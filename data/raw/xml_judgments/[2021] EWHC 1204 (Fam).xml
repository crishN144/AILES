	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">The applicant is the father, and the first respondent the mother, of the second respondent child, whom I shall call A, who is represented by her Children&#8217;s Guardian, Ms Baker. The child lives with her mother in England. The father alleges that the mother wrongly removed or retained the child from the Russian Federation, her country of habitual residence, and applies for her summary return under the 1980 Hague Convention. The mother opposes the application. The issues for the court to determine are the date of wrongful removal or wrongful retention, habitual residence, settlement, the Article 13b defence of grave risk of harm, and, if relevant, the exercise of the court&#8217;s discretion whether or not to order return. In relation to the issue of wrongful retention a question to determine is whether, when parties have agreed to the retention of a child abroad for an identifiable period of time, and the left behind parent resiles from the agreement and demands the return of the child before the expiry of that period, the refusal or failure of the travelling parent to comply with the demand renders the child&#8217;s retention wrongful at that time. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">The brief history is as follows. The father has dual Russian and Moldovan nationality and the mother is Moldovan. The parties met online whilst the father was working in Germany and the mother was studying in the Russian Federation. They began a relationship and the mother became pregnant with A. The father moved to Russia. A was born there on 31 May 2014. The parties dispute the nature of their relationship over the ensuing few years but agree that the mother left with A for Moldova on 26 April 2018. The father followed approximately a month later. On 12 June 2018 the father signed a formal consent document by which, on the face of it, he consented to the mother removing A from Moldova &#8220;to all countries of the European Union and Great Britain from 12.06.2018 to back 12.06.2019&#8221;. This document was prepared by a notary and states that it was orally translated by the notary into the Russian language for the benefit of the applicant. The mother arrived in England with A on 8 July 2018 and they have remained here ever since. Her parents both live here. Contact between the father and A continued but soon diminished and then ceased. On 20 January 2019, in response to attempts by the father to contact her and A through the Moldovan Police, the mother wrote a letter to the Moldovan Police, witnessed by a solicitor in Leeds, stating that she and A were alive and well, and that A was attending school. She confirmed her location but asked them to keep it confidential from the father. She attached documentation and a video. Although it does not say so in terms, the mother says that the letter &#8220;made it clear that we had no intention of returning&#8221; [C57 para. 84] and the father agrees with that characterisation of the letter. The father lodged an application for return of A to Russia to the Russian Central Authority but not until May 2020, and the application in this court for return was issued on 14 October 2020. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">The father&#8217;s case is that the mother wrongfully removed A from the Russian Federation on 26 April 2018, and then either wrongfully removed her to this jurisdiction on 8 July 2018 having never had any intention to return her upon leaving, or wrongfully retained her here at the end of August, alternatively in October 2018, or in the further alternative, on 20 January 2019, the date of her letter to the Moldovan police. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">At the hearing the mother sought to amend her defence by adding a further element, namely, the child&#8217;s objections. This application followed the receipt of the Guardian, Ms Baker&#8217;s report of 7 April 2021. I refused that application. The defence relied upon appeared to be very weak: the child is only six years old and did not express her views about return to Ms Baker in a reasoned manner. The application was made very late and without giving the father a fair opportunity to address it in advance of the hearing. Ms Baker&#8217;s report had not directly addressed the question of the child&#8217;s objections and her maturity and understanding. Further evidence would therefore have been required, causing delay. The mother has been represented by experienced solicitors and counsel throughout the proceedings. During the hearing it transpired that there are issues about influence on the child by the parents which would have necessitated further evidence in relation to her objections had the defence been allowed. </p>

She alleges that when she informed the father of the pregnancy he told her that he had been diagnosed with leukaemia and strongly urged her to have an abortion. She says that later he told her he had spoken to her parents and they had asked him to force her to have an abortion. Neither assertion was true. The mother&#8217;s mother gave the father money to ensure that the birth took place in a private hospital but, the mother alleges, he kept the money and her labour care was chaotic. Eventually she had an emergency Caesarean section. The mother says that after the birth she struggled to find suitable accommodation and that the father was no help. Again, her mother handed over a large sum of money and the father largely kept it for himself. The mother says that she was responsible for nearly all the childcare and the father would lose his temper if his sleep was disturbed by their new baby. The father disputes the mother&#8217;s account of his conduct during this period. </p>

It transpired that [the father] was watching my every step from the very beginning. [The father] would fall out and have disagreements with my family and with my friends, which meant that I was slowly becoming isolated from everyone.

She says that she was on edge and terrified, and she blamed herself for everything that was going wrong. From late 2016/early 2017 she alleges that the father became physically violent. &#8220;He would get angry, grab me, pin me down, hit me on the head and on occasion, try and choke me.&#8221; She says that she had nowhere else to go and felt she had to stay in the relationship. Nevertheless, she did spend two months with A with her family in Moldova in late 2017/early 2018. Again, the father disputes the mother&#8217;s account in full. </p>

The mother exhibits a photograph of bruising to her arm and says that other photographs of extensive bruising did not come out. The father says that the mother attacked him and exhibits photographs showing quite extensive bruising and marks to his body including what appear to be scratch marks and a bite mark. He accepts that neighbours alerted the police and that A was present. The mother says that A witnessed the father attacking her and tried to &#8220;get in the middle of us.&#8221; The father does not accept that. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The mother says that in January 2018 she received a letter from her grandmother in Moldova asking her to come to her. She says that she was worried about her grandmother but the father would not let her travel to Moldova. Following the father&#8217;s deteriorating behaviour, she decided to travel to Moldova with A and she informed the father from Moscow once she had embarked on the journey on 26 April 2018. She did not ask for his agreement in advance. The father&#8217;s case is that he did not know where his partner and child had gone and he went to the police to report the matter but the mother called him the next day. He travelled to Moldova and stayed for about a month. He tried to persuade the mother to return with A to Russia. The mother then told him that her mother, who lived with her father in England, was seriously ill and she wanted to visit her with A. The mother&#8217;s father had travelled to Moldova and whilst there he spoke with the father who ultimately consented to the mother taking A abroad. He says that the maternal grandfather arranged for a notary to prepare a formal consent document and that he signed it on 12 June 2018. He says &#8220;Russian is my first language and I don&#8217;t read and write Moldavian &#8230; I accepted it in good faith and signed it because I felt sorry for [the mother] and I trusted her father. I seriously misjudged them both.&#8221; The mother says that the father gave his consent to A travelling abroad for a year only after a series of meetings in cafes with her and her father. The father agreed to the terms set out in the formal consent document which he signed in front of a Notary on 12 June 2018 [C11]. </p>

The mother says that the father was very difficult and started to demand information such as their address in England which she did not want to provide because she was worried about safety in the light of his previous abusive conduct towards her. She found that dealing with the father about contact triggered troubling, fearful feelings about him. She allowed contact with A to continue until she became convinced that the father was using contact to manipulate the mother &#8211; he would talk to A about court documents, knowing the mother could hear him. She ceased direct communication with the father herself after a few weeks, and she terminated contact between A and the father when he told A that he would come and take her away from her mother. The father denies that he said any such thing. He says the mother terminated contact in October 2018. The mother is unsure but believes it was a little earlier. The mother says that she was aware after cessation of contact that the father was writing to her family to try to find out her address and, she says, to malign her. </p>

The mother became aware that the father had asked the Moldovan police to locate her and A. She regarded this as more threatening and manipulative conduct by the father. She corresponded with a Moldovan police officer and then on 20 January 2019 sent a letter with accompanying documents and video to the Moldovan police, the letter being witnessed by a solicitor in X. She gave her previous address but asked that her address be kept confidential from the father. In fact, the Moldovan police passed on information including her previous address to the father. At this point, the mother says, and it is accepted on behalf of the father, the mother was manifesting an intention permanently to stay with A in England and not to return within twelve months of the father&#8217;s consent document, namely by 12 June 2019. </p>

Ms Baker was recalled to address this issue. She told the court that her first discussion with the father had been on 22 January 2021. He had told her that he had been recording contact sessions and wanted her to listen to the recordings. He also told her that a psychologist from Russian Social Services had been involved. Her understanding, from discussions with the father, was that this was normal in Russia, and that he had supplied recordings to the psychologist. She accepted that she may have misunderstood the father. When he had told her, she was awaiting the father&#8217;s statement and did not inform the parties&#8217; representatives or the court about this information. She recalls informing the father that it was not appropriate to record contact without the mother&#8217;s knowledge and she very properly refused to listen to recordings without approval of the court, but she accepted that she had not given advice to the father to desist from involving the psychologist, not knowing that the psychologist had been present listening in at contact sessions. </p>

She did not inform the court or the parties and she has not referred to this in her report. She accepts that she should have brought this to the attention of others. Through Ms Stanley, she has apologised to the court for not having done so. From what she told the court, Ms Baker did not lead the father to believe that recording contact without the consent of the mother was acceptable, and he could not have had that impression after the hearing before Ms Justice Russell, but Ms Baker may have inadvertently given the father the impression that it was acceptable for him to continue to engage a psychologist to attend contact sessions without the mother&#8217;s consent or the court&#8217;s permission. Once Ms Baker had been made aware of the involvement of a psychologist she did not make it clear to the father that he should obtain the consent of the mother or the permission of the court and neither the father nor Ms Baker informed the court.

The burden of proof on settlement and the Article 13 defences is on the respondent mother.

Once it is accepted that retention is not a continuing state of affairs, but an event occurring on a specific occasion, it necessarily follows that removal and retention are mutually exclusive concepts. For the purposes of the Convention, removal occurs when a child, which has previously been in the State of its habitual residence, is taken away across the frontier of that State; whereas retention occurs where a child, which has previously been for a limited period of time outside the State of its habitual residence, is not returned to that State on the expiry of such limited period.&#8221;  </p>

It is clearly true that if the two parents agree that the child is to travel abroad for a period, or for that matter if the court of the home State permits such travel by order, the travelling parent first removes, and then retains the child abroad. It is equally true that both removal and retention are, at that stage, sanctioned and not wrongful. But to say that there is sanctioned retention is to ask, rather than to answer, the question when such retention may become unsanctioned and wrongful. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.5in">When the left-behind parent agrees to the child travelling abroad, he is exercising, not abandoning, his rights of custody. Those rights of custody include the right to be party to any arrangement as to which country the child is to live in. It is not accurate to say that he gives up a right to veto the child&#8217;s movements abroad; he exercises that right by permitting such movement on terms. He has agreed to the travel only on terms that the stay is to be temporary and the child will be returned as agreed. So long as the travelling parent honours the temporary nature of the stay abroad, he is not infringing the left-behind parent&#8217;s rights of custody. But once he repudiates the agreement, and keeps the child without the intention to return, and denying the temporary nature of the stay, his retention is no longer on the terms agreed. It amounts to a claim to unilateral decision where the child shall live. It repudiates the rights of custody of the leftbehind parent and becomes wrongful. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The plain purpose of the Abduction Convention is to prevent the travelling parent from pre-empting the left-behind parent. The travelling parent who repudiates the temporary nature of the stay and sets about making it indefinite, often putting down the child&#8217;s roots in the destination State with a view to making it impossible to move him home, is engaging in precisely such an act of pre-emption. </p>

It is not, however, necessary in the present case to attempt to foresee such eventualities, or to consider whether fundamental failures to observe conditions as to the care or upbringing of the child might amount to such pre-emptive denial. It is enough to say that if there is a pre-emptive denial it would be inconsistent with the aim of the Abduction Convention to provide a swift, prompt and summary remedy designed to restore the status quo ante to insist that the left-behind parent wait until the aeroplane lands on the due date, without the child disembarking, before any complaint can be made about such infringement. </p>

The concept operates in the expectation that, when a child gains a new habitual residence, he loses his old one. Simple analogies are best: consider a see-saw. As, probably quite quickly, he puts down those first roots which represent the requisite degree of integration in the environment of the new state, up will probably come the child's roots in that of the old state to the point at which he achieves the requisite deintegration (or, better, disengagement) from it.&#8221;.  </p>

			<p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;While Lord Wilson's see-saw analogy can assist the court when deciding the question of habitual residence, it does not replace the core guidance given in A v A and other cases to the approach which should be taken to the determination of the habitual residence. This requires an analysis of the child's situation in and connections with the state or states in which he or she is said to be habitually resident for the purpose of determining in which state he or she has the requisite degree of integration to mean that their residence there is habitual. </p>

This is not to say continuing or historical connections are not relevant but they are part of, not the primary focus of, the court's analysis when deciding the critical question which is where is the child habitually resident and not, simply, when was a previous habitual residence lost.&#8221; </p>

Whereas acquiescence is expressly recognised to be acquiescence subsequent to the removal, consent is not so limited in Article 13 and must, therefore, include permission which is given before the removal. If clear unequivocal and informed consent is given to the removal of a child, then it is difficult to see why the court should not exercise the discretion conferred by Article 13 to permit the child to remain in the country to which it was agreed he or she should go. The policy of the Convention is to protect children internationally from the harmful effects of their wrongful removal or retention. If a child is removed in prima facie breach of a right of custody, then it makes better sense to require the removing parent to justify the removal and establish that the removal was with consent rather than require the claimant, asserting the wrongfulness of the removal, to prove that he or she did not consent. Article 3 should govern the whole Convention and Article 13 should take its place as the exception to the general duty to secure the return of the child which is, after all, the basic principle of the Convention. </p>

It is generally the case that it is in the best interests of the child for them to be returned to the country from which they were abducted, so that that country and the judicial system of that country can determine where and with whom they should live, and what contact they should have. However, it is important also to bear in mind what Baroness Hale said at paragraph 54, that in a case where there has been a lengthy delay, the purposes of the Convention may no longer be possible to meet in the same way as would be the case in a &#8220;hot pursuit&#8221; case. </p>

Physical, emotional and psychological settlement. (See <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Cannon</span>, paragraph 71). However, it is, in my view, important to have in mind the reality of the situation, which is that those three factors may well interrelate, particularly between the emotional and psychological factors. It is necessary to take a holistic view of settlement, rather than try to apply three separate legal tests, or three separate issues. Each must be taken into account, but how they are then assessed and what weight is given to evidence between the three factors, must be one for the judge on the facts before him or her. </p>

It is important to understand why this is the case and refer back to <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Cannon</span> at paragraph 53. As I understand the position, there are really two reasons why the burden has increased on the abducting parent. If the child has been actively concealed, then the court should be slow to give great weight to the delay by the left behind parent in taking any action. Because otherwise the abducting parent gains a benefit by their misconduct. The second factor is that where the abducting parent has created a (I use Black J's words) &#8220;web of deceit and subterfuge&#8221;, then it may be more difficult and often will be more difficult to show that a child is emotionally and psychologically settled. </p>

The sliding scale of concealment goes from the parent who is on the run, the true fugitive who changes names and hides the child, to the parent at the other end of the spectrum, who simply does not tell the left behind parent that they are leaving. Therefore, as a generality, the greater the level of the concealment, the more difficult for the abducting parent to show that the child is truly settled. </p>

It is, as article 13(b) makes clear, the return to the requesting state, rather than the enforced removal from the requested state, which must have this effect. Thus, the English courts have sought to avoid placing the child in an intolerable situation by extracting undertakings from the applicant as to the conditions in which the child will live when he returns and by relying on the courts of the requesting State to protect him once he is there. In many cases this will be sufficient. But once again, the fact that this will usually be sufficient to avoid the risk does not mean that it will invariably be so.&#8221; </p>

The mother never intended to return A from England and used her mother&#8217;s illness to trick the father into agreeing for her to travel there with A. Thus, there was wrongful removal when she travelled to England on 8 July 2018. In the alternative, there was wrongful retention when she did not return A in time for nursery in Russia on 1 September 2018. Further alternatively, there was wrongful retention in October 2018 when the father had realised he had been tricked and demanded return of A. The mother manifested an intention to stay in England by cutting off contact, refusing to disclose her address and enrolling A in school. At all of these times A was habitually resident in the Russian Federation. The father submits that A was not settled in England as of 14 October 2020 because she was not emotionally and psychologically settled given the termination of contact with the father by the mother two years earlier. Further, the protective measures suggested by the father and the mother&#8217;s history of living in, and familiarity with, the Russian Federation, mean that the Article 13b defence is not established. </p>

She terminated contact once here only after a few months and because the father had been distressing A and threatening to take her away from her mother. She wanted A to be educated whilst she was in England and so enrolled her into a school. It was only over a period of about six months when she realised that she and A were thriving and happy, A was already settling into her new school, and they had a new home with the maternal grandparents, that she decided to remain in England on a permanent basis. By writing her letter of 20 January 2019 she accepts that she manifested that intention. The mother does not seek to argue that retention was on 12 June 2019. The mother says that A was habitually resident in England by 20 January 2019, indeed well before then, and was certainly settled by 14 October 2020.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">The father is a practising immigration lawyer, living in the Russian Federation. He gave evidence through an interpreter, and over a video link from Russia. I have to make allowances for the difficulties this caused. Nevertheless, the manner in which he dealt with cross-examination was striking. The impression I gained was that he regarded cross-examination as like a game of chess which required a careful strategy and which he was determined to win. There is nothing wrong with a witness being assertive, for example to ensure that their full answer to a question is given. The mother herself did that. But the father&#8217;s approach went beyond assertiveness. He insisted on providing lengthy contexts when answering simple questions thereby avoiding giving straightforward answers to straightforward questions; he commented critically several times on the questions put to him when he regarded them as repetitive or otherwise inappropriate; he accused Mr Hepher, for the mother, of having forgotten evidence and, when Mr Hepher simply put the mother&#8217;s case to the father, of being unethical. He repeatedly, and unjustifiably, accused Mr Hepher of having misunderstood the answers he was giving. Furthermore, the father introduced new evidence for the first time at the hearing. His new evidence was not about peripheral matters but went to the core of the issues in dispute. The father was dismissive when the impact of his new evidence at the hearing was pointed out to him.  </p>

They included reference to accommodation for the mother and A in the area of Y where he lived and where he has lived since these proceedings began. The mother has had to prepare for the hearing by considering her position about returning to Y. The father then told the court, on the second day of the hearing, that on the first day of the hearing he had moved to Moscow where he intended to remain &#8220;as long as I live&#8221;. He said that he had decided to move to Moscow four days earlier. He had an office in Moscow and wished to work there. He had no proposals for where the mother and A should now live upon return. He appeared content for the mother to choose where she should live in the Russian Federation.

That revelation led Ms Justice Russell to forbid recording of contact sessions. In his second statement, dated 30 March 2021, the father told the court he had ceased recording as ordered and stated (in translation, &#8220;I recorded the calls as a personal memento of our conversations in the same way as I would have wanted to take photos of her had we been able to spend time together.&#8221; However, in oral evidence he told the court that he had engaged a child psychologist, for remuneration, to sit beside him during contact (off camera once contact was by video call) and the psychologist had made the recordings for professional purposes. She had attended every contact session (about forty in total) since contact had resumed in November 2020. She had later passed the recordings she had made on to the father so he could listen to them also. The father had not referred to the psychologist in his written evidence. The father dismissed suggestions that his evidence about who had made the recordings and why, had been inconsistent but his efforts to reconcile his recent statement that he had made the recordings as mementos, with his oral evidence that the psychologist had made them for professional purposes, were wholly unconvincing.  </p>

The father told the court that the psychologist had attended every single contact session (about forty to date), paid for by him. He said that her role was to assist him to relate positively with his daughter. However, he had urged Ms Baker to listen to the recordings at her discussion with him on 22 January 2021, he applied to me on 25 March 2021for permission to rely on the recordings as evidence, he told Ms Baker on 12 April that he would be filing documents (apparently related to the involvement of the psychologist) in Russia, he told Ms Baker on 13 April 2021 that the psychologist would be producing a report, and he asked the court during his crossexamination at this hearing whether permission would be given to rely on evidence from the psychologist. The father told the court that he found the psychologist through contacting Russian Social Services. It is highly likely therefore that he would use her evidence in dealings with Social Services in the future. It is conceivable that the father wanted assistance from a professional when contact was re-instigated in November 2020, but I cannot accept his evidence that he needed the continuing support of a child psychologist to help him to manage contact with A who, on the father&#8217;s own account, was confident and at ease with him during contact sessions. I am quite satisfied that he has used the psychologist and the recordings to gather evidence to use in this and future proceedings against the mother. </p>

The father repeated this assertion several times during his oral evidence but it appears nowhere in his written evidence and was not part of the case put forward on his behalf in advance of the hearing. He told the court that when A was not returned by 1 September he took various steps including contacting the nursery and the Russian police. None of that is in his written evidence.

He called that &#8220;emotional blackmail&#8221;. The mother said that her mother was ill and had suspected cancer and that she is still unwell but the diagnosis has even now not been confirmed. At the time of the negotiations with the father, the paternal grandfather had been in Moldova with the mother&#8217;s brother, visiting other relatives, and they remained in Moldova with the mother until 8 July 2018.

His case is that the mother had &#8220;kidnapped&#8221; A from Russia only a few weeks earlier. He had refused to allow her to remove A from Moldova and it had taken a week of negotiations with her and her father to reach the point when the father would give his consent. The father is an immigration lawyer and demonstrated in his evidence that he enjoys attention to detail. It is inconceivable that he would have signed a formal document in front of a notary on trust, without knowing what was in the document.  </p>

I asked him what the maternal grandfather had said in front of the notary that was not reflected in the agreement. The father could not identify anything. Therefore, if the description of the agreement in front of the notary was accurate, there was no trickery. Furthermore, the florid account of discussion with the notary some months later, given by the friend of the father, in which it is alleged that the notary accepted that the father had been the victim of fraud, makes no sense at all. </p>

He was asked by Mr Hepher what else he had not included in his statement. The father told the court that there were some things he knew that would have serious consequences for the mother. He then said that he knew that she had contacted a &#8220;professional&#8221; to arrange to eliminate him (the father) and then to go into hiding. When he gave that evidence the clear impression was that he was threatening that he could cause the mother to be in significant trouble with the police in Russia if he so chose. When that was put to him by Ms Stanley on behalf of the Guardian, he changed course, laughing openly about the allegation and telling the court that he had not taken it seriously and he did not think that the mother had been serious about it either.   </p>

Return to Russia is not mentioned in the document. Indeed, the consent in translation was for &#8220;travel out Republic of Moldova&#8230; from 12.06.2018 to back 12.06.2019&#8221;. This implies that the parties had agreed that the mother would bring A back to Moldova at the end of the period in which the father had consented to her travelling away from that country. I can find no evidence to support the father&#8217;s assertion that the mother agreed to return A to the Russian Federation by 12 June 2019 or at all. She and A had left there in April 2018, they had no family there other than the father, who was in fact in Moldova when he gave his consent to A being taken out of Moldova. Without hesitation, I reject the father&#8217;s evidence that there was an agreement to return A to Russia. I also reject his evidence that the agreement was to return A to Russia (or anywhere else) by 1 September 2018. He had not mentioned that in his witness statements, it is at odds with the formal consent document, and his Counsel referred in her opening skeleton argument to the agreement of the parties that A was to remain in England until 12 June 2019. </p>

Since she expected to be there for several months it was natural for her to register A with a GP and with a school. The mother clearly values her child&#8217;s education and her registration with a school was not an indication that she had no intention of leaving England by June 2019. Whilst primary school education might have started a year or so later in Russia, it was the only sensible option for A in England, if she was to be in some form of education. The mother told the court that she did not know what she was going to do in the longer term in the weeks after A started school. By Christmas 2018, however, the mother and A had been in England for over five months, they had just moved into new accommodation with the maternal grandparents, A was shortly due to start at a new school but had settled in well at her previous school. The mother says that she had noticed a positive change in A being settled here in England. She was a happier girl. The parties agree that the mother&#8217;s letter of 20 January 2019 manifested an intention not to return from England by 12 June 2019.

The father was refusing to allow her to leave for Moldova to visit her grandmother.

Furthermore, the mother&#8217;s recollection of when contact with the father ceased is unclear, whereas the father has told the court it ended in October. After the termination of contact, I am satisfied on the evidence, the father communicated by correspondence with the mother&#8217;s parents. Hence, it is far from clear that he was demanding that the mother should return A to Russia before 1 September 2018. By the time the mother wrote her letter of 20 January 2019, and when she made her witness statement to the police in February 2019, the father had, I accept, resiled from his formal consent document and made it known that he wanted A returned from England. After considering all the evidence I find that the father demanded the return of A and sought to resile from the agreement the parties had reached that A could stay in England for a year, in or about October 2018.

She also alleges physical violence by him against her, with a particularly serious incident in March 2018 which triggered her leaving for Moldova. The mother&#8217;s allegations are not manifestly incredible, and photographs adduced by both parties tend to show that there was a physical struggle between them, at the very least. The parties agree that neighbours and the police became involved and that A was present. The mother has been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder since arriving in England. It was very noticeable that having remained calm during the hearing, she broke down in tears, clearly distressed, when Mr Hepher spoke of some of the past alleged domestic abuse in his closing submissions. For the purposes of this application, without making any findings in relation to domestic abuse, I consider it reasonable to assume that the father was controlling, coercive and physically violent to the mother during the relationship. I bear in mind the guidance under FPR PD 12J and the approach to allegations of abuse set out in my review of the law above. I recognise that a history of controlling and coercive behaviour by the father would give rise to a risk of such behaviour continuing in the future with harm to the child in various ways. For example, the child is distressed by witnessing domestic abuse, and by witnessing the effect on her mother. The child is given a poor model of conduct. The mother who is suffering from such conduct is less able to give appropriate care for the child. For the purposes of this application I assume that there is a risk that upon return to the Russian Federation, the child would be exposed to the harmful effects of coercive and controlling behaviour by the father towards the mother, which would be magnified by closer proximity. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">The father offered protective measures upon A&#8217;s return. They are set out in his witness evidence and include financial measures to support the mother upon return. At the hearing he offered an additional measure not to apply for sole custody of A. Notwithstanding his many allegations against the mother, and his assertion as recently as 13 April 2021 to Ms Baker that A was in danger as a result of the actions of the mother and her family, the father told me that he has come to realise that it is in A&#8217;s best interests to be cared for by the mother. Given the father&#8217;s remarks that he held information about the mother that could land her in serious trouble on return to Russia, and given his dishonesty in relation to important parts of his evidence, it is difficult to accept the sincerity of his offers. I understand him to say that they should be set out in an order, rather than to be accepted as undertakings, because the order could be registered in a Russian court. However, I have no confidence that the father would abide by such orders once the mother and A were in Russia. In any event, his suggested financial contributions are of little meaning given that it is not clear where A and her mother would live, in particular since he has so very recently moved to Moscow on a permanent basis. </p>

Any Art 13a defence of consent, or acquiescence, would have to relate to an identified wrongful removal or retention. The court cannot consider whether the father consented to a removal or retention without knowing when either of those events occurred. I have found that the father gave formal written consent to A being removed for up to 12 months from 12 June 2018. I have already referred to [42 of the judgment of Lord Hughes in <span style="font-style:italic">In the matter of C (Children) </span>(above). Although the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re P (A Child) (Abduction: Custody Rights) </span>(above)<span style="font-style:italic"/>held that consent to removal is to be determined under Art. 13a, not Art. 3, Lord Hughes clearly stated that if a child is removed and then retained abroad by agreement then the removal and retention are not wrongful. Whilst A was removed to England from Moldova, where A happened to be when the agreement was reached, and therefore not from her home state, the same principle applies. </p>

It did not render the earlier removal of the child wrongful. An agreement to the removal of the child might be invalid because of fraud, for example, but if a valid agreement has been reached, and acted upon, it cannot be rendered a nullity by one party later resiling from it. Accordingly, the question is whether, if the father resiled from the agreement after the removal, that rendered the retention of A in England thereafter, wrongful.  </p>

The Israeli parents agreed to bring their two daughters to England for at least one year. They arrived in September 1992. In December 1992 the father left their house in England and alleged that the mother refused to allow the children to speak to him after April 1993. He commenced divorce proceedings in Israel. In May 1993 the mother obtained an <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte</span> interim residence and prohibited steps order in the English court. One of the issues that Wall J identified was, &#8220;Can there be a wrongful retention within Art 3 when there has been agreement for the children to remain within the jurisdiction for a fixed term and one party requires the return of the children to the country of their habitual residence before that term has elapsed?&#8221;  At 90 H to 94 A, he posed a different question and answered it. In the course of his answer he addresses the issue he had earlier identified, and which is pertinent to the present case: </p>

I was initially attracted to the proposition that where parents agree that children shall remain in England for a specified period there cannot be a wrongful retention until that period has elapsed. The mere fact that the relationship between the parents has come to an end cannot entitle one parent unilaterally to resile from the which has been agreed between them. The example which springs to mind is an agreement that the children should visit a foreign country for a specific time, such as a school holiday. </p>

When a child has been removed and then retained abroad consequent to prior agreement between the parties that the child may remain abroad for an identifiable period, the retention of the child abroad during that period is not wrongful provided that the travelling parent honours the temporary nature of the agreement. In the absence of a repudiatory breach of the left behind parent&#8217;s rights of custody, of the kind analysed in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C (Children)</span> (above), the left behind parent&#8217;s demand that the child be returned during the agreed period does not by itself render the continued retention of the child abroad wrongful.

Art 3 defines the wrongfulness of a removal or retention by reference to whether it is in breach of rights of custody. The focus is on whether the retaining parent has acted in a manner that breaches the left behind parent&#8217;s rights of custody. Thus, the question is whether, if the father sought to resile from the agreement for A to stay in England for an identifiable period by demanding return within that period, the mother&#8217;s response constituted a retention in breach of those rights.  </p>

In exercising his rights of custody to agree to a stay abroad, the father agreed to restrict the exercise of his rights of custody during the agreed period of the stay. He agreed that the child would not be returned from abroad during that period. His commitment was for an identifiable period. Thus, unless the mother pre-empted the temporary nature of the stay, her failure to return the child from abroad during that agreed period honoured the father&#8217;s rights of custody, it did not breach them. That is so even if the father demanded return during that period.  </p>

In fact, the duty to return a child arises only if its removal or retention is considered wrongful in terms of the Convention. Now, in laying down the conditions which have to be met for any unilateral change in the status quo to be regarded as wrongful, this article indirectly brings into clear focus those relationships which the Convention seeks to protect.

Now, from the Convention's standpoint, the removal of a child by one of the joint holders without the consent of the other, is equally wrongful, and this wrongfulness derives in this particular case, not from some action in breach of a particular law, but from the fact that such action has disregarded the rights of the other parent which are also protected by law, and has interfered with their normal exercise.

Unless the travelling parent&#8217;s response to the left behind parent unilaterally resiling from the agreement amounts to a pre-emption of their rights of custody, there is no wrongful retention which the Conventions seeks to prevent. </p>

The reality is that the earlier agreement existed and formed the basis of the child arrangements. The travelling parent is not obliged to disregard the earlier agreement and bow to the new demand of the left behind parent. Similarly, if a mother with a lives with order agrees that a child should spend Monday to Friday with their father, and on Tuesday demands the return of the child because they have changed their mind, the father is not obliged to return the child. </p>

It may do so, as was the case in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S (Minors) (Child Abduction: Wrongful Retention) </span>(above). Whether it does will depend on the circumstances of the particular case and whether the travelling parent acts in repudiatory breach (as explained in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C (Children)</span>).

Given the subsequent Court of Appeal decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Re P (abduction Consent) </span>(above) I would prefer to say that it is because there has been no breach of custody rights under Art 3 and therefore no wrongful retention.

The fact that she did not comply with the father&#8217;s requests to return A did not, until 20 January 2019, constitute a repudiatory breach on her part.

His case is that she was habitually resident in the Russian Federation at that date, the mother says that she was habitually resident in England. A had not lived in the Russian Federation since April 2018. She had never been to school there, but she was born there and had lived there all her life until April 2018. Her father was in Russia but her mother and maternal grandparents and uncle were in England. Her living great-grandparents were in Moldova. She was at school in England and she had established friendships here. She was registered with a GP here. She had recently moved to a home with her mother and maternal grandparents which was intended as a permanent home. She had moved schools, starting her new school only at the beginning of January 2019, but she had settled in well at both. She would have had no expectation that she was gong to leave England imminently nor even in the months ahead. She had stability in her life and was well integrated into her family and social environment in England. The mother, her main carer, had settled in England and achieved stability in her own life here.

In contrast, once in England she had a stable existence within the wider maternal family. She also started school in early September and settled in well. She had no ties in the Russian Federation save for her father. By October 2018 she had been out of the Russian Federation for five to six months. She had been in England for three to four months but in that time she had become integrated in the family and social environment. In all the circumstances, had it been necessary to decide, I would have found that A was habitually resident in England by October 2018.  </p>

The date on which settlement needs to be considered is 14 October 2020 when this application was issued. This was nearly one year, nine months after the retention of A in this jurisdiction on 20 January 2019. By 14 October 2020 A had lived in England for two years, three months. She had celebrated two Christmases and two birthdays here. She was very well settled into school and had made friends. She had a settled home life with her mother and maternal grandparents. Ms Baker had little doubt that A was physically and emotionally settled. Indeed, she advised the court that in her opinion, overall, A was settled in this jurisdiction. She was reporting following discussions with A in January 2021 but her conclusions surely also apply to the relevant date. Ms Stanley, for the Guardian, submitted that A was settled in this jurisdiction at the relevant date. Ms Baker&#8217;s only reservation was whether A could be said to be psychologically settled when contact with the father was not resolved. It is true that at the relevant date A was not having contact with her father and had not spoken to him for about two years. However, once contact resumed in November 2020, and until 13 April 2021, A found contact &#8220;easy&#8221; according to the father (and as briefly witnessed by Ms Baker). The mother confirms that description. She had no psychological difficulty talking with her father notwithstanding the long break in contact.  </p>

It is true that the mother would not reveal her address, but the father knew that A was in England and living with or close to the maternal grandparents in X. The evidence indicates that he was able to correspond with the maternal grandparents. He may not have known the address at which A was living but he knew enough that if he had chosen to do so, he could have located A much earlier than he did. When asked why he had not applied earlier he primarily blamed the Covid-19 pandemic which could not have obstructed his efforts in 2019 and referred to his need to learn all about this area of law. I found his explanations to be unconvincing. The delay between his knowledge of the letter of 20 January 2019 and the issue of his application on 14 October 2020 is not explained by the mother evading him, so much as the fact that he chose not to take steps to issue his application.  </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Cannon v Cannon</span> (above) Thorpe LJ clearly held that there were &#8220;two constituent elements of settlement, namely a physical element and an emotional element. To consider only the physical element is to ignore the emotional and psychological elements which in combination comprise the whole child.&#8221; Thorpe LJ may well have intended &#8220;emotional&#8221; and &#8220;psychological&#8221; to be synonymous. In any event, it is too mechanistic, certainly on the facts of this case, to discriminate between A&#8217;s emotional and her psychological settlement. I need to consider the &#8220;whole child&#8221;. In the present case the father had consented to A remaining in England until 12 June 2019. He knew that she was in this jurisdiction, and from shortly after the mother&#8217;s letter of 20 January 2019 he knew that she was in X.  He was able to write to the maternal grandparents. It appears that he took no material steps to locate A for well over a year after the mother&#8217;s letter. In the meantime, A had a stable home, school, and family and friendship networks. Even without contact with her father she was happy, confident, and thriving physically, emotionally and psychologically. She was still young and her mother was certainly settled in England by October 2020. That is an important factor in considering </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.04in">The father has made covert recordings of contact and has been in communication with social services in Russia and engaged a psychologist through their recommendation. He has threatened during these proceedings that he has information about the mother that would cause serious problems for her with the authorities upon her return if should choose to disclose it. He has told Ms Baker that he will use the evidence of the psychologist to send a file to the Russian social services with the help of the psychologist. It is likely, I find, that upon the mother and A returning to the Russian Federation, the father would find a pretext to report the mother to the authorities there. There is a serious risk of the mother&#8217;s self-confidence and ability to care for A would be eroded by actions of the father were they to be compelled to live in the Russian Federation. </p>

Whether the exercise of discretion arose because of settlement and/or grave risk of harm, the court could not ignore the fact that this is not a &#8220;hot chase&#8221; case under the Convention. The purpose of the Convention to secure a swift return cannot be achieved. The courts in the Russian Federation would not be well placed to decide issues of residence and contact because of the long time that has elapsed since the mother and A lived there.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">In contrast, there is a clear case for A&#8217;s best interests being served by her remaining in England. She wants to stay here, her needs are well met here, her mother strongly wishes to remain here, and her mother&#8217;s ability to care for her would be put at risk by return to Russia. The changes involved in moving to Russia would be harmful to A in my judgement. The protective measures offered would not satisfy me that A&#8217;s welfare would be adequately protected were she to be returned to Russia. Thus, I would have exercised my discretion, had it arisen, to refuse to return A to the Russian Federation. </p>

I have made no findings of fact about alleged domestic abuse and no findings about what caused A distress at contact on 13 April 2021. The question of future child arrangements requires careful consideration. To date the mother has remained supportive of indirect contact by video link. Aside from the contact on 13 April 2021 both parents appear to be content with how contact has progressed, and the evidence is that A has been confident and at ease during indirect contact. The parties need to reflect on this judgment. I shall receive further submissions and then give directions in relation to preparation for a final hearing to consider child arrangements.  </p>
