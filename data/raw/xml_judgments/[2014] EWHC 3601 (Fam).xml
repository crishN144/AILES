	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These are public law proceedings concerning a little girl, Y, who is now 7 years and 7 months old. Y was placed with foster carers by A City Council (the local authority) following the tragic death of her 8 month old baby sister X, at the hands of her mother. M, their mother was severely mentally ill at the time. B&#8217;s father (F) suffers from a disease which affects his respiratory system and which is a degenerative and life-shortening.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">M was arrested and shortly afterwards placed in a secure hospital. M pleaded guilty to infanticide and sentenced by a judge at a Crown Court, she was made subject to a Hospital Order pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 37</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> and a restrictions order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/41" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 41</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. She will be released after successful treatment, which is likely, on the psychiatric evidence, to take 2 to 3 years, any failure to comply with psychiatric treatment after her release will lead to a recall to hospital. The restrictions imposed by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/41" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s41</ref> order require that she seeks and obtains permission from her treating clinician and the Secretary of State before she travels abroad so that a treatment plan is put in place; this is not a ban on travel but failure to comply could lead to recall. The Crown Court heard evidence from three psychiatrists all of whom conducted in depth interviews with M and to which I shall return later in this judgement; all three considered that she would pose a risk to others, particularly (for the purpose of these proceedings) children in her care.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Clearly, and it is not disputed, the threshold as set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s31</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> (CA) is crossed by X&#8217;s death and the psychiatric evidence regarding the risk posed by M, however, the local authority seek further findings of fact and a judgment to provide a fuller context for the placement of Y, both now and in the future. All the parties to the proceedings, including the maternal grandparents, agree that Y should be placed with her maternal aunt, MA, outside this jurisdiction, and that the legal basis for that placement should be a Special Guardianship Order (SGO), s14 CA; but the local authority and Y&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Guardian are concerned that that placement should be seen as long-term and provide a secure and settled home during Y&#8217;s minority and beyond. They are concerned that the exclusive nature of the parental responsibility that the SGO grants to the special guardian should be understood by all members of the family (including the maternal grandparents) and emphasised by a judgement of this court. The legal advice which has been obtained from the relevant foreign jurisdiction, is that their courts will be required by law to recognise and enforce the judgement and orders of this court and thus to enforce but not to modify the Child Arrangements Order (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2014/6" uk:canonical="2014 c. 6" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children and Families Act 2014</ref>) and the SGO that are made in respect of Y.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Y&#8217;s father has played very little part in these proceedings and has had nothing to do with Y since he was taken to hospital just hours before X died. That he does not put himself forward as a carer is understandable given his ill-health. What is less comprehensible is that fact that he has chosen not to have any contact, at all, with his daughter since shortly after X&#8217;s death. It is notable that despite his illness he has managed to travel to see M in hospital on several occasions during this period. He has not attended court this week. He has, heretofore, refused to take part in life story work; although he now says that he will do so.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the day that X died all of B&#8217;s immediate family disappeared from her life and she has not seen them since. The trauma of such a loss on a small child is difficult to imagine and its effect unquantifiable. It cannot be disputed that she must have been left bereft and in a very vulnerable emotional state. When her mother was sentenced in the Crown Court, and on advice from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), Y was told that her mother had admitted causing the baby&#8217;s death, that she could not remember how it had happened and that she was unwell. It was stressed that Y was not in any way responsible; but sadly during her time in foster care Y has expressed feelings of guilt about the baby dying which the foster-carer has recorded and set out in her statements (I shall return to this below).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Threshold</span> As I have set out above both the local authority, and those representing Y herself, regard it as necessary and in best interests of Y for the court to resolve, insofar as possible, a factual framework that properly and sufficiently reflects Y&#8217;s experiences prior to her accommodation in care. Such a framework is imperative to ensuring that Y and her carer have as objectively truthful narrative as is possible going forwards but, more importantly, so that professionals (and if necessary, the court abroad) have a firm foundation on which to proceed when considering how to meet Y&#8217;s welfare needs in future or if considering the basis of any possible future dispute as to her care and living arrangements. (In due course it will augment the life-story work being carried out for Y by social services with assistance from her mother and, it is hoped, her father.) There have been concerns raised about both M and her parent&#8217;s treating the placement with MA as short-term or temporary until Y&#8217;s mother can resume her care. That is neither the purpose of the SGO nor the intention of this court in making these orders.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The facts sought by the local authority have been reduced and are contained in the Revised Schedule of Findings dated 13 June 2014 (see below). It is the view of the local authority and the Guardian that in the absence of a judicial determination of the disputed facts the parents and, perhaps, the maternal grandparents, would continue to place a euphemistic gloss on and/or may continue to dispute the events Y experienced during her up-bringing, the effects of her upbringing on Y, the harm she has suffered as a result and the risk of suffering significant harm in the future should her placement be disrupted.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Contact</span> There had, until the hearing on the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July 2014, been a dispute between the local authority and M about whether Y should have face to face contact with her mother prior to moving to the foreign jurisdiction with her aunt, as planned, in July 2014. Y has not seen her mother or had any planned direct contact with her since the morning that X died. Y has been displaying considerable distress and displayed some uncharacteristic behaviour and upset after it has been suggested to her that she may see her mother, despite the fact that she has also said that she would like to see her mother. It is similar to the behaviour she exhibited after her grandfather put her on the phone to her mother around Christmas time (contrary to the court&#8217;s orders), a description of which is set out in the statements of her foster carer and which I shall not rehearse here. M has now said, through her counsel, that she will co-operate with the preparation of a DVD which can be watched by Y either before she leaves this country, or later when she has moved, if the professionals currently charged with her care, decide that would be appropriate. The decision will be guided by how vulnerable Y is emotionally during this delicate transition. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If Y is able to watch the DVD and if it is considered that she has handled it well and that seeing her mother is, on balance, in her interests then consideration will be given to face to face contact with her mother before she leaves. There are benefits for Y in seeing her mother particularly if she is able to demonstrate her wholehearted support for Y going to live with her aunt. Y will also see that her mother is alive, well and being cared for which will offer additional reassurance. I can well understand that M would very much like to see Y and that she feels that she can provide reassurance that no-one else can, however, Y has displayed real distress at the possibility of seeing her mother and there can be little doubt that she remains in an emotionally vulnerable state. It is far from a meeting to simply to say good bye and good luck; I reiterate that Y has not seen her mother since her baby sister died, and that in the interim she has been told that her mother caused X&#8217;s death. The maelstrom of emotions that will engulf Y in the meeting her mother proposes are self-evident and would seem to militate against such a meeting taking place, unless there are clear signs that Y is able, not just to cope with it but to benefit from it.</p>

Y likes seeing her grandparents and appears to be relaxed and happy in their company. But there have been concerns raised about the grandparents&#8217; willingness and ability to put Y&#8217;s interest before that of M; these concerns have substance and are set out in the assessments carried out by the social workers of the maternal grandparents as a possible placement for Y, they are shared by MA. I shall not repeat them here as they agree that Y should be placed with her aunt. In future contact will be at the discretion of Y&#8217;s aunt at her instigation and direction. Its form, frequency and duration will be a matter for MA, alone, and will take place for the benefit of Y, not her grandparents. There must be a substantial quietsome time, when MA and Y can get to know each other in peace and without interruption.  Any agreement or court order must reflect this and the primacy of Y&#8217;s needs, particularly her need for stability and security.</p>

There is no need to set it out in detail here, but I am certain that she will encourage Y to develop relationships within the extended maternal family, including maintaining the relationship she has with her grandparents; but as <span style="font-style:italic">grandparents</span> not in a parental role and secondary to her&#8217;s as Y&#8217;s principal carer.

The most illuminating evidence is contained in his police interview, which is not challenged and upon which the court can place some reliance. Much of the concern about Y&#8217;s upbringing and life with her parents is based on what she is reported as saying after she came into care and on the behaviour she has displayed whilst in care. The evidence filed by M is limited to one statement dated the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2014 of barely five pages in which she says that she hopes to resume care of Y in the future (paragraph 19). She gives very little by way of detail as to her life with Y. However she had extensive interviews with three psychiatrists; the contents of those interviews, which although prepared for the criminal proceedings, are prepared by experts in forensic psychiatry and were not challenged. Some of what she told the psychiatrists forms the basis of the history set out here. What M said also contradicted her statement and the basis of her case in these proceedings particularly concerning her history of mental illness and alcohol abuse.</p>

He has used several names during his life and does not use the names given at birth. He told the police he moved to India in the early sixties and frequently returned to the UK. He has been married twice before and has other children, who he was unable to name to the police; he had no idea of their ages, where they lived or anything else about them. F said when he went abroad he had become interested in spiritualism generally and in tantric sex which was his main focus. While abroad he was treated as a teacher and took on Hindu aliases. He described himself as a spiritual guide and said that he had, and continued to be, supported by wealthy benefactors who gave him money and other gifts. F met M overseas and said that he also travelled to other parts of the when he was with M.</p>

Although he knew she was a recovering alcoholic he encouraged her and her friend to drink because it was &#8220;wild&#8221;. He was unable to remember where Y was born whether it was abroad or elsewhere or whether she was born in a hospital or not. Later in the interview he said X was born at home, but he could not really remember. (In fact she was born in hospital and M left 2.5 hours after she was born to go home to look after F). He told the police that M later told him that she suffered from post-natal depression after Y was born which had surprised him as he was not aware of it.</p>

After X was born they both were depressed, according to F, and both took medication, Lorazepam, which had been prescribed to him. They would both cry because of the medicine.

F said that he told M in the months leading up to X&#8217;s death that they needed to see a psychiatrist but she did not want to as she was afraid that she would be locked up. They started to share medication, they had rows and made plans to leave the house and the area as M did not want to live there. In the last few weeks she spoke of killing herself, which made him angry.

She managed to complete a degree course in 2001. She became interested in Buddhism, went abroad and spent three years travelling and towards the end of this period that she met F. According to one of the psychiatrists her description of her feelings at the time was suggestive of an elevated mood state. When she became pregnant with Y they came to the UK. When they arrived in the UK M became depressed and told one of the psychiatrists instructed in the criminal proceedings that she started to drink again. Y was born and after about 4 months F disappeared, apparently abroad, he told her he was in Russia. M was effectively stranded without funds and a new baby, whose passport was missing. With some difficulty she arranged travel documents and took the baby home to her mother in her home country. She then moved to another part of the country for a year where, she told the psychiatrist, she had a relationship with someone else. This came to an end in about 2008. M told the psychiatrist that she was suffering from depression but did not seek any treatment for it. This period accounts for the first two years of Y&#8217;s life. </p>

She left Y with her mother&#8217;s partner, drove away and attempted suicide by drinking a bottle of wine and cutting her wrists. She was admitted to hospital for 10 days. </p>

The evidence of what actually took place in the home is limited to what was said by F in his police interview about using sexual activity to deal with M&#8217;s depression latterly and the couple&#8217;s adherence to a belief in the healing properties of sexual energy more generally. M told a psychiatrist instructed by the prosecution of the sexually open nature of her relationship with her husband, and her belief that sexual contact is part of the sexual healing of others. She told the psychiatrist that her husband would welcome her having sexual intercourse with others in their home so he could feel the sexual energy and that he subsequently received detailed accounts of these sexual encounters. There is a statement taken by the police of a man who had sex with M on four or five occasions prior to the death of the baby. He would arrive late at night and M would be wearing diaphanous clothing and was naked underneath. The last time was on the night after F was taken into hospital. Both parents say that they had ceased their wider sexual encounters after they left India.

It is reported that she continues to do so almost every day. Y was only six years old when she came into foster care. The court entirely rejects her mother&#8217;s comment that this is no more than an early sexual awakening. It is very unusual sexualized behaviour in a young child and any sexual awakening must have been encouraged or engendered. How it happened far from clear; Y herself is recorded as saying that it made her feel better when she was thinking. She also said that her mummy used to tickle her there when she was in the bath, however she has not gone on to say any more than that. Y is reported as saying that her mother had boyfriends and seeing her in the bedroom with a man when her mother shouted at her and told her to go to her room.</p>

This went over and above bedwetting at night which would be unsurprising in a child who had lost her home, her parents and her baby sister. It was reported that Y would crouch down on her bed or in the corner of her room and urinate; she would urinate on her clothes. She wet herself when out with the foster carer and at school. This behaviour is indicative of considerable emotional distress and disturbance in this child.</p>

She has displayed distress and acted out after contact with her grandparents and when it has been suggested that she might see her mother. Despite saying she wants to Y had also said it would be alright if she did not as long as the indirect contact continued. Y is reported as saying that she was frightened at home, that robbers would come and her father could not fight them off; that her mother and father were always shouting and falling out and told her to get to her room. She is reported as saying that her mother could not look after X as she was crying all the time; that her mother banged her head off the wall. Y is reported as telling her foster carer that her parents would go out to play Black Jack and leave her in the house with X and that she had to feed the baby to stop her crying.</p>

It is reported that she said &#8220;I keep thinking if X fell off the bed onto a knife that would make her die&#8230;and if she went under the water in the bath that would make her die, because my Mom has the water very deep.&#8221; She put her hands up to her chin and said up to here; Y said she could not stop worrying about it all the time. Around Easter, the foster carer reports that they when they were out and Y said &#8220;My Mom didn&#8217;t do it on purpose, she was ill&#8221;. Y got tearful and upset; the foster carer described Y&#8217;s distress as heart-wrenching, affecting her whole body &#8220;from the toes upwards&#8221;. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The foster carer described Y&#8217;s distress after she had contact when her grandfather put her on the phone with her mother. She was reported as saying her mother had cried on the phone to her. She had more temper tantrums and was more tearful at night, and, in the opinion of the foster carer Y was set back. Y is reported as saying that the grandparents told her she would go to live with her Auntie and would have a sleep-over with them when she did. After her Guardian visited her at school on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2014 Y was again very distressed. The guardian had spoken to her about the possibility of seeing her mother. Her foster carer said she was in a &#8220;terrible state&#8221;, angry and shouting at tea-time and then becoming very tearful and sobbing. Y told her foster carer that her Guardian had come to see her at school and &#8220;said that maybe I could see my mum to say goodbye and I was too embarrassed to let [the guardian] know I was really upset inside.&#8221; She then went to talk about the baby dying and how she thought it was her fault. Y is reported to have told her foster carer that if she had come out of her bedroom maybe she could have stopped it happening; that if her mother had seen her watching maybe she would not have done it as she would have been embarrassed. Y was very upset all night, waking from nightmares and saying she was frightened but not of what she was frightened. She made a reference (as she had on a previous occasion) to her mother getting her to help her father out of the bath and seeing &#8220;his privates&#8221;; something she clearly did not like. Her disturbed behaviour continued all weekend and although it lessened at night her temper tantrums continued throughout the day. The foster carer writes that it was as if Y had a change of personality.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is the opinion of the psychiatrist instructed by the prosecution that M suffered bouts of a schizoaffective  disorder mental illness, both of the depressive and manic type, during adulthood although she has been treated for it only once in the past. This psychiatrist was of the view that M avoided such treatment through her lifestyle choices and her use of alternative coping strategies such as meditation and mindfulness skills. Latterly she also self medicated with the assistance of her husband. The psychiatrist makes reference to discussions with M&#8217;s GP in which it was confirmed that neither M nor her husband had disclosed previous mental health problems to the surgery, and that there were no concerns about her mental health until X was a few months old and F was admitted to hospital.</p>

This is at variance with what she has told the psychiatrist instructed by her defence team at a time when the aim was to plead diminished responsibility. It is also at variance with the evidence of her husband. There can be little doubt that she did not disclose even the limited mental illness she accepts in her statement to her GP. There are undisputed and clear indication that she suffered depression after Y was born; her husband says she told him so and her description of her mood state when she returned to her home country with Y in 2006 bears it out. Both of them were aware that she was depressed and having difficulty coping, at the very least after, X was born, particularly when F went into hospital for a month. </p>

Her deteriorating mental health was noticed by her neighbour over the month prior to the baby&#8217;s death. </p>

Most of the details that are known are from the statements taken by the police of witnesses. M left with the baby in the car and abandoned the vehicle. She called a cab but was very vague both as to her destination and the purpose of her journey; she seemed to believe it was at the behest of her husband. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have not set out all of the evidence above just that which is relevant to the disputed facts and to form such narrative as there can be in the absence of a full and coherent explanation from both of the parents. M cannot recall what took place on the morning X died because she was so mentally unwell at the time. But she has, in my view deliberately, failed to set out the life that she and Y led prior to Y being taken into care. It is more likely than not that she has done so in order to minimise the difficulties she encountered and the effects of her chosen lifestyle on her daughter. It is also likely that M did so in the hope that it would help her resume the care of Y in the future as she sets out in paragraph 19 of her statement. This stance, while understandable, undermines her claim to support Y&#8217;s placement with MA; and, if conveyed to Y, would tend to undermine the placement itself. Even if M recovers and is released it would be some years before she could travel to the foreign jurisdiction. Y will be well settled, probably in or about to start secondary education and any attempt to move her would not be conducive to her long-term stability and welfare during adolescence. It is the view of this court that no such move or application to the courts of the foreign jurisdiction to bring about such a move should be contemplated, in the light of the findings I have made.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In respect of finding 1: I find on the balance of probabilities and on the evidence of the parents themselves that Y and her mother have had a peripatetic lifestyle during which there was no semblance of stability. The moves were not made as part of any planned pattern related to work or career progression as is usually the case when families move with this level of frequency. There is no evidence of what the family lived on; there is little or no evidence of integration into any local community or wider society. Even when in the UK which is the longest period the family were in one place; there is no evidence of settlement or integration. Indeed F&#8217;s evidence is that M wanted to move on again. It cannot be disputed that F dipped in and out of Y&#8217;s early life and that his role as a parent has been diminished by his need for M to care for him. There is no evidence that he has ever taken on a caring or nurturing role for any of his children, some of whom he cannot even name. This must have affected Y&#8217;s emotional security and development and her needs have always come second to the wishes of her parents.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Y&#8217;s behaviour alone gives rise to considerable concern about sexual boundaries within the home. The masturbation seems a pernicious and a well established pattern of behaviour which must have been learnt and most probably encouraged. It is not acceptable behaviour for a child of this age and it is likely to be emotionally damaging to have sexual feeling aroused at an early age. Y has already suffered emotional harm as a result, which is attributable to the care of her parents. While there is no evidence to support any finding of direct physical sexual abuse there is evidence on the balance of probabilities from her behaviour that, at the very least, Y has been exposed to uninhibited sexual behaviour and, it must follow, inappropriate sexual boundaries. Given the explanations of both parents of their belief in sexual healing during the police investigation and criminal proceedings and the evidence of the man with whom M had sex during the summer prior to X&#8217;s death it is more likely than not that they continued their sexual practices throughout their marriage.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finding 2 is not disputed and therefore it must follow that finding 3 (e) cannot be disputed either. I find that from March to September that year M was the children&#8217;s primary or sole carer. There is little, if any, evidence from any source that F participated in the care of the children before March and none at all after March. He did not attempt to get any treatment for M as her mental health deteriorated again; in fact according to him part of the reason he decided against such a course is that it would have deprived him of a carer.</p>

It is difficult to see such behaviour could have done anything other than frighten and worry her. I find 3(g) proved. Neither parent took any steps to protect Y from the consequences to her of her mother&#8217;s being mentally unwell nor have they provided any evidence about how they may have attempted to do so. They should have sought professional help, they did not do so. 3 (h) is proved on the balance of probabilities. </p>

This stance is reflected in the missing parts of the history as set out in this judgement. He has declined any contact with Y since he told her that her sister was dead. He has in fact and in deed abandoned her. He has made absolutely no efforts on her behalf, offered no reassurance, no love and undertaken not one single act of sympathy or care for his little daughter. His illness is no excuse as he has both visited and supported his wife in secure hospital. His police interview was self-obsessed and self-reverential; he is a father of breathtaking selfishness who is only concerned for himself and his own comfort. He has failed his child.</p>
