The court further heard the oral submissions of the parties, which submissions included argument about whether a further adjournment of the proceedings was necessary.

In addition to the evidence before the court that this was, at least in principle, the only type of treatment available to Isaiah, I also dealt extensively at Paragraphs [23], [27] to [28], [42] and [47] with the unanimous evidence before the court was that Isaiah&#8217;s brain injury was irreversible and, accordingly would not improve with treatment, whether in the community or otherwise.  </p>

In any event, having regard to the totality of the evidence before the court, and for the reasons set out in my judgment, I was satisfied that Isaiah has a profoundly depressed level of consciousness and that, if he is aware, he is more likely than not only to be minimally so.  That conclusion was based on a medical consensus that, if Isaiah is aware, he has an extremely low level of conscious awareness and that, within this context, an absence of objective evidence that he feels pain or pleasure.  </p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;By that judgment, this court explained why it had decided to refuse permission to the parents to appeal to it against the order of the Court of Appeal dated 25 May 2017. But its refusal was subject to a reservation of jurisdiction to grant a further stay of the declarations dated 11 April 2017. There is a logical problem about a stay of a declaration (as opposed to an order) but this is no time to wrestle with it. As is agreed, the practical effect of any stay would be that, for as long as it continued, it would not be unlawful for the doctors and other staff at Great Ormond Street Hospital (&#8220;the hospital&#8221;) to continue to provide artificial ventilation, nutrition an hydration (&#8220;AVNH&#8221;) so as to keep Charlie Gard alive.&#8221;</p>

The Supreme Court has made clear that in cases of this nature, the practical effect of any stay is that, for as long as it continued, it would not be unlawful for the doctors and other staff at King&#8217;s College Hospital to continue to provide artificial ventilation to Isaiah.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that if an order is to be made then a stay is the appropriate form of order.</p>

In the circumstances, not to stay the order would render any appeal nugatory.  However, with respect to the balance of harm, a stay would also mean that Isaiah continues to be given treatment that the court has determined is not in his best interests for the reasons set out in my substantive judgment.  I must also bear in mind that a stay is the exception and not the rule and, for the reasons I have given, I am of the clear view that it cannot be said in this case that there are strong grounds of appeal or a strong likelihood of success.</p>
