	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The background to this matter spans, regrettably, over ten years of litigation in respect of T, beginning with an application by the father for a prohibited steps order in relation to T&#8217;s schooling.  A final order in those proceedings was made in September 2008.   In March 2010 children&#8217;s services undertook an investigation following allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards T by the mother&#8217;s partner.  The case was closed following an investigation pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/47" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 47</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  Further allegations were made in December 2011 of inappropriate behaviour by the mother.  Once again, following investigation by children&#8217;s services, this time by a different local authority, the case was closed in February 2012 following a Core Assessment being undertaken.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In December 2012 the father made an application for sole residence.  In February 2013 the mother applied for residence, contact and prohibited steps orders.  On 5 March 2013 the learned judge made a shared residence order, which order was affirmed by final order made by the District Judge on 4 March 2014. In November 2015 a further assessment of T was undertaken by Children&#8217;s Services following allegations of inappropriate behaviour made by the mother with respect to a member of the paternal family.  That case was, ultimately, also closed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In December 2015 the father made a further application with respect to the child arrangements for T.  In January 2016 the learned Judge made an order re-introducing contact (the father complaining that there had been a gap in contact) and affirming the shared residence order.  On 11 March 2016 the father applied for permission to temporarily remove T from the jurisdiction to take her to Hungary from 22 March to 6 April 2016 to visit members of the paternal family.  On 17 March 2016 the learned Judge refused that application.  In November 2016 the father made a further application seeking restoration of contact, a greater period of time with T and for the mother to pay his costs.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This short summary, taken from the chronology provided by the father, and that prepared by Ms Topping, gives some flavour of the burden of litigation that T has had to bear over a considerable period of time.  Interwoven within this litigation have been cross allegations of abusive behaviour towards T by maternal and paternal family members and others, resulting in T being interviewed by both Police officers and social workers on more than one occasion, and the involvement of doctors by the mother concerning an alleged eating disorder and signs of stress in T.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As the history of this matter moves towards the end of 2016, it is necessary to consider the background in a little more detail having regard to the issues raised in this appeal.  In December 2016 the father applied for permission to instruct an expert child and adolescent psychiatrist to assess T&#8217;s wishes and feelings and whether she was the subject of adverse maternal influence.   On 19 December 2016 the learned Judge joined T as a party to the proceedings and gave permission for Dr Berelowitz to be instructed to undertake an assessment of T.  I am told by the parties that that instruction did not proceed because the parents accepted the recommendation of the Children&#8217;s Guardian that they should attempt mediation.  Within his report recommending mediation, the Children&#8217;s Guardian also recommended that the proceedings should be concluded with indirect contact to the father and an order under s 91(14) for 12 months.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_10">
	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Sadly, the mediation, whilst undertaken, did not lead to a resolution.  Within this context, at a hearing on 7 July 2017 the parties agreed, and the learned Judge endorsed, a direction for a psychologist, Mr Clowry, to report on a plan of clinical work to assist the parents with facilitating the progress of contact between the father and T.  There is no copy of that order in the appeal bundle but Ms Topping&#8217;s chronology makes clear that the order provided that there was <span style="font-style:italic">no</span> permission for the psychologist to see T for the purpose of preparing the report.  On 14 September 2017 the father applied to expand the remit of the psychologist to include consideration of T&#8217;s wishes and feelings and the question of parental influence.</p>

At that hearing the Children&#8217;s Guardian was continuing to press for the proceedings to be brought to an end.  The court has a copy of the order made on that date.

I have come to the view that a) such a report is necessary, not to establish the wishes and feelings of the child, that, that&#8217;s been done already.  But because the court needs assistance with a plan of work to get contact going, if I can put it in the vernacular, and a plan to ensure that contact is advanced and lasting.  So I find it necessary, I also find on balance, that it is best done within Court proceedings.  There is a history in this matter of non-communication by the parties, and if there is communication, not terribly constructive communication.  There is a history of the Court having to make orders for each of the parents to comply with.  So, on balance, I am going to order the report but, and I take note of what the Father has said today, it will be recorded in the preamble of the order, that if the outcome is that proceedings should end, if that is the recommendation of the psychologist, the Father would go along with that, because he sees, I&#8217;ve no doubt, as the Guardian states and the Mother sees that that would be best for the child.&#8221;</p>

Whilst the letter of instruction limits the instructions to Mr Clowry to the preparation of a &#8220;robust, clinically legitimate and reputable plan of clinical work&#8221;, the permission given in the order of the learned Judge is in somewhat wider terms, namely &#8220;to prepare a report in respect of the time that T should spend with her father.&#8221;</p>

A copy of the report is before this court.  All parties agreed before the learned Judge on 28 November 2017, and agree before this court, that that report is deficient in that it failed to comply with the instructions provided to Mr Clowry in the letter of instruction. In these circumstances, it is not necessary to descend into detail with respect to precisely how it is said that the report was deficient having regard to the terms of the letter of instruction.  I do however, note that whilst the document produced by Mr Clowry is inconsistent with the ambit of the instructions contained in the letter of instruction, it is perhaps less inconsistent with ambit of the terms of the <span style="font-style:italic">order</span> of 15 September 2017.</p>

This is not an accurate reflection of what the learned Judge had said and, in any event, is not a promise he could have made, not least having regard to the right of a party to appeal.

As noted above, the order of 15 September 2017 made no provision for statements of evidence to be filed and served for the final hearing on 28 November 2017, nor for the filing and serving of a final report from the Children&#8217;s Guardian.  In the circumstances, on 28 November 2017, the court was without up to date sworn evidence from the parents or a report from the Children&#8217;s Guardian on the issues that fell to be considered at the final hearing.  For the reasons I have already set out, the expert report that had been produced the evening before the final hearing to inform the same was deficient by reference to the terms of the letter of instruction. </p>

Both sought an outcome that provided for no order to be made with respect to the time the father spent with T.  The Guardian&#8217;s Position Statement also urged the court to make an order pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 91(14)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> in respect of the father for a period of 12 months. However, no application had been issued.  The father sought permission to instruct a replacement expert or an adjournment of the final hearing to permit him time to make a properly constituted application under FPR 2010 Part 25 for permission to instruct a replacement, with a view to him pursuing his argument for a far greater level of contact at an adjourned final hearing.  In any event, the father sought a final child arrangements order that provided for a much greater level of time spent with T than was then taking place.  The final hearing was, therefore, contested.</p>

Further, and contrary to the varied positions of the mother, the father and of the child, the learned Judge proceeded to make a final child arrangements order.  The final order made by the learned Judge in respect of the time the father would spend with T reflected the level of contact that was then said to be taking place.  Accordingly, the order provided for the father to spend time with T for at least 2 hours once per month, with an additional 2-hour periods during the holidays, together with indirect contact.</p>

The reason for this appears to have been that, whilst the learned Judge had reserved the matter to himself, he was very heavily listed on the day in question and the matter had therefore been placed in District Judge Smith&#8217;s list.  The matter remained before the District Judge for approximately half an hour.  During that time the parties made substantive submissions on the adequacy of Mr Clowry&#8217;s report and the proper course of action in respect of the report.  The District Judge having expressed &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">severe concerns</span>&#8221; regarding the report of Mr Clowry, counsel for the father, Ms Sarah Cooper, proceeded to make submissions in support of the continued need for expert evidence, a course opposed on behalf of the mother by Mr Persson and on behalf of T by Ms Topping.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is a noteworthy feature of the transcript of the hearing before the District Judge that, as was to become a feature of the transcript of the hearing before the learned Judge, counsel constantly interrupted each other.  Ms Cooper&#8217;s submissions on the fate of Mr Clowry&#8217;s report were interrupted by Mr Persson, without demur from the District Judge.  Mr Persson was in turn interrupted by Ms Topping, again without judicial demur.  Indeed, at times the transcript appears to show simply an argument between counsel with no input from the District Judge.  This conduct continued until the District Judge decided that enquiries should be made as to whether the learned Judge could take the case.  The net result of the way this part of the hearing was conducted meant that no party ever got to the point of concluding a complete, focused and structured submission on any issue.</p>

The father also complained before me that the Judge appeared, from his initial comments, to have reached a settled judgment from the outset.  The opening statements of the learned Judge, who had had long involvement with this case, form the basis of the father&#8217;s contentions in this regard:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Cooper commenced, on behalf of the father, by seeking permission from the learned Judge for a replacement expert to prepare a report and, in default, for a short adjournment to permit the preparation of a properly constituted Part 25 application to that end.  Ms Cooper sought to advance her argument in circumstances where the default on the part of Mr Clowry was not known to the parties until the evening before the hearing and was not the father&#8217;s fault, or indeed the fault of any party.  Ms Cooper did not get to conclude that submission because she was again interrupted, by Mr Persson.  Whilst Ms Cooper managed briefly to reclaim the floor, she was then interrupted by Ms Topping, followed by a period during which all counsel appeared to be making submissions in an unstructured and unfocused fashion.  Indeed, as had occurred before the District Judge, the majority of the hearing before the learned Judge was characterised by counsel interrupting each other and speaking over each other, again without apparent judicial demur.  </p>

At other times, the learned Judge appeared to indicate it was an issue he was prepared to decide.  The precise ambit of the issue the parties are addressing in respect of expert evidence is only belatedly defined and no party ever got to the point of concluding their submissions on the question of further expert evidence, although Ms Cooper made a valiant effort to conclude organised submissions to the Judge in support of permission for a further expert or a short adjournment to allow the preparation of a properly constituted Part 25 application.</p>

In respect of this issue, the learned Judge initially gave a clear indication that he considered it inappropriate to determine the matter by way of final orders at the hearing in circumstances where the matter remained fully contested by the father:</p>

The father himself begins to make submissions to the learned Judge, Miss Cooper, Mr Persson and Ms Topping continue to make points with little order, structure or focus, and even Mr Gaye enters the arena at one point.  All this occurred as the learned Judge continued to propound his view that a final order should be made at the hearing, reflecting the then current level of contact, and sought repeatedly to press the parties to agree to that course of action.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within the foregoing context, it is of particular note from the transcript that no party was ever able during the hearing to get to the stage of making submissions on the key issue before the court, namely the question of whether, if the court decided to proceed to conclude the proceedings, a final child arrangements order should be made and, if so, the nature and extent of the contact in any final child arrangements order.  Whilst counsel were able, up to a point, to make submissions on the question of whether the learned Judge should <span style="font-style:italic">proceed</span> with the final hearing or adjourn it, the increasingly unstructured nature of the hearing meant that, as conceded by Ms Topping and Mr Persson before me, <span style="font-style:italic">no</span> party ever reached the stage of making submissions, nor did the learned Judge invite submissions, on what <span style="font-style:italic">outcome </span>with respect to contact was in T&#8217;s best interests <span style="font-style:italic">if </span>the learned Judge determined, against his initial instinct, that it was right conclude the proceedings then and there.  This was the case even though Miss Cooper had made clear on behalf of the father that the matter was contested, and that the father would be seeking more extensive contact in any final order than that then taking place, and even though Ms Topping&#8217;s instructions from the Children&#8217;s Guardian remained that there should be no order as to contact and an order pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 91(14)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> with respect to the father for a period of 12 months.  </p>

If the child is caught up in a very powerful adversarial situation there&#8217;s a high probability the child is going to reflect certain of the adult attitudes and opinions.  If the child were enabled to meet the psychologist whether it be me or anybody else the child might then be prepared to reconsider.  I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t know the child.</p>

He stated he placed &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">great weight</span>&#8221; on T&#8217;s wishes and feelings.  By way of explaining his reasons for making a final child arrangements order in the face of the father&#8217;s objections in the terms he did, the learned Judge said as follows at [19] and [20]:</p>

I am satisfied with the Guardian&#8217;s position that of [T] is left to her own devices with the guidance of an order of the court that there will be some contact between her and the father if I make those orders today.  I accept the father&#8217;s misgivings about this and I accept that the father will not be happy with the amount of contact ordered but ordered it will be and it is the mother&#8217;s duty as a mother and as a primary carer of the child to ensure that the contact works.  If it does not work, I shall hold the mother to blame.  It is a difficult task being a parent and a very difficult task being a single parent of a teenage child who has to toe the line and see an absent parent. I accept that.</p>

He submitted that, in circumstances where the hearing was not moved to the learned Judge until 2.20pm and that the learned Judge had to attend a meeting at 4.00pm demonstrated that the learned Judge did not accord the final hearing, listed for three hours, sufficient time.  The father further argued that the transcript of the hearing plainly showed that the learned Judge did not give proper consideration, or indeed any consideration, to the arguments on the central issue before the court at the final hearing, namely the nature and extent of any final child arrangements order. As I have noted, the father complained that the fact that the hearing before the learned Judge descended into a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">shouting match</span>&#8221; further prevented the learned Judge from giving proper consideration to the arguments before him. As I have noted, before me, the father also argued that it was apparent from the transcript that the learned Judge had pre-judged the case when he came into court.</p>

The father argued that this was further evidence of the learned Judge having failed properly to prepare for the hearing.  The father further argued that,<span style="font-style:italic"/>in circumstances where the fact that the expert evidence the court had considered necessary was not before the court due to the default of Mr Clowry and not a change of circumstances that affected the conclusion on necessity, the learned Judge should have at least allowed a short adjournment to permit him to issue a properly prepared Part 25 application in circumstances where he had only received the deficient report of Mr Clowry the evening before the final hearing and where, on the father&#8217;s submission, expert evidence remained necessary.  </p>

In particular, the father submitted that the learned Judge was wrong to decide the case based on his conclusion that contact would develop under the auspices of the final order he made if T was left to her own devices, the father submitting that all of the evidence before the court pointed precisely to the contrary.  </p>

Mr Persson argued that the primary issue in the case was whether Mr Clowry should continue his work and, if the conclusion was no, whether the proceedings should be brought to a close and with what order.  In seeking to defend the learned Judge&#8217;s making of a final child arrangements order, Mr Persson submitted that contact &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">had been working at the rate previously arranged</span>&#8221; without an order (a point disputed by the father), that proceedings were by then over a year old and litigation had been continuing and on and off for nearly eleven years, that Guardian&#8217;s position had been &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">unequivocal</span>&#8221; and that further proceedings would be counterproductive.

In his oral submissions however, Mr Persson conceded that, within the context of manner in which the hearing progressed, no party was able to make substantive submissions as to the merits in respect of a final order or contact before the learned Judge made a decision in respect of those issues.  Mr Persson likewise conceded that the court did not have before it statements of evidence or a final report from the Children&#8217;s Guardian.  Mr Persson however resisted the suggestion that the learned Judge had pre-judged matters, characterising the learned Judge&#8217;s statements as perfectly permissible robust indications at a final hearing, and likewise resisted the suggestion that the learned Judge was not adequately prepared for the hearing, pointing out that the learned Judge had long been involved with the matter over a number of hearings.</p>

Within this context, and relying on an assertion that the learned Judge had characterised his decision to permit the instruction of Mr Clowry as finely balanced (again, an incomplete description of the learned Judge&#8217;s characterisation of his decision) as justification for the learned Judge&#8217;s view that expert evidence should no longer be pursued notwithstanding the decision on 15 September 2017 that the same was necessary to resolve the proceedings justly, Ms Topping submitted that the learned Judge was not wrong to reject the father&#8217;s case on replacement expert evidence in circumstances where the proceedings had been ongoing for a decade and it was not being suggested that T should live anywhere than with her mother.</p>

In her oral submissions however, like Mr Persson, Ms Topping conceded that, within the context of an increasingly unstructured and fractious hearing, no party ever came to make substantive submissions as to the merits in respect of any final order.  Ms Topping likewise conceded that the court did indeed not have before it, statements of evidence from the parties or a final report from the Children&#8217;s Guardian when considering whether to make a final child arrangements order and, if so, in what terms.

It has long been recognised &#8211; and authority need not be quoted for this proposition &#8211; that for this reason a judge exercising the family jurisdiction has a much broader discretion than he would in the civil jurisdiction to determine the way in which an application of the kind being made by the father should be pursued. In an appropriate case he can summarily dismiss the application as being, if not groundless, lacking enough merit to justify pursuing the matter. He may determine that the matter is one to be dealt with on the basis of written evidence and oral submissions without the need for oral evidence. He may, as His Honour Judge Cliffe did in the present case, decide to hear the evidence of the applicant and then take stock of where the matter stands at the end of the evidence.</p>

But if the judge is satisfied that no advantage to the children is going to be obtained by continuing the investigation further, then it is perfectly within his case management powers and the proper exercises of his discretion so to decide and to determine that the proceedings should go no further."</p>

In undertaking such a role, a judge must necessarily form, at least a preliminary, view of the strength and/or merits of particular aspects of the case. The process may well lead to parties reviewing their position in the light of questioning from the judge and, by agreement, issues being removed from the list of matters that may fall to be determined. </p>

The FPR 2010 makes provision for an 'Issues Resolution Hearing' ['IRH'] at a later stage of care proceedings. As the IRH label implies, it is intended that some, if not all, of the issues will be resolved at the IRH stage. The rules are however plain [FPR 2010, PD12A] that the 'court resolves or narrows issues by hearing evidence' and 'identifies the evidence to be heard on the issues which remain to be resolved at the final hearing'. </p>

On the one hand he or she is required to be interventionist in managing the proceedings and in identifying the key issues and relevant evidence, but on the other hand the judge must hold back from making an adjudication at a preliminary stage and should only go on to determine issues in the proceedings after having conducted a fair judicial process. </p>

However, with respect to the issue of preparation, whilst the learned Judge indicated he had not looked at the bundles, he had long experience of this matter, having dealt with it on numerous occasions previously.  He was therefore well versed in the key issues before the court.  Whilst the learned Judge&#8217;s announcement that he had read Mr Clowry&#8217;s expert report over his sandwich at lunchtime may suggest to a lay party a certain informality of approach, the need for judges to work through lunch in order to get through the work in their extremely heavy lists is the modern reality for judges up and down the country.  Within this context, the fact that the learned Judge combined eating and reading is not an indication of a lack of diligence or preparation. Rather, it is quite the opposite. The learned Judge worked assiduously through his lunch break to ensure he had considered the material relevant to the hearing he was about to conduct.  </p>

However, I also bear in mind that the matter was listed on 28 November 2017 for a final hearing rather than a preliminary case management hearing, at which final hearing the learned Judge was required to adopt an essentially inquisitorial role in pursuance of his duty to further the welfare of the child as his paramount consideration.  Within this context, at least on one reading, the learned Judge was simply exploring at the outset of the final hearing the extent of the issues between the parties at the final hearing and inviting the father to consider a reasonable view on the information available to the court.  Finally, as Mr Persson points out, upon being told that the matter was contested by the father, the learned Judge did go on to conduct a hearing and to listen to certain submissions from the parties.</p>

The increasingly formless and fractious nature of the hearing meant that no party made submissions on the need for an order or the appropriate level of contact before the learned Judge gave his judgment on those central issues, nor did the learned Judge invite such submissions.  The substantive submissions made by counsel were limited to the procedural question of whether the learned Judge should deal with the final hearing or adjourn it.  </p>

Notwithstanding this, in his judgment the learned Judge determined <span style="font-style:italic">both</span> issues.   Accordingly, even if one accepts that the learned Judge was operating within the wide ambit of his procedural discretion in dealing with the final hearing summarily on submissions, he dealt with the matter without hearing submissions on the merits.  Even though Ms Cooper had made clear on behalf of the father that the matter was fully contested with respect to child arrangements, and that the father would be seeking more extensive contact in any final order than that then taking place, the father never got to argue that case at the final hearing, whether on submissions or otherwise, before the final order was made.</p>

I note that the learned Judge expressly states in the final paragraph of his judgment that, at &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the end of a long and hard day</span>&#8221;, he would have wanted to have time to hand down a judgment but that he felt it was important for the parties to know the outcome.

However, even where the court determines that it is appropriate to deal with the case in this manner, it is equally clear that in doing so, each party must first have a fair opportunity to put their case to the court before the court moves to make final orders.  Within this context, even if he or she elects to determine the final hearing summarily following oral submissions, the judge must be careful to ensure, with the assistance of the advocates, that each party has had a fair opportunity to make their respective cases by way of submission on the issues that the court is required, albeit summarily, finally to decide. Issues that may often include, as in this case, whether to make a final order and if so, which order in the best interests of the child.   In this case, such an approach was even more important where, as I have noted, the learned Judge did not have the benefit at the final hearing of final witness statements from the parties, nor a final report from the Children&#8217;s Guardian, and in circumstances where the expert report that had been considered by the court prior to the final hearing to be necessary to resolve the proceedings justly was deficient having regard to the terms of the letter of instruction.</p>

That decision echoed a determination that the learned Judge had first reached as early as 19 December 2016 when the learned Judge gave permission for the instruction of Dr Berelowitz.   In the circumstances, all parties and the court proceeded on the basis that the final hearing on 28 November 2017 would be informed by expert evidence that the court had determined was necessary to resolve the proceedings justly, specifically a plan of clinical work for advancing contact between T and her father.  </p>

This was not therefore a case in which the court was faced with an application by a parent for an adjournment to secure <span style="font-style:italic">further </span>expert evidence, but rather simply to secure the expert evidence that the court itself had already deemed necessary to resolve the proceedings justly, but which had not been provided as anticipated ahead of the final hearing.</p>

Within this context, the father reached the final hearing having anticipated the court would have before it expert evidence setting out a plan of clinical work for advancing contact between himself and T, which evidence was central to the father&#8217;s case, only to find that such evidence was not available.  In the circumstances, the father and his legal representatives had almost no time to investigate replacement experts to fill the evidential lacuna caused by Mr Clowry&#8217;s default and to mount a properly prepared application for a replacement. Whilst in her submissions to the learned Judge Ms Topping on behalf of the Children&#8217;s Guardian repeatedly criticised the father for trying to make an application for a replacement expert without having prepared a proper application under Part 25, the father had no other choice but to proceed in this manner in circumstances where he had had barely 12 hours notice that Mr Clowry&#8217;s report was deficient and a short adjournment was opposed by all other parties.  Within this context, the criticism of the Children&#8217;s Guardian of the father&#8217;s approach at the hearing was, and remains, unfair.  </p>

When giving his reasons for refusing to permit the father to instruct a replacement expert, or to permit him a short adjournment to prepare a properly constituted application, the learned Judge referred expressly to what he characterised as Mr Clowry&#8217;s view that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">a psychologist would have to see a child before he or she could reach a conclusion</span>&#8221;.  As I have already observed, it is clear from the transcript that this was not a complete summation of what Mr Clowry had, in fact, said.  More fundamentally, in determining the father&#8217;s application, it is clear from the judgment that the learned Judge relied on information conveyed to the court by Mr Clowry, the status of which information was unclear in circumstances where Mr Clowry was not sworn, and which information no party was able to challenge.</p>

By contrast, the learned Judge did not explain in his judgment, and in the context of his comments on 15 September 2017 regarding her wishes and feelings, why T&#8217;s objection to seeing an expert was now to be considered determinative, nor why, given his orders in December 2016 and September 2017, he had moved from considering expert evidence to be necessary to being satisfied it was not.</p>

That properly constituted application might not have been successful but, again, in the context of the matters I have set out above, in my judgment a short adjournment to permit such an application should have been accorded to the father, particularly in circumstances where the matter remained fully contested, the deficiencies in the jointly instructed expert report were not the fault of the father and where the expert evidence that the court had <span style="font-style:italic">already</span> deemed necessary for the just resolution of the proceedings went to the heart of the father&#8217;s case.  </p>

Both the transcript of the hearing before the District Judge, and the transcript of the hearing before His Honour Judge Scarratt, record each of the advocates, although counsel for the father a good deal less so, regularly interrupting each other.  The net effect of that approach was that, as I have observed, neither judge received properly structured submissions, in the proper order on the points that were in issue between the parties, and no issue was ever fully run to ground.  It is quite clear from the transcript why the father chose to describe the hearing as having descended into a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">shouting match</span>&#8221;.  </p>

FPR r 12.21 reflects the fact that properly sequenced submissions constitute a vital constituent of a fair hearing.  The requirement for submissions to be made in a clearly defined order aims to ensure that each party has a fair opportunity to present their case on the issues that are before the court for determination.  A failure by advocates to assist the court in adhering to this requirement is corrosive of that aim.  In this case, the reception by the court of properly sequenced submissions was rendered extremely difficult by a concerning tendency on the part of the advocates simply to interrupt each other in an effort to advance their competing submissions.  It should go without saying that this mode of advocacy does not assist the court and is to be deprecated.</p>
