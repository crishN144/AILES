	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case is, I suggest, as difficult as any which comes before the Family Court.  At its heart is a young girl, A, who was born in May 2014, and is therefore aged 2&#189;.  Over the four days of hearing, the courtroom has been divided in half, with screens erected down the middle; only I could see all of the parties, with their legal teams assembled around them.  On each side of the partition has been a set of parents who yearn profoundly for the chance to raise A throughout her childhood and into adulthood; both sets of parents have laudable and legitimate claims.  One the one side are prospective adopters of A with whom she was placed, from foster care, in December 2014 and with whom she has lived for the last two years; on the other side are A&#8217;s paternal grandparents by birth, who care for A&#8217;s younger brother, J, now aged 17 months.  </p>

Additionally, I heard evidence from Paul Richardson (adoption support worker for the Local Authority), Paula Gibbons (service manager for the fostering and adoption team of the Local Authority), the paternal grandmother, and the Children&#8217;s Guardian. I also read the filed statements and reports, including the report of Beth Miller, the Special Guardianship reporter.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A was born in May 2014.  Her parents are unmarried; I do not believe that the father has ever acquired parental responsibility for A.  Both parents have learning difficulties affecting all levels of their functioning; their relationship has been assessed to be chaotic, their lifestyle transient.  The father was observed at times to be controlling and abusive towards the mother; there is a history of drug abuse.  Neither parent co-operated with any ante-natal assessments, and their parenting capacity was never truly assessed, given their low level of commitment to any of their children.  They are believed now to have separated.  Shortly after A&#8217;s birth, the Local Authority applied for and obtained an interim care order, and A was moved to live with short-term foster carers.  A&#8217;s parents saw A three times over her first week, but have not seen her since; they established a very low level of engagement with children&#8217;s services of the Local Authority.  In October 2014, the court made a care and placement order in respect of A; this was supported by A&#8217;s court-appointed Children&#8217;s Guardian and not meaningfully opposed by the parents, neither of whom attended the hearing.  The parents had not identified, or assisted the Local Authority in locating, any possible alternative carers within the family; accordingly, the order specifically recorded that &#8220;neither the mother nor the father have put forward any alternative family member to be considered as a carer for [A]&#8221;.  In December 2014, A was placed for adoption with Mr. and Mrs. X.  The handover was planned and careful; it was described in this hearing as a &#8220;textbook&#8221; handover.  The move nonetheless caused A some upset in the early weeks and months of her current placement; it took time for her to settle, with much reassurance required.  It is appropriate that I should note here Dr. Young&#8217;s opinion that placing a child for permanency at around the age of 6 months is optimal: &#8220;as this is the age when the infant begins to form clear-cut attachment to a discriminated parental figure, in other words, they begin to identify their &#8216;secure base&#8217;&#8221;.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In June 2015, the parents had another child, J, following a concealed pregnancy; they were then living in a different local authority area.  In the search of a family placement for J, this second local authority traced the paternal grandparents and identified them as potential carers.  It was in this process that the second local authority revealed to the paternal grandparents the existence of A, and her imminent adoption; the grandparents immediately expressed an interest in caring not only for J but also for A.  The grandparents have been consistent in maintaining that they would have put themselves forward to care for A had they known about A&#8217;s existence when she was born. Importantly, no party really disputes before me that had the paternal grandparents been located in May or June 2014, at the time of A&#8217;s birth, they would in all probability have been positively assessed to care for A.  </p>

J was placed with them shortly after his birth, and he remains living there.   In October 2015, the paternal grandparents were successful in their application for a Special Guardianship Order in relation to J.  In April 2016, a third child, K, was born to the parents, and placed with a paternal aunt.</p>

In December 2015, HHJ Simon Wood granted the paternal grandparents leave to issue an application for a Special Guardianship Order in relation to A.  The cross-applications were heard by Bodey J in April 2016; his order, granting the Special Guardianship Order to the paternal grandparents, was successfully appealed in July.</p>

That said, important in the welfare evaluation is the fact that A has been in her prospective adoptive home for approximately 4/5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">ths </span>of her life.  As the Court of Appeal said at [65] (<ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2016/793" uk:canonical="[2016] EWCA Civ 793" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWCA Civ 793</ref>), the welfare balance to be struck must inevitably reflect these particular circumstances, which of course are different from the circumstances when the placement order was made.  The balance at the placement stage naturally would have tilted towards a family placement if relatives had been assessed, as these grandparents would probably have been, as being able to provide good, long term care for a child within their family.</p>

There is professional consensus that A would suffer trauma, distress, confusion and emotional harm if she were to be uprooted from the home of the prospective adopters and placed with other carers. The more difficult question is whether that short-term (which Dr. Young measures as being likely to last for between 6 and 12 months) distress and harm to her attachment security would be followed by longer-term damage in those domains, and specifically in her ability to form new secure relationships.  This possibility has further to be weighed with the risk of long-term harm to A by remaining in her adoptive home when her siblings are within the paternal family, bringing with it feelings of rejection.  There are many unknowns in all these various scenarios; the professionals reminded me that it is no-one&#8217;s practice to remove children from situations where they are receiving care to a very high standard (as here), to place them permanently elsewhere; there is therefore unsurprisingly little if any data (illustrative or otherwise) on which they can usefully draw.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The predictable certainty of short-term emotional harm and trauma would be likely to develop into long-term harm if A fails to establish secure attachments with her grandparents and/or the wider paternal family.  This risk is not quantifiable, but is nonetheless regarded by Dr. Young as a serious possibility that cannot sensibly be ignored.  The evidence suggests to me that her failure to attach may derive from her broken trust in the adult world, profound confusion, and/or the emotional or practical unavailability of a new carer; most likely it would be a combination of these and other factors.  Her distress at the move would be likely to play out (certainly in the early days) as marked challenging behaviour, but this may convert into remote and introvert behaviour as she resigns herself to her new situation. Mrs. Gaskin was concerned that the paternal grandparents may struggle to manage challenging behaviour; Dr Young reminded me that withdrawn behaviour, often subtle but no less significant as an indicator of distress, is often missed by a carer.  Damage to her emotional security in the short-term, certainly if it becomes long-term, could affect her ability to access schooling; at this stage of her life every day, every week, every month is crucial in terms of her emotional development; it can be hard for a child to catch up later in relation to emotional steps missed now.  Dr Young was of the view that one would not really be able to see for 12 months or so what the likely impact of a move had been on A.</p>

Dr. Young was of the view that this risk of harm would be materially moderated by her having contact with her birth family throughout her life: &#8220;if she has some links with her birth family, this can address some of the trauma experienced in adolescence&#8221; (evidence in chief).</p>

They were assessed by Mrs. Gaskin to demonstrate a good understanding of a child&#8217;s basic needs and a positive capacity to parent. They appear to share the caring tasks of their grandson equally, and have many strengths as parents. They are highly motivated to care for A, of that I am certain, and take the view strongly that A should be brought up within her birth family, which is in her best interests throughout her life.  They accept that the prospective adopters have cared well for, and love A, but understandably regard the care available within a natural family as &#8220;irreplaceable&#8221;. They are described as a &#8220;very warm and welcoming couple&#8230; It is very evident that their family is the most important thing in their lives, and it would appear that [they] are at the centre of the family&#8221; (Beth Miller: SGO assessment report). My own assessment of the paternal grandparents entirely accords with that view.  There is no dispute that had the paternal grandparents been identified as potential carers back in May or June 2014, they are likely to have been positively assessed to care for A, though how that would have impacted on their ability to accept subsequently the placement of J in their care is less clear.  </p>

Option 1 contemplates a transition over approximately 4 days, and requires Mr. and/or Mrs. X to participate, a task which Mrs. X has indicated her inability to perform; although Mr. X is more persuadable, he is perhaps not convinced of his ability: &#8220;I would have to put my own heartache on one side&#8221;.  Option 2 contemplates a swift overnight move without any preparation for A; Option 3 contemplates the removal of A from the Xs initially to a bridging foster placement for three to six months before moving on to the paternal grandparents.  Dr. Young and Mr. Richardson advised me that none of these options is in A&#8217;s best interests; it would be necessary therefore to choose the least bad alternative.  Mr. Richardson rather poignantly asked rhetorically &#8220;how can an <span style="font-style:italic">adult</span> say&#8221; which of these options would be the least harmful for a child such as A.  </p>

It would be impossible for the paternal grandparents as much as for the experts to provide reassurance to A in her state of fear, trauma and/or &#8220;enormous distress&#8221; (Mrs. Gaskin) in a situation which she would experience as incomprehensible.

They have offered regular support to the prospective adopters whilst the initial planning of direct contact is undertaken, and also offer a pre- and post-contact briefing around each direct contact session. Additional therapeutic support has also been offered to the prospective adopters.  The Local Authority rationalises the proposal for direct contact as enabling A to develop knowledge, understanding and an ongoing relationship with her birth siblings from an early age, so that her separation from her family is accepted by her as a part of her life.</p>

She told me that the relationship between all of the adults is key to the success of future contact; the adults have to be comfortable with the arrangement.

Doubtless each of them has had to develop strategies of self-preservation to protect themselves from the outcome that A is not ultimately to be in their care. All the adults will have found it hard to be assessed and reassessed, but I sensed that each recognised why this needed to happen; to their great credit, and I believe A&#8217;s ultimate benefit, they have all engaged fully.</p>

She will have little knowledge or recollection of any life which is different; the continuity and high level of care which she has received has nurtured a strong sense of security with these primary attachment figures.  I am influenced too by the knowledge that the paternal grandparents, rightly described by the Guardian as &#8220;child-centred people&#8221;, are currently raising their grandson with evident love and skill; that they would &#8211; I accept &#8211; have been more than likely to have been favourably assessed to care for A had they been considered over two years ago, and had that been so, then A would be living with them now.  Their belief that A would be best placed in their care is both sincere and passionately held.  If A is placed with the grandparents, she would have the considerable additional benefit of being raised in a household with one of her siblings, and in close proximity to the other.</p>

In evaluating the respective cases, it has been necessary to make some informed predictions about the future, conscious of my obligations to consider the issues by reference to A&#8217;s whole future life.

This may have significant implications for her sense of identity and self-esteem.  This risk, if it materialises, will not arise for a number of years.

No question is raised about short-term harm; it is assessed as being inevitable.  The professionals spoke of the serious possibility of medium-term and long-term emotional and psychological damage to A by the traumatic severing of the secure attachments which she has formed with the Xs, with the consequent risk of disruption to her placement if these risks materialise and are not adequately addressed.  Dr. Young opined that &#8220;a significant move such as this at this stage of her development <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">will have</span> a significant detrimental impact on her, of which the long term consequences would be uncertain, and thus any decision must proceed with this knowledge in mind&#8221; (emphasis by underlining added).  While I am satisfied that there would be no shortage of love, and willingness on the part of the paternal grandparents to assuage the evident hurt for A in the event of a move, which may help A to some extent, the ability (or inability) of the adults around A to address the risk of deeper damage would be affected by a combination of the following factors:</p>

They have maintained contact with the foster carers who looked after A for her first seven months, allowing A to develop a real appreciation of her life-journey; I felt that this ability to embrace wider aspects of A&#8217;s life would be likely to carry through into an ability to involve the birth family in A&#8217;s life. They have developed in their own adoption &#8216;journey&#8217; to a position of accepting direct contact between A and her birth family.  The risk that A may develop a sense of rejection may be further mitigated by it being explained to her as she grows older &#8211; when the language <span style="font-style:italic">would then be available</span> to explain what has happened to her in a way which an adolescent will understand &#8211; that the difference between her situation and her brothers is not about <span style="font-style:italic">her</span>, but about the context and circumstances in which they each respectively began their lives. </p>

This indeed adds a new and important dimension to this difficult case.  The proposal to <span style="font-style:italic">introduce</span> a relationship between an adopted child and her birth family <span style="font-style:italic">after</span> adoption by way of direct contact is in my own experience unique.  I was not at all surprised to hear from the adoption team manager that it was unprecedented in this authority&#8217;s experience, and in the experience of Barnardo&#8217;s (with their wealth of adoption knowledge) whom they consulted on the issue.  This proposal reflects the resourcefulness of all those involved &#8211; coupled with the creativity of the professionals, and the selflessness of the proposed adopters &#8211; to divine an outcome for A which best meets her needs.   As I have indicated above, if contact were to happen in the way proposed, it would be likely to play a highly material part in neutralising A&#8217;s possible sense of rejection by her birth family, while remaining in the Xs care, at the stage of her development when she is considering more maturely the difficult issues around her identity.   </p>

Its purpose would be principally to forge a link between A and her birth family, and between the families more widely, and to dispel for A any sense that she has been abandoned or unwanted by her birth family.  In these respects, it would hopefully enhance and clarify her identity.  The context is equally important: at present A is only aware in a rather notional sense of the existence of a birth family, her awareness deriving from the photographs and limited narrative in the life-story book prepared by the adopters; she has no current relationship whatsoever with any member of that family.  Those considerations each individually, but certainly collectively, drive me to the conclusion that direct contact would most appropriately be set at a low frequency (i.e. initially of twice per year), on the basis that it could be increased if shown to be successful.  </p>

Drawing all of these powerful factors together, I have reached the clear conclusion that it is in A&#8217;s best interests that she should live with Mr. and Mrs. X, where she has established solid, loving, and secure emotional foundations; from that &#8216;secure base&#8217; she will be able in a wider and more general sense (as she did in a more limited and specific sense when Dr. Young visited her home earlier this year) to explore the world, and importantly with confidence explore and embrace new relationships, including those with her birth family.

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.49in">On the basis of such a recording, I cannot conclude that it would be better for A that I make an order.  Indeed, it would be better for A to know that her adoptive parents were able to agree wholeheartedly with the proposal for contact without the need for court intervention.   I am further concerned that a court order may prove to be inflexible &#8211; however it be worded &#8211; to meet the demands of a rather uncertain arrangement. I have regard to what was said by Dame Elizabeth Butler Sloss P in <span style="font-style:italic">Re T (Adoption: Contact)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 2 FLR 251" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 2 FLR 251</ref>:</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.49in">In many ways, as Jackson LJ inferred at [95] of the judgment at <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2016/793" uk:canonical="[2016] EWCA Civ 793" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWCA Civ 793</ref>, the facilitation of contact for A with her birth family, while maintaining the security of a placement in her adoptive family, has leant itself well to supporting the outcome which is likely in my judgment to serve A&#8217;s emotional needs best now and in the future. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Inevitably, as much as this outcome will provide great joy to the Xs, it will generate profound disappointment to the paternal grandparents and their family, exacerbated doubtless by the fact that in the earlier litigation they secured the outcome for which they contended.  They have plainly done all they can to advance their claim to care for and raise their granddaughter; this is significantly to A&#8217;s advantage as their important role, and the role of their family, will now be reflected in the establishing of a relationship with A through contact, from which I trust all will mutually benefit.</p>
