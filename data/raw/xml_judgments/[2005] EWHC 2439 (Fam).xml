	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Eileen D (Ms D) is a woman of thirty-two. She lies critically ill in the W Centre for Neurology and Neuro-surgery in the North of England. She suffers from the most horrible of genetic neurological illnesses. It is a terminal condition known as mitochondrial cytopathy. In her case also it has attacked her brain and has caused her to have continuous epileptic seizures without recovery in between. By about four months ago her condition had stabilised but deteriorated to the extent that all her doctors and other medical experts said that she was in a vegetative state and probably had no awareness of any kind. That remains the situation today. They say there is no prospect of improvement or recovery. Accordingly they say that in their opinion it is not in Ms D&#8217;s best interests to try and prolong her life if, for example, either her breathing fails or she suffers cardiac arrest or contracts a potentially life threatening infection which would normally be treated by antibiotics. The NHS Trust ask the court to declare that it is not in Ms D&#8217;s interests to take these, and other invasive steps given her current condition.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms D&#8217;s parents, seven of her other relatives and her partner disagree. They have visited and continue to visit Eileen in hospital. They say that Ms D does have some awareness; on occasions she recognizes them and communicates with them by blinking or squeezing of her hand or similar sign. They say she is a fighter and that miracles do happen. Accordingly they oppose the doctors doing or declining to do anything which might not prolong her life for as long as possible. Every possible step and intervention should be taken they say.</p>

The doctors assert that Ms D will die in any event within about twelve months. The doctors further assert that if artificial ventilation were to be initiated the situation would soon be reached where a decision had to be taken to discontinue it. That would be a decision which was even more difficult to contemplate than the one which now faces the Court, the effect of discontinuance of ventilation being awful both for the patient, the family and the medical staff. </p>

So far as the expert medical evidence was concerned I have had statements from Dr. E, a consultant neurologist, dated 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2005. Dr E was Ms D&#8217;s treating neurologist for 6 months up to 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September of this year. I have also had statements from Professor C, the treating consultant neurologist since the 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2005. He has provided statements dated 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2005, 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2005 and 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2005. I have also had a letter from Dr H and Dr E dated 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2005 and a further report from Dr Schady, another consultant neurologist, dated 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2005. Finally I have had a report from an expert consultant neurologist instructed by the Official Solicitor, Dr Newman. His report is dated 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2005. In addition to the expert evidence provided by these five consultant neurologists I have a joint report drawn up by Dr Schady and Dr Newman following a discussion which took place between them on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> October 2005. All the reports to which I have made reference are contained in the bundle of papers specifically prepared for this application. Apart from this written medical evidence I heard orally from both Professor C, Dr Schady and Dr Newman. So that was the extensive medical evidence which was provided to the Court.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However I have also had numerous statements from members of Ms D&#8217;s family. Statements from her father (on behalf of himself and her mother), brother, sister-in-law, sister, uncle, aunt and another cousin have all been provided to me. I have read them with great care.

Tragically Ms D&#8217;s younger brother died from MC aged 17 in August 2003 at the Hospital, after 4 months of repeated seizures. In 2004 Ms D&#8217;s condition worsened significantly: from June 2004 she had problems with her balance and often staggered when walking and in the Autumn/Winter 2004 she required repeated in patient admissions for prolonged seizures.</p>

She now shows no evidence whatsoever of any response to any outside stimuli other that reflex responses such as constriction of her pupils to shining a light in them. In particular there is no response that indicates any reaction to the outside world. This is the view of myself, another consultant neurologist (Dr H), the junior doctors who see her day by day, and also the nursing staff who care for her completely 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In essence she lies in bed, constantly twitching in various parts of her head, neck and upper body, and it is unfortunate that, as I understand it, her family misinterpret this twitching as voluntary actions (especially those around her eyes and mouth). However I have attended her bedside whilst her father has tried to demonstrate to the nursing sister and me any responsiveness to his voice or presence and to me none was demonstrable. Her father has since agreed with me that she did not respond to his presence. All movements occur whoever is present or indeed if she is observed from afar, at all times of day and night. In my clinical opinion this twitching and jerking is due to epileptic discharges in her brain and occurs continually and completely independently of any external stimuli etc.&#8221;</p>

She had no startle to a sudden loud sound, the pupils were moderately dilated and responded sluggishly to a light stimulus. There was continuous facial myoclonic activity which also involved tongue and the left hand. There was ocular bobbing in synchrony with the facial myoclonus. There was no response to firm pressure applied to the forehead or to each limb in turn. Although the eyelids flickered with the myoclonus there was no additional blinking when the eyelashes were stimulated. There was a cough response on deep tracheal suctioning. The jaw reflex was very brisk, there was no tendon reflexes in the limbs. The limbs were flaccid and there was no limb movement other than the myoclonic activity of the left arm. Plantar stimulation produced no response. It was noted that the limb myoclonus was left sided whereas previously this had been recorded as right sided. Other than this point there was no difference in the current examination when compared with the clinical features documented in recent weeks in the medical notes. Ms D showed the appearance of a vegetative state with superimposed myoclonus.&#8221;</p>

In my experience of many previous patients in this condition it has often been the case that non-sentient reflex activity is misrepresented by the family members as indicating a purposeful response. The medical notes and the nursing observations of Ms D contain many references to sentient responses until the period in June when the further deterioration arose. Since that time the highly experienced staff have failed to identify any sentient response despite the multiple evaluations on a daily basis. While I have every sympathy with the family who will have been desperately seeking signs of possible recovery I must regrettably conclude that Ms D has not shown any meaningful responsiveness for several weeks and the observations of the family have misinterpreted basal reflex responses and myoclonic activity.&#8221;</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.38in">This case evokes some of the fundamental principles that undergird our humanity. They are not to be found in Acts of Parliament or decisions of the courts but in the deep recesses of the common psyche of humanity whether they be attributed to humanity being created in the image of God or whether it be simply a self-defining ethic of a generally acknowledged humanism. It is powerfully captured in the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Hoffman LJ in the <span style="font-style:italic">Bland</span> case <span style="font-family:Arial">&#8211;</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">Airedale NHS Trust </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">&#8211;</span><span style="font-style:italic">v- Bland <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1993] AC 789" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1993">[1993] AC 789</ref></span>.

		  <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.38in">"I start with the concept of the sanctity of life <span style="font-family:Arial">&#8230;</span> [W]e have a strong feeling that there is an intrinsic value in human life, irrespective of whether it is valuable to the person concerned or indeed to anyone else. Those who adhere to religious faiths which believe in the sanctity of all God's creation and in particular that human life was created in the image of God himself will have no difficulty with the concept of the intrinsic value of human life. But even those without any religious belief think in the same way. In a case like this we should not try to analyse the rationality of such feelings. What matters is that, in one form or another, they form part of almost everyone's intuitive values. No law which ignores them can possibly hope to be acceptable. </p>

	      <subparagraph>
		<content>
		  <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.38in">Our belief in the sanctity of life explains why we think it is almost always wrong to cause the death of another human being, even one who is terminally ill or so disabled that we think that if we were in his position we would rather be dead. Still less do we tolerate laws such as existed in Nazi Germany, by which handicapped people or inferior races could be put to death because someone else thought that their lives were useless. </p>

		<content>
		  <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.38in">But the sanctity of life is only one of a cluster of ethical principles which we apply to decisions about how we should live. Another is respect for the individual human being and in particular for his right to choose how he should live his own life. We call this individual autonomy or the right of self-determination. And another principle, closely connected, is respect for the dignity of the individual human being: our belief that quite irrespective of what the person concerned may think about it, it is wrong for someone to be humiliated or treated without respect for his value as a person. The fact that the dignity of an individual is an intrinsic value is shown by the fact that we feel embarrassed and think it wrong when someone behaves in a way which we think demeaning to himself, which does not show sufficient respect for himself as a person"</p>

		  <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.38in;text-indent:0.12in">"There can be no doubt in my mind that the evaluation of best interests is akin to a welfare appraisal. <span style="font-family:Arial">&#8230;</span> Pending the enactment of a checklist or other statutory direction it seems to me that the first instance judge with the responsibility to make an evaluation of the best interests of a claimant lacking capacity should draw up a balance sheet. The first entry should be of any factor or factors of actual benefit. In the present case the instance would be the acquisition of foolproof contraception. Then on the other sheet the judge should write any counterbalancing dis-benefits to the applicant. An obvious instance in this case would be the apprehension, the risk and the discomfort inherent in the operation. Then the judge should enter on each sheet the potential gains and losses in each instance making some estimate of the extent of the possibility that the gain or loss might accrue. At the end of that exercise the judge should be better placed to strike a balance between the sum of the certain and possible gains against the sum of the certain and possible losses. Obviously, only if the account is in relatively significant credit will the judge conclude that the application is likely to advance the best interests of the claimant."</p>

In summary, the test is &#8220;best interests&#8221; which are interpreted more broadly than &#8220;medical interests&#8221; and include emotional and other factors.  There is a strong presumption in favour of preserving life, but not where treatment would be futile, and there is no obligation on the medical profession to give treatment which would be futile.  I agree with Hedley J that the court should be focusing on best interests rather than the concept of intolerability although the latter may be encompassed within the former.</p>
