I would urge the parents in this case to continue with the resource. Whilst the court is always there to make decisions it is recognised that in appropriate cases decisions about children reached with the agreement of both parents often have a more secure and enduring quality than those after long drawn out litigation.  </p>

She met the father here in 2012, returned back to the US later that year, returning here in September 2013 following the parent&#8217;s engagement in the US. The mother came here with her daughter E, then age 9, but returned to the US with E in November 2013. The parties dispute the reasons; the father says due to financial pressure the mother alleges the father sought to pressure her to have an abortion.  The mother did not return to the UK until August 2014 following their wedding in the US. By then T was 6 months old.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The parents lived together with the two children until October 2016, when they separated. The mother alleges domestic abuse and went to a refuge with the children. The father denies any abusive behaviour. The father sought an order in November for disclosure of the child&#8217;s whereabouts and a prohibited steps order preventing the mother from removing the child from the jurisdiction. Those orders were granted by DJ Harrison. The mother sought non-molestation orders and that application was resolved by undertakings in January 2017. The father&#8217;s application came before the court on 1 February 2017 when DJ Jones adjourned the matter until 22 April 2017 pending further evidence regarding the parents mental and physical health via their GPs. </p>

The mother wished to return to the US for E to receive medical treatment, to be near her birth father and for them all to have the support of the wider maternal family. The father did not agree to T going, resulting in the mother making an application to the court. The mother was unrepresented, the father and the child were legally represented.  </p>

The order records the application as (a) the applicant has applied for a child arrangements order (CAO) and permission to extend paragraph 13 of the order dated 6 March 2017 and the child&#8217;s removal permanently from the jurisdiction to the US and (b) the father seeks a CAO and in the alternative shared care/defined contact order. The order also records the father&#8217;s continuing agreement until the next hearing for T to remain in the US and twice weekly skype calls are recorded as being agreed. The local authority were directed to attend the next hearing on 26 March 2018. That hearing was further adjourned twice as the parents were seeking public funding for legal representation and was next effectively listed on 17 May 2018. The Children&#8217;s Guardian made a part 25 application for an expert assessment on 17 May, to instruct a psychologist in the light of the information that had been filed by the mother with her application in December which set out that the child was suffering from stress. The purpose of the report was to determine whether the child&#8217;s presentation is as a result of his current situation or whether there are any underlying psychological issues, as well as assessing the child&#8217;s relationship and attachment with each parent. UK based psychologists were put forward who could report within 13 to 22 weeks. </p>

The mother was in person and joined the hearing by telephone, the father attended in person and the child was represented. The local authority attended and are recorded as stating they were unable to undertake any assessment if the child remained out of the jurisdiction.  The parties were directed to file any revised applications and statement by 11 June 2018 addressing the child&#8217;s interim placement. The matter was listed for a contested hearing to consider the child&#8217;s interim placement and whether the mother should continue to be given permission for the child to remain in the US.  </p>

It would be contrary to T&#8217;s best interests for litigation to determine his welfare to be conducted in a jurisdiction so far away from his day to day life. The father&#8217;s future involvement in T&#8217;s life and the mother&#8217;s ability to support that can be fully determined within litigation to determine these issues in the US.

She doesn&#8217;t specifically address the issue of habitual residence but submits this case has proceeded, until very recently, on the basis that this court has jurisdiction. It was expressly conceded in the recitals to the orders made in March 2017 that this court retained jurisdiction. The mother made her application to extend the leave in December 2017 and, in effect, submitted and acceded to this court&#8217;s jurisdiction until July 2018.
