Although he is eligible for criminal legal aid and both I and Mr Justice Holman have made considerable efforts to encourage F to instruct solicitors again he has declined that opportunity. He is currently serving a prison sentence for contempt of court and his release date is 4 May 2018.  He is fully aware of the seriousness of the allegations made. He is aware of the availability of solicitors and counsel to represent him. He has been represented by solicitors and counsel previously, most recently in November 2017.  It is entirely his choice not to be represented now. There is no breach of his Article 6 ECHR rights in relation to these committal proceedings by proceeding without his having legal representation. V has criminal legal aid and is represented by solicitors and by Mr Lue of counsel, that all having been put in place in a matter of a couple of days following his arrest.   </p>

As litigant in person he ought to have been served 3 days before the hearing. F himself then produced a number of documents which neither Mr Hepher nor the court had seen before. These facts raise issues which I shall return to in respect of litigants in person and serving prisoners. The documents F produced  included</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">After adjourning to enable all parties to digest the documents produced late by the other I commenced hearing the case. I refused F&#8217;s application to recuse myself and refused his application to dismiss the proceedings on the basis that they were based on fraud.  I gave a judgment on those. I also addressed the question of the disclosure of the telephone transcripts to the Home Office concluding that this was a matter for the court to consider after any committal proceedings against V had concluded.  I had to adjourn the hearing of the permission application and timetabling because F had quite properly raised an objection to any reliance being placed on the transcripts on the grounds that they had been obtained in breach of the terms of a court order and he submitted that evidence improperly or illegally obtained could not found or be admitted into evidence in committal proceedings which are criminal in nature. He asserted that they had been obtained dishonestly and by deceit and that the contents of the transcripts had been deliberately and dishonestly manipulated. Neither Mr Hepher or F had addressed the law on this subject in their documents. Given that the test for permission requires the court to consider the strength of the evidence in support, and the telephone transcripts were the only evidence on which the Grounds rested if it was inadmissible it followed that permission would not be granted. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I therefore adjourned the application for permission and case-management part-heard to 27 March 2018. By chance it turned out that V was not as F said he believed, being held in Nigeria. He arrived in the UK by air on Thursday, was arrested on the warrant at the airport and appeared in custody before me as the Urgent Applications Judge. He was represented. I released him (on conditions) and directed that he attend the part-heard hearing; in particular to deal with the issues relating to the admissibility of the transcript evidence.  Mr Lue appeared today and provided me with a very helpful Position Statement on the law relating to the admissibility of the transcript evidence. Mr Perkins who took over from Mr Hepher also produced a very helpful Skeleton Argument on the admissibility of evidence and permission issues. In the meantime given F had put in issue the circumstances in which the transcripts were obtained Ms Bennett, M&#8217;s solicitor had produced a statement setting out how it came about they were provided.  Mr Perkins Skeleton and Ms Bennett&#8217;s evidence had been provided to F the day before by means of a legal visit being booked to see F, it not being possible to ensure he received them by post due to delays in post to prisoners being processed.  F also then produced several more documents including a Position Statement, further documents to support his application to purge his contempt, a further document related to the &#8216;fraudulent&#8217; argument and a complaint addressed to the President of the Family Division against me. I returned the &#8216;fraudulent&#8217; document unread as I had determined that application last week and I passed on the complaint to the President.  </p>

I had hoped that it would be possible for V&#8217;s team to at least engage in the case in respect of the admissibility of the transcript evidence but Mr Lue was able to persuade me that V&#8217;s team had really not had a proper opportunity to prepare.

The court must balance all the circumstances including the relevance of the evidence and the effect of its exclusion.  There may be cases where the behaviour of the person obtaining the evidence was so outrageous that the case based on it should be struck out.

Please see attached.&#8217;</span> The author of the e-mail was a para-legal. Ms Bennetts evidence was that when she discussed the response with the para-legal she was working on the assumption that the order authorised the release of the transcripts. She said she did not go back to the order to check its precise wording but assumed because the prison had said they could have the recordings that that was what the order authorised. She accepted in evidence that she was mistaken in her belief about what the order provided for. She said she did not realise the transcripts had been provided not in compliance with the order until F&#8217;s solicitors pointed it out on 13 December 2017.</p>

Ms Bennett accepted that it was a failure on her part. She appeared, rightly, somewhat embarrassed that this had happened on her watch. F put it to her that it was a deliberate attempt to mislead the prison and to get evidence by improper means. She denied this and pointed out that there was nothing to be gained in doing so as the court would almost certainly have approved the obtaining of the recordings that had been sought. </p>

Each of those categories require the permission of the court to pursue. The procedure is set out in FPR 37.15. In respect of making a false statement FPR 37.17(4) enables the court to refer the matter to the Attorney-General with a request that he consider whether to bring committal proceedings. The test for granting permission (in the context of false statements) was considered by the Court of Appeal in KJM Superbikes Limited-v-Hinton <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2009] 1 WLR 2406" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] 1 WLR 2406</ref>.

F&#8217;s track record in absconding and then in not returning the children during the 3 years he was in Nigeria are directly counter to the contention that his release would enable him to make efforts to secure their return.  Only by securing their return now is he likely to be able to purge his contempt. Ensuring that Cafcass have access to the children to speak to them or enabling a representative in Nigeria to do so might provide some foundation. I therefore refuse F&#8217;s application to purge his contempt.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Firstly F had not been provided with M&#8217;s Position Statement well in advance of the hearing. Mr Justice Peter Jackson (as he then was) emphasised in Re B (Litigants in Person: Timely Service of Documents) <span class="case"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2016/2365" uk:canonical="[2016] EWHC 2365 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWHC 2365 (Fam)</ref></span> the need for Litigants in person to be provided with documents in good time in order to ensure a fair hearing. This seems to give rise to particular difficulties where the Litigant is a serving prisoner as I was told that post can be delayed by several days for screening and that only by booking a legal visit can documents be provided. This seems to be a considerable waste of funds and I intend to explore this issue further through the Family Justice Council and the FPR Rules Committee.  For the future good management of this case though M&#8217;s solicitors should take steps to ensure that F has the relevant documents in good time for hearing even if this means booking legal visits to deliver them. Until a different and equally effective way is devised of getting  the documents to him adopting this approach will allow that to happen. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Secondly F himself produced his documents at court when produced from the cells. Again it seems to me that a more effective mechanism for ensuring that a serving prisoner Litigant in person &#8211; of whom there are a significant number &#8211; is able to provide documents in advance is needed. It may be that M&#8217;s team will also need to collect F&#8217;s documents from him the day before the hearing or it may be possible for a direction to be made to the prison to ensure that F is able to have his document transmitted to M and the Court the day prior to the hearing. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">Thirdly F produced a significant number of documents which could be characterised as applications, witness statements (from himself and others) position statements and other species of documents.  In <span class="Strong" style="font-weight:normal;color:#272727">Barton v Wright Hassall LLP</span><span style="color:#272727"> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2018/12" uk:canonical="[2018] UKSC 12" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] UKSC 12</ref> </span>Lord Sumption stated that a LIP&#8217;s: &#8220;<span class="Emphasis" style="color:#272727">&#8230;lack of representation will often justify making allowances in making case management decisions and in conducting hearings. But it will not usually justify applying to [LiPs] a lower standard of compliance with rules or orders of the court&#8230; The rules do not in any relevant respect distinguish between represented and unrepresented parties</span>.&#8221;  Lord Sumption further confirmed (in his majority view) that &#8220;<span class="Emphasis" style="color:#272727">Unless the rules and practice directions are particularly inaccessible or obscure, it is reasonable to expect a [LiP] to familiarise himself with the rules which apply to any step which he is about to take.</span>&#8221;   Although said in the context of the CPR the logic applies as much to the FPR. If F wishes to make an application in future I doubt that the court will indulge him to the extent it has so far. Any applications made by F should be made on the correct forms and issued out of the court office in compliance with the FPR. Evidence should be filed and served in accordance with orders made. Fairness to the parties&#8217; cuts both ways; M should know in advance and be able to instruct her team on applications made by F or evidence produced him. </p>
