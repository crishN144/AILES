The account of X being pushed over and hitting his head could explain the acute subdural haematoma although it would be an unusual event in these circumstances.  The appearances of the bleeding do not assist in determining the explanation, and can be explained by a single localised impact to the top of the left cerebral hemisphere.

		  <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Georgia;color:#0E002D">I am particularly concerned about the impact of the fact finding process on J.  I am aware that only J can provide a direct account of the alleged events. The accounts of the Mother and the Father are, necessarily, secondary, rehearsing what J told them of the event itself and describing only the aftermath directly.  The pressure on her of the process would be not inconsiderable.</span></p>
		  <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Georgia;color:#0E002D">J&#8217;s ability to give a clear and coherent account of the events may be affected not only by her own limitations &#8211; such as they are &#8211; but also by the shock and panic associated by being in the vicinity of the events.  </span></p>
		  <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Georgia;color:#0E002D">I have been told that J has already been advised that she may well not have to give evidence; whether that was sensible is a moot point given that this decision was not yet available, but I nonetheless note that she was described as &#8220;buoyant&#8221; to discover that she may well be spared the process of recounting her events to the court, however sympathetically we were to arrange that for her</span></p>

If the tribunal is left in doubt, the doubt is resolved by a rule that one party or the other carries the burden of proof. If the party who bears the burden of proof fails to discharge it, a value of&#160;zero is returned and the fact is treated as not having happened.

It is apparent from all that I have read that the social workers have worked conscientiously, not always in the easiest of circumstances, in the interests of the children.  The court is, and the family should be, indebted to them for that. </span></p>

My judgment does not of course deal in any measure with the more historic concerns; it cannot do so, as I have heard no evidence about this, and could not make findings.  While those concerns were never regarded as sufficient to support a contention that the threshold criteria were established, they did nonetheless register reasonably high on the index of concern with the local authority, and they register similarly high with me.  </span></p>

Going forward, I hope that the parents will look to professionals for support, where appropriate, when they may be struggling with the demands of their children and particularly in the more challenging phases of their development.  They have indicated a willingness to follow up investigations for A in relation to his medical presentation &#8211; variously considered at times to be cerebral palsy, but perhaps now felt to be more likely dyspraxia &#8211; and I encourage them to do so.</span></p>
