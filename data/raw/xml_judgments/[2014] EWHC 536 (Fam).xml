It is my view that rule 27.10 does not create a presumption that hearings of this kind should be held in private, but merely a starting point.  There is a huge legitimate public interest in open justice in family cases, just as much as in criminal, or in civil cases.  I&#160;mention that I&#160;gave to both leading counsel the opportunity at the very outset of the hearing to object or submit that the case should not be heard in public.  Neither chose to do so.  As a result, journalists have been present throughout most of this hearing and currently.</span></p>

The only exceptions have been brief periods when, for one reason or another, they were not able to be present.  I&#160;wish to stress, however, and this is very important indeed, that even if I&#160;had not decided to hold the present hearing in public, I&#160;would unquestionably have exercised a discretion not only to permit, but indeed positively to invite, each of Mr&#160;Mike Luckwell and Mrs.&#160;Mary Luckwell to attend and be present if they wished to do so.  That is my invariable practice in cases of this kind since, in my view, family cases particularly intimately concern close family members.  That is especially the situation in the present case when it is crystal clear that the entirety of the assets under discussion in this case have derived originally and ultimately from one or other or both of the wife&#8217;s parents, namely, Mr&#160;Mike Luckwell and Mrs.&#160;Mary Luckwell.</span></p>

Mr&#160;Lewis Marks QC is about to commence his cross-examination of the wife herself.  He has now made an application that for part of that cross-examination, which he estimates as about the first third of it, I&#160;should now exercise a discretion to exclude the wife&#8217;s father, Mr&#160;Mike Luckwell, from being present in court whilst that part of the cross-examination takes place.  Interestingly, neither Mr&#160;Marks QC nor his exceptionally diligent and experienced junior, Miss&#160;Marina Faggionato, have been able to identify any rule of the Civil Procedure Rules or any passage in The White Book which makes any comment upon, or reference at all to, the presence of one prospective witness in the courtroom while another witness gives evidence.  </span></p>

When the proceedings are being heard in private, rule 27.11(2) and (3) make reference to who may or may not be present in the courtroom.  Rule 27.11(2) provides:</span></p>

Rule 27.11(3) does not refer back to persons falling within paragraphs (e) nor (g).  To my mind, for the purposes of rule 27.11(2), the reference in subparagraph (e) to &#8220;a witness&#8221; is clearly a reference to a person during the actual time when he or she is within the courtroom for the purpose of actually giving evidence as a witness.  If such a person is permitted to be present in the courtroom during other parts of the hearing, whether before or after he or she gives evidence, then it is pursuant to paragraph (g) as &#8220;any other person whom the court permits to be present&#8221;.  So it does not, in the end, seem to me that any help at all is derived from those parts of rule 27.11.</span></p>

That authority was an appeal from a procedural decision of a magistrates&#8217; court hearing an application to vary, by reducing, the amount of a magistrates&#8217; court maintenance order.  On the facts of that particular case, no application at all had been made to exclude the man with whom the wife concerned was said to be cohabiting and by whom she was said to be being maintained.  But when the wife, who was acting in person, sought to call him as a witness to rebut the suggestion that they were cohabiting or that he was maintaining her, the magistrates refused to allow her to do so, on the basis or grounds that he had, meantime, been sitting in the courtroom.  It is hardly surprising that the divisional court very clearly and roundly criticised that decision of the magistrates, since the magistrates had been sitting in public and there had not been the slightest direction or indication from the court that the man should be excluded from the courtroom during the course of the earlier evidence.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">That seems to me, with respect, to be clearly right.  I&#160;cannot see that there can be any rational grounds for distinction, depending on whether a case is being pursued in the magistrates&#8217; court (now family proceedings court) or in the civil courts, for instance, the county court or indeed civil divisions of the High Court, or in this court.  In any such court, and indeed in any class of case, once the court is sitting in public the broad approach to the exercise of discretion should be the same.  Sir John Arnold put it that &#8220;the proper course for justices to pursue &#8230; would be to exclude the witnesses, unless they were satisfied that that would not be an appropriate step to take &#8230;&#8221;  Speaking for myself, and respectful of that decision but mindful that it is not binding upon me, my own feeling is that the approach should be the other way round.  If a court is, in fact, sitting in public, and if an application is made to exclude a witness or witnesses, then the court may exclude them.   But it should only exclude them if the court is satisfied, on the facts and in the circumstances of the particular situation, that it would, for good reasons, be an appropriate step to take.   The threshold may not be a high one. The reason may not need to be a very cogent one. But if a court is sitting in public, no one who wishes to be present should be excluded, not even a witness, without some good reason for doing so. I&#160;propose to apply that approach and direct to myself in that way in making the present ruling.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">As I&#160;have already mentioned, it is patent in this case that all the current assets of these parties, which, in fact, are almost entirely currently owned and in the hands of the wife, have been derived from the considerable generosity of her own parents.  Further than that, the current situation is that her own parents are currently supporting the wife and the children by payments in excess of &#163;100,000 a year when the payment of school fees is included.  The greater part of those payments is being made by the wife&#8217;s father, but substantial payments are also being made by her mother.  Some years ago, the father voluntarily gave to the wife a very valuable house in Connaught Square, London W2, which currently has an equity of about &#163;6.7 million.  Effectively, it is the equity in that house which is the only asset of significance in this case.  Part of the context of the whole case and of that gift is that the husband signed a prenuptial agreement and, later, two supplementary agreements, in all of which he agreed, in effect, that in the event of separation and divorce he would make no claim at all against the assets of the wife.  The governing prenuptial agreement clearly recites that each of the husband and wife &#8220;specifically acknowledges and agrees that the marriage would not be taking place without this agreement having been negotiated and signed by each of them&#8221;.  Further, it is the case of the wife that there would have been no question of her father giving Connaught Square to her, or indeed money with which to buy earlier properties, unless the husband had first signed not only that prenuptial agreement but also each of the supplemental agreements.  That is clearly a very significant feature of this case.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Separately and distinctly, but in conjunction with the fact of the prenuptial and supplemental agreements, the wife and her father both say that at the time of the transfer of Connaught Square to her she gave to him a promise that she would never sell it, charge it or raise money upon it, at any rate without his consent.  It is at the moment stated by the father in a written statement that, in the event that the wife is now effectively forced to sell or even raise money secured upon that property, he will completely terminate all the payments that he currently makes for the support of his daughter and grandchildren and for their school fees.  That, of course, may have a profound impact upon the outcome of this case; for if what he says is true, it will mean that if this house is sold or even mortgaged the support for the wife and children and payment of their school fees will be very significantly reduced, even if the wife&#8217;s mother takes a more generous view and continues, herself, to provide some funding.  The implications of that are, of course, that, in that event, provision will have to be identified from the equity of Connaught Square not only for housing needs but also for the long-term income needs of the wife and children, including school fees.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The husband has already given evidence.  During the course of his evidence he did agree that, before the date of the actual transfer of Connaught Square to him, his wife told him that she had promised her father that she would not sell it or mortgage or otherwise charge it without his consent.  That much now appears to be common ground.  There are, however, wider areas where the evidence at the moment is potentially in conflict or, at any rate, less clear as to what discussions may have taken place more directly between Mr&#160;Mike Luckwell and the husband and/or conversations taken place in the hearing of Mrs&#160;Mary Luckwell.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Further, it is plain that in this very anxious situation there is a need to have some exploration as to the true intentions of the father, Mr&#160;Mike Luckwell, which, in turn, may involve consideration of his motivation when he extracted whatever promises he did extract.  There is also another issue in the case which requires further illumination.  It is the fact that some time after the transfer of Connaught Square to her, the wife did, apparently voluntarily, make some very substantial payments back to her father and, separately, to her brother Adam so as, as it was put, &#8220;to level up with him&#8221;.  I, at this stage of the case and evidence, accept that that is a topic which Mr&#160;Marks QC, on behalf of the husband, may wish legitimately to explore with each of the wife and her father.</span></p>

Interestingly, Mr&#160;Charles Howard QC, in opposing the application, stresses that it is of importance to the appearance of justice to his client that her father should not be excluded from any part of the hearing.  I, for my part, am less focused for the purposes of this particular ruling on the appearance of justice to either of these parties than on the quality, purity and reliability of the evidence which I&#160;have still to hear.  There are potentially issues of fact here upon which the evidence is, to my mind, still obscure.  To my mind, the evidence of each of the wife and, more particularly, her father will have greater value as evidence if the father is not present while she gives the relevant part of her evidence and is not able to hear at the time what she has said before giving his own evidence.</span></p>

But, of course, Mr&#160;Mike Luckwell is in a different position from everybody else in the world and in a different position from the journalists, because he, unlike them, is himself going to be a witness of fact on important issues in this case.  I&#160;readily recognise his very, very genuine and legitimate interest in the outcome of this case and indeed in all that takes place in the courtroom.  I&#160;have welcomed him in.  I&#160;am very, very glad that he and Mrs&#160;Mary Luckwell have been present so far for virtually the whole of this hearing.  I&#160;hope, apart from this short period, that they will continue to be present.  I&#160;am genuinely appreciative of the close attention that each of them has patently been paying to these proceedings.  I&#160;have many times begged these parties to try to settle this case.  I&#160;have now afforded several opportunities by adjournments in order to enable them to do so, and I&#160;am perfectly aware that one of the realities of this case is that decisions voluntarily made by Mr&#160;Mike Luckwell could make it more or less easy for his daughter, the wife, to find a way through to settlement.  So there is no doubt that he is somebody who is, to put it colloquially, &#8220;centre stage&#8221;.   But it does seem to me, on balance, that the evidence of each of the wife and, later, of Mr&#160;Mike Luckwell is likely to be of greater value as evidence and to carry greater weight if he is not present while she gives her evidence on the topics that I&#160;have outlined.</span></p>
