	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On the evening of Friday 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2020, whilst on duty as the Out of Hours Judge, I received an application on behalf of Barnsley Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. The application, presented by Ms Dolan QC, related to MSP, a 34-year-old man with a complicated abdominal history which has caused him to have significant gastrointestinal problems for approximately 10 years. The issue framed in the application is whether the Trust should continue to provide ITU support or withdraw treatment other than palliative care.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Historically, it has not been possible to join the Official Solicitor in these urgent Out of Hours applications. The offices of the Official Solicitor have not been able to identify the resources to facilitate it. Ms Sarah Castle has, since her appointment as Official Solicitor, been determined to remedy this situation. As of last week, she is now able to provide Out of Hours cover for serious medical treatment cases, personally supported by a number of senior members of her team. This application is the first time the Official Solicitor has been called upon in these circumstances and I should like to express my gratitude to her. I should also add that I have found her involvement to be helpful and, I have noticed that the family of MSP have plainly welcomed her input.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">For more than a decade MSP has had painful and complex abdominal problems. In July 2013 he had a gastric ulcer which required a laparotomy and significant care in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) afterwards. The primary gastroenterology diagnosis is unclear but MSP has experienced bleeding from the bowel, chronic abdominal pain and poor absorption of nutrients.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In October 2019, MSP underwent surgery where an ileostomy was formed. There was a significant prolapse in February 2020, which it is clear MSP found to be very distressing. At MSP&#8217;s request the stoma was reversed on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2020. Though I will develop this, in my reasoning below, it requires to be recorded here that MSP utterly loathed life with a stoma.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Following surgery MSP returned home to his mother and father, where he has lived throughout his life, apart from his time at university. Sadly, but not entirely unsurprisingly, as I read the evidence, MSP returned to the hospital a few days later with very significant abdominal pain and sepsis. There was also acute distention of the abdomen. A CT scan was undertaken, revealing an obstruction of the small bowel and a drain was inserted which released three litres of faecal fluid. MSP&#8217;s position was plainly very grave. Mr M, who is the consultant gastroenterological surgeon on duty, responsible for MSP&#8217;s care at this admission, impressed upon his patient that his condition was life threatening and that he required a stoma to be formed immediately. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">There is no doubt that MSP expressed his consent to the stoma being inserted. This consent however seemed entirely contrary to his unambiguous rejection of the stoma, expressed bluntly to three consultants with whom he had discussed it. It also appeared entirely inconsistent with everything he had said to his mother, father and step-sister on the point. Significantly, on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2020 MSP had written a carefully crafted Advance Directive which he had copied to his parents and to his step-sister. Outside the hospital setting these were the only three people who knew MSP had a stoma. He did not even wish his grandmother to be told. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Many people require a stoma to be fitted and I have no doubt that the vast majority make the necessary accommodations to ensure that it does not unnecessarily inhibit their enjoyment of life or become an impediment to their personal and sexual relationships. However, this was simply not the case with MSP. There is powerful evidence that as a young man in his thirties who, as his sister has said, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;knew he was good looking&#8221;,</span> MSP could never accept life with a stoma. No amount of support, love or understanding could change MSP&#8217;s mind. The stoma, it seems to me, ran entirely contrary to MSP&#8217;s perception of who he is. Its existence was corrosive to his selfesteem.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">A further illustration of the care and thought that went into the document is demonstrated by the meticulous detail relating to music to be played in the event that MSP fell into a coma. In her evidence, his mother told me that MSP had described to her violent and frightening dreams when he had been ventilated on ICU previously in 2013. He discussed these with his mother in detail and returned to them on a number of occasions. This illuminates the close and loving relationship between the two and reinforces my impression of her as determined, as she puts it, to be a voice for her son. His mother tried to unravel and make sense of the dreams. In the course of the last few months I have been made aware, from a number of very senior consultants, that these frightening and often violent dreams are sometimes a feature of the experience of patients who have been ventilated. It is recognised as &#8220;ICU syndrome&#8221; and I have heard it compared to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The intrusive nature of ICU can never be underestimated. MSP told his mother that he had nightmares of being raped. Sensibly, to my mind, she helped her son to understand that this was probably a reaction to the many tubes that had to be inserted into him. The music MSP set out in a playlist in his Advanced Directive document was selected to relax him if he found himself in this situation again. The music is eclectic, ranging from The Smiths (introduced to him by his father) to the Adagio for Strings, by Samuel Barber.  The document also makes provision for music at his funeral as well as incorporating a number of diffident suggestions that strike me as empathetic to the family who he is contemplating leaving behind. I emphasise all these details because they are, to my mind, indicators of the enormous amount of time and thought that had been given to this document.  </p>

Dr W appeared on the conferencing platform, on which we are presently constrained to hear cases, in his scrubs. He had sent a message to the Court in advance of the hearing apologising for not being able to change, no apology was required. Dr W gave his evidence first and at the conclusion of it I told him that I was grateful to him and that he was free to leave court. As an afterthought, conscious of how busy he is, I said that if he preferred to remain and listen to the evidence he was entirely free to do so. It was clear to me that he wanted to understand whether there had been some seismic change in MSP&#8217;s thinking in relation to the stoma. It was not a surprise to me, having listened to his evidence, that Dr W chose to stay to hear the evidence of Mr M. In fact, Dr W remained throughout the entire case, including the closing submissions. Mr M also stayed throughout the hearing.  </p>

I should like to echo this. Both were adamant that their responsibility was to tell me not what they wanted but what their son wanted.

Today, she gave a much more well-rounded account of him. MSP&#8217;s father added information as and when necessary. His contributions were unfailingly helpful and pertinent. MSP emerges from their account as a highly intelligent man, voraciously interested in the world, politics and affairs. He was an A star student, hard-working and respected by his colleagues at school, university and in the workplace. He is 6ft 3, handsome and meticulous in his appearance. His step-sister has gently suggested that he might have been prone to more than a little male vanity. Recently, struggling to walk any distance, MSP bought himself a pair of designer sunglasses so that he could look smart and confident when driving in his car. His mother told me that he spent two hundred pounds on them.  Though she plainly considered this extravagance, I sensed that she delighted in what she saw as her son&#8217;s engagement in the world. This, in my assessment, is not mere vanity but a reflection of MSP&#8217;s determination to conceal the impoverishment of his health and to present himself to the world as competent and active. As I have recorded above, MSP was determined to conceal the stoma from all but the three people closest to him.  </p>

His mother told me that at university he went through a period of self-harming and was ultimately diagnosed as bi-polar. Though it took a little time to get the balance of his medication right, this was eventually achieved and he has remained on anti-depressant medication which has been effective for him. In candid terms MSP&#8217;s mother told me that her son was very popular with girls and had a great many girlfriends. Following the stoma MSP withdrew from any real attempt to forge intimate relationships. Though, his mother told me, he previously enjoyed beer and red wine, in moderation at weekends, this no longer agreed with him and he had started drinking gin rather to excess and every day. Despite his wish to recover vitality, MSP continued to smoke heavily and in the face of his parents&#8217; unconcealed opposition to it.   </p>

His mother told me a number of stories about MSP that pointed to him having a lively, sometimes slightly raucous sense of humour.  It is also important to recall that when, in response to the evidence, I referred to MSP as &#8220;obviously a good looking lad&#8221; his mother corrected me. He is not &#8220;a lad&#8221; she insisted, he is a grown man, intelligent, articulate, a graduate and a respected professional. She was entirely right to refocus my thoughts. There is no doubt, in my mind, that he had come to a clear and entirely settled decision that he was not prepared to contemplate life with a stoma or indeed any significant life changing disability. It is not for me, or indeed anybody else, to critique those views or beliefs, but merely to identify them. They are a facet of MSP&#8217;s broader personality, the expression of which is integral to his own personal autonomy.  </p>

I shall consider these below but, in any event, all agree that document has significant relevance when evaluating MSP&#8217;s best interests. For the avoidance of doubt, I should make it clear that MSP is currently sedated and ventilated. He has an endotracheal tube in situ and is breathing spontaneously with the support of the ventilator. Dr W told me that over the weekend a third sedative agent was added as MSP had been intermittently reaching for his ET tube. He is receiving 25% oxygen and his oxygen level is stable. The arterial blood gas demonstrates a metabolic acidosis, the origin of which is presently unknown but could be due to significant biliary fluid losses from his ileostomy. He is supported nutritionally with total parenteral nutrition. Dr W emphasises that MSP is receiving very little organ support and accordingly, if the hospital were to withdraw life sustaining care this would mean extubating MSP and permitting him to breathe on his own. Given that he is breathing spontaneously with only a small amount of support, at the moment, it is conceivable that MSP would not die because of this, unless sedated to the extent that his breathing and cough reflexes are supressed. As Dr W puts it, with great clarity, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;there is very little support to withdraw otherwise&#8221;</span>. Accordingly, if MSP&#8217;s wishes are to be given effect, what requires to be identified is whether it is in his best interests for artificial nutrition and hydration to be withdrawn.  </p>

The purpose of the best interests test is to consider matters from the patient's point of view. That is not to say that his wishes must prevail, any more than those of a fully capable patient must prevail. We cannot always have what we want. Nor will it always be possible to ascertain what an incapable patient's wishes are. Even if it is possible to determine what his views were in the past, they might well have changed in the light of the stresses and strains of his current predicament. In this case, the highest it could be put was, as counsel had agreed, that "It was likely that Mr James would want treatment up to the point where it became hopeless". But insofar as it is possible to ascertain the patient's wishes and feelings, his beliefs and values or the things which were important to him, it is those which should be taken into account because they are a component in making the choice which is right for him as an individual human being.&#8221; </span></p>

One cannot, as it were, attribute any particular a priori weight or importance to P's wishes and feelings; it all depends, it must depend, upon the individual circumstances of the particular case. And even if one is dealing with a particular individual, the weight to be attached to their wishes and feelings must depend upon the particular context; in relation to one topic P's wishes and feelings may carry great weight whilst at the same time carrying much less weight in relation to another topic.

That said, they will rarely, if ever, be determinative of P&#8217;s &#8216;best interests&#8217;.  Respecting individual autonomy does not always require P&#8217;s  wishes  to  be  afforded  predominant weight. Sometimes it will be right to do so, sometimes it will not. The factors that fall to be considered in this intensely complex process are infinitely variable e.g. the nature of the contemplated treatment, how intrusive such treatment might be and crucially what the outcome of that treatment maybe for the individual patient. Into that complex matrix the appropriate weight to be given to P&#8217;s wishes will vary. What must be stressed is the obligation imposed by statute to inquire into these matters and for the decision maker fully to consider them.  </span></p>

Strong feelings are often expressed non-verbally, sometimes in contradistinction to what is actually said. Evaluating the wider canvass may involve deriving an understanding of P&#8217;s views from what he may have done in the past in circumstances which may cast light on the strength of his views on the contemplated treatment. Mr Patel, counsel acting on behalf of M, has pointed to recent case law which he submits, and I agree, has emphasised the importance of giving proper weight to P&#8217;s wishes, feelings, beliefs and values see Wye Valley NHS Trust v B.&#8221; </span></p>

All the factors in the best interests checklist should be considered, and in particular, the decision-maker should consider any statements that the person has  previously  made  about  their  wishes  and  feelings  about  life-sustaining treatment. Importantly, section 4(5) cannot be interpreted to mean that doctors are under an obligation to provide, or to continue to provide, life-sustaining treatment where that treatment is not in the best interests of the person, even where the person&#8217;s death is foreseen. Doctors must apply the best interests&#8217; checklist and use their professional skills to decide whether life-sustaining treatment is in the person&#8217;s best interests. If the doctor&#8217;s assessment is disputed, and there is no other way of resolving the dispute, ultimately the Court of Protection may be asked to decide what is in the person&#8217;s best interests.  </span></p>

Whilst this document is not binding as an Advance Decision, it nonetheless represents a clear and eloquent expression of MSP&#8217;s wishes and feelings. Nor, as I have stated above, does it stand alone. It is reinforced by the choate and consistent evidence of MSP&#8217;s parents, his stepsister (communicated via the parents) and the clear evidence of three consultants, each of whom was left with no doubt at all that MSP would not want to live either with the stoma or TPN and that the combination of both would be unbearable for him. MSP&#8217;s father told me that if his son was permitted to recover consciousness and discover his own plight, he thought he would <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;kill himself&#8221;</span>. This is something his father fears most of all.

In evidence Mr M readily agreed that he had been optimistic, notwithstanding the history of the earlier reversal. If I may say so, Mr M struck me as a person with an optimistic and positive attitude to his patient. This was illustrated in his evidence, when he said that though the stoma would never be reversible, it may be that parenteral nutrition may not be necessary lifelong. It struck Mr M that the survival of the large bowel, albeit with multiple adhesions, may leave open the possibility, at least theoretically, of enteral feeding i.e. by mouth, at some point in the future. Mr M agreed this was speculative and did not feel able to evaluate the likelihood of it. </p>

Mr M knew nothing of the &#8216;Advance Directive&#8217;, he agreed that his conversation would have been of a different complexion if he had been aware of this. I emphasise this was nobody&#8217;s fault; the document had not been produced. At the time of the conversation, MSP is described as very unwell and septic, he was also receiving a high grade and level of analgesia. I also factor in Mr M&#8217;s optimism concerning the potential reversibility of the stoma, the force of which will undoubtedly have been communicated to MSP. I agree with Ms Dolan that in these circumstances </p>

What MSP did not want was to find himself in the position he now is. Whether the history of the case justified Mr M&#8217;s optimism is logically irrelevant. MSP rejects life with an <span style="font-weight:bold">irreversible</span> stoma and in terms which are unambiguous and consistent. In these circumstances he has made it clear that he rejects all medical treatment or procedures or interventions that artificially sustain his life. Manifestly, this extends to parenteral feeding. </p>

His expressed wishes and feelings, she analyses, weigh most heavily in the balance, to the extent that they are determinative here. In other words, the presumption of preservation of life is rebutted by the countervailing weight to be afforded to MSP&#8217;s autonomy. Ms Dolan has, as her arguments set out above illustrate, concentrated on the consistency and cogency of MSP&#8217;s clear views. Logically her arguments lead to the same conclusion advanced by the Official Solicitor. However, Ms Dolan stops short of reaching a conclusion and, though this is her application, on behalf of the Trust, she adopts what she articulates as a position of neutrality. She advances no other course, nor has she suggested that the sanctity of life or the presumption of promoting life has not been displaced. Her careful and skilful arguments, properly analysed, lead only to the conclusion reached by the Official Solicitor. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">It is important to confront what all this means in the medical context. The Code of Practice highlights the importance of this exercise in the holistic assessment of best interests. There is a real prospect that MSP will survive ventilation. The prospects of that are said to be somewhere between 60 to 70 percent. Accordingly, Dr W considers that if MSP&#8217;s wishes are to be given effect, there should be withdrawal of artificial nutrition and hydration with continued sedation which, ultimately, will compromise respiration and lead to MSP&#8217;s death. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">It is important to break these issues down. Whilst I have highlighted the less than optimal circumstances in which MSP gave his consent to Mr M for the stoma, I do not consider that the evidence rebuts the presumption that MSP was capacitous at the time. If MSP has yielded to an overly optimistic prognosis of reversal which, as we know, proved to be unfounded, he may have means of legal redress. I am not in a position, on the evidence available to me, to know whether or not Mr M should have been more circumspect in his advice. Had he been pessimistic, as to the prospects of a reversal, there is little doubt in my mind that MSP would have rejected the procedure and have chosen to die. This does not mean that this court should correct the error by bringing about the death which MSP would prefer to life with an irreversible stoma. This is, in my judgement, runs contrary to s4 (5) MCA which prohibits an evaluation of &#8220;best interests&#8221; which is motivated by a desire to bring about death. The intensity of the focus on MSP&#8217;s rejection of life with the stoma occludes the fact that he has been equally </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">clear in rejecting anything which artificially prolongs his life. He would unhesitatingly reject the striking artificiality of parenteral feeding. This is clear both from his Advance Directive document and in his mother&#8217;s evidence. In the exercise of his personal autonomy he is entitled to take that decision which this court is required to and does respect. Accordingly, and for these reasons, I consider that the plan advanced by Dr W is in MSP&#8217;s best interests. It is important that I make it entirely clear that Dr W puts forward this plan only in the event that I conclude that it reflects what MSP would have wanted. Having heard all the evidence, which I regard as compelling and cogent, I am satisfied that the plan accords with MSP wishes and feelings.</p>

His confidence and self-esteem has been adversely impacted. His capacity to forge and maintain interpersonal relationships has been significantly eroded. He has made a practical, utilitarian calculation that life in these circumstances is not what he wants. In a real sense this is not a case about choosing to die, it is about an adult&#8217;s capacity to shape and control the end of his life. This is an important facet of personal autonomy which requires to be guarded every bit as jealously for the incapacitous as for the capacitous.</p>

In the particular circumstances of this case and bearing in mind the extent to which MSP wanted to conceal his stoma from the world, I consider this strikes the appropriate balance between the competing Article 10 (ECHR) and Article 8 rights which are engaged and in which both have parity. Ms Dolan recognises the inevitability of the limited duration in which anonymity can be preserved but makes a request to the press to consider whether it would ever be truly necessary, having regard to the public interest, to publish MSP&#8217;s name or any details which would reveal his identity.  </p>
