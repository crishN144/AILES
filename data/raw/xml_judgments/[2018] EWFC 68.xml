	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">This matter concerns an application for a declaration of non-parentage in respect of TSA, born 14 March 2013 now age 5. The application is not opposed by PA, or by Ms Carew on behalf of the Children&#8217;s Guardian. At the hearing on 10 July the declarations were made, with reasons to be given later. This judgment sets out the reasons for that order. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">This case highlights, once again, the need for parties embarking on fertility treatment, in particular involving a clinic outside the United Kingdom, to consider carefully the legal relationship they will have with any child born as a result of such treatment. Additionally, this case emphasises the differences in other jurisdictions of the relevant provisions that may, or may not, enable any child, born as a result of such treatment, to obtain any information relating to the sperm or egg donor from which the embryo was created that resulted in their birth.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">It may be stating the obvious that the availability, or not, of such information may have lifelong implications for the child, relating to matters such as identity and any medical conditions.  It may be said that those embarking on such fertility treatment have, at the very least, a moral responsibility to any child born as a result of such treatment to have considered these matters at the early stage of any such treatment. Additionally, those clinics that operate here may need to carefully consider what information they give to people who seek their advice who they suggest and/or recommend should seek such treatment abroad.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In light of the issues raised by this case I am going to direct that Ms Carew brings this judgment to the attention of the relevant authorities, including the Department of Health and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, and this judgment will be reported on Bailli.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">TSA was joined as a party at an earlier directions hearing. Although on the documents there was agreement between the parties, in my judgment this application affected her legal status as between the parties and, as a result, she should have a separate voice in these proceedings bearing in mind the lifelong implications for her of any declaration made by this court. Due to the fact that the history in this case was agreed there have only been limited welfare enquiries undertaken by the Children&#8217;s Guardian. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Both the applicant and Children&#8217;s Guardian are legally represented, and the court has had the enormous benefit of detailed written submissions from both of them. The court is particularly grateful to Mr Kingerley, and his instructing solicitor, who are both acting pro bono. The court is extremely fortunate to have such comprehensive submissions from advocates with such expertise in this area of the law. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The parties commenced a relationship in about 2011 and in due course decided they wished to have a child together. Medical assistance was going to be required as PA had had a vasectomy and RQ was over 40. They sought the assistance of UK Fertility Clinic, and in particular Dr P (Consultant in Reproductive Medicine). She advised that the chances of retrieving suitable eggs was low due to RQ age. </p>

Dr P wrote on 26 March 2012 to RQ and PA setting out her advice, which included the option of embryo adoption. She concluded that letter as follows <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;Whichever way you decide you want to proceed you will need infection screens and a number of forms to be completed&#8230;&#8217;.</span></p>

She reports that whilst PA did not wish to play any part in TSA&#8217;s life he was wholly supportive of RQ, considered her to be a devoted and caring mother and was confident RQ would tell TSA of her history when she was old enough to understand it. In her discussions with RQ the Guardian was satisfied that RQ will provide a narrative to explain her origins and to help her understand PA&#8217;s role, and the need for this to be a process rather than an event in TSA&#8217;s life. She recognised the earlier she is informed the easier it will be for her to accept. </p>

In practical terms this means the parties did not undertake the counselling, complete the relevant WP/PP forms (Form WP &#8216;your consent to your partner being the legal parent&#8217; and Form PP &#8216;your consent to being the legal parent&#8217;) or act in any other manner that would have demonstrated compliance with the terms of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref>.

There the court was able to make declarations of parentage in circumstances where the record keeping by the relevant clinics had fallen below what was required. This case is the reverse in that the reality for TSA is that she was born as a result of assisted conception, she has one legal parents but as Ms Carew observed an <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;administrative falsehood exists in that her birth certificate names a person who is not her legal or indeed her genetic or even her psychological parent as her father and the court is being asked to rectify the record&#8217;.</span></p>

Under the relevant Spanish law (14/2006) sperm donors are granted complete anonymity, which means they cannot be traced in later life by any child who is conceived as a result of their sperm donation. This is in contrast to the position in the United Kingdom, which allows for a record to be kept of the names and details of sperm donors which enables any child born as a result to identify their donor for medical, social and emotional reasons notwithstanding the absence of any obligations to or responsibility for any child conceived as a result of their donated sperm (see <span style="font-style:italic">Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (Disclosure of Donor Information) Regulations 2004).</span></p>
