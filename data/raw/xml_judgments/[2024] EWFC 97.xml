Child 2 turned 17 in January 2024 and (by virtue of s 31(3) of the 1989 Act) cannot be the subject of a care order and the proceedings have been discontinued in relation to him.  Child 2 remains living at home with M.

The family had been open to the public law outline (&#8216;PLO&#8217;) process, which commenced on 22 October 2022.  However, in the LA&#8217;s view the parents continued to lack insight and minimise the impact that domestic abuse and physical chastisement have on the children and seemed to lack the motivation to make changes to their parenting style.   </p>

He had an inch long cut to his head which he said he had sustained when [F] pushed him against the corner of a wall. He also alluded to a previous incident where [F] had punched him. The trigger for this behaviour appears to have been that [Child 2] had been testing boundaries in stayed out until 21:00 without asking or telling his parents where he was, as well as their concerns (unconfirmed) that he has started using illicit drugs. [F] is reported to have been living at the address in breach of the Child Safety Plan expressly prohibiting him from doing so, something which [M] has not disclosed to the Social Worker during the course of their interactions. There had also been a Restraining Order in place until July 2022, which [F] is also reported to have breached. [F] has been bailed to an address in Feltham and is due to answer bail on the 18th December 2022. He has failed to keep in contact with Probation at the date of this assessment and is due in court in relation to the breach on 03/11/22. [M] is the victim of the index offence (see details below). She has struggled to understand why agencies are concerned and appears to genuinely believe that she will not be able to cope without [F], although there is no evidence of this based on what Children's Services know about the family and the support available to them. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">The parenting assessment made a number of relevant findings which I consider particularly concerning, notably that, in addition to witnessing domestic abuse of their mother and suffering physical abuse themselves, the children have all been put under pressure by their parents not to disclose this to relevant professionals and have been chastised when they have done so:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[Child 2, Child 3 and Child 4] have all experienced varying degrees of physical chastisement throughout their lives. They have also witnessed arguments between parents and violence perpetrated by their father against their mother. Parents have asserted that the children have not witnessed any violence, however there has been multiple occasions of neighbours witnessing these arguments and feeling the need to call the police, therefore it is conceivable that this has in some way been witnessed by the children. Child 3 has spoken of being scared to end up involved in the arguments, he spoke of being trapped in them, and unable to leave, giving the impression of being used as ammunition within these arguments. &#8230;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">There are instances throughout the case recordings that Child 1 and Child 2 have stated that they have been reprimanded for having told professionals about the physical chastisement they have experienced. During a home visit on 25th August following the incident of Child 2 being assaulted, Child 1 did not wish to show the social worker her split lip for fear of getting in trouble for it. During Direct Work session with Child 4 on 1st December 2023 he told the social worker &#8216;mummy told me if I tell you about Daddy he won&#8217;t come back forever&#8217;. This paints a picture where the children are experiencing abuse in the form of physical chastisement, as well as witnessing aggression and violence towards their mother, but being put in a position where they are not allowed to speak about this. Certainly, for a child as young as Child 4 this is confusing and difficult. Throughout the time that Children&#8217;s Services have been involved there has been difficulty in gaining information with regards to their lived experience and there has been continued concern that they are being coached in what to say to professionals.</p>

All of the children report a fondness of mum and that they feel loved, she is kind and caring. There have been similar reports in relation to their father and the observations of greetings and goodbyes during family time are indicative of a bond between children and parents. All of the siblings are equally close, affectionate and desire to support and care for each other. Despite the unpredictability of their father&#8217;s behaviour, witnessing aggressive and violent behaviour and experiencing physical assault in the manner of chastisement, they all feel loved and have developed a bond as a family. This is important to note but should not be taken as an indication that there has not potentially been damage caused by these experiences.</p>

The work identified in the Goals and Expectations document should be completed before consideration can be given to any reunification, a process that would take between at least 12 and 18 months.  The LA has agreed to make all of the necessary referrals, if it has not already done so, in respect of the proposed work and there are no cost implications in respect of these courses that would prevent them taking place.  He observed that some of the courses do not start until September 2024 but said that if there was any difficulty accessing an in-house course then a reference could be made to the FAST team.  The LA also agree with the Guardian&#8217;s recommendation that Child 3 and Child 4 should have supervised contact with M twice a month for two hours at a time and once a month for two hours at a time with F.  He confirmed the LA&#8217;s intention was that the children should remain in foster care together.  In his view it was not in the children&#8217;s best interests to discuss the proposed plan for reunification with the children.  It should be explained to them that they cannot go home.  He agreed that both children clearly love both their parents, but the risks are such that (for example) they would not be able to play cricket with F this summer or play in a community cricket match with him, at least not without a specific risk assessment being carried out.</p>

F had visited despite the fact he had been subject to bail conditions and a restraining order in the past, and M had taken the children to see F in breach of the safety plan.  The children had been put under pressure not to disclose that fact.  He agreed with the Guardian that M is warm and loving but has difficulty with more complex aspects of parenting and that reunification should remain the plan<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="font-style:italic">if or when</span> M is able to evidence sustained and meaningful separation from F, insight into the impact of domestic abuse and physical abuse of the children and development of parenting techniques that move away from the use of physical chastisement.  It would not be enough just for M to attend the relevant courses; she would need to demonstrate engagement with the work and a process of assessment would be necessary.  The LA would keep an open mind about whether more or different courses are required if the first set of courses do not achieve the necessary breakthrough.  The 12-18 month timescale before reunification included the process of assessment, but there could be no certainty about reunification.  The plan for reunification should not be explained to the children until it becomes a feasible option.  Otherwise there was a risk that their hopes of reunification would be dashed, causing them further harm.</p>

He agreed that it will be upsetting for the children and they will be unhappy if an order for their permanent removal is made.  However it would be worse if they were returned.  If F returned in breach of any order and abused M or the children that would cause further emotional harm.  If they then had to be removed a second time that would be devastating for them.</p>

She accepted that F had hit her and the children had seen that, which would have harmed them.   Although she had not witnessed F hitting the children she accepted that had happened too.  She had been with F since 2009 and prior to that was in another violent relationship with the father of Child 1 and Child 2.  She felt able to leave F now; they had separated after the hearing in October 2023.  She was asked about the WhatsApp&#8217;d photograph of her and F on their wedding day that she had sent to F on 21 November 2023 saying &#8216;happy wedding anniversary&#8217; with a heart emoji.  She accepted (after first appearing to say that her daughter had sent this) that she had sent this to her husband.  The explanation she gave was that it was their wedding anniversary; that even though the relationship was over &#8216;this was my second marriage after my last husband passed away; he gave me a new life.  So I just sent him this message&#8217;.  When asked about F&#8217;s statement on 2 January 2023 that they remained in a relationship (set out in the preamble to the order, see para 27 above) she said this was not true.  M accepted that she had allowed Child 4 to speak to F on the telephone despite that being prohibited by the safety plan. She denied having told Child 4 not to tell the social worker that he had spoken to F and could not explain why Child 4 had told the social worker that.  She was also asked about another record in which Child 4 had told the social worker that he had seen F sleeping in M&#8217;s room at their house in early November 2023, in breach of the safety plan and after she had said the relationship was over.  M denied that F had stayed over during this period.  She was adamant that the relationship had ended after the hearing on 13 October 2023.  The courses she had already attended (the Freedom Programme) had taught her a lot; how to protect herself and the children and how to identify if someone was mistreating her.  Asked about Talking Therapies she said she did not think she needed to do this but would do so if advised.  It was not necessary for her to do so before her children came home because she could care for her children.  She was committing her life to her children.</p>

In cross-examination he was asked about the statement made, on instructions, on 2 January 2023 that he remained &#8216;in a relationship with M&#8217; and wished to &#8216;parent the children together&#8217;.  He said that he meant that they remain speaking on the phone and had contact with each other.  He said they wished to &#8216;parent the children together&#8217; because if they did not the children would be upset.  His hope is to jointly parent the children in future.  He accepted that on two occasions, 30 November and 2 December 2023, he had breached the safety plan.  The first had been a family party with family friends and he had not known M and the children were coming.  He hadn&#8217;t told the family friends that he and M were separated as he was concerned it would affect the children.  On 2 December 2023 his daughter had arranged a surprise birthday party and he had not known M and the children were coming.   He accepted he should have reported this event to social workers.  In future he would be more careful.  He denied having slept over at the house, either in 2022 when the restraining order was in force or in November 2023, contrary to what Child 2 and Child 4, respectively, had told social workers.  He accepted his behaviour had affected the children mentally and emotionally.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">The Guardian&#8217;s position was, in some respects, firmer than that of the social worker.  She did not accept that securing F&#8217;s removal from the home would provide adequate protection for the children.  That is in part because she does not believe that he can be prevented from returning home; any court orders will be insufficient because they depend upon M to police the orders and to be honest with social workers. The Guardian did not believe M could or would do that.  Moreover, the children had been exposed to domestic abuse which is deeply harmful emotionally and psychologically.  While they remain in the family home they will feel fundamentally unsafe and will be expecting that abuse to resume, even if F is not present.  In any event F could continue to exercise coercive control indirectly.  It is essential for the children to be somewhere that they feel safe.  That will not happen in their home because that is the environment in which the abuse took place and they will remain in fear of F returning.  There is also the wider context of M&#8217;s neglect as a result of her inability to understand the impact on the children and to protect them from harm.  She hopes that the work identified in the Goals and Expectations document will allow the children to return but at present is not confident it will succeed.  There has already been significant LA involvement but this has not been understood and acted upon by the parents and matters had not progressed.  There was no evidence of any increased insight or understanding.  She agreed with the timescale of 12 months for the delivery of the necessary work and assessment followed by a transition plan with a number of stages.  She agreed that the children should not be told of any plan for reunification.  If the children were to be permitted to return home then they will learn that they cannot speak to professionals and will not know who to trust when they are worried, so action cannot be taken when required to protect them.  There had probably been a much higher incidence of physical assault against both M and the children than social services know about.  </p>

She did not know why Child 4 had hurt the family dog (which precipitated their move to the third foster carer) but it could have been because he was playing out violence he had witnessed by F or for cultural reasons as a result of not being familiar with pets.  She had not seen the children in their new setting or considered whether their emotional and cultural needs were being met there.  She accepted that emotionally and psychologically the children were harmed by separation from their primary caregivers.  She accepted that her advice as to reunification was highly contingent and at best a possibility.  Accordingly, the question was whether it was in the children&#8217;s best interests to be removed for the whole of their childhood, to which her answer was &#8216;yes&#8217;.</p>

Schedule 3 gives very limited powers to a court to impose requirements on the person with parental responsibility or with whom the child is living but only if that person consents; and grants powers to supervisors to give directions to the supervised child.  By contrast with a care order, a supervision order confers no power in relation to the exercise of parental responsibility or any of the specific duties owed to &#8216;looked after children&#8217; under s 22 and there is no equivalent regulatory safety net for the exercise of the local authority functions in relation to them including those exercised by IROs.

A NMO may be made by the court of its own motion in any family proceedings: s 42(2)(b).  A power of arrest may be attached to an occupation order: s 47.  Breach of a NMO is a criminal offence punishable by up to 5 years&#8217; imprisonment: s 42A.  There is, however, no power to impose a requirement of electronic monitoring under either order, by contrast with s 35(6) of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 which permits such a requirement to imposed when the court makes a Domestic Abuse Protection Order (&#8216;DAPO&#8217;) under s 28 or 31 of the 2021 Act.  Those provisions of the 2021 Act are not yet in force, however.  Accordingly, the primary means of enforcing a NMO requires the victim to report any breach, which may be of limited value if an abusive relationship is continuing.</p>

	    <intro>
	      <p class="Listpara2" style="margin-left:0.79in">In determining what is in the best interests of the child, and whether intervention is necessary and proportionate, the primary question will often be (and is in this case) whether the risk of harm to which the child will be exposed if they remain within their family can be adequately managed within the available legal framework and with available authority support.  Only if the risk of harm is too great to be adequately managed is it likely to be either proportionate or in the best interests of the child to be removed from their family.  That is because removal of a child from their family is not itself risk-free.  The most obvious, immediate consequence is that it makes children, and the rest of the family, unhappy and may have significant longer term consequences which I consider further, below.  As Sir James Munby asked, rhetorically, in <span style="font-style:italic">A LA v MM</span> [2009] 1 F.L.R. 443, &#8216;What good is it making someone safer if it merely makes them miserable?&#8217;  While those words were written in a case concerning the best interests of an incapacitated adult, they are equally applicable to the best interests of children, as the surrounding context of the quote makes clear (emphasis added):</p>

The fact is that all life involves risk, and the young, the elderly and the vulnerable, are exposed to additional risks and to risks they are less well equipped than others to cope with. But just as wise parents resist the temptation to keep their children metaphorically wrapped up in cotton wool, so too we must avoid the temptation always to put the physical health and safety of the elderly and the vulnerable before everything else. Often it will be appropriate to do so, but not always. Physical health and safety can sometimes be bought at too high a price in happiness and emotional welfare. <span style="font-style:italic">The emphasis must be on sensible risk appraisal, not striving to avoid all risk, whatever the price, but instead seeking a proper balance and being willing to tolerate manageable or acceptable risks as the price appropriately to be paid in order to achieve some other good &#8211; in particular to achieve the vital good of the elderly or vulnerable person's&#160;happiness.

It is not clear to me what precipitated this behaviour but it is not too remote a possibility that it is connected to the emotional turmoil of being separated from his family.  I accept the Guardian&#8217;s view that it could also be a consequence of his having witnessed F&#8217;s aggressive and violent behaviour or a result of cultural difference because he has not been raised around pets.</p>

The Guardian, for her part, expressed considerable scepticism that it would be possible.   If the care plan is not actively and conscientiously focussed on rehabilitation there is a significant risk that the children will remain in foster care for the rest of their childhoods - for 5 and 12 years, respectively.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">Foster care is the most restrictive of the children and their parents&#8217; Article 8 rights but it is the safest option, at least in the short term.  There is a long history of domestic abuse by F against M which the children have witnessed, of physical chastisement of the children by F and of neglect of the children which crosses the s 31(2) threshold, which the parents accept.  I find that F continues to pose a high risk of harm to his partner and children within the context of relationships and agree with the conclusion of his probation officer to that effect and &#8216;that until [F] accepts his own mistakes and works with professionals for support, he will simply repeat the same mistakes again and again. [F] needs to reflect on the impact that his avoidant coping strategies have on himself and those he loves.&#8217; Of further concern is that the children have been put under pressure by the parents not to make disclosures to the authorities and have been chastised when they have done so.  I note, in particular, that following the assault on Child 2 on 22 September 2022, Child 2 initially gave a statement but then retracted it, which meant that the prosecution had to be discontinued.  This pressure is harmful on a number of levels: it places the children in a situation where they have conflicting loyalties, which is psychologically harmful; they cannot disclose to those in authority when they or their mother are at risk; and F cannot be held to account and the children protected when they are exposed to his criminal behaviour.</p>

In my judgment, and in agreement with the evidence of the LA and the Guardian, these orders and measures are not sufficient to meet the identified risk.   The available court orders are all dependent upon either F, M or the children reporting a breach by F or by the LA detecting a breach during the course of its supervision of the family.  None of these provide sufficient assurance given the likelihood that F will breach the orders, the unlikelihood that either F or M will report any breach, the inappropriateness of depending on the children to report any breach, the absence of other protective factors and the unlikelihood that the LA will detect any breach: </p>

It is highly unlikely that either Child 2 or Child 4 will have invented their separate accounts that F had returned home in breach of those orders.  I reject F and M&#8217;s denials that he has done so.  In any event, it is concerning that neither F nor M immediately reported to the local authority the meetings between F and the children on 30 November and 2 December 2023 and F&#8217;s telephone conversations with the children, all of which were a breach of the Court ordered safety plan.  These breaches took place while these proceedings were ongoing and the family were under significant scrutiny.  It is more likely that F will breach any orders made by the Court once the proceedings are over when that scrutiny will be significantly reduced.  In any event, I do not accept F&#8217;s evidence that he would report any breach to the LA given his record of non-compliance with orders in the past.</p>

		<p class="Listpara3" style="margin-left:1.18in">F and M gave evidence that their relationship has been over since 13 October 2023.  I do not accept that evidence.  In reaching that conclusion I place weight, in particular, on: the level of contact between F and M revealed by the telephone analysis, including the happy anniversary messages sent by M and F in November 2023; F&#8217;s instructions to his lawyer at the hearing on 2 January 2024 that he remained in a relationship with M; and the evidence of Child 4 that F had stayed over in M&#8217;s room in November 2023.  I also consider it telling that both M and F have expressed the hope that their relationship could resume, although in M&#8217;s case I accept that she stated this to be conditional on F changing his behaviour and sustaining that change.  In my judgment it would be wrong to return the children to M&#8217;s care on the premise that the relationship is over.  That would be to set them up to fail.  Both M and F need to have the time and the opportunity to conduct the necessary work.  M, in particular, needs to make a choice whether to prioritise her children over her partner.  If she chooses to continue or resume her relationship with F then the LA will need to be satisfied that F has addressed his own behaviour and that the risk of further abuse of M and the children has been reduced to an acceptable level.  In the meantime, this factor causes me considerable doubt that M will report any contact between F and the children or any other breach of a NMO.</p>

		<p class="Listpara3" style="margin-left:1.18in">M has proved unable to protect the children from harm from F in the past, despite significant involvement and input from the LA.   M has been in a coercive and controlling relationship with F since 2009 and was in an abusive relationship with her previous partner.  As I have had cause to observe elsewhere, the insidious nature of coercive and controlling relationships is such that the victim remains vulnerable to the abuser&#8217;s influence and will often return to the abusive relationship: <span style="font-style:italic">Re. EF (Abduction: Hague Convention (Slovakia))</span> [2023] EWHC 505 (Fam), [65].  Unless and until M engages meaningfully in the work identified in the Goals and Expectations document she will continue to lack insight into the risk that F poses to her and the children and the harm that a resumption of his behaviour will cause.  She will therefore remain unable to protect herself and the children from that harm.  While I find she is now highly motivated to prove her willingness to engage in the necessary work in order to secure the return of Child 3 and Child 4, that willingness is likely to dissipate if the children were to be returned to her now.  She needs to demonstrate a consistent engagement and understanding of the risks posed by domestic abuse generally and by F specifically.  That is only likely to happen if the children remain in foster care, at least in the short to medium term.  Until then, I do not consider M will be able to provide effective protection for the children in the event that F seeks to return home or that she will report any breach by F.  </p>

The management of the care plan falls squarely within the LA&#8217;s functions under the scheme provided for by the 1989 Act.  However, given these are matters that go to the proportionality of the interference with the Article 8 rights of the children and their family they must be kept under review by the LA and the IRO.  Furthermore, the work identified in the Goals and Expectations document must commence as soon as possible and should not be delayed because of a lack of resources.  This case must not be allowed to drift.  If a year from now the point has not been reached where the necessary work has been finished and planning for a return home has reached an advanced stage then searching questions will need to be asked.  The IRO will then need to give careful thought to whether to refer the case to CAFCASS to consider what steps are necessary to safeguard and promote the children&#8217;s welfare, for example by instituting proceedings on their behalf under reg. 45 of the 2010 Regulations.

The timescales for the work to be undertaken by parents needs to be considered as a rough guide and will be dependent on the individual services availability and on the engagement of the parents and ability to make themselves available for all sessions. </p>

The approximate timescales for this will be 12 weeks but are dependent on the availability of an assessor to undertake the assessment and parents&#8217; engagement. If [F] was being assessed as joint carer, further alcohol testing would be required. </p>

The timescales of this would be dependent on the level of contact between the parents and children at the time. If contact was still supervised/supported, then this would need to progress to unsupervised before a transition could be considered. Once parents were having regular unsupervised contact with the children (at least 3 times per week) then a transition plan would be formulated. This would be undertaken over approximately 6 weeks. This would start with unsupervised contact within the family home moving to an overnight contact then weekend contact and then full transition. SW visits would be conducted along with input from school and foster carers.</p>
