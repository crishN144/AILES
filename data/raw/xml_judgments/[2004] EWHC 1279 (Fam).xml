	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case concerns Ms T who is 37 years old. The Claimant seeks declaratory relief concerning her medical treatment. The Claimant is responsible for the medical care of Ms T, but it is not responsible for her psychiatric care and at present does not have her psychiatric records.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the hearing before me Ms T was represented by solicitors and counsel. I also heard submissions from the Official Solicitor and, of course, the Claimant. The Official Solicitor was present and represented in one or more of the following capacities, namely, as the potential litigation friend of Ms T, as a friend of the court or as a person who would be invited to make enquiries by the court. His participation was extremely helpful. I pause to comment that it is well recognised that the participation of the Official Solicitor in cases of this type, which are difficult and sensitive, is helpful to the court and others who are involved in them.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I was told that the solicitors acting for Ms T have experienced difficulties in obtaining public funding. To my mind this is surprising and unfortunate. The judge who deals with this case at final hearing may wish to return to this point, however I record at this stage, that in cases of this type it is important that all practical efforts are made to enable the person who is, or may be, refusing treatment to be properly heard (see the guidelines in reported cases referred to below). An important aspect of that is the funding of his or her legal representation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms T has on a number of occasions over the years self harmed by cutting herself and blood-letting. The consequence of this blood-letting is that her haemoglobin level falls to a life threateningly low level such that she requires blood transfusion on an emergency basis. My references to blood transfusion should be read as including iron supplements and other necessary treatment in respect of her dangerously low haemoglobin.  This emergency situation can arise on or very shortly after her presentation at, and admission to hospital. The high risk that exists at these times of chronic anaemia is that in the absence of a blood transfusion sufficient oxygen will not be transferred to her body tissues and Ms T will die.</p>

I am not aware of when I am cutting myself, and therefore cannot prevent my HB dropping very low periodically. Having a transfusion does not resolve this problem in the long term, only causes stress to myself.</p>

Although the blood given in transfusions is perfectly healthy/clean once given to me it mixes with my own and also becomes evil. Contaminated by my own. Therefore the volume of evil blood in my body will have increased and likewise the danger of my committing acts of evil.</p>

Ms T led me to understand that there have already been some discussions between [the mental health care trust and the Claimant] and I shall make contact with [the mental health care trust] to clarify the position.</p>

She felt it however, likely, that she would become liable to need a transfusion over the next few months, although she emphasises she would not wish to accept it&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..&#8221;</p>

She was refusing a blood transfusion and the hospital was aware of (a) the advance directive, the accompanying letter from the GP, and the letter from Dr C (the treating psychiatrist) which I have referred to earlier and (b) the medical opinions relating to a similar incident in the autumn of 2001 which I refer to later.  </p>

If the patient is unwilling to sign a written indication of this refusal, this too should be noted in writing. Such a written indication is merely a record for evidential purposes.

In many such cases the patient's general practitioner or other responsible doctor may be sufficiently qualified to make the necessary assessment, but in serious or complex cases involving difficult issues about the future health and well-being or even life of the patient, the issue of capacity should be examined by an independent psychiatrist, ideally one approved under s 12(2) of the Mental Health Act. If following this assessment there remains a serious doubt about the patient's competence, and the seriousness or complexity of the issues in the particular case may require the involvement of the court, the psychiatrist should further consider whether the patient is incapable by reason of mental disorder of managing her property or affairs. If so the patient may be unable to instruct a solicitor and will require a guardian ad litem in any court proceedings. The authority should seek legal advice as quickly as possible. If a declaration is to be sought the patient's solicitors should be informed immediately and if practicable they should have a proper opportunity to take instructions and apply for legal aid where necessary.

The view of the patient may reflect a difference in values rather than an absence of competence and the assessment of capacity should be approached with this firmly in mind.

Indeed it seems unnecessarily destructive to place responsibility on the staff to carry out Ms T&#8217;s wishes when she herself is giving a very mixed message. She could surely kill herself quite cleanly if she genuinely intended that. Without detailing appropriate parts of her anatomy, it is quite easy to kill oneself if one&#8217;s haemoglobin is as low as Ms T&#8217;s by a simple incision in an artery at various points.

I was able to discuss her attitude to blood transfusions with her in some detail, and although some of her ideas were slightly odd, it seemed clear to me that she fully understood the nature of the proposed treatment (i.e the blood transfusion), the possible risks and benefits of the treatment and the possible consequences of refusing the treatment. She has clearly been able to understand and retain any information given to her about this, and has reached a judgment as to whether or not she wishes to accept the treatment. My understanding of the common law situation, following the case of R v C is that this is sufficient that she has capacity to refuse treatment.&#8221;</p>

The latest statement of government policy in </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Making Decisions</span><span style="color:#000000"> shows that the Government currently accepts the Law Commission's recommendation: see para 1.10. Pending the enactment of a checklist or other statutory direction it seems to me that the first instance judge with the responsibility to make an evaluation of the best interests of a Claimant lacking capacity should draw up a balance sheet. The first entry should be of any factor or factors of actual benefit. In the present case the instance would be the acquisition of foolproof contraception. Then on the other sheet the judge should write any counterbalancing dis-benefits to the applicant. An obvious instance in this case would be the apprehension, the risk and the discomfort inherent in the operation. Then the judge should enter on each sheet the potential gains and losses in each instance making some estimate of the extent of the possibility that the gain or loss might accrue. At the end of that exercise the judge should be better placed to strike a balance between the sum of the certain and possible gains against the sum of the certain and possible losses. Obviously, only if the account is in relatively significant credit will the judge conclude that the application is likely to advance the best interests of the Claimant. </span></p>

In my view the reason for this is that applying the above approach on the present evidence the balance of the competing factors comes down heavily in favour of Ms T having the treatment to save her life.  On the present evidence the reasons advanced against the giving of the treatment are found in the advance directive under the heading &#8220;reasons for my decision&#8221;.  To my mind the second reason based on Ms T&#8217;s belief that her blood is evil carries no weight in the balancing exercise.  The first reason relates to the vicious circle Ms T says she finds herself in but in my view this does not have great weight.  Further in my view it is to some extent is undermined by the point that Ms T told Dr C that in other respects she remains reasonably well and led him to understand that cutting had been rather less frequent since October 2003 (see his March letter).  I say that even though I acknowledge that Dr C has also said that there has not yet been identified a validated means of treating her emotionally unstable personality disorder.</p>

The fact of the application before her out of hours on an emergency basis, and the issues before me, demonstrate that there are difficult human and legal problems in respect of emergencies relating to the authorisation of treatment  of an adult who is thought to lack capacity, or who it is thought may lack capacity.  Put another way in my view there are problems concerning the approach that should be adopted by the judge and others involved in the middle of the night when the medical opinion is that unless treatment is administered immediately the patient will die and in the case of an adult there are uncertainties relating to his or her capacity to give or refuse consent or the validity or effect of an advance directive.  Similar problems exist in the case of a child when those with parental responsibility cannot be found or are not giving consent and when the child is <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick</span> competent and is objecting to treatment.</p>

It seems to me that included among them are (a) whether the court can grant an interim declaration without the patient being heard, (b) whether interim relief can be granted on the basis that there is doubt as to the capacity of an adult and thus by reference to best interests whilst such doubts remain and, if so, what tests should be applied in measuring the doubt that would trigger that approach and in assessing best interests, (c) whether interim relief other than an interim declaration could be granted in effect to suspend the effect of a refusal of treatment or an advance directive (and thus the autonomy of an adult who was found after full investigation to have capacity) and thereby enable the court to authorise treatment on a best interests approach until doubts as to capacity were resolved and (d) the extent to which a different approach can be taken with children having regard to the inherent jurisdiction in respect of children and the possibility of the court (i) overriding the wishes of a <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick</span> competent child and giving consent for the treatment of such a child or a younger child, or (ii) making a specific issue order in respect of the treatment of a child (see for example <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re R (a minor) (blood transfusion)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1993] 2 FLR 757" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1993">[1993] 2 FLR 757</ref> at 759, <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re O (a minor) (medical treatment)</span><span style="font-style:italic"/><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1993] 2 FLR 149" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1993">[1993] 2 FLR 149</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re M (medical treatment) (consent)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 2 FLR 1097" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 2 FLR 1097</ref>).</p>
