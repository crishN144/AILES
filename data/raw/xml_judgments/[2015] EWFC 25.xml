The child's mother (D) and his father (F) oppose the imposition of a placement order and support the application of I's paternal great-aunt (Ms M) for a Special Guardianship order (SGO). The child's guardian supports I's long-term placement with his foster-carer but has recommended that it should be under a SGO which she believes would better meet his needs.</span></p>

The paternal great-aunt (Ms M) and the Children's Guardian both gave oral evidence. A reduced bundle had been filed with the court containing limited relevant documents from the original trial bundle and up dating material including the assessments of social workers. </span></p>

I has been left with restricted mobility and sees occupational therapists and physiotherapists. He also sees his health visitor and his GP. The most recent medical report the court has seen (dated 23</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Palatino Linotype'">rd</span><span style="font-family:'Palatino Linotype'"> September 2014 and prepared by the medical advisor to Birmingham Children's Services) describes I as having eight health professionals involved in his care in addition to his GP. As is immediately apparent from that long list I has many medical problems which affect him; he is developmentally delayed, has hearing loss, difficulties with his vision, probable cerebral palsy, had previous head trauma and difficulties in eating and breathing normally (the latter affects his sleep). </span></p>

He was then described as a delightful child who was very interactive; a description borne out by the social workers who had seen him whilst preparing their report. I have no doubt at all that his continued progress and his happy and sociable demeanour is in large part due to the excellent care and affectionate stimulation that he has received from his foster-carer, C. </span></p>

They both entered guilty pleas and were sentenced in November 2014. F received an immediate custodial sentence of three years and four months; he remains in prison and refused to get on to the transport provided for him to attend court for this hearing. The prison was unable to accede to his request that he attend court for the full length of the hearing by video-link. F accepts that he will have a limited role in his son's life in future but strongly supports I being placed with his aunt Ms M. He rejects any possibility of a continued placement with C as he says she will not be able to promote a positive view of I's parents.  It is likely that F to will have to return to the Congo after he is released from prison.</span></p>

The "hostility" and "tension" between the carer and D seemed to involve the link worker and whilst it was recognised to be an issue it would seem that the local authority took little, if any, action to ameliorate the situation.

A SGO report (undated) has been prepared on behalf of the local authority by Vinhod Verma , which supported a SGO being made in favour of C. Mr Verma produced two addendum reports dated the 8</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Palatino Linotype'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Palatino Linotype'"> September 2014 (following the concerns raised about C's attitude towards the parents and its effect on promoting a positive view of the his family for I in the long term) which recommend that there should be a Supervision order for 12 months to assist with contact and promote with the child's birth family. </span></p>

Mr Verma considered that his recommendation that there should be a SGO remained unchanged but again recommended a supervision order to ensure additional support for these areas which had caused some concern.</span></p>

Having heard the evidence of the case social worker I am at a loss to understand the rationale behind the local authority's decision to make the application for a placement order, which is not, in fact, supported by the social worker allocated to the case, although I can see from the court bundle that adoption was being considered as an option in December 2013.  Their case was put to this court as being largely based on  the desire of  C to adopt I; but she has not always taken that position, indeed she told Mr Verma when he was preparing his final addendum towards the end of 2014 that she would apply for adoption only if the court refused her application for a SGO.</span></p>

This raised questions about Ms M's ability to deal with her son should he object to any aspect of I living with them. As observed by Ms Green I would be likely to be distressed at moving from his carer and would vocalise his distress. When asked about this likelihood Ms M's son dismissed it by saying that when his mother baby-sat for his cousins they cried and it did not bother him, but I's situation would be quite different and would demand his mother's attention full time.

Ms Green had observed during contact that Ms M failed to pick up I's cues and so missed opportunities for play and stimulation. The number that Ms M gave Ms Green for the signing classes was unavailable and there was no evidence before the court that she had taken up any English classes although she said she had. I found the lack of any initiative being taken even to identify facilities and resources that would be necessary to provide a similar level of support for I as he has with his current carer a matter of considerable concern.

Ms M's reluctance to engage in this process was palpable. This was evident in the manner in which she gave evidence, which was at times obdurate; not least in her contradictory explanations for why she had not taken the steps asked of her to provide a medical report.  Ms Green told me that in the years in which she had prepared many SGO reports this was the first time that she had had the experience of there being no medical report in place at the final hearing.

The lack of support for C and the unusual level of involvement lead to predictable antipathy which was visible to D and to those carrying out her parenting assessment.

Moreover if, as it is submitted, I am entitled to have due regard to the parents' hostility and its likely future effect on the placement then I can properly take note of antipathy of C towards the parents and to the effect that that may have on her ability to promote a balanced view of his parents to I and of his family as a whole forming as they do part of his heritage and ultimately his view of himself both in relation to his family and his African Congolese ethnicity.</span></p>

His placement with C makes the need for him to have direct access to his Congolese cultural heritage and black African ethnicity and to the Francophone community all the more important for his development, his sense of self and his place in the wider world as he grows up and throughout his life. </span></p>

All agree, including C,  that direct contact with the birth family in the person of his great-aunt and later other members of I's extended family should take place at least four times each year. The guardian identified in her report a concern which I share that the desire of C to protect I and to fight for him coupled with the negativity C has shown in the past towards his parents, may well lead to plans for contact not being carried through. Mr Verma recommended a twelve month Supervision order alongside the SGO to assist C and I; the implication was it was to provide support for C to provide for I to have contact with his family and culture.  It is likely that disagreements could arise over contact and understandable that C may come to the view that it was not in I's interests that it continued; it is asking a lot of her. I have no doubt that contact is in I's best interests and that it must continue for the reasons identified by the professionals and set out above.</span></p>

She described C as having been on a rollercoaster over the choice between adoption and a SGO. Ms Solomon said that she had no concerns that F would destabilise any placement with C. She told me that on balance she would support the making of a SGO. Ms Solomon said that the beginning and the end of her reason for supporting the adoption order was that it was C's stated wish, but that shared Ms Green's view and agreed with her evidence that the facts of this case weigh against there being an adoption order; she told me that C had used the word's I "belongs to me" but agreed with the guardian that "in this case that I should belong to his family as that's of benefit to him too." It was better [for I] not to sever the links with his family and that an SGO placed with C was probably better. </span></p>

In those circumstances it would seem inappropriate, confusing and lacking any semblance of reality for him to no longer be a part of his family; to have ceased in law to be a member of that family. His family have an important role to play in his development, not least in his sense of self and identity. Their continuing role in his life and their involvement will be of significant benefit and tangible value to him. This is, again, a matter that will grow in importance as the years pass and he grows and eventually enters adulthood. It will be of relevance and importance throughout his life.

I disagree there would be if I ceased to be a member of his family who are to continue to play a role in his life and provide a most important backdrop and context to it. Neither parent is considered to be likely to try to disrupt the placement; both are unlikely to be in a position to do so. I have applied the statutory provisions to this particular child and his circumstances and conclude that his welfare is best met by making a Special Guardianship Order in favour of C.</span></p>

It is too important, too significant a part of the plan for I's future welfare to be left to chance or depend on the good-will of the adults involved. It is a necessary order as the continuation and the progression of contact form part of the basis of this court's decision and a contact order reflects the imperative need for contact to take place. In addition, it will deal with the parents' contact and will provide support for C as any application for contact by either parent will be in the face of an existing order regarding their contact.</span></p>

His application for direct contact at present is wholly unrealistic there are no adequate or proper facilities for I to visit him in prison. To re-introduce contact after he is released, and if he does not return to the Congo, is not in the child's interests as it is difficult to see what purpose it would serve for I. He cannot safely be reunited with F and any contact would have to be professionally supervised. Contact is not supported by any other party. The contact that I will be having with his great-aunt will provide the connection with his paternal family which best meets I's welfare needs. </span></p>
