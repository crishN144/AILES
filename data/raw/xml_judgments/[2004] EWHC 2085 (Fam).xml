	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an application on behalf of 10 year old Samuel R by his maternal grandmother and Litigation Friend, Mrs June D.  It is for pre-action discovery under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54/section/34/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.34(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54" uk:canonical="1981 c. 54" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Supreme Court Act 1981</ref> and Part 31.16 of the Civil Procedural Rules.  It relates  to a potential claim arising from treatment given to Samuel by the Respondent Care Trust between 1998 and 2002.  That treatment arose from Samuel&#8217;s behavioural and other problems.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is said that it was not until the summer of 2002 that Samuel was properly diagnosed with Asperger&#8217;s Syndrome and Attention Deficit Disorder.  In failing to make this diagnosis at an earlier time during his treatment, the Respondent failed in its duty to provide proper care for Samuel and were negligent.  Had an earlier correct diagnosis been made Samuel would have received different treatment.  This would have avoided or ameliorated his present condition.  Pre-action discovery is sought to determine whether such a claim has a proper foundation.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_3">
	  <num>3.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Respondents have given partial disclosure.  They resisted giving full disclosure for 2 reasons.  Firstly there was the concern about the effect on Samuel.  That was met at the hearing by a voluntary condition offered on his behalf that further discovery would neither be shown to him nor discussed with him.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_4">
	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second reason related to the position of Samuel&#8217;s mother.  She is not a party to the application.  She features in the early notes kept by the Respondent.  Some of the details are felt by the Respondent to be of a sensitive nature.  I was invited to read one sentence in particular which has not so far been disclosed to the Applicant.  This was with the knowledge and agreement of the Applicant.  Suffice it to say that the Respondent&#8217;s description is apt.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A further matter which has troubled the Respondent is the Data Protection legislation.  It was not put forward as a reason for restricting disclosure.  Its relevance it is said arises under the issue of costs.  It is under that heading that I shall consider it.</p>

After 2 assessments he started to see her weekly from August 1999.  It is not necessary to trace the subsequent history.  It concluded with the diagnosis of Dr Carter, the Respondent&#8217;s Consultant Community Paediatrician, in July 2002 to which I have referred.  Suffice it to say that it is that diagnosis which it is claimed could and should have been made earlier.</p>

In general, therefore, one would expect disclosure of all the information put before the court in proceedings under section 29 for the purpose of establishing that the nearest relative &#8220;has exercised without due regard to the welfare of the patient or the interests of the public his power to discharge the patient from guardianship &#8230;&#8230;or is likely to do so&#8221;, unless there was a demonstrable risk of harm to the patient or others in so doing.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;C&#8217;s interest in protecting the confidentiality of personal information about himself must not be underestimated.  It is all too easy for professionals and parents to regard children and incapacitated adults as having no independent interests of their own:  as objects rather than subjects.  But we are not concerned here with the publication of information to the whole wide world.  There is a clear distinction between disclosure to the media with a view to publication to all and sundry and disclosure in confidence to those with a proper interest in having the information in question.  We are concerned here only with the latter.  The issue is only whether the circle should be widened from those professionals with whom this information has already been shared (possibly without much conscious thought being given to the balance of interests involved) to include the person who is probably closest to him in fact as well as in law and who has a statutory role in his future and to those professionally advising her.  C also has an interest in having his own wishes and feelings respected.  It would be different in this case if he had the capacity to give or withhold consent to the disclosure:  any objection from him would have to be weighed in the balance against the other interests, although as W v Egdell <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1990) Ch 359" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1990">(1990) Ch 359</ref> shows, it would not be decisive.  C also has an interest in being protected from a risk of harm to his health or welfare which would stem from disclosure; but it is important not to confuse a possible risk of harm to his health or welfare from being discharged from guardianship with a possible risk of harm from disclosing the information sought.  As In re D (Minors) (Adoption Reports: Confidentiality) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1996) AC 593" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">(1996) AC 593</ref> shows, he also has an interest in decisions about his future being properly informed.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">That balance would not lead in every case to the disclosure of all the information a relative might possibly want, still less to a fishing exercise amongst the local authority&#8217;s files.  But in most cases it would lead to the disclosure of the basic statutory guardianship documentation.  In this case it must also lead to the particular disclosure sought.  There is no suggestion that C has any objection to his mother and her advisers being properly informed about his health and welfare.  There is no suggestion of any risk to his health and welfare arising from this.  The mother and her advisers have sought access to the information which her own psychiatric and social work experts need in order properly to advise her.  That limits both the context and the content of disclosure in a way which strikes a proper balance between the competing interests.&#8221;</p>

It is common ground, therefore, that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/29" uk:canonical="1998 c. 29" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1998 Act</ref> does not prevent the local authority disclosing this information.  Nor, however, does it require the authority to do so.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have already considered the position of Samuel and of his mother.  The Data Protection Act itself allows for an exception for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.  That overrides the exception to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/29/section/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 7</ref> under paragraph 5 of the Data Protection (Subject Access Modification ) (Health) Order 2000.  The exception is only likely to arise in a limited number of cases.  Mr Anthony does not now I understand it seek to raise it as a primary ground.  He points though to the difficult balancing act which the Respondents are required to carry out.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The question therefore is to what extent does that mean that the Respondents are bound to meet a request for information such as the one with which I am concerned.  The argument turned in the end on a narrow but important issue.  Here the Respondent raised an objection in relation to Samuel which was met by an agreed condition not to permit disclosure to him.  The question that arises is on which party the burden lies after the objection is raised to point out how it could be met.  Equally so far as Mrs D is concerned, on whom does the burden lie to say whether any objection can be met?</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am satisfied that the proper course is as follows.  There is a duty to disclose medical records to a person having parental responsibility for a child.  The Respondent may well have an objection to raise.  It was right and reasonable for the Respondent for instance to say that Samuel might be upset by having matters disclosed by him in confidence discussed by others.  He had already made that clear.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If however there is a way where that objection can properly be met it is in my judgment for the Respondent to indicate what would satisfy them and meet their duties not to disclose the information.  It is not for an applicant to try a series of strategies in the hope that one might appeal to the Respondent.</p>

In relation to that discrete issue I hold that it was unreasonable for the Respondent not to put forward that as a means of meeting a legitimate concern or responding to it when it appeared in the Applicant&#8217;s skeleton argument.</p>

The Respondent raised a proper objection.  Are they bound to do no more than raise the objection and then leave an Applicant to see whether they can persuade the court to override the objection?</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment the Respondent is entitled to present a proper argument to the court raising legitimate concerns.  They are entitled to ask the court to consider whether in the exercise of its discretion those concerns are or are not to prevail.  Their appearance therefore at court is not unreasonable provided they have genuine concerns which are properly raised.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However that is not the end of the story.  It is one thing to point out that there are various objections identifying their nature and the source on which they are based.  They might arise under a common law duty of confidence or the Data Protection Act.  Having done so and indicated the relevant authorities in my judgment their proper stand is to indicate that these are matters properly to be considered by the court which may or may not in any given case prevail.  In this instance having given partial disclosure, there was a refusal to give any further disclosure without a sufficient indication of what could be done to meet their objections or the particular considerations relevant to the court&#8217;s determination in relation to Mrs D.</p>

However nor do I think on balance that the opposite course of ordering payment of the Applicant&#8217;s costs would be right in this case as, properly set out, a hearing before the court was likely.</p>
