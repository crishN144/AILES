KL is six and is the only child born to these two parents. F seeks an order that he return forthwith to that jurisdiction in twin proceedings heard conjointly under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985</ref> (which incorporates into English law the key provisions of the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction) or alternatively pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the English High Court. When in this judgment I refer to 'Hague' or to 'the Convention' I mean that 1980 Convention unless from the context otherwise appears.</p>

KL has a younger half-sibling now aged some 21 months born to M in England by a subsequent relationship.  On each side the parents' families originate in Ghana. F is a dual national naturalised American; M's upbringing was in England from the age of 4 and she has indefinite leave to remain here. The parents, now in their forties, met and married in Texas in December 2005 and KL was born there in August 2006. Together with F's elder son they lived in Texas prior to the breakdown of their marriage evidenced by a Texan divorce petition issued by F in March 2008. Meanwhile he, a serving member of the American armed forces, was deployed to Iraq between May and September 2007 during which time of course KL was in the sole care of M; while between October and December 2007 M, a qualified social worker, took up a short term work assignment in England during the course of which KL was in the sole care of F.</p>

The agreed orders plainly envisaged that M and KL would continue to occupy the former matrimonial home in Texas, but in July 2008 M removed herself and KL to London where they lived, in the event, until in March 2010 the Texan court finally finalised the divorce (and I use that description advisedly) and, in contested welfare-based proceedings in which both parents took part, awarded F custody of KL together with the exclusive right to designate his place of residence.</p>

That having been said the documentary evidence, and the findings of the Texan judge in March 2010 (and further summarised by that same judge in her Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law dated 12 July 2010) and the narrative account of the history contained in the 10 August 2011 appeal court judgment referred to below, to some large extent justify the complaint that M from this early post-separation stage took unilateral and clandestine steps in relation to KL which did indeed involve elements of deception (for instance in relation to his acquisition of immigration status in the United Kingdom), while at the same evincing her opposition to the smooth flow of contact between F and KL.</p>

M then removed him to England, acting in reliance upon an order of the Texas Federal Court made in Hague abduction proceedings instituted by her upon the basis (which was indeed adopted by the first instance Hague judge) that KL had been habitually resident in England when the March 2010 order awarded his custody to F, and that F by acting on that order and keeping KL living with him was thereafter wrongfully retaining him in Texas. Central to the issues before me are questions which arise in relation to that, may I say, bizarre decision: not least whether now to characterise M's August 2011 removal of KL back to England to live with her here as lawful or wrongful (i) at the time of the removal; and (ii) subsequently in light of the reversal on 31 July 2012 of that Hague determination by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit court; (iii) after M 'retained' him in England despite an order made on 29 August 2012 by a Texas Court Federal judge (in fact, the same judge who had made the by now reversed Hague return order, apparently of his own motion and certainly without either party having any opportunity to be heard); and perhaps (iv) prospectively, depending upon the outcome of as yet unresolved proceedings before the United States Federal Supreme Court which challenge the validity of that reversal.</p>

On 10 August 2011 M's application prevailed, the District Court holding that KL was habitually resident in England and Wales. An order was made requiring F to deliver up KL to M and for him to be returned to England forthwith. There was no application for a stay pending appeal either then or thereafter. F complied with the order and M and KL returned to England on 14 August 2011.</p>

From then until March 2012 I would characterise the stance of F in relation to those proceedings as ambiguous, without thereby meaning to prejudge (if in the light of my approach to this case it becomes necessary for me to do so) M's assertion that F has acquiesced in what (on his case) is her wrongful removal/retention of KL in this country which (she says) opens up to her a doorway, via article 13(a) of the Convention, which should lead me (if I get that far) to exercise discretion against ordering the return of KL forthwith to Texas. Meanwhile on 23 November 2011 a residence order in favour of M was made and on 9 of February 2012 an order for contact to F was made.</p>

	    <p class="jus" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.25in">On 3 March 2012, however, F instituted his own applications under the Children Act, for both residence and contact. Orders for contact were made on 3 July, but then on 31 July 2012 came the order of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversing the Hague order pursuant to which M had removed KL to England, and holding that far from being wrongfully retained in the USA KL had been habitually resident there at the time in question in the Hague proceedings. M's attempts to seek rehearing of the appeal all failed. But on 7 September 2012 she presented a petition to the US Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, and presented a motion for consolidation of this case with a separate and still pending case called <span class="Emphasis">Chafin v Chafin</span>. The facts are similar, in that the mother in that case left America with the parties' child in reliance on a court order which had neither been stayed nor was the subject of appeal; and on her behalf it is argued that the appeal against that order is 'moot' and should not be allowed to proceed as the child is no longer in the jurisdiction. If the mother in that case (which was argued before the Supreme Court in early December, with a judgment anticipated in the spring) is successful in her argument, M in this case will seek to assert that the 31 July order reversing the Hague order pursuant to which she removed KL should itself be overruled, thus leaving her with the benefit of the earlier (albeit clearly erroneous) order of 10 August 2011.</p>

Her report described a somewhat confused 6 year-old upon whose expressed wishes it would be inadvisable to place too much reliance. He did not appear averse to a return to America when first seen, but his views had hardened against that outcome when the officer saw him again at M's request next day. She (the CAFCASS officer) perhaps thought it unnecessary to investigate the reasons for his change of view.

The litigation history of this child thus far tends strongly to suggest that my decision, not to order his return at this stage, will lead to an application from F for leave to appeal, and indeed that sequel was indicated as likely by Mr Harrison in the course of the hearing. If F does not accept this outcome and permission to appeal is granted I do ask myself whether the Court of Appeal will be assisted by what in effect would be a third set of comprehensive submissions contained in a judgment certainly rivalling and possibly extending significantly beyond the scale of the presentations they will receive from counsel? With some but I hope not undue diffidence, I doubt it, and I doubt whether the Court of Appeal's task, if put to it, will be rendered anything other than more onerous if the load of the case has added to it a conventional and referenced textbook judgment from me. I would rather (and hope that, if it comes to it, they would rather) have what I believe can be presented as relatively straightforward conclusions based on my understanding of the relevant authorities and my experience and perception of the way the Convention does and is meant to operate in practice amongst its now nearly 90 Contracting States.</p>

It might also appear that this is the defining moment governing whether the relevant act is or is not wrongful, and that that characterisation of the act, either way, applies for all time and is the basis from which parents and courts can reasonably proceed. In short therefore I start from the proposition that F's rights of custody were not breached in August 2011 by KL's court-sanctioned removal.</p>

Any characterisation of M's August 2011 removal of KL as legitimate in view of the unstayed and unappealed order apparently entitling her to remove him when she did should be regarded as provisional only. And the effect of the successful appeal over a year later, setting aside that return order, is nothing less than to erase it ab initio and thus to render the removal retrospectively wrongful, irrespective of intervening events. In consequence, it is argued, consideration of allied questions potentially affected by the characterisation of the act (such as the loss, transfer or acquisition of habitual residence) must be reassessed. Moreover, and by the same reasoning, the replacement of the Hague court's necessary finding (necessary, that is, as a pre-requisite to making the return order) that KL had been wrongfully retained in Texas by F must also be reassessed. For, at the time in March 2010 when he took over the child's care he did so pursuant to an express order now re-legitimated by the appeal court's finding that KL was then habitually resident in Texas. Thus I should hold that KL's removal from Texas in August 2011 was a removal from, rather than a return to, his territory of habitual residence.</p>

As the objective of Hague is the child's prompt return to the country of the child's habitual residence so that that country's courts can determine welfare issues it would indeed be perverse in such circumstances for what will have become a superseded and redundant Hague order to be enforced. Were it to be so the original remover would be authorised by the home court's order to remove the child again to the receiving state. That to and fro would be pointless and disruptive. I am not aware of such a case but can conceive only that the Hague return order would either be discharged on application, or if that course were not permissible in the relevant jurisdiction that it would be swiftly set aside on appeal.</p>

The damage envisaged is that if it is correct (as I apprehend it to be) that physical return of the child pursuant to a Hague return order is irreversibly not wrongful even if the order is successfully appealed, then countries which do not presently do so will feel obliged to shift their practice so as more readily to grant a stay pending appeal.

I described this just a few lines up as 'equally unsatisfactory', but in truth of course it would be far more unsettling for KL now once more to be shipped like a shuttlecock back to the States than if a stay had been granted pending appeal and he had remained in Texas for that intervening year.</p>

But, if moot the appeal court reversal is found to have been, then logically it would (and maybe at some future stage of this litigation will) be argued for M that that would resurrect the lawfulness of her August 2011 removal. Can it be the effect of the use of the word 'is' on which the argument largely hinges, and/or required by policy considerations that there should in such circumstances be a third review and a second change of direction concerning the lawfulness of a removal or retention, in what in this case will be approaching 2 years after the event?

	    <p class="jus" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.25in">It is true that the dilemma on which the discussion focuses does not operate anything like so harshly in relation to return orders made by London courts. We are fortunate that whether by luck or good management our procedures in relation to appeals usually run speedily and effectively. Unless and until a staying order is made by the first instance judge or by the Court of Appeal the order's effect is neither postponed nor delayed. If, when a return order is made, the losing parent indicates an intention to appeal (or that time for consideration whether or not to appeal is sought) the first instance judge is likely to leave to the Court of Appeal the decision whether the required permission to appeal should be granted, but will meanwhile very often grant a temporary moratorium to cover what is likely to be at most a few days' interval before the Court of Appeal can be invited to permit the appeal to proceed and to consider extending the stay. A very early date for the appeal will be set, which may again be but a few days later.</p>

But the better outcome, for all concerned in these particularly anxious cross-border family disputes concerning children, would be for appeals to be expedited, rather than to introduce a fluctuating and unstable concept of wrongfulness through the prism of which a child's situation would diffract differently each time the validity of an order was successfully impugned on appeal. That would be a recipe for confusion, expense and above all delay.</p>

Clearly (and so indeed it was found by the appeal court) F was exercising rights of custody in relation to KL at the time from March 2010 through to August 2011 when they lived together. But it seems to me that it must be the case that a Hague court-mandated removal of a child to remedy anterior wrongful removal or retention does not in turn constitute a breach of rights of custody of the parent found responsible for the wrongful act. Nor does it become so if subsequently on appeal that parent is exonerated: one cannot in this context make water flow back under the bridge. So that it seems self-evident to me that, in these proceedings, M's removal of KL to England in August 2011 was neither wrongful at the time it took place, nor in breach of H's undoubted rights of custody.</p>

It is common ground that he made it without prior application by either party and therefore on his own initiative and in the absence of any representation or opportunity for submissions. The District Court judge (as I have observed, the same judge as had made the erroneous Hague return order) recited passages from the appeal court's judgment, and added that M was obliged to comply with the March 2010 custody order. To 'comply with the Fifth Circuit's judgment mandate' his order concludes <span class="Emphasis">'M must return KL to the United States which is the country of the child's habitual place of residence; M must return KL to the custody of the possessory parent, F; and the parties must comply with the Texas state court's decision regarding possession and custody of the child going forward.'</span></p>

However, his order relaying that decision and dated 19 September 2012 describes his 29 August order as <span class="Emphasis">'simply instructing the parties that they must comply with the Fifth Circuit's judgment and mandate</span>.'

His practical ties with America were sundered. He was not only resident here but firmly so for what, the vagaries of life apart, looked likely to be an indefinite but by no means necessarily brief or delimited period. I reject the suggestion that his stay here was perforce provisional or conditional because of the pendency of the US appeal proceedings. And so I hold that by 31 July 2012 (when the appeal court set aside the August 2011 Hague order) and by 29 August 2012 (when the District Court Judge relayed his instruction) KL had become habitually resident in England and Wales &#8211; on whatever test.</p>

She plainly, for her part, was no longer habitually resident in Texas (as I assume she had become when the parties lived together as a family), but by 2011 on any reading of the meaning of habitual residence and how it is lost/transferred/acquired she must have become habitually resident in England.</p>

I have in mind the provisions of the code concerning parental responsibility comprised in articles 8 to 15 of the Regulation. Article 8 lays down the general rule that in cases within its scheme the habitual residence of a child is the foundation of jurisdiction. Article 10 sets out a series of considerations, compliance with any one of which leads to a shift of jurisdiction away from the state which, before an abduction, was where the child was habitually resident. But it is clear from the terms of that provision that it operates upon the basis that a child may acquire a changed habitual residence <span class="Emphasis">before</span> jurisdiction shifts: whereas the outcome contended for by F in this case would prevent habitual residence changing in analogous circumstances. This would be to open up a chasm in the operation of the Hague Convention because article 60 of the Brussels II Revised Regulation stipulates that it takes precedence over the Child Abduction Convention 'in relations between Member States [i.e. EU Member States other than Denmark]'. The result, it seems to me, would be that two different rules would apply to abduction cases the subject of Convention applications, depending on whether they were intra-EU or extra-EU. Such a result, I suggest all would agree, would be profoundly regrettable and is therefore by any possible means to be averted. Thankfully it can be so, by rejecting the 'let us wait and see what happens on appeal' approach Mr Harrison would have me adopt.</p>

Much water has flowed, much of it irreversibly as I have found, under the bridge in KL's life in the intervening almost 3 years. His recent past is here.

My comments are obiter as far as the instant case is concerned, as what I will point out has not affected my conclusions one way or the other: but still they may be of some and it may even be more than mere passing interest in relation to the quest for autonomous rationalisation of the concept of habitual residence, consistently across international instruments, now so central to so many cross-border cases affecting adults just as much as children.</p>

To that end, in particular the duration, regularity, conditions and reasons for the stay on the territory of a Member State and the family's move to that State, the child's nationality, the place and conditions of attendance at school, linguistic knowledge and the family and social relationships of the child in that State must be taken into consideration.

Before habitual residence can be transferred to the host State, it is of paramount importance that the person concerned has it in mind <span class="Strong">to establish there the permanent or habitual centre of his interests, with the intention that it should be of a lasting character</span>. Accordingly, the <span class="Strong">duration of a stay can serve only as an indicator in the assessment of the permanence of the residence</span>, and that assessment must be carried out in the light of all the circumstances of fact specific to the individual case.</p>

	      <p class="ind" style="margin-left:0.5in">55      That is even more true where the child concerned is an infant. An infant necessarily shares the social and family environment of the circle of people on whom he or she is dependent. Consequently, where, as in the main proceedings, the infant is in fact looked after by her mother, it is necessary to assess the mother's integration in her social and family environment. In that regard, the tests stated in the Court's case-law, such as the reasons for the move by the child's mother to another Member State, the languages known to the mother or again her geographic and family origins may become relevant.</p>

To that end, where the situation concerned is that of an infant who has been staying with her mother only a few days in a Member State &#8211; other than that of her habitual residence &#8211; to which she has been removed, the factors which must be taken into consideration include, first, the duration, regularity, conditions and reasons for the stay in the territory of that Member State and for the mother's move to that State and, second, with particular reference to the child's age, the mother's geographic and family origins and the family and social connections which the mother and child have with that Member State.

To that end, where the situation concerned is that of an infant who has been staying with her mother only a few days in a Member State &#8211; other than that of her habitual residence &#8211; to which she has been removed, the factors which must be taken into consideration include, first, the duration, regularity, conditions and reasons for the stay in the territory of that Member State and for the mother's move to that State and, second, with particular reference to the child's age, the mother's geographic and family origins and the family and social connections which the mother and child have with that Member State. It is for the national court to establish the habitual residence of the child, taking account of all the circumstances of fact specific to each individual case.</span></p>

The contrast is with temporary.&#8217; But now, I suggest, a very sound basis for downplaying (if not indeed for eliminating) the implications of permanence as an ingredient of habitual residence is reinforced upon the basis of internal analysis of the English-language judgement in the light of its derivation from a French-language original.</span></p>
