I am grateful to both Counsel, and indeed the wider legal teams, for the helpful and clear way they have respectively conducted their cases. Both parties have been represented before me at a first class level; but it has, of course, come at a cost. In the proceedings for which this was the final hearing, the mother has incurred a total of &#163;259,298 in legal costs and the father a total of &#163;171,440. All but a very small portion of the mother&#8217;s legal costs have been paid by the father, who has of course paid his own costs as well.</p>

His long-term cohabiting partner and later wife has been Ms Annie Kilner Walker, whom he married in November 2021. There are four children from that relationship: Roman (12), Riaan (8), Reign (6) and Rezon (3 months). The father and his family live in Cheshire. The father is a professional footballer at the highest level, currently employed by Manchester City Football Club and also playing as Vice-Captain of the England national football team. In the latter capacity he took part in the final of the European Football Championship on the evening of Sunday 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2024, a fact which caused me to adjourn the start of the hearing by one day (of which more below).  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.12in">The circumstances and contexts of the conceptions and births of Kairo and Kinara, and the nature of the relationship between the parties, have, perhaps for obvious reasons given the father&#8217;s celebrity status, aroused public and press interest and generated a great many newspaper stories. I shall make some comments below about how this press interest has been fed and its effect on some of the orders I shall make, in particular in relation to the publication of this judgment. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in">I note at this stage that it is common ground that the parties have never been in a cohabiting relationship. The evidence suggests that the mother wished the relationship to develop further than it has and the father&#8217;s decision not to allow the relationship develop at all and instead to commit himself to his wife has been a source of disappointment, anguish and anger for the mother. The evidence further suggests that, so far anyway, there has been a reluctance by the father to pursue a relationship with Kairo and Kinara beyond a small number of fleeting encounters which he does not currently plan to repeat. He has instead prioritised his wish to rebuild his relationship with his wife and to draw a line under his relationship with the mother. Whilst these matters are part of the story, and some human beings have undoubtedly been affected and no doubt distressed by them, none of them are of much importance to the financial decisions at the centre of my task, and it is certainly not the role of the Financial Remedies Court to make moral judgments on what has happened or in any way to seek to punish or condemn any perceived human frailties or lack of wisdom.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in">Kairo was born on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2020. The mother made a financial application in relation to him on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> June 2020, which, painfully and expensively, went through many interim stages to a final hearing before Recorder Chandler KC in February/March 2022. His judgment (from which I shall quote below) was appealed, in one part successfully, to Sir Jonathan Cohen in May 2022, returned to Recorder Chandler again on a drafting point in July 2022 which he resolved by an order dated 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2022 and was appealed for a second time to Sir Jonathan Cohen in August 2022 on the drafting point. Before the second appeal could be determined, some further negotiations had taken place against the background of the mother&#8217;s threat that if she did not get what she wanted she would select a home a stone&#8217;s throw away from the father&#8217;s family home in Cheshire rather than in Sussex, an idea which she knew horrified the father. The more generous provision led to a compromise of the appeal in a consent order in due course approved by DDJ Burles on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2022. The overall costs incurred in this first round of proceedings up to July 2022, which are almost certainly not all of them by the end, are recorded in Recorder Chandler&#8217;s July 2022 order as being &#163;427,277 by the mother and &#163;201,702 by the father. All but a very small portion of the mother&#8217;s legal costs were paid by the father. Not very long after this compromise was reached the mother became pregnant again by the father. Against the background of this (then secret) fact, the father offered yet more generous housing provision which (perhaps na&#239;vely) he hoped would keep the lid on the news of the second pregnancy.  </p>

On 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2023 the mother&#8217;s legal representatives made a pitch for &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">an order for the sum of &#163;131,000 to be made available on account of the mother&#8217;s legal fees</span>&#8221; together with a range of interim provision. Forms E1 were exchanged in September 2023 and I dealt with a First Appointment on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2023 and referred the matter to a private FDR before Mr Tim Amos KC, which took place on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2023.

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.25in">Throughout 2023, the father (again, perhaps, naively - honesty might have been a better policy) sought to keep secret the fact that he was Kinara&#8217;s father. It is clear from the evidence that he was understandably embarrassed about this fact and anxious about how his wife would react when she found out. In his attempts to persuade the mother to go along with the retention of secrecy, the father gave way to many of the financial demands of the mother which he might otherwise have resisted. Most obviously, he agreed to increase the mother&#8217;s housing budget from the figure of &#163;1,850,000 agreed by the parties and approved by DDJ Burles in November 2022 to the purchase price of &#163;2,400,000 of the Sussex home purchased in August 2023 which she now occupies. The evidence before me has amply demonstrated that the mother was able to leverage these substantial increases by hinting that she would go public on the paternity issue. If the father thought that this rather generous house budget increase would keep his paternity a secret, he was to be disappointed, and the mother plainly had no intention of keeping the matter secret. She saw no advantage for herself or her children in the secret being kept and this is perhaps understandable. As well as making a significant number of obvious social media hints about the paternity, the mother decided to send a text message to the father&#8217;s wife on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2023, at a time when she knew the father was playing football so would not be at home, saying: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Hey its Lauryn I just wanted to quickly tell you that Kyle is the father of our daughter</span>&#8221;. This was intended to, and did, cause distress to the father&#8217;s wife. I do not accept the mother&#8217;s explanation that this text message was sent in an attempt to create a good working relationship between the two women in the father&#8217;s life. In my view this text was written in the same spirit as the series of text communications with the father&#8217;s next door neighbour in Cheshire in which the mother sought to persuade the neighbour to record conversations over the garden fence with a view to gain material to undermine the father&#8217;s marriage. When the mother texted the neighbour to say &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Ready to finish them</span>&#8221;, she had in mind causing irreparable damage to the father&#8217;s marriage.</p>

This gave rise to a consideration of <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;The Transparency Reporting Pilot for Financial Remedy Proceedings&#8217;</span> publicly approved by the President of the Family Division and introduced in the Central Family Court and some other courts on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2024.

A sale would be triggered on Kairo ceasing education up to a first degree or earlier if the mother cohabited with or married another person (subject to the leave of the court if Kairo was still in education). The mother was to be responsible for &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">internal routine maintenance and decorative upkeep of the property</span>&#8221;, but the father was to be responsible for the cost of &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">structural repairs, all external maintenance and repairs and non-cosmetic internal repairs</span>&#8221;. If the mother wanted to move away from Sussex outside the 60-mile zone to a replacement property elsewhere, she could do so, but only a lower figure (identified as the &#8216;protected housing budget&#8217; in the order and set at &#163;1,350,000, proportionately adjusted over time) would be made available for her housing in these circumstances.</p>

It is common ground that, under the scheme of Children Act 1989, Schedule 1, neither of these provisions could have been imposed on the father against his wishes, but he volunteered them anyway. It has become apparent in the course of the hearing before me that the Deed of Trust recording the 10% interest for Kairo has not yet been drawn up, but the father indicated that he would now attend to it forthwith and he needs to do this. </p>

The welfare of the child is not, by virtue of the statute, either the court&#8217;s paramount or the court&#8217;s &#64257;rst consideration, but welfare will have &#8220;in the generality of cases, a constant in&#64258;uence on the discretionary outcome&#8221; and the child is &#8220;entitled to be brought up in circumstances which bore some sort of relationship to the father&#8217;s current resources and the father&#8217;s present standard of living&#8221; with the caveat that &#8220;the court must guard against unreasonable claims made on the child&#8217;s behalf but with the disguised element of providing for the mother&#8217;s bene&#64257;t rather than for the child&#8221;: Re P [2003] EWCA Civ 837. One parent &#8220;should not be burdened with unnecessary &#64257;nancial anxiety or having to resort to parsimony when the other parent was able to live lavishly&#8221;: A v V [2022] EWHC 3501. &#8220;No great signi&#64257;cance should be attached to the issue of whether a pregnancy was planned or otherwise&#8221;:  J v C [1999] 1 FLR 152. The duration of the parents&#8217; relationship is not in itself a relevant factor but may be relevant to the extent that a child has over time become accustomed to a particular standard of living which a&#64256;ects a reasonable assessment of the child&#8217;s needs: N v D [2008] 1 FLR. In most cases the most signi&#64257;cant element is the provision of capital for housing and the court will have to determine what accommodation is reasonable for the child in the context of available resources. The provision of capital for housing (whether it is made by way of a lump sum or by way of a property settlement or transfer order) should be drafted in such a way that the provision reverts to the payer once the relevant child attains the age of 18 or ceases full-time education:  UD v DN [2021] EWCA Civ 1947&#8230;.Other items which have been held to have a su&#64259;cient element of bene&#64257;t for the child so as to justify lump sum provision include house repairs (Dickson v Rennie [2014] EWHC 4306), motor cars (where, if su&#64259;cient funds are available, a once-o&#64256; &#64257;gure for a purchase and rolling replacement programme of cars for the child&#8217;s minority should be considered (PG v TW (No 2) [2012] EWHC 836), furniture and decoration (Re P [2003] EWCA Civ 837) and the statute speci&#64257;cally allows costs &#8220;incurred in connection with the birth&#8221;: Children Act 1989, Schedule 1, paragraph 5(1)(a). Orders have been made to enable the parent with care of a child to clear credit card debts: M-M [2014] EWCA Civ 276 (though care should be taken to avoid a lump sum in lieu of inadequate maintenance). Where there is reason to believe that monies may not be spent on the intended item the court can make directions for the payee to provide proof (Re N [2009] EWHC 11), but this may not be appropriate in most cases. Lump sum orders are limited to singular items of a capital nature (Green v Adams [2017] EWFC)&#8230;A lump sum may be appropriate to provide an investment fund for future school fees (Tracey v Tracey [2006] EWCA Civ 734).&#8221;</span></p>

That exercise is not only irrelevant - a complete red-herring - but seems to me to have unpleasant transactional overtones. I agree with the judgment of HHJ Horowitz QC in&#160;Re V&#160;[2012] EWHC B36 (Fam) at [106] where he suggested that the concept of a carer's allowance &#8220;is past its utility&#8221;.

She generally found it very difficult to give a straight answer, she argued with counsel, asked questions back and, in my judgment, sought wherever possible to argue her case rather than give simple, straightforward answers&#8230;The Mother showed a remarkable lack of insight in relation to her own spending. On occasion, she sought to answer a question by going onto the attack. When asked about whether she was worried about overspending, she acknowledged she was worried but then said &#8220;&#8230;that really upset me &#8211; the fact that Kyle doesn&#8217;t want to provide the same level of support for his other children&#8221;&#8230;While it may serve the Mother&#8217;s purpose to see herself as the victim in this case, I cannot see any proper basis for suggesting that the Father has sought to &#8216;punish&#8217; the Mother or deny her proper financial support. In my judgment, this is a fantasy on the Mother&#8217;s part which enables her to avoid responsibility for her actions which amount to spending money as if it was going out of fashion&#8230;I also bear in mind that the Mother does not have a good track record when it comes to telling the truth. The Mother has a conviction for benefit fraud relating to misappropriate of &#163;21,000&#8230; She said to counsel &#8220;I find it upsetting you&#8217;re using this [her conviction]&#8221;. The Mother was in my judgment seeking to deny any responsibility, to the extent that she appeared to be looking for sympathy by reference to her ill health or her parents&#8217; divorce. I regret to say I do not consider that the Mother&#8217;s answers in relation to her conviction were either truthful or straightforward&#8230;.My overall conclusion is I must treat the Mother&#8217;s evidence with great deal of caution. I do not accept that she either tried or did give this court an honest and clear account of the background. In my judgment, the Mother she said whatever she felt would best advance her claim.&#160;</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am entirely free to make a different assessment of the parties to that of Recorder Chandler and I am in no sense bound by what he said; but the assessment quoted above entirely accords with my own overall assessment of the parties. In my view the father&#8217;s presentation before me was sensible, honest and reliable. Where he felt that the mother may have a point, he readily conceded it with some grace, generosity and kindness. Plainly, he was embarrassed and remorseful as to the difficult situation in which he has placed a number of people, including all of his children, and regretted his decision-making in trying to keep his paternity of Kinara a secret; but he has in my view acted with dignity and generosity (and, once the secret was out, honesty) in facing up to the financial and personal consequences of what happened. In contrast, my assessment of the mother is that she was not reliable, often said what she thought would help her case rather than what was true, failed to make a calm and measured assessment of what she needed and often exaggerated her need to spend money (I think the father was correct to observe that the mother was in many ways treating him as an open-ended cheque book). She was unable to give any credit to the father for the reliable and generous financial support he has in fact given her and was happy to take every point against him. She made few concessions where concessions might have been appropriate, for example in relation to the appropriateness of her threats to move to Cheshire near the father&#8217;s home. She went out of her way to blame the father for all the newspaper coverage that has been received when I am entirely satisfied that she was overwhelmingly responsible for it, save for the one <span style="font-style:italic">mea culpa</span> interview he gave in late January 2024, which is perhaps more to his credit than otherwise. </p>

In fact, the father went further and made &#163;2,400,000 available as a housing budget, not because he accepted that this was needed, but because the mother asked him for this and he acceded. I also remind myself that there was a specific reason for its inclusion, that the mother was threatening to move her home close to the father&#8217;s family home in Cheshire. Having heard the evidence, this reason and this justification still very much exists. I also remind myself that, in his evidence, that the father readily conceded that the 60-mile rule could be extended to 100 miles. There is no reason for thinking that the mother faces any injustice because of this clause. There is no reason why she should move out of her current home and/or anywhere within 100 miles of her current home and there is no evidence before me to suggest that the figure of &#163;1,350,000 (proportionately upgraded) would not adequately house her in a suitable home outside the 100-mile limit. </p>

The clause was not removed by the DDJ Burles order and the Sussex property was purchased in August 2023 in the context of an express agreement that this would continue to apply. It is not an uncommon clause to see in these orders and any risk to the mother is ameliorated by the caveat which requires the court&#8217;s leave before any sale can occur. If the mother cohabited with another wealthy man she would probably not still require the current property, but if she cohabited with an impecunious man she almost certainly would still require the current property (and an order for sale would probably not be permitted by the court) so it is difficult to see any significant injustice arising from the inclusion of this clause.</p>

An individual would have to earn about &#163;300,000 per annum gross to receive this net income. In addition, the mother will have all her housing and motor car costs met. It is, on any view, a very significant income. If it is not at the level of a premiership footballer, it might be difficult to argue that it is not broadly commensurate with it or that it is out of kilter with it or that it is out of kilter with what the father spends from his income (preferring to a significant extent to accrue capital).</p>

	    <p class="NoSpacing" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue of child-care costs has been dealt with in 2022 by Sir Jonathan Cohen. I have set out above what he said. Since this is a fresh application, I am not formally bound to adopt what he said, and in any event there are now two children, but I have found it difficult to disagree with either the sentiment or the detail of his judgment. Ms Gray suggested that it would not be correct to say that it is <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">never</span> appropriate to allow child-care to allow a mother to redevelop her career, and she suggested that Sir Jonathan Cohen was not correct to say this (if he did), but (whatever the merits of this argument generally) I am entirely satisfied that it was the correct answer for the present case. I agree with Sir Jonathan Cohen that it is reasonable here to make some provision for child-care in the nature of respite care. Sir Jonathan felt that, when there was one child, fair provision would be additional child periodical payments in respect of child-care costs in the sum of &#163;1,386 pcm until August 2025 (the start of Kairo&#8217;s primary school) and then at the rate of &#163;1,040 pcm until September 2031 (the start of Kairo&#8217;s secondary school).</p>

In reaching this conclusion I have in mind all the authorities and legal principles referred to above. The dominant feature in my reaching this conclusion is that argued by Ms McNeil-Walsh when she wrote: &#8220;</span><span class="within-new" style="font-style:italic;color:initial">The parties are well-known celebrity figures and there has already been substantial reporting of the long-running dispute between them. Much of this reporting has been the result of one or both of the parties themselves putting information into the public domain. Given what is already in the public domain, it would be artificial to suggest that the parents could not be identified if there was reporting of these proceedings on an anonymised basis. The mother in particular has repeatedly placed in the public domain &#8211; both via the media and via her public social media profile &#8211; images, video and audio of the parties&#8217; children, together with various statements about the father and his marriage to Ms Kilner. In those circumstances, any Article 8 rights are of limited weight in the Re S balancing exercise&#8230;In the particular circumstances of this case, there is no reason to suppose that the reporting of these financial remedy proceedings will cause further detriment to the welfare of the parties&#8217; children</span><span class="within-new" style="color:initial">&#8221;. </span></p>

It would be a nonsense, opening the court to ridicule, to try to redact or anonymise this judgment to prevent identification of the parties. Further, a perusal of the many hundreds of newspaper articles published about these matters clearly illustrates that the mother has not just cooperated with, but actively instigated, press coverage placing in the public domain her own children, the circumstances of their conceptions and what she thinks about the father. It sits ill for a person to come to court arguing for privacy for her children when, just a very short while earlier, she took a payment from the press to visit the European football championship with her son dressed in an England football shirt with the name &#8216;Daddy&#8217; on the back, and to be willingly photographed doing this to provide journalistic fodder which the newspapers were only too happy to use. If the children suffer any harm from the publicity of these matters, it has already happened, and it will largely be the result of the mother&#8217;s own decisions and actions. For me, on the facts of this case, the balancing exercise must come down against the mother&#8217;s argument. For me, the right of the press to scrutinise and comment upon the court&#8217;s procedures and decisions, and what the mother has requested of the father and how he has responded, are on this occasion a greater priority. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span class="within-new" style="color:initial">This conclusion applies also in relation to the press being permitted to name the children involved here. The names of the four children of the father&#8217;s marriage are very frequently cited in many of the press articles referred to above, as is the name of the parties&#8217; older child Kairo. The name of the parties&#8217; younger child Kinara does appear in some coverage, but certainly less than the others, although I have noticed that the mother sometimes appears in photographs with a necklace including the initials &#8216;KW&#8217;, although this could refer to either of her children (or indeed the father). I can see no benefit to the children or anybody else in the court trying to impose restrictions to prevent the reference to the names of the five children already widely publicised. How would they be helped if a newspaper article referred to un-named children whose names are already well known in the public domain? It would in my view also be quixotic and unhelpful to impose a restriction just on Kinara&#8217;s name when the other children were being named (and in any event it is very possible to find Kinara&#8217;s name on the internet with a small amount of searching). I also consider it very likely, having heard her evidence, that the mother will be tempted, one way or another and whatever any transparency order says, to seek defiantly to put in the public domain her views about the court&#8217;s findings and also further views she may have about the father. In these circumstances it is my view preferable that anybody interested in the topic should have the opportunity to read the full independent account contained in this judgment before reaching any conclusions about what has happened.</span></p>
