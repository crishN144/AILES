	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue arising in this judgment is whether the court has jurisdiction to make orders concerning parental responsibility in a respect of a child, E, born 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2011 and therefore now aged 2 years 7 months.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">E&#8217;s father is English and was born in 1981. Her mother is Polish and was born in 1985. The parties were in a relationship for a short period during which time the mother became pregnant but, before E was born, the relationship broke down. There were allegations of domestic violence and, shortly before E&#8217;s birth, the father was made the subject of a restraining order by the magistrates. He asserts that it was the mother, rather than he, who was responsible for instigating arguments and was violent towards him. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">After E&#8217;s birth, the mother registered the baby in her name only. As a result, the father does not have parental responsibility for the child. Thereafter, his contact with E was infrequent. On 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2012, he filed an application in the county court seeking a parental responsibility order and a prohibited steps order preventing the mother from removing E from the jurisdiction. In his notice of application, the father stated that the mother had indicated that she might return to Poland with the baby. On the same day, without giving notice to the mother, the father appeared in person before District Judge Mildred who made an order forbidding the mother from removing E from the jurisdiction until further order and adjourned the matter for further consideration on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the adjourned hearing on that date, the father again appeared in person. The mother was represented by her solicitor and applied for permission to take E to Poland for a holiday. The father was directed to file a statement in response to this application and the matter was listed for a further hearing on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> May. On 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April, however, the father sent an email to the court in the following terms:</p>

The hearing duly went ahead before District Judge Dancey. The father again appeared in person and the mother was represented by her solicitor. At the hearing, the mother gave oral evidence to the effect that, if she were permitted to take the child to Poland for a visit between 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2012 and 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2012, she would return E to this jurisdiction at the conclusion of the visit. On the basis of that evidence, the father withdrew his objections to the temporary removal of E to Poland. </p>

I am starting a new job&#8230;and need a clear head to focus on the job so I am able to support my daughters, if I am unable to focus on the job at hand I will miss the chance to secure this job and my daughters need me to be able to provide for them, I am going to pray to God that [the mother] sees the light and is guided in the right direction and lets me see my daughter if this takes some time and she does not I will pay again to put in for access. I feel if I carry on this route it will surely make things worse between me and [the mother] and I do not wish this as one day I want to be at least friends for the sake of our daughter, I do miss my daughter so much and I am devastated I have missed the birth of my daughter and going to miss her christening I will be praying I do not miss my daughter&#8217;s first birthday and Christmas, I know how much it affected me not having both my parents in my life and I do not wish this on my daughter if things are not dealt with out of court I will file for access in September 2012 in time to get access to my daughter.

On his behalf Mr Devereux submitted that this was simply a request that the hearing on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> August should not go ahead. Mr Devereux submitted that this email, and its predecessor sent on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April quoted above, are indicative of the father&#8217;s inner turmoil and uncertainty as to the best way to proceed. The father had seen how the proceedings were affecting the mother and was concerned that her feelings would be transmitted to E. He was determined, however, that he should not be excluded from E&#8217;s life.</p>

The order concluded by recording: &#8220;this is a final order&#8221;.

On 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2012, the father&#8217;s application for the summary return of E was started in the Polish courts and heard on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December.

On 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2013, the Polish Central Authority sent documents to the England and Wales Central Authority pursuant to Article 11(6) of Brussels II Revised.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr. Devereux&#8217;s principal submission is that the proceedings launched by the father on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2012 were ongoing at the date of E&#8217;s removal from the jurisdiction. Although the father sent an email to the court on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May which was interpreted by the court as an application to withdraw his application, Mr Devereux relies on the father&#8217;s assertion in his email dated 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May that he had telephoned the court on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May to rescind his application to withdraw made by email the previous day. It is plain from his endorsement on the internal memo that District Judge Dancey regarded the email of 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May as an application to set aside the order of 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May. Mr Devereux therefore submits that the proceedings initiated by the application of 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April are extant. As a result, this court has jurisdiction because those proceedings were started before any proceedings in Poland at a time when E was habitually resident in this country. As a result, this court has jurisdiction under Article 8 of Brussels II Revised, which provides that the courts of a member state of the European Union have jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility over a child who was habitually resident in that member state at the time the court was seised. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The first principle is that habitual residence is a question of fact: has the residence of a particular person in a particular place acquired the necessary degree of stability&#8230;to become habitual?

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The quality of a child&#8217;s stay in a new environment, in which he has only recently arrived, cannot be assessed without reference to the past. Some habitual residences may be harder to lose than others and others may be harder to gain. If a person leaves his home country with the intention of emigrating and having made all the necessary plans to do so, he may lose one habitual residence immediately and acquire a new one very quickly. If a person leaves his home country for a temporary purpose or in ambiguous circumstances, he may not lose his habitual residence there for some time, if at all, and correspondingly he will not acquire a new habitual residence until then or even later. Of course, there are many permutations in between, where a person may lose one habitual residence without getting another. &#8221;</p>

As E had only been absent this country for 14 days prior to 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May, he was still habitually resident in this country at that date.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The undertaking given by the father in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re I</span> was to return the child whenever requested to do so by the court. That open-ended undertaking was interpreted as amounting to an unequivocal acceptance of jurisdiction. The undertaking in the present case was not open-ended but rather time-limited in the sense that the mother was obliged to return E by a fixed date. It seems to me that this is a distinction without a difference. In each case, the parent removing the child was obliged to return the child as directed by the court. Whenever a child is removed on the basis of an undertaking to return the child, that undertaking amounts to an express and unequivocal acceptance that the court to which the undertaking is given retains jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility concerning the child until such time as the undertaking is fulfilled or discharged. On any view, the undertaking, and the concomitant unequivocal acceptance of jurisdiction, remained in effect as at 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2012.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As for the other elements of Article 12.3, E&#8217;s father remained habitually resident in this country at 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2012. E was, and is, herself a national of this country. Plainly therefore, she had, and has, a substantial connection with this country within the meaning of Article 12.3. Furthermore, it was at that date plainly in E&#8217;s best interests for the court to which the undertaking to return had been given to have jurisdiction in relation to matters of parental responsibility. Accordingly, if the proper interpretation of the father&#8217;s email of 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2012 is that it was a fresh application under s.8 of the Children Act, the county court had jurisdiction to entertain the application under Article 12.3, even if E had by that date ceased to be habitually resident in this country.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The current application is brought in the proceedings started in 2012. It follows, therefore that this court has jurisdiction to hear the application under Article 12.3. Having reached a clear conclusion that the court has jurisdiction on that basis, I find it unnecessary to embark on the detailed factual enquiry required to determine whether either of the other bases for jurisdiction are made out. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I indicated to Mr. Devereux in the course of the argument, however, it seems to me necessary for this court to consider its power under Article 15 of Brussels II Revised to transfer the case to a court in Poland where E and her mother have now been living for over two years. Mr. Devereux indicated that he would wish to have time to consider this issue, stating that he was unaware of any previous case where a court had made a request under Article 15 in respect of a child who had been abducted. Accordingly, I agreed to adjourn consideration of that issue to a further hearing, and made directions for that hearing, including a direction that the mother must attend the hearing, directions for the filing of evidence relevant to the issue of a transfer of the case, permission for the father to obtain an expert report as to the legal procedures and principles that would determine an application for the equivalent of a parental responsibility order and a child arrangements order in Poland, and a request for a welfare check to be carried out and delivered to the court via the respective Central Authorities under Article 55. </p>
