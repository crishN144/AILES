	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The court is concerned with an application for a parental order in relation to a young boy Z,  now sixteen months of age.  The applicants are Mr W and Ms X.  The first respondent is Ms Y. She is the gestational surrogate who carried Z, following a surrogacy agreement entered into between the parties on 18&#160;June&#160;2019 through the New Life Surrogacy Agency (the Agency), which is in based in Tbilisi, Georgia.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">As a result of orders made previously by this court, Z was joined as a party to these proceedings, and is represented by Cafcass Legal through his Children's Guardian, Ms&#160;Doyle.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The central issues the court is concerned with at this hearing is the focus on two particular matters in relation to the section 54 criteria.  Firstly, whether the applicants who are in a platonic relationship, satisfy the requirement in section 54(2)(c) that they are two persons who are living as partners in an enduring family relationship and secondly, whether there are any particular features of this case that raise public policy issues, such that would prevent the court making a parental order.</p>

	    <num>4</num>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">It is clear that this application has taken some time to each a final hearing, but as Ms&#160;Stanley pointed out during submissions at this hearing, it is extremely important for the parental order reporter appointed in cases such as this (including when her role changes to become the Children's Guardian) and for the court to carefully consider these applications.  By their very nature, they affect the fundamental legal status and relationship in a life-long way between Z and the applicants.  Therefore, it is critically important that if the court considers that further inquiries are needed, or further information is required to be put before the court, those steps should be taken.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Turning briefly to the background to this matter.  Both applicants have known each other since about 1999/2000 when they met in Kiev, they both attended university there.  They remained friends and met again more recently in December 2017, when Mr&#160;W, who by then had moved to London, was on holiday back in Georgia.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Both of the applicants were born in Georgia and until about 2000 lived there.  In 2001, Mr&#160;W came to this jurisdiction and has been largely based here since then.  Ms X worked and was based in Georgia until more recently, although spent two summers in the United Kingdom in 2002 and 2003.  </p>

Ms&#160;X has been working in marketing and currently works for a United States company with a marketing role, although obviously has been undertaking that role remotely more recently.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">They renewed their friendship and their relationship in December 2017.  They both describe having a strong desire to have a child together, even though their relationship was not an intimate one.  They decided in those circumstances to look at surrogacy and made an appointment with the international patient coordinator at the Agency based in Georgia. This was done jointly, as the evidence demonstrates, and they signed an agreement with that agency, including a power of attorney, enabling that agency to sign documents on behalf of the applicants.  </p>

	  <paragraph eId="para_9">
	    <num>9</num>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms X stated that the address in London which was put on that form, was part of their joint intention for the child born as a result of any surrogacy arrangement, to be brought up in the United Kingdom.  </p>

	  <paragraph eId="para_10">
	    <num>10</num>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Both applicants state that whilst they were aware that surrogacy was not available to single people in Georgia, they answered each question they were given honestly, and were not asked if their relationship was a sexual or an intimate one at all.  They therefore say that they dealt with the position transparently with the surrogacy agency in relation to fulfilling their joint wish to be able to have a child together.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The applicants jointly chose the egg donor and the surrogate. Mr&#160;W described meeting the surrogate mother in February 2020, just before Z's birth.  He understood she had been a surrogate before, and was fully aware of the documents which would be necessary for her to sign to support the application for a parental order that was anticipated would be made here.  The applicants were kept updated during the pregnancy by the pregnancy coordinator who was allocated by the agency, and in their joint statements the applicants described their joy when they first met Z following his birth.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Following Z's discharge from the clinic in Tbilisi after his birth, the applicants and Z stayed in Mr&#160;W's apartment in Tbilisi.  They had the support of Mr&#160;W's mother, but limited other visitors because by that time the global health pandemic was beginning to affect all countries, and there was caution in relation to the number of visitors.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr&#160;W had to return back to London in March 2020, due to his work commitments and the complexities raised by the travel restrictions that were likely to be brought in place.  Z remained in Tbilisi in Georgia, being cared for by Ms&#160;X and Mr&#160;W's mother.  It took about three months for Z's birth certificate to be produced in September 2020 because of the difficulties caused by the restrictions and the health pandemic.  This enabled the passport application to be able to be made to Her Majesty's Passport Office on 15&#160;October 2020, for the reasons caused by the global pandemic there were delays in processing that application.  Z's passport was not received until February 2021. He came to this jurisdiction on 22 April 2021, to the accommodation where the applicants live with him and that is where he has remained.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The difficulties in travelling between the jurisdictions was affected by the Covid restrictions.  Mr&#160;W in fact returned to Georgia in September&#160;2020, at the time when the birth certificate was available.  Both Mr&#160;W and Ms X came to this jurisdiction on 23 November&#160;2020 to prepare the flat in London for Z's arrival, not anticipating the further delays that would be encountered, not only by the passport delays, but also by the further restrictions as a result of the worsening position with the pandemic.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The first hearing in this case took place in January 2021 and as it was adjourned until April 2021, Ms&#160;X went back to Georgia to be able to resume the care of Z, who had been looked after by Mr&#160;W's mother during the period between November 2020 and January 2021. Ms X remained caring for him until Mr&#160;W went out to Georgia and they were all able to come back to this jurisdiction in April 2021.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The C51 application for a parental order was initially made by Mr&#160;W as a single applicant on 13 August 2020.  It was resubmitted as a joint application on 13&#160;January&#160;2021.  The matter was first listed before me on 28 January 2021, when Z was joined as a party to the proceedings.  Directions were made for a hearing on 27&#160;April&#160;2021, which was adjourned to a hearing today with directions for further evidence to be filed.</p>

Initially Ms Roddy's report dated 18 January 2021 set out her concerns then in relation to the circumstances and the further evidence that was required.  Subsequently, the parental order reporter role was taken on by Ms Doyle, and she became the Children's Guardian when Z was joined as a party. Her report is dated 29 June 2021.</p>

Ms&#160;Roddy on 20 November 2020, 6 and 13 January 2021 and Ms Doyle on 12&#160;March&#160;2021.  All of those were by way of remote communication save that Ms Doyle was able to arrange a home visit to the family home in London on 28&#160;May&#160;2021.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In addition, the court has a letter dated 15 April 2021 in relation to Ms X's immigration position.  Essentially, Ms X is here under a time-limited visa.  Whilst this application is governed and driven by Z's welfare needs that letter makes clear is that if this court does make a parental order it may enhance the likelihood of Ms X being able to secure her immigration position here by way of an application for leave to remain.  I make it clear this court is only and primarily concerned with Z's welfare needs.  What, if any, outcome there is to any application which is made in relation to Ms X's immigration position will be entirely a matter for the relevant Secretary of State.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The court is extremely grateful for the very helpful and full skeleton arguments which have been provided, not only by Ms Cantor-Freedman on behalf of the applicants, but also by Ms&#160;Stanley on behalf of the child.  The legal framework within which the court is considering this application is section 54 of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008.If the criteria set out in that Act are met the court needs to consider whether making a parental order will meet the life-long welfare needs of Z, having regard to the matters set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref>.</p>

	  <paragraph eId="para_21">
	    <num>21</num>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to the section 54 criteria, there is no issue that sections 54(1), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (8) are met.  I can deal with them relatively briefly.  The evidence establishes that Z was carried by the respondent surrogate and the biological connection between Z and one of the applicants, namely Mr&#160;W, as a result of the DNA test which is in the court bundle.  </p>
	    </content>
	  </paragraph>
	  <paragraph eId="para_22">
	    <num>22</num>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, the court needs to be satisfied that Z had his home with the applicants at the time when the application was issued, and at the time when the court is considering making the order.  From the history I have just set out, it is clear Z has had his home largely, save for the period between November 2020 and January 2021, with either one of the applicants or both of them.</p>

	  <paragraph eId="para_23">
	    <num>23</num>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The court, in considering whether Z had his home with the applicants at the time when the application was issued, needs to take a wide and purposeful construction of this provision.  It is quite clear from the information that the court has that the applicants and Z's Article 8 rights to family life had been established.  They were having to navigate the difficulties that had been caused as a result of the Covid restrictions in being able to manage, including Mr&#160;W being able to continue with his work and the delays that had taken place regarding Z's birth certificate being produced in Georgia and, also, the delays in the subsequent passport application being processed.  </p>

	  </paragraph>
	  <paragraph eId="para_24">
	    <num>24</num>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">When considering the evidence as a whole, Z had his home with the applicants at the time when the application was issued, whether that is taken as August 2020, when he was in Georgia, or in January 2021, when he remained in Georgia.  When one of the applicants was not physically present with Z, they remained in very regular contact with Z and had responsibility in relation to the care which was being provided for him.  I am therefore satisfied in the circumstances of this case that criteria is met.</p>

	  <paragraph eId="para_25">
	    <num>25</num>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The court also needs to be satisfied that both of the applicants are over eighteen years of age, and they are.  Mr&#160;W has a domicile of origin in Georgia.  What is submitted on his behalf is that he now has a domicile of choice in this jurisdiction.  In considering whether that is established, the court needs to consider whether what has been demonstrated is an intention to permanently and indefinitely reside in this jurisdiction.  </p>

However, from the evidence the court has, in particular what is set out in the second joint statement dated 5 March, he has made his life here.  He set out the detail in relation to the education he has undertaken here, the work he has done here following completing his Master's, and also the purchase of properties here, not only the property he lives in at the moment, but other property as well.  He pays, through his employment, taxes here and his pension is based here.  He became a British citizen in&#160;September 2010, and he set out at the end of his statement dated 5 March 2021 as follows,</p>

It was identified by Ms&#160;Stanley that the English version of the Form A101A and the translated version in Georgian had a difference; namely that Ms X's name was added into the bottom part of the consent in the Georgian version, which was not in the English version.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The court was able to deal with that when Mr&#160;W gave oral evidence to the court today, which I accept, where he was able to interpret from the Georgian version what it said. It confirmed exactly the same as in the English version, but with the additional name of Ms&#160;X.  I am satisfied that that is what the Georgian document says, and there is no need for any further delay for an English translation.  I am fortified in that by a number of other parts of the evidence.  </p>

That has both applicants in that application, and post-dates the consent of the 7 August 2020.  Secondly, the reference in Ms&#160;Roddy's report at paragraph&#160;51-53 of her conversation with the respondent surrogate on 18&#160;January&#160;2021, where she made it quite clear she had no objection or any observations to make as to whether, in fact, the consent was to the applicants jointly having a parental order or a sole application.  I am therefore satisfied that that consent can be relied upon by the court.</p>

This was a commercial surrogacy arrangement which was entered into in a jurisdiction where such arrangements are permitted.  It has been helpfully set out in the applicant's first statement.  The payments that were made to the respondent surrogate during the period of the pregnancy and up until February 2020 totals &#163;15,850.  Secondly, payments that were made to the agency total &#163;17,460 plus a figure which seems to be in dollars of $2,500.  </p>

In the circumstances in this case the court can authorise that element of those payments pursuant to s54(8).</p>

As has been set out in the extracts the court has been referred to from that judgment, namely paragraphs 18, 27-28 and 29, the references in that decision to the debate that took place in Parliament prior to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref>.

Whilst there was a concern at the early stages of these proceedings as to whether there had been transparency and frankness with the Georgian authorities, it being recognised Georgian law does not permit single applicants to have children by surrogacy.  The applicants' behaviour, however, has been consistent with their intention and their arrangement of wanting to be able to have a child together, to be able to bring that child up, albeit within a platonic relationship setting.  This has been demonstrated by the applicants&#8217; commitment, in particular by Ms X, to Z in providing his care, not only in Georgia but since their arrival here in this jurisdiction.</p>

They have both shown a commitment to him since birth, and there is no information before me to question this.  The parenting arrangement they have come to is likely to be tested.  Not only should the parents move on to establish their own romantic relationships and, perhaps, further children, but Z will also have questions about the way in which he was created, conceived and the nature of the relationship between his parents.  The unit that they have created for Z is a family relationship which is enduring, and the intended parents are committed to providing Z with honest and age-appropriate explanation about his creation, which is the best way to ensure that he feels safe, secure and develops a positive sense of who he is."</span></p>
