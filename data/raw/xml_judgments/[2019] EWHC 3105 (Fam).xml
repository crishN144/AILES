It follows that he had lived as a male for nearly 19 years at the point when he married JP who is a woman, and who was born a woman.  At the time of the marriage in 2009, AP had not obtained a Gender Recognition Certificate (referred to in this judgment as a &#8216;GRC&#8217;), and his birth certificate had not been changed; his birth certificate showed him still as a female. </p>

He was advised that his marital status could not be recognised. Despite a letter from AP&#8217;s general practitioner in 1990 confirming that AP had &#8220;now had surgery and other treatment for gender reassignment&#8221;, he was still legally female and was so at the time he purported to enter into the marriage with JP.  AP understood the advice from the DWP to be that if he wished the marriage to be recognised as lawful, he would have to either obtain a declaration of validity or he would need to &#8216;re-marry&#8217; her, but legally as a man. </p>

But it should be noted that the issuing of a passport is done under the Royal Prerogative and as such, there are no legislative requirements as to the manner in which a person&#8217;s sex is described (although the current policy is that a person must identify themselves as either male or female): see <span style="font-style:italic">R (Elan-Cane) v.

If AP requires clarification that his marriage to JP is void, he may (subject to what I say at [75] below) apply for a decree of nullity. </p>
