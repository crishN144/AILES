She is a citizen of the Lebanon but, as I will describe, she currently lives in London. The parents married in July 2005 with lavish ceremonies in both Oman and the Lebanon, which the mother told me cost in aggregate about US $5.5 million plus the cost of a specially chartered large aircraft. The whole cost was paid by the father, and that set the tone for the very high standard of living during the marriage.  </p>

In July 2017 the mother, who by then was habitually resident in England and Wales, issued a petition for divorce here in England. Before it had been served on the father he divorced her in Oman in October 2017.  </p>

They bought a house in Fulham, in the name of the mother, and she and the children have lived there continuously ever since. Both parents agree that the main motivation for the move was so that their children could be educated in England. The father himself says at paragraph 7 of his statement dated 13 December 2017 (now at bundle page C32) that </p>

They are all well settled and happy in their schools here and all have many friends here. It is beyond argument that all three children are habitually resident here and, accordingly, that this court has jurisdiction over them and their welfare. Further, in the eyes of English law and that of the Member states of the European Union, this court, being a court of the state in which the children are habitual resident, is the court of primary jurisdiction.  </p>

The court of the Sultanate of Oman, in the name of HRH Sultan Qaboos bin Said, has very recently made a judgment and order in relation to the children to which I will refer again below. The formal judgment and order does not expressly recite the basis upon which that court has exercised jurisdiction, but I have no reason to doubt, and indeed I respectfully and unreservedly accept, that the courts in Oman </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.01in">During October 2017 the children spent a holiday with their father in Oman from which he duly returned them to England and their mother. The father also saw them regularly here in England. However he appears to have ceased living in England since about January 2018, and the tragic fact is that the last time he saw, or attempted to see, his children face to face was during an outing with them in London on 28 January 2018. I am unclear as to whether the father has ever even been in England or the UK since about that date. He speaks to the children quite regularly by ringing the landline telephone at the mother&#8217;s house. But although the children have iPhones (provided by him) and access to computers, he has not sought to communicate with them visually by such now standard means as FaceTime or Skype.  </p>

She said that he is very isolated. He lives in a cocoon. He does not have friends, but only an entourage. He does not engage in modern forms of communication such as FaceTime, and in fact she would have been surprised had he attempted to do so.  </p>

Following the divorce in Oman the mother applied pursuant to Part III of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984</ref> for financial relief following an overseas divorce. I myself have twice heard significant, but interim, hearings under that application on 19 April and 24 July 2018. My judgments of those dates have been transcribed and are publicly available on the Bailii website under neutral citation numbers <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2018/1214" uk:canonical="[2018] EWHC 1214 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] EWHC 1214 (Fam)</ref> and <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2018/2436" uk:canonical="[2018] EWHC 2436 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] EWHC 2436 (Fam)</ref> respectively.

He has not paid any of the costs funding of &#163;240,000 payable by six monthly instalments between May and October 2018, and the wife now owes her solicitors over &#163;450,000. As I described in my judgment of 24 July 2018, the father had nevertheless paid &#163;95,000 to his new solicitors, Stewarts, in the space of one month in June / July 2018 alone.  I made a pound for pound order on 24 July 2018. The father&#8217;s reaction has been to cease to instruct or fund any solicitors at all, but still he has not paid a penny towards the wife&#8217;s legal costs.  </p>

As the evidence of both the mother and the independent children&#8217;s guardian, Ms Kay Demery of Cafcass, make quite clear, each of the children are in fact very well settled and happy here and in their schools here. They wish to see their father. They do not wish to live, or go to school in Oman. Further, I am crystal clear that, whatever the father may protest, the children would not be permitted to live with, or be cared for by, their mother in Oman and she would be largely, if not wholly, excluded from their lives. That, further, is the language of the very recent court order made in Oman last week on 23 October 2018. It provides that &#8220;custody of the children should be removed from [the mother]&#8221;. </p>

As I understand it, the mother applied during the currency of her existing leave for an extension which is still under consideration by the Home Office.  So she, too, is currently still lawfully here. The twins, however, are not. Their leave expired when they attained the age of 11 and the parents did not apply before its expiry for an extension. </p>

Later, Mr Justice MacDonald took the view that many of the allegations were unnecessarily historical, and by paragraph 6 of his order dated 2 March 2018, now at bundle page B84, he limited the allegations upon which the mother could seek to rely to those numbered 4, 5, 17, 18 and 19 in the Scott schedule.  </p>
