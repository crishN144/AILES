The mother believes that there were proceedings concerning R&#8217;s children.  The mother alleges that her family made it clear to her that, following R&#8217;s divorce, she was to have nothing to do with R, that the family were to be loyal to R&#8217;s husband and that the family hounded and threatened R. R has subsequently remarried, but lives elsewhere and relations between her and the grandparents are currently distant at best.</span></p>

Because T, who would have been in her early 20s, kept seeing the boy behind her family&#8217;s back, she was sent to the grandparents' home in Islamabad.  The mother says that T was badly beaten by the grandfather and by her own father and brother S (now sister F&#8217;s husband).  She heard this and she believes that her brother G and sister M did too; she could not say whether sister F also knew.  T was tied to one of the upstairs toilets, where she remained for a week.  She was given a little food, but was wetting herself and unable to move.  She would cry for help.  It was in the summer, no window was open and the room stank.  T was then taken back to her village and a couple of months later they heard she had died.  There were several conversations in the family saying that she had brought shame on them and that she did not deserve to live.  The mother described what happened to T as deeply upsetting.</span></p>

Present were the grandmother, sister R&#8217;s husband I, cousin M and the grandmother, who kicked and punched her, mainly in the stomach. Cousin M was willing to marry her, but the grandmother strongly objected because one of his brothers was already married to sister R, while the father was the son of another of the grandmother&#8217;s sisters.  The grandmother says that she would never accept the child as her grandchild.  At another time, the grandfather put a small kitchen knife to her throat and said that she had dishonoured him.  The grandparents arranged for her to marry the father within a few days.  The event took place quickly and with little ceremony.  The mother said that she was upset and held her head down throughout and that there are no pictures of the event that can now be seen.  She describes the marriage as a relationship that she was put into by her parents without her consent.  After the wedding, her father did not speak to her for two or three years, but her relationship with her mother improved after L was born.</span></p>

She explained that a number of family members and close guests had come back to the grandparents' home after a celebration of S&#8217;s wedding at a wedding hall.  She was in a bedroom, getting changed, when the father walked in.  He was angry that pictures of his family had not been taken.  She started to shout at him and it turned into a physical fight, during which the father grabbed her by the throat.  Voices were very raised and guests who were outside in the lounge area came in &#8211; Mr IM (who gave evidence), sister F and her husband, and brother G&#8217;s wife N.  IM grabbed the father off her and took him out.  The mother was very upset and remained in the bedroom for a couple of hours, during which time the grandfather came in and started shouting at her for making a scene.  She suffered a lot of pain and some redness around the neck.  At that point she considered that the marriage, which had been going through a rough time before, was over and she did not speak to the father while she remained in Pakistan.  The grandmother was unhappy that she was not doing more to make the relationship work.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The mother&#8217;s dishonesty about her dealings with a serious drug dealer and his associates is deplorable.  The court relies upon parents to tell the truth so that the right decisions can be taken in relation to children.  The mother&#8217;s lies have made it harder for the court to do this.  She has gone to considerable lengths to cover up the fact and extent of her relationship with Mr B, and even now I have no confidence that she has given a full or truthful account.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:12pt">However, having had a full opportunity to consider this issue while judgment has had to be reserved, I conclude that the mother&#8217;s lies do not undermine her other allegations.  Her explanation &#8211; that she was attempting to protect herself and the children, and that she was embarrassed &#8211; is credible when one considers this family history.    </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:12pt">I take account of the fact that the reason given by the mother for her flight is at one level linked to her allegations, but I find the family&#8217;s suggestion that she has invented these detailed allegations as a smokescreen for her involvement with a drug gang quite uncompelling.  Whatever the depth of the mother&#8217;s involvement with undesirable people, I do not see why it would have been necessary for her to lie (or indeed go to the police or to a refuge) if she did not in some way fear for her safety.  If the family philosophy is as benign and supportive as its members protest, her actions would have been unnecessary.  Likewise, the grandparents&#8217; assertion that they have never known why sister R left the family (twice) is not credible. </span></p>

This code may have led sister R to absent herself from this bitter family dispute and it places sisters F and S in a very difficult position.  Although they are both educated persons, they are not free agents.  </span></p>

She began to associate with people who were involved in drug-dealing in the area of the family home and from September 2010, if not before, she became involved in a relationship with the ringleader, Mr B, by whom she now has a child.  The mother has persistently lied about these matters and the truth is not yet known; however, this does not invalidate her allegations against her family or the father. </span></p>

The mother alleges that her family have made threats to kill her and have said that they want to take away the children.  While it would not be safe to discount the existence of risk in the light of my findings, I reach no further conclusions at this stage.  I will hear from the parties as to how the matter should now be progressed.</span></p>
