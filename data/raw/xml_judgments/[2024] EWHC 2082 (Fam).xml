The applicants made payments amounting to &#163;16,726.00 and I note that the clinic was responsible for paying this sum to the surrogate. The amount  received is evidenced by  invoices produced in the court bundle. As at today&#8217;s exchange rate, Y received &#163;4,851.44. The parental order reporter who has previous experience of surrogacy arrangements by this particular agency, stated that it was her understanding that the compensation payments for surrogacy arrangements were generally between &#163;3000-&#163;4000. This amount would be in line with the minimum wage in Nigeria and payments made by way of surrogate compensation  in Nigeria. On production of the invoices, it has now been confirmed that the payments made to the surrogate as compensation were closer to &#163;5000. Notwithstanding this minor discrepancy, I am satisfied, however, that these payments are lawful in Nigeria and were in accordance with the surrogacy agreement. There seems to be no abuse of public policy: the payments were necessary and proportionate and Y did receive the amount paid to her. Above all, when authorising the payments, I have taken into account that XW`s welfare is paramount. He needs a parental order to recognise and cement his place in his family. I thus retrospectively authorise the payments made.</p>

It is central to his being, whether as an individual or as a member of his family. As Ms Isaacs correctly puts it, this case is fundamentally about X&#8217;s identity and his relationship with the commissioning parents. Fundamental as these matters must be to the commissioning parents they are, if anything, even more fundamental to the child. A parental order has, to adopt Theis J&#8217;s powerful expression, a transformative effect, not just in its effect on the child&#8217;s legal relationships with the surrogate and commissioning parents but also, to adopt the Guardian&#8217;s words in the present case, in relation to the practical and psychological realities of X&#8217;s identity. A parental order, like an adoption order, has an effect extending far beyond the merely legal. It has the most profound personal, emotional, psychological, social and, it may be in some cases, cultural and religious consequences.&#8221;</span></p>

M has lived and worked in London since 2009 and married F in 1999 who himself had British nationality. XW has dual nationality and has British and Nigerian citizenship. M confirmed to Ms Callaghan that she intends to live in London and raise XW here. M trained as a paediatric nurse and plans to return to work after a period of parental leave. She has a joint council tenancy and is in the process of transferring this into her sole name. Notwithstanding F&#8217;s death, she was steadfast in her intention to return to this jurisdiction and  resume life here.  I am more than satisfied that she has abandoned her domicile of origin in Nigeria and acquired a domicile of choice in this jurisdiction. Thus, I am satisfied both limbs in s 54 (4) are made out in the circumstances of this case. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Finally, I turn to the issue of consent. It is, of course, as Mr Powell says, the cornerstone of the statutory criteria. Y signed the A101A form. It confirms she sought legal advice. It confirms it was signed in the presence of a notary and bears the seals of a notary public. It is thus in accordance with the procedural requirements of paragraph 13.11(4)(c) of the Family Procedure Rules 2010. The A101A form requires Y to sign this with full knowledge of what is involved in the making of a parental order. The form A101A shows that the surrogate consents to her status as a parent being extinguished as a matter of English law. The first applicant&#8217;s solicitor wrote to the surrogate as I have indicated, informed her that the second applicant had died and that it was likely a parental order would be made at this hearing.  I have indicated that Y, through the surrogacy agency, replied to the letter expressing her condolences and confirming that she did not wish to stand in the way against the extinguishing of her parental rights and transferring them to M. I am satisfied that her consent stands at the time of this hearing as it did at the time of the form A101A being signed despite the F&#8217;s untimely death. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Thus, having satisfied myself that the statutory criteria are made out, I remind myself that I must look at XW&#8217;s lifelong welfare, having regard to the welfare checklist in the Adoption and Children Act 2002. Parental orders are serious orders. Like adoption orders, they create  a lifelong relationship between the applicants and the child  going beyond childhood to adulthood. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The parental order report makes it clear that XW is thriving in M&#8217;s care. He is plainly a much loved, much wanted and much cherished little boy. He needs a parental order to give permanency and security to his care arrangements in circumstances  where no-one else other than the applicants sought to give lifelong care for him. I agree with Mr Powell&#8217;s submission that it is fundamental to the welfare evaluation in this case that XW is recognised as a child of both intended parents and that, as a donor conceived child, his unique life story should be reflected legally. His parentage is woven throughout his identity which is integral to his overall welfare.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">XW needs a full understanding of how he came to be born and will require support and love to deal with this information as and when it becomes known to him. I was pleased to read in CC&#8217;s report that M confirmed she would share the details of his conception and birth when he is old enough to understand this. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">For M, this is a very poignant moment. Today, there has been the creation of a legal and unbreakable bond which ties her and F to XW. She did not need a piece of paper to confirm that she and the F loved each other and loved XW but now there is a legal status which reflects to the world the love they had for one another and for XW. I offer her and XW my congratulations on what I know is a very difficult day. </p>
