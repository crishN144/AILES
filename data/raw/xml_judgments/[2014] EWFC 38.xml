	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.32in">On 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April, 2014 Leicester City Council (&#8216;the local authority&#8217;) applied to the court for a care order in respect of a little girl, H.  H is now aged 17 months.  She was born on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May, 2013.  Her mother is J (&#8216;the mother&#8217;).  Her father is D (&#8216;the father&#8217;).  The case now comes before the court for final hearing. Most issues are agreed. The parents agree that the threshold set by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.31(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> is satisfied on the basis set out in an agreed threshold document. All parties agree that the appropriate welfare outcome is that there should be a supervision order for a period of 12 months. A supervision support plan has been agreed. Final orders can now be made, thus completing the case within 26 weeks as required by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/32/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.32(1)</ref>(a) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.</p>

Their claim is brought pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/7/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.7(1)</ref>(b) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref>. Pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.8</ref> they seek relief in the form of declarations and damages. The local authority accepts that by its conduct it has breached the parents Article 6 and Article 8 rights. It agrees to most of the declarations sought by the parents. It does not agree that the parents are entitled to damages. </p>

The local authority concluded that H was at risk of significant harm from her parents due to the concealed pregnancy, the parents&#8217; learning needs and their limited support networks and that it would therefore be unsafe to discharge H into her parents&#8217; care at that time.</p>

The parents were still concerned about not being able to take H home, but were equally concerned about H being placed in care with strangers. They therefore put forward the names of Mr and Mrs B as people they trusted to care for H. The social worker accepted this information as an indication of the parents&#8217; consent to the placement of H with Mr and Mrs B and then contacted Mrs B to discuss the situation and arrange a visit.</p>

The social worker was also concerned that the parents appeared not to have fully understood what they were agreeing to when H was placed with Mr and Mrs B. The parents were anxious to know when H would be returned to their care.</p>

Previously, he was reasonably well controlled on a combination of drugs and prior to May he could go a week or two between seizures.  According to his partner, during his seizures he goes stiff, his eyes flicker, he screams and [he] may foam at the mouth. He is unaware during these attacks but they are brief, lasting less than a minute. They can occur asleep or awake and are what are called &#8220;complex partial seizures&#8221;.&#8217;</p>

The judge awarded damages of &#163;100 for each parent. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal against the finding that there had been a breach of Article 6. The award of damages therefore fell away. However, it is in my judgment again implicit in their Lordship&#8217;s judgments that where the court in care proceedings finds that there has been a breach of a Convention right it has the power to make an award of damages under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.8</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref>.

It seems from passages both in the judgment itself and also in the judge's later judgment when he refused permission to appeal, that the judge considered that once he had found there had been a breach of a right under the Convention then he was bound in some way to mark that by an award of damages.</p>

There are also pre-conditions to an award of damages by a domestic court under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/8/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8: (1)</ref> that a finding of unlawfulness or prospective unlawfulness should be made based on breach or prospective breach by a public authority of a Convention right; (2) that the court should have power to award damages, or order the payment of compensation, in civil proceedings; (3) that the court should be satisfied, taking account of all the circumstances of the particular case, that an award of damages is necessary to afford just satisfaction to the person in whose favour it is made; and (4) that the court should consider an award of damages to be just and appropriate. It would seem to be clear that a domestic court may not award damages unless satisfied that it is necessary to do so, but if satisfied that it is necessary to do so it is hard to see how the court could consider it other than just and appropriate to do so. In deciding whether to award damages, and if so how much, the court is not strictly bound by the principles applied by the European Court in awarding compensation under article 41 of the Convention, but it must take those principles into account. It is, therefore, to Strasbourg that British courts must look for guidance on the award of damages.&#8217;</p>

It was not until June 2014 that these parents eventually managed to secure the return of their daughter to their care, exactly a year after she was placed with Mr and Mrs B. Whilst it is true that during that year the parents were having regular contact, supervised contact at a local authority contact centre is far removed from the joys of fulltime, unsupervised care of one&#8217;s own child. The residential assessment which began in June 2014 could have begun a year earlier. The cognitive assessment of the parents, not finally obtained until May 2014, could have been obtained months earlier.

The applicants, who are usually the parents of the children in question, have generally been successful in recovering substantial damages. In making such awards, the Strasbourg Court has acknowledged the considerable distress and in some cases the loss of opportunities suffered, and has shown a greater willingness to speculate than in other types of case. The Court has been prepared in some cases to compensate the applicant for a &#8216;loss of relationship&#8217; with his or her child. Perhaps these features of the Court&#8217;s treatment of the case-law in this area can be attributed to the importance of the right in question and the lasting impact that a decision to place children in care will have on both the applicants and their children.&#8217;</p>
