	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:10pt">The application before me is an unusual one. The applicant local authority, represented by Mr Roger McCarthy QC, wishes to publish a report (the Report), commissioned by the local Area Child Protection Committee (the ACPC) as a result of care proceedings taken by the local authority in respect of 6 children. The initiation of the care proceedings disclosed matters which the ACPC felt were of sufficient public concern for it to set up an inquiry and invite experienced professionals to investigate and to report. There are objections to the publication of the Report by the principal person involved (Ms A), represented by Mr Allan Levy QC and Miss Joanna Hall, by the Official Solicitor representing several children but more important a group of vulnerable adults, represented by Miss Angela Hodes, and by the NHS Strategic Health Authority represented by Mr Richard Booth.  Mr Richard White attended on behalf of an adoption charity, the Agency, and I permitted him informally to make written and oral submissions. </span></p>

Ms A, who is now 64, over many years acted as a foster mother to children with particular difficulties, first in London and then in a large property in the country (the Home). She became a most valuable source of help to many local authorities.  Most of the children she fostered, she later adopted and she eventually drew under her wing a large family of vulnerable young people, some of whom were adopted by her in their late teens. Most of those she adopted or fostered remained with her after becoming adults. At least two were married there and the children of some residents also lived there. A few vulnerable young people came to live with her when they were already grown up. She collaborated in a book written about her work over many years with these children and young people. </span></p>

Ms A had rescued her when she was a teenager and allowed her to play a major part in the running of the home. The judgment of Hughes J, handed down in open court on the 23</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:10pt">rd </span><span style="font-size:10pt">February 2001, sets out in some detail the advantages and disadvantages of the Home and those who managed it.   </span></p>

The local authority then commenced care proceedings in respect of those children but subsequently withdrew them in respect of the 6 eldest. In December 1998 the ACPC commissioned a panel (the Panel) to sit on an inquiry into the management of the Home and to report to them and drafted the terms of reference, which were later amended. For various reasons the Panel did not begin its task until November 1999 and completed it in September 2002. In the care applications running parallel to the inquiry, Hughes J granted injunctions against publicity on the 22</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:10pt">nd </span><span style="font-size:10pt">February 1999.

Despite those efforts they were unable to meet the objections of the Official Solicitor and of Ms A. The local authority now seeks to publish Volume 1 without any further restrictions.

Where a child may have suffered potentially life-threatening injury or sustained serious and permanent impairment of health or development through abuse or neglect and the case gives rise to concerns about the way in which local professionals and services work together to safeguard children, any agency or professional may refer it to the ACPC chairman if it is believed that there are important lessons for inter-agency working to be learned from the case. Paragraph 8.8 sets out an useful list of questions to be asked in considering whether to set up a Part 8 inquiry. Certain procedures have to be followed as to whether the case does meet the case review criteria. The decision is taken by the chairman of the ACPC and it is the duty of the local authority to inform the Department of Health about every case that becomes the subject of such a review. The local authority gave notice of this case review to the Department of Health. The guidance recognises that reviews will differ widely in breadth and complexity but states that in all cases lessons should be learnt and acted upon as quickly as possible and that reviews should generally be completed within 4 months.</span></p>

In his first, dated the 27</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:10pt">th</span><span style="font-size:10pt"> November 2002, he indicated that the local authority sought the permission of the court to publish Volume 1 since some of the information had been released to the Panel by the orders of Hughes J and Munby J. According to Mr Thomson, the chairman of the Panel had indicated that it was not possible to provide a summary, the view being that the whole report needed to be published. It was thought to be impossible to disentangle the parts which might or might not be subject to the court orders. He referred to the application of the local authority made both in the proceedings before Hughes J and in the exercise of the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction. </span></p>

Given the importance of the recommendations of Volume 1 set out in Chapter 15 which had national implications, it was the expectation of the Department of Health that the Report would be publicly available. The local authority and the ACPC agreed and the Report was written with that expectation in mind. The inquiry had been extremely extensive and had involved an enormous level of public expenditure.</span></p>

The role of the Agency was set out in detail in two chapters and he accepted that professionals would be able to identify the Agency.  He had assumed that Ms A would oppose publication and had not felt it necessary to serve her. </span></p>

Despite the representations of the Official Solicitor a decision had been made that it was not reasonably possible to restrict Volume 1 to the minimum information envisaged by paragraph 8.29 of the Working Together guidance. It is clear from the revised text the parts that had been omitted or revised, and a great deal of factual detail and comments had been omitted. A supplementary explanatory report had been produced to enable anyone who felt s/he had been referred to in the main Report to seek confirmation.

He said that in 2000 the Panel held discussions about publication of the Report with the contributing agencies and the consensus was that Volume 2 would be published to the agencies and Volume 1, subject to anonymisation, would be generally published.

In any event the guidance was bound to be helpful and to be taken into account by the court. He pointed out that in the guidance there was no indication of what should be contained in the executive summary. An essential difference between Volumes 1 and 2 was that Volume 1 included as a main aim the need to publicise the general lessons which the Panel believed needed to be learned from the Review which included many of national importance. The Panel considered that it was essential that lessons were learned from what had happened to date. Any failings in the actions of the agencies should be open to public scrutiny and the public should not be deprived of proper accountability. The tax payers and voters in the area of the local authority had so far been deprived of an opportunity to assess what had been done with the high level of expenditure incurred in carrying out the Review. All the agencies and professionals involved in the Report thought it essential that it should be published. One issue was whether changes in primary or secondary legislation might be necessary consequent upon publication of Volume 1.  The chairman of the Panel had said that it was not possible to produce an executive summary but Mr Thomson suggested that Volume 1 was in effect an extended executive summary. The first draft of Volume 1 was completed in June 2002 and between then and January 2003 the agencies and other professionals had had an opportunity to comment and the amended Report included their comments and corrections.</span></p>

It was an inquiry under the provisions of  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/19/section/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 7</ref> of the 1970 Act which required the Department of Health guidance to be followed and an inquiry which included investigations about the needs of adults could not be held under the Guidance of &#8220;Working Together.&#8221; The Department of Health Guidance covered investigations into children and did not extend to adults. The Terms of Reference which specifically included adults were, he asserted, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt">ultra vires</span><span style="font-size:10pt"> the guidance which had statutory force by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/19/section/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 7</ref> of the 1970 Act and were not covered by any authorisation which the local authority could properly give. Hughes J and the ACPC understood that it was a Part 8 Review and this was not just the question of methodology.  Every document in the inquiry and in these proceedings, including the skeleton argument on behalf of the local authority, was headed Part 8 Review. The reality was that it </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt">was</span><span style="font-size:10pt"> a Part 8 Review. The local authority was therefore restricted to carrying out a Part 8 Review, limited to a consideration of the children in the Home and to publish an executive summary which did not include the vulnerable adults. The parts of the Report which went outside the proper boundaries, were </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt">ultra vires</span><span style="font-size:10pt"> and tainted, in his submission, the entire Report.  Mr Levy asked the rhetorical question, if it was not a Part 8 inquiry what was it and what was its statutory basis?  He submitted that the local authority did not have a discretion to set up any sort of inquiry. He described the Review as a &#8216;rogue inquiry&#8217;.</span></p>

He considered that this was an issue which should be raised in judicial review proceedings and sought an adjournment in order to apply to the Administrative Court. This application was, in my judgment, raised at far too late a stage of the hearing, and I refused an adjournment.  Mr Levy said that Ms A did not have the opportunity to have any involvement or representation in the preparation of the Report. Ms A had asked to be allowed to be heard without involving her lawyers but that request was rejected. She did not see the criticisms in the Report nor have any opportunity to respond to them. This submission seemed to me also to raise issues under article 6. But article 6 issues were not pressed on behalf of Ms A or indeed by any of those opposing the publication of the Report.</span></p>

In the event I did not consider that it was necessary for me to set them out in detail. In some instances, Mr Levy suggested that the findings of the Panel went behind the findings of Hughes J in his judgment. There was also gratuitous mention of unnecessary matters and the introduction of damaging and unjustified material. The findings of Hughes J did not merit the degree of censure of Ms A in the Report. There had been an attempt to demonise Ms A and there was discussion about a cult and accusations were raised which were unfair.  In concentrating upon Ms A and her family the Report spiralled out of control and did not look at the global picture or the extent to which Ms A had been a place of last resort for many local authorities faced with dealing with the most difficult children. It was significant in the light of the criticisms about Ms A that Coleridge J nonetheless made decisions that returned 4 of the vulnerable adults to the Home and to the care of Ms A.  30 years of Ms A&#8217;s life had been under a microscope for 4 years and the effect of publication, 5 years after the police raid, would be that she was still being scrutinised and a picture would be disclosed which would revive undesirable public interest. The Report did not concentrate on inter-agency working, the purpose of the Review. He queried the unnecessary detail of the Report. He submitted that the Report would interfere to a very significant degree with the private lives and the psychological state of mind of the residents and the private life of Ms A. He submitted that to publish it could not be shown to be necessary in a democratic society and would be disproportionate and irresponsible.  </span></p>

The change of title of the Report did not provide sufficient anonymity. The Home was large and an unusual place and the only one of its kind in the county of the local authority. Identification of the local authority would immediately identify the Home. She pointed to Chapter 2 which gave a graphic and identifiable description of the Home. She pointed out that the majority of adults who had lived in the Home as children were given Ms A&#8217;s surname.  The residents of the Home would be identified as a class and as individuals and they would be liable to intrusive publicity and prurient speculation. In the body of the Report allegations of a cult were raised, discussed and then discounted. The effect of telling the story of the Home would be to create the impression that the Home was an unnatural organisation. </span></p>

There were pejorative and muddled explanations and the allegations would lead to finger-pointing at the way in which these vulnerable adults were living. This would be unacceptable intrusion. The Official Solicitor was concerned about the vulnerable adults, whom he specifically represented, who had been required to move out of the Home and had only just returned.  A period of stability was needed and there was a high risk of destabilisation. Even if Chapter 13 was removed (which was not suggested) the Report remained centred on the family and not on inter-agency working, and the Home would be brought to public attention even if not directed specifically at the vulnerable adults. The people living in the Home, both children and adults, needed protection and the court had a duty to protect them and to take positive action to do so. </span></p>

The order of Hughes J granting leave to give documents to the panel was on the assumption that it was a Part 8 Review. She suggested that, despite the editing and further amendments, the focus of Volume 1 remained on Ms A and the residents at the Home rather than on a review of agency policy and professional practice. Miss Hodes questioned why the Report included irrelevant, intrusive and unnecessary details. For instance, why was it necessary to investigate the capacity of the vulnerable adults to contract marriages? She suggested that the form of the Report was a legal foray into an unnecessary investigation and would undoubtedly stimulate Press intrusion which had already happened in the past and had been most upsetting for the residents. She said that publication would be in breach of the right to privacy and to respect for the family life of those people living in the Home in that there was a real and significant risk that publication at this time would destabilise the protected placements and would directly affect the upbringing of the children and the way of life and personal relationships of the vulnerable adults. To publish the Report as it stood with the probability of identification would be unjust to the children and in particular unjust to the vulnerable adults living in the Home. The continuing public interest surrounding this extended family would not abate if Volume 1 was published and the publication would be invasive and disproportionate. Confidential medical and personal information about their lives should not be published.</span></p>

The local authority did not have the right to collate and then to publish whatever it chose to publish. It had to be mindful of the purpose in publishing a Part 8 Review and what was proportionate to its aim in the publication. The Review should be bound by the guidance set out in Part 8. The purpose of an executive summary was to achieve the aim of showing the lessons to be learned without breaching the article 8 rights of those who would be adversely affected by its publication. The local authority had failed to show that there was a legitimate public interest in the publication of the entirety of the Report or that the impetus for public debate was a necessary, relevant and proportionate interference with the article 8 rights. The Official Solicitor had written expressing concern that an executive summary was not being produced. There was no reason why an executive summary could not be prepared in line with the guidance. In her submission the answer to this application was to refuse leave to publish and the Panel could well provide an executive summary which would be the most economical and practical way of dealing with this issue.</span></p>

The Agency had not understood that there would be an intention to publish in detail to the whole world.

Mr McCarthy accepted that giving the inquiry the nomenclature of a Part 8 Review may have been confusing but the title was not significant. The Panel was an independently constituted body. The members had an enormous task which they carried out with professional integrity. They made trenchant comments which might make them professionally unpopular. They had not been given the task of writing an executive summary and they did not do so. He pointed out that the Terms of Reference did not refer to an executive summary. They were aware that the Report would be published but were not responsible for the publication. That was the concern of the ACPC. The view of the members of the Panel was that they could not, on the special facts of this inquiry, write an executive summary. The Panel had now dispersed and it was not feasible nor desirable at this stage to publish an executive summary.</span></p>

He submitted that the purpose of Volume 1 was to make general recommendations in order that lessons might be learnt nationally. There were general questions of significance and lessons to be learnt by agencies other than those engaged in the Review. The Terms of Reference were discussed and agreed with the Department of Health. Normally the local authority would check the question of publication with the Department of Health and this local authority did so. The two parts of the Report were not designed to and could not do the same job. The recommendations in Volume 1 were much more extensive than those in Volume 2. The suggestion that the focus was on the family and not on the agencies was incorrect and was shown to be wrong by the breadth of the conclusions and the recommendations.</span></p>

The protected material was, of course, subject to contempt proceedings if published. He submitted that the local authority had the right to publish 95% of the material even if permission was refused by the court, since the major part of the material lay outside the area which would be covered by contempt proceedings. The major part of the material came from information provided to the inquiry, the judgment given in public by Hughes J, material already in the public domain from press coverage and the book to which Ms A had extensively contributed. Other than the protected material there were no grounds upon which a court had the jurisdiction to restrain publication. Furthermore no applications had been made by any of the parties for orders to restrain publication and no evidence adduced to support the opposition to the applications made by the local authority.</span></p>

It was relevant but not determinative of the issue. The local authority gave its reasons for not involving her. No issue which might arise under article 6 had been relied upon by Ms A.  She had made no application for a specific injunction and within the local authority application she had to prove her case which she had failed to do. The public interest to publish in the present case was overwhelming. </span></p>

He suggested that children, like adults, had no special right to protection from publicity in cases where their welfare was not in issue. If there were questions surrounding harm to children the court would balance the provisions of articles 8 and 10.

The inquiry with which I am concerned was not set up by the Secretary of State but by the local authority and the ACPC.  I agree with the submission of Mr McCarthy that the local authority had the power to initiate the inquiry in the form in which it did. The local authority had wide powers exercisable under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1972/70" uk:canonical="1972 c. 70" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1972 Act</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1972/70/section/111/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 111(1)</ref> and the power to incur expenditure in respect of its functions under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/22/section/137" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 137</ref>. Local authorities also depend upon guidance issued by the Department of Health, see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1970/42" uk:canonical="1970 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1970 Act</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1970/42/section/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 7</ref>.  There appears to me to be no obstacle to a local authority holding an inquiry in any form consistent with the appropriate guidance from the Department of Health and its overall statutory duties. I do not agree with Mr Levy that the local authority acted </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt">ultra vires</span><span style="font-size:10pt"> its powers in the form of the inquiry which it commissioned. The decision to use the model of the Part 8 Review, following the Working Together Guidance and adapting the inquiry to include the vulnerable adults was within their powers.   The local authority in its Terms of Reference and the Panel at the outset made it clear that the scope of the inquiry went beyond the Department of Health guidance. The problem arose in describing and treating the inquiry throughout as a Part 8 Review, even in the wording of the orders of Hughes J and in the claim form filed by the local authority in the present proceedings. It led everyone connected with the Review to believe that the inquiry would be conducted in accordance with the Part 8 guidance and falling within its requirements. The participants in the review process, including even the local authority and the Panel, appear to have been lulled into the belief that the inquiry was actually being held under Part 8.  Certainly the contributing participants seemed to have assumed that at the conclusion of the inquiry an executive summary would be published. The misdescription of the process does not of itself, in my view, invalidate the basis of the inquiry nor demonstrate that the local authority had exceeded its statutory powers nor that the Report was based upon a procedure which was </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt">ultra vires </span><span style="font-size:10pt">the powers of the local authority. The question whether any of those who contributed were misled might  be relevant to the other issues which arise but do not undermine the power of the local authority to commission an inquiry which did not fall within the guidance set out in Part 8 of &#8216;Working Together&#8217;. I am therefore satisfied that the local authority had the power to set up the inquiry and commission the Report. </span></p>

The application now put forward by Mr McCarthy on behalf of the local authority was to the effect that I had a limited jurisdiction to exercise in this case, limited as it was by the scope of the orders made by Hughes J and Munby J, and as I understand the final submissions, I have no jurisdiction to restrain the local authority from publishing all but a tiny portion of the full Report contained in Volume 1. The approach of the local authority has therefore changed from a request to the court to exercise its inherent jurisdiction to give the local authority permission to publish the Report in its entirety. It is now asserted that only about 5% of the Report includes the &#8216;protected&#8217; information subject to court orders.  The remaining 95% is not subject to any restriction the court might wish to impose, and its publication requires no direction or approval of the court.  If Mr McCarthy is right in his submission as to my jurisdiction and only 5% of the Report is covered by court orders, my task is relatively simple since all I would have to decide is whether the orders of Hughes J and Munby J designed to protect the children and the vulnerable adults should be continued beyond the period of the court proceedings. </span></p>

Much of the story of Ms A and the Home have already been set out in the public judgment of Hughes J and in the book to which Ms A contributed. There is therefore much information already in the public domain. The orders of Hughes J and Munby J were clearly designed to protect those under a disability and not to protect Ms A.  Interestingly no real objection was made on behalf of Ms A based on article 6 as to the failure to consult or inform Ms A about the proposed publication and I do not feel that I need to embark upon considerations of article 6.  </span></p>

It is relevant to have in mind that the Review was not open to the public, but an internal overview of inter-agency co-operation. The Report is far from dispassionate or objective in its comments. It dwells at length on the story of Ms A and the residents of the Home. It raises questions such as the existence of a cult, and the suitability of the marriages of two residents. It provides emotive rather than factual descriptions of events and those involved in them. The telling of a sensational story has, in my view, taken over from an objective and summary analysis of an extraordinary situation. Although the recommendations appear to be admirable, I fail however to understand why it was necessary to write not far short of 600 pages of description in order to set out the recommendations.  I also fail to understand why a group of able and experienced professionals were unable to write an executive summary within the broad guidelines of  &#8216;Working Together&#8217;.  It is particularly surprising since the Panel was purporting to act under the guidance of a Part 8 Review which assumes that there would be an executive summary at the conclusion of the inquiry. As the Panel recognised, its Report could not conceivably be so described. The guidance in Part 8 (see above) concentrated on the purpose of a case review and the Panel appeared to see itself as adhering to the spirit of the guidance. Paragraph 8.30 envisaged that the content would be suitably anonymised in order to protect the confidentiality of relevant family members and others. </span></p>

The inevitable consequence would be renewed press and media interest in the Home which would obviously be easily identifiable from existing information in the public domain. This would equally obviously result in visits to the Home which would be intrusive and probably distressing to many of those who continue to live there. In my view, this Report appears to have strayed far from the balanced guidance given in Part 8 whilst purporting to provide a Report within its guidelines.</span></p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:10pt">In weighing the factors in support of publication it has to be taken into account that this inquiry considered a most unusual situation which demonstrated over many years serious failures within disciplines engaged in the protection and welfare of children and serious inter-agency shortcomings. These failures are clearly of sufficient importance to merit an inquiry and to entitle the public to know the relevant facts and where matters went wrong and not to have this information buried without publication. Another factor, stressed by Mr Thompson, was that the ratepayers of the local authority are paying for this inquiry and should know how their money has been spent.  These are powerful arguments in support of publication of the facts in a suitable form in order to explain the recommendations of the Panel. It does not, however seem to me that it is, in itself, a powerful argument for publication of a report which, in its content, strays so far from the intention of its authors to write a report within the spirit of a Part 8 executive summary.  I am, I have to say, surprised that it would not be possible even at this stage to produce a report which fulfilled the description of executive summary.</span></p>

I take into account the effect on the media of the publication of the Report, written as it is in the terms I have set out above.  They might be targeted by journalists or present when adults were targeted. There is a real and substantial risk that press intrusion would be disruptive to their care and adverse to their welfare. I consider that the publication of the Report is therefore likely to be harmful to those children now living in the Home. The children have a right to as much protection of their placement as can be achieved since they can only have been damaged by the moves and the circumstances of this long drawn out saga. The factors supporting the rights and welfare of these 6 children under article 8 and the right of the local authority to publish under article 10 have to be balanced.  To interfere with the article 10 right of freedom of expression would be lawful and would be for the protection of the rights and welfare of these children. I have considered very carefully whether it would be a disproportionate response to the contents of the Report, having regard to the importance attached to it by section 12.  I am, also, fully aware of the factors against restraining publication of Volume 1.  I am satisfied, however, that, the balancing exercise comes down in favour of protection of the children and a restraint on the publication of Volume 1.   I am reinforced in this conclusion by my strong view on the impact of the Report on the vulnerable adults to whom I now turn.  </span></p>

It is a flexible remedy and adaptable to ensure the protection of a person who is under a disability. It has been extended to questions of residence and contact. Until there is legislation passed which will protect and oversee the welfare of those under a permanent disability the courts have a duty to continue, as Lord Donaldson said  in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt">re F</span><span style="font-size:10pt"> (</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt">Mental Patient: Sterilisation)</span><span style="font-size:10pt">, to use the common law as the great safety net to fill gaps where it is clearly necessary to do so.

In the previous cases about adults under a disability, the issues have been the lawfulness of the proposed course of action and considerations as to their best interests. That cannot be the correct approach in the present case. The application of the inherent jurisdiction would seem more appropriately to be treated as the exercise of a &#8216;protective jurisdiction&#8217; rather than a &#8216;custodial jurisdiction&#8217;. In considering whether the publication of the Report would be contrary to the welfare of the vulnerable adults, I propose to approach the issue by balancing their rights under article 8 against the rights given under article 10 and the emphasis given by section 12.

They have had considerable and distressing disruption of their lives and are, as set out in the Report, vulnerable. A period of peace, stability and a chance to settle down again after the very real upset of their lives is threatened by the likely intense media cover if this Report is published. They are all under some disability but not such, as far as I know, as to prevent possibly all of them, but certainly at least 4 of them, from understanding the impact of press and other media intrusion. That intrusion would affect their daily lives and would be very likely to be disruptive, distressing and contrary to the need for them to settle back in the Home.

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:10pt">What is required here is an injunction in negative terms, although not, of course, solely for a limited period. A declaration in the present case is of limited assistance for the protection of adults who are under a disability and are recognised as vulnerable by the local authority seeking to publish a Report which I have decided would be in breach of their article 8 rights and would be seriously detrimental to their welfare. In order to give adequate protection to the vulnerable adults, in my judgment I have to act positively and close the gap. I shall therefore grant an injunction restraining the local authority from publishing Volume 1 in its present form.</span></p>
