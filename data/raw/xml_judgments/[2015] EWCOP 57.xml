As I have said on many other occasions, a will is a highly relevant written statement, and PAW&#8217;s appointment of SJ and BQ as her executors suggests that she trusted them to deal with her financial affairs after her death, and that she thought they would be business-like and capable of coping with the paperwork. </span></p>

I was particularly impressed by his witness statement, and that is why I quoted most of it in paragraph 14 above. It seems to give an articulate and balanced account of the family&#8217;s history and current circumstances, whereas IW&#8217;s four witness statements, which were admissible, were rambling, hysterical and vindictive. </span></p>
