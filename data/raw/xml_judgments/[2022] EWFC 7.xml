He died intestate in France. As a result, under French succession law, the property passes in equal shares to B and his adult sister. B is habitually resident in England. It is necessary, under French law, for the heir (in this case B) to accept his/her succession to a French estate. As a minor, B is not able to do so. If he were resident in France, his surviving parent would be able to accept succession on his behalf by a straightforward, essentially administrative, exercise by application to the <span style="font-style:italic">juge des tutelles</span>.

 <span style="font-size:11pt">Master Matthews (as he then was), sitting in the Chancery Division, was faced with a similar factual situation. After the death of her father, and pursuant to French succession law, the minor child held an interest in a French apartment. The child&#8217;s mother applied for an order to be appointed as agent for the child in order to enter into a contract for sale. The application was put forward in a number of ways, including as an exercise of parental responsibility under s3 of the Children Act 1989. The Master granted the order sought on the basis of private international law enabling him, sitting in an English court, to apply French law. The application accordingly succeeded. But, and of interest to those who practise in the field of Family Law, he concluded that he had no power to grant the relief sought under the Children Act, saying: </span>

 <span style="font-size:11pt">&#8220;25. I have no reason to doubt that the Defendant has parental responsibility for Estelle in English law. But I am not aware of any case law or other authority (and none was cited to me) to the effect that s3 authorises the Defendant to dispose of Estelle&#8217;s immovable property rights. S3(3) in particular refers expressly to her being able to give a good receipt or sue for property belonging to the minor, as if that might otherwise be in doubt (cf Re Chatard&#8217;s Settlement <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/report/1899/elr/1/712" isNeutral="false" canonical="[1899] 1 Ch 712" reportSeries="elr" year="1899" jurisdiction="GB" type="case">[1899] 1 Ch 712</ref>). But it is striking that there is no mention anywhere in s3 of disposal, which goes far beyond receipt and recovery. Taken as a whole, I am not satisfied at present that this section confers powers on those exercising parental authority to enter into a contract to sell immovable property on behalf of a minor.</span>

All matters under the Children Act 1989 are assigned, by the Senior Courts Act 1981, s61 and Sch 1, to the Family Division of the High Court. So judges in the Chancery Division have little or no experience of applications under this Act. It may simply be my own lack of knowledge&#8221;.</span>

 <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt">Hays v Hays</span>
 <span style="font-size:11pt"> is therefore not strictly on point and I have no hesitation in concluding that, on the facts of this case, acceptance of inheritance falls comfortably within the s3 definition. It is plainly the receipt or recovery of property to which the child is entitled. Acceptance of inheritance does not amount to a disposal of property which was the s3 issue before Master Matthews. </span>

 <span style="font-size:11pt">21. It may be that once the inheritance is accepted, M will apply for authorisation to enter into a contract of sale of AC&#8217;s share of the Property, in which case the dicta in </span>
 <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt">Hays v Hays</span>
 <span style="font-size:11pt"> will need to be revisited. I have not received full submissions on this point; that will have to await another day. But my initial view is that the Master&#8217;s interpretation of s3 was, with respect, too restrictive. If, in this case, M is not authorised to enter into a contract of sale on behalf of AC, then AC will not be able in a meaningful sense to receive or recover his property until he is 18. Of course, he will hold it, but he will be prevented from converting it into other assets which can be managed, invested or deployed in his interests. I would regard a contract of sale in such circumstances as arguably falling within the phrase &#8220;entitled to receive or recover&#8221;. In any event, subsection (3) states that the rights referred to in subsection (2) &#8220;include&#8221; the right to receive or recover. The word &#8220;include&#8221; does not operate as a limit to the powers relating to property, which powers in my provisional view include disposal of property. It offers one particular example of circumstances in which the power may be exercised (probably aimed at trust arrangements commonplace in England but not encountered in many foreign jurisdictions) but does not limit the power to that example. I see no reason why s3, read as a whole, should not be construed more widely to encompass entering into a contract of sale provided, of course, that the welfare checklist and paramountcy principle govern the exercise of that power. </span>

Because of the Master&#8217;s decision on the unavailability of the s3 exercise of parental responsibility to achieve the desired outcome of a sale of the minor&#8217;s property interest, applications of this nature under the Children Act 1989 are not routinely (or at all) made, whether in the Chancery Division or the Family Court. In my judgment, henceforth parties should not be dissuaded from making such applications and in the ordinary course of events they should be made to the Family Court where allocation to the appropriate level of judge can take place in the usual way.&#8221;</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Having satisfied myself that I am entitled to authorise the applicant to enter into a contract for sale on behalf of B, I am persuaded that, when considering the paramountcy of B&#8217;s welfare, it is in his best interests to grant the authorisation sought. The value of B&#8217;s share is substantial and there are no known debts. The proposed sale is at a price of &#8364;320,000 such that B&#8217;s 50% share would be &#8364;160,000 less a pro rata contribution to sale costs. At present, B can make no meaningful use of his share of the property. There is no significant link with France anymore; the family barely visit the property. B&#8217;s family life is in England. B himself seeks a sale of the property, so as to assist him at university in due course, and explore other investment opportunities, including purchasing a rental property in this country. Rental income defrays some of the running costs, but does not provide a meaningful net income. A ready and willing purchaser has been identified and the evidence suggests that if this opportunity to sell is not grasped, it may become more difficult to secure a sale.</p>

Usually, in circumstances where the applicant is one parent, and the other parent is sadly deceased, there will be no automatic respondents. It is possible to envisage a situation where another family member has parental responsibility by court order, in which case that person must be made a respondent, but such cases will be rare. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It will sometimes be the case that other persons are legally or beneficially interested in the relevant property. In my judgment, any third party who has, or appears to have, a legal or beneficial interest in the property that is the subject of the application should be (i) notified of the application; (ii) invited to provide confirmation as to whether they do or do not oppose the application; and (iii) reminded that they may, if so advised, make an application to be joined to the proceedings pursuant to FPR 2010 rule 12.3(3). In the present case, B&#8217;s adult sister was formally made a party, and indicated no opposition in her Acknowledgment of Service. It seems to me that, in fact, it was not necessary to join her; notification of the proceedings and confirmation of her position would have been sufficient. Usually, in my view, third parties will not need to be joined absent good reason, because their rights are not generally affected by the sort of application before me today. It is unlikely that a third party would oppose authorisation to accept an inheritance, which is personal to the minor. As for an authorisation to enter into a contract for sale, that is not an order for sale; it simply entitles the applicant to enable a sale to be effected on behalf of the minor. A third party is not prohibited from opposing a sale under the relevant domestic law if he/she thinks fit. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In <span style="font-weight:bold">Re AC</span>, I concluded at paragraph 23 that the appropriate venue for a Specific Issue Order application such as this is the Family Court.

The President's Guidance &#8220;<span style="font-weight:bold">Jurisdiction of the Family Court: Allocation of cases within the Family Court to High Court Judge level and transfer of cases from the Family Court to the High Court&#8221;</span> dated 24 May 2021 does not require that an application of this kind <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">must</span> be allocated to judge of High Court judge level. Applications of this nature can be dealt with by judges of District Judge or Circuit Judge level sitting in the Family Court. That, of course, does not prevent, in the usual way, the application being allocated to a judge of High Court judge level on the ground of complexity.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">When I first saw the application, I contemplated whether to dispose of it on paper without the need for a hearing, given that it is unopposed. I have come to the conclusion that, notwithstanding the cost and burden of legal proceedings, ordinarily it is appropriate for there to be a hearing on an application of this sort. It involves the welfare of a child. Precisely because applications of this nature are one sided, the court needs to be extra vigilant to be satisfied that the child&#8217;s welfare is not prejudiced. There is an analogy with an infant approval hearing for personal injury settlements, mandated by Part 21 of the CPR, which requires a court hearing for approval of the final award. In my judgment there should usually be a short hearing before a judge to approve the order sought, although the ultimate decision on this must rest with the judge.</p>

That is unlike the position in the Chancery Division where any application would ordinarily be heard in open court (see, for example, <span style="font-weight:bold">Hays v Hays </span>and <span style="font-weight:bold">Re Shanavazi</span>). </p>
