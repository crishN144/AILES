Its plan envisages that, assuming the cooperation of the prison authorities (which, if I may be permitted to say so, they would probably be well advised for their own purposes to extend to the police), the police, operating in conjunction with the local authority, will exercise their powers under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/46" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 46</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> at the moment of birth, following which, depending upon the time of day, but no doubt within a matter of hours, the local authority will seek and, I anticipate, will obtain from the justices in the Family Proceedings Court, an Emergency Protection Order, which from that point on will clothe it with parental responsibility and the power to look after the child.</span></p>

It goes without saying that a newborn baby in the first seconds or moments of life is exceptionally vulnerable and that a distraught mother, who, as I will have to describe shortly, has already demonstrated her capacity to threaten violence to her children, would be capable of causing catastrophic injury to the child within a matter of moments. </span></p>

The child is, as I speak, still </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">en ventre sa mere</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> and, accordingly, no court has jurisdiction to make any order under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, nor (see </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">In re F (In Utero)</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> [1988] Fam xxx) can the court exercise its inherent or wardship jurisdiction in respect of children.  Equally, Mr. Hayden makes clear that despite the mother's very concerning behaviour there is no evidence suggesting incapacity.  I cannot therefore exercise any welfare jurisdiction in relation to the mother, whether the jurisdiction exercisable under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> by the Court of Protection or the inherent jurisdiction of the Family Division in relation to incapacitated adults.  I am therefore concerned, it seems to me, and Mr. Hayden is entirely content with this approach, with the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court to grant anticipatory declaratory relief, declaring in appropriate circumstances that some future course of conduct is either unlawful or, as Mr. Hayden would invite me to declare in the present case, lawful.  The question therefore, and it seems to me a question which arises wholly independently of the best interests of the mother, is whether it is lawful in the circumstances for the local authority not to share its thinking and its care plan with the mother and her partner prior to the point at which, immediately following the birth, the child is removed, as I would anticipate by the police in the exercise of their powers under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/46" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 46</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. </span></p>

Nor, as the Government point out, may it even be desirable, even if possible, to do so if those having custody of the child are seen as the source of an immediate threat to the child, since giving them prior warning would be liable to deprive the measure of its effectiveness. The court must however be satisfied that the national authorities were entitled to consider that there existed circumstances justifying the abrupt removal of the child from the care of its parents without any prior contact or consultation. In particular, it is for the respondent State to establish that a careful assessment of the impact of the proposed care measure on the parents and the child, as well as of the possible alternatives to the removal of the child from its family, was carried out prior to the implementation of a care measure." </span></p>

The issue in terms of the Convention is as to the operation of Article 8, and Article 8, as well-known authority demonstrates, has both a substantive and a procedural component, the substantive component regulating the circumstances in which public authority can interfere and the procedural component imposing upon public authority the obligation of engaging and discussing adequately with the parents before it interferes.  The test which defines the circumstances in which public authority can interfere by removing the child must equally, it seems to me, regulate and define the exceptional circumstances in which public authority is entitled to proceed without engaging the parents in the decision-making process.  The test in short, to adopt the words of Hale LJ, as she then was, and of Thorpe LJ is this:  Is the step which the local authority is proposing to take, that is, the step of not involving the parents in its planning and not communicating to the parents its plan for immediate removal at birth, something which is justified by &#8220;the overriding necessity of the interests of the child&#8221; or something which is "essential to secure [the child's] safety"? </span></p>

The fact that the child is as yet unborn means that I cannot exercise jurisdiction under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>; it means that I cannot exercise jurisdiction in wardship.  But it does not prevent me, in my judgment, exercising jurisdiction under the general law to declare the conduct of the local authority either compliant or, as the case may be, non-compliant with Article 8.  Any contrary view would lead to this absurdity, that in circumstances where, compatibly with the Convention and with the Strasbourg jurisprudence, it would be perfectly lawful for a local authority not to engage a parent in its decision-making process between the moment of birth and the subsequent intervention by EPO, and for the court to grant appropriate declaratory relief to that effect, it would not be possible for the court to declare it to be lawful for the local authority to adopt precisely the same approach in the period leading up to birth.  That would be absurd and would tend to frustrate the very need to protect the child which is implicit in the Strasbourg jurisprudence. </span></p>

But there is, as it seems to me, a fairly obvious difference in the degree of risk and the need for immediate intervention presented, on the one hand, by a mother who, if she is going to harm the child, is going to do so by poisoning, a risk which in principle is capable of management by ensuring that the mother does not have poison secreted on her when she comes into contact with the child (that being the situation in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">P, C and S</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">) and the very different situation with which I am faced in the present case where there is the most compelling evidence suggesting a high degree of risk that if the mother is alerted beforehand to what is going on she will react at the moment and immediately following the moment of birth in an impulsive and physically uncontrolled fashion, where she may lash out or do something else causing, even in a matter of moments and even if there are others present, very serious physical damage to the child.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">That is the risk against which the local authority in this case understandably wishes to protect the child.  And it is, for all the reasons I have given, and not least in the light of Dr. Reading's report, as it seems to me, a very real risk indeed.  The degree of risk that the mother will behave in that way, I am inclined to agree with Dr. Reading, is probably at the severe end of the scale.  But even if that not be so, the potential consequences for the child if the mother was not to cooperate in the birth process or was to lash out in some way, whether uncontrolled or controlled and deliberate, simply do not bear thinking about. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I am conscious that the mother has not been served with these proceedings and that, in consequence, there may be a very real question as to whether she can in any way be bound by the declaration I have granted.  But the very nature of the risk which she presents, and against which the local authority appropriately wishes to protect her unborn child, means that she cannot be alerted to the application, for that would be to frustrate the very order which the local authority seeks. The local authority, if I may say so, has acted entirely properly in bringing the matter to court rather than merely proceeding on its own way. It is entitled to seek the sanction of the court for the unusual step it is proposing to take.  And it is, in my judgment, proper for the court in such circumstances to make an order of this kind, even in the absence of the respondent.     </span></p>
