That would be consistent with a problem of anger the mother accused the father of in one of the texts.

Your Honour will also recall that in the course of that report he excluded beyond a reasonable doubt the presence of rickets radiologically. What his report is silent on is his analysis of the metaphyseal changes, as to whether they are metaphyseal fractures. In the course of my exchange with him this morning, he expressed the view to me that he was doubtful as to whether they are metaphyseal fractures. That, I immediately disclosed &#8211; at the earliest opportunity obviously &#8211; to my learned friend.  </p>

I took the opportunity on the telephone to ask him whether he had in fact had a chance to analyse the metaphyses, and he confirmed that he was doubtful that they were metaphyseal fractures. Now I deliberately did not go into any further detail at that point, and I set in train the events which I have described to you. In relation to the running of the case, we have Dr Maynard here who was the doctor on duty who first saw [X] on admission on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April, I think.

		    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1in">&#8220;The background is this. The prosecution had evidence from a highly experienced and respected consultant paediatric radiologist (Dr Joanna Fairhurst) that the skeletal survey showed to the criminal standard &#8211; that is beyond reasonable doubt &#8211; that there were metaphyseal fractures as a result of the inappropriate application of force which baby [X] had suffered. The issue raised by the defence in the case was that those changes were attributable to rickets. It is the prosecution position that that defence has been substantially undermined by the evidence of prosecution experts in this case. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1in">Given the development of the argument in this case, and as responsible prosecutors, we sought a second opinion from Dr Somers as to the analysis of the skeletal survey of baby [X]. He gave his opinion in a statement to us that baby [X] was not suffering from rickets. He gave this opinion to the criminal standard: he was sure of that. In the course of consultation yesterday, he gave his view to the prosecution team that he could not be sure that metaphyseal fractures were present. This was immediately disclosed. His opinion &#8211; clarified this morning &#8211; is that there may be fractures, but he cannot be sure. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1in">The prosecution have considered the position carefully. This is clearly a serious case. As a responsible prosecution faced with differing opinion from two respected experts in a difficult area of expertise, we have concluded that it would not be possible for the jury to conclude so that they are sure that metaphyseal fractures are present. Therefore, there is no longer a realistic prospect of conviction in respect of the central allegation on this indictment. This is not &#8211; in the view of the prosecution &#8211; a reflection on the undoubted expertise of both consultant paediatric radiologists, who have provided evidence for the prosecution. There is, however, a difference of opinion in a difficult diagnostic area.  And as responsible prosecutors, we do not seek a conviction in those circumstances, and we propose to offer no evidence. </p>

It was to the effect that having been able to look at the images, as a consultant paediatric radiologist, he did not conclude that he could be sure that they showed metaphyseal fractures. He informed the prosecution that in his opinion there was no evidence of rickets, but that it may be a situation where &#8211; although possibly suspicious and a suggestion of it &#8211; he could not be sure that there were metaphyseal fractures.   </p>

And having considered it carefully with Mr. Bryant-Heron &#8211; recognising that obviously allegations of fractures to a baby are serious &#8211; it was determined in all the light of the evidence and Dr Somers&#8217; most recent opinion, that the prosecution could not say that there is any longer a realistic prospect of conviction.  That being the case in an area of difficult diagnosis, they have come to the conclusion that it would not be proper for this case to continue any further.

That is a task which, in my judgment, can properly be undertaken by counsel instructed by the guardian and which does not, in the unusual circumstances of this case, in any way compromise the guardian&#8217;s neutrality. The simple fact is that this is no longer a case in which the guardian has a welfare role to perform (except in relation to any future argument about reporting restrictions) and there will not, insofar as I am in a position to assess the matter, be any risk of either the guardian or her counsel being put in a position of professional embarrassment.

Their position is simple. When X came to live with them, they understood that X was a child who was removed from the birth family because X had suffered multiple injuries in the care of the birth parents. Their submission at the end of the hearing before me was (a) that this fundamental truth still holds good and (b) that the hearing has further confirmed that, in the last analysis, X was removed from the birth parents because it was necessary to do so to protect X. I accept that submission without qualification. They consider that the hearing reconfirms that X was adopted following a fair and transparent process and on the basis of findings (by Judge Nathan) that were sound. I unhesitatingly agree. They are understandably exceedingly critical, not least on behalf of X, of the stance adopted by the birth parents, who initially mounted a full frontal attack on the entire process which had culminated in X&#8217;s adoption before trying, at the last minute, to walk away from the re-hearing. They were, as they put it, &#8220;stunned&#8221; by it. I can well understand why. </p>

As Dr Adams said in her oral evidence: &#8220;I cannot think of any explanation which could account for the child having done this [themself].&#8221; Frenulae are not torn during normal handling. The mechanism is impact directly into the mouth causing overstretching of the tissues. According to Dr McGowan (with whom Dr Adams agreed), in the case of young children typical mechanisms include &#8220;a blow from a fist to the mouth&#8221; or an object such as a feeding bottle being &#8220;rammed forcefully into the child&#8217;s mouth.&#8221; Dr McGowan said that she had only seen this injury in cases of inflicted injuries but accepted that such injuries can be &#8220;caused by an exasperated adult losing control and seeking desperately to quieten a persistently crying baby.&#8221; In the course of her evidence before Judge Nathan, she made clear, in response to the </p>

The furthest either went was in the birth father&#8217;s admission, for example when being cross-examined before Judge Nathan, that on occasions he was &#8220;too heavy handed&#8221; when feeding X, though he denied ever &#8220;ramming&#8221; the bottle in and denied ever being rough with X. </p>

That force would have been greater than any involved in the normal handing of a baby. In relation to the fractures, Dr Fairhurst and Dr Offiah are agreed that their infliction would have required a pulling and twisting force well in excess of normal handling and that they would have caused X distress and discomfort for several days.

This was really serious child abuse, child cruelty. Whoever was the perpetrator must have known that X required medical attention. Even if someone was neither the perpetrator nor present at the time when injuries were inflicted, that person must have realised, even if only as time went by, that something was seriously wrong and that X required medical attention. Yet, until the final episode of oral bleeding, neither of the birth parents made any real attempt to obtain medical assistance for X, let alone to protect X from what was going on.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The birth parents were young, somewhat immature and living in cramped conditions which may have made coping with a first child more difficult for them. That there were disagreements between them from time to time is admitted, though much played down, and I strongly suspect (not least in the light of text-messages passing between them and various admissions by the maternal grandmother, albeit later unconvincingly retracted) that the &#8216;play fighting&#8217; of which they spoke went significantly further than they were prepared to admit and tipped over on occasions into domestic violence. I suspect also that the birth father may have found X more difficult to handle and been more prone to angry feelings than he was prepared to admit. But at the end of the day little of this really matters, for there are no findings I can safely make which would assist in identifying who was or was not a perpetrator. Moreover, it has to be borne in mind, given the constellation of inflicted injuries X suffered, and the period of time over which they were inflicted, that this is not a case of momentary loss of control of the kind that might be sparked by domestic discord, nor is there any suggestion from either of the birth parents of any incident of domestic argument or domestic violence as being linked to any of X&#8217;s injuries. Nor is there anything to suggest that, apart from the various inflicted injuries X suffered, X was otherwise in any meaningful way an indirect victim of whatever domestic violence there may have been, albeit on one occasion X was actually in the birth mother&#8217;s arms </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Before parting from the birth parents, I ought to say something about the timing and asserted basis for their attempted withdrawal from the proceedings. I cannot accept their protestation that the motivation for this was concern for X&#8217;s welfare and a recognition that there was little realistic prospect, whatever my findings, of ever being able to challenge the adoption order. <span style="font-style:italic">If </span>that had indeed been the case, they could have sought to withdraw much earlier. The truth, as it seems to me, is that, faced with the overwhelming weight of all the expert evidence which by then had been marshalled, they realised that &#8216;the game was up&#8217; and cynically sought to withdraw, hoping that this would stymie any attempt to re-visit Judge Nathan&#8217;s original findings and thus prevent those findings being vindicated. I agree with Ms Morgan and Ms Segal&#8217;s evaluation: given the totality of the evidence now available, it is little wonder that the birth parents did not wish the court to examine it and that they sought by their actions immediately before the final hearing to ensure that it did not.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">There is one final matter I should touch on. I received helpful submissions from counsel identifying various differences, as between the criminal and family courts, in the practice and procedure relating to expert witnesses, even if in substance the approach is the same. I do not, in the circumstances, think that any useful purpose would be served by any extended analysis and it is certainly no part of my function to draw adverse comparisons between two systems. For present purposes, beyond adding a reference to what Cobb J said in <span style="font-style:italic">In re AD and another (Children) (Fact-finding Rehearing)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2016/2912" uk:canonical="[2016] EWHC 2912 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWHC 2912 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2017] 4 WLR 23" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] 4 WLR 23</ref>, paras 13-15, I need say only this. Nothing in the history of this unfortunate litigation gives me any cause for concern about the continuing utility and appropriateness of the processes and procedures in the family courts provided for in FPR 2010 Part 25 and PDs 25A-E. On the contrary, the system in relation to the expert evidence worked well, and as it should have done, both before Judge Nathan and before me.         </p>
