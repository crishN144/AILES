	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0in">This is an appeal from an order made on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2019 following a fact-finding trial in Children Act (CA) 1989 proceedings for child arrangement orders at the Central Family Court in London before the Designated Family Judge. The case concerned complaints of domestic abuse including of the most serious sexual assault. The Appellant (JH who had made the complaints) was represented by counsel, Ms Piskolti, and gave evidence. The Respondent (MF) was unrepresented (but had assistance from a McKenzie friend throughout) and the judge carried out the &#8220;cross-examination&#8221; of JH. This case is yet another example of the difficulties encountered by litigants when public funding is not available to the party against whom complaints are made; and of the way in which justice or a fair trial is compromised when the judge is required to enter the arena. The judge found against the Appellant.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0in">The Appellant appealed against the judgment and order; permission was granted by Mrs Justice Lieven on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2019 (who gave permission to appeal four days out of time). In her written reasons Lieven J said that she had granted <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;permission to appeal on each of the grounds&#8221;</span>, having set out each of the seven grounds advanced on behalf of the Appellant. In essence I agree with the observations made by Lieven J in granting permission to appeal but also find that the judge&#8217;s conduct of the hearing was fundamentally flawed and unjust for procedural irregularity as set out in Family Procedure Rules (FPR) 2010 (Cf. <a href="https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/Document/ICCA91D62188F11E0BBD1B657C276DA33/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem&amp;contextData=(sc.Search)" style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#0563C1">FPR rule 30.12(3)</a><a href="https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/Document/ICCA91D62188F11E0BBD1B657C276DA33/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem&amp;contextData=(sc.Search)">)</a>; and the appeal is allowed for that reason and the reasons set out in full below. </p>

There is no argument in respect of the law which applies in this appeal. I have been reminded of, and keep in mind, the relevant case law; it is unnecessary for me to set it out in full.

The task facing a judge is not to pass an examination, or to prepare a detailed legal or factual analysis of all the evidence and submissions he has heard. Essentially, the judicial task is twofold: to enable the parties to understand why they have won or lost; and to provide sufficient detail and analysis to enable an appellate court to decide whether or not the judgment is sustainable. The judge need not slavishly restate either the facts, the arguments or the law. To adopt the striking metaphor of Mostyn </span></p>

The Appellant (then only 17 years old) met the Respondent (then 23) in 2013 when they started their relationship. The Appellant moved in with the Respondent shortly after they met. Prior to their meeting police records indicate that there had been complaints made about the Respondent&#8217;s violent and abusive behaviour by his own mother, his brother, his aunt and a previous partner. According to the police records which were before the Family Court the parties first came to the attention of the Police in June 2014 as a result of third-party contact or referral; the Respondent was said to have been intoxicated, aggressive and abusive to the Appellant. The police records show a further incident including another verbal altercation in September 2014. The child who is the subject of these proceedings (C now 4 years and 11 months old) was born on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> January 2015.  </p>

Specifically, there were complaints of domestic abuse by the Appellant in February of that year, followed in April by a record of an incident when the Respondent was said to have hit the Appellant on her head. She had fled to a neighbour&#8217;s home and the police were called. The Respondent was arrested for battery and released on bail. In May 2015 the Appellant contacted the police and retracted her statement. Nonetheless the Police made a referral to Social Services because of domestic abuse. Social Services were recorded to have responded that C would be placed on a Child in Need plan. The Appellant subsequently moved to another local authority area and the case was closed. </p>

In late August 2016 the Appellant had reported to the Police a history of domestic abuse including sexual assault by penetration and was categorised as a high-risk victim. The Respondent was again arrested and released on bail. The Appellant left the family home and moved into a refuge with C. The Respondent then reported the Appellant to Social Services and made allegations about her inability to care for C; he called the Police to report her &#8220;missing&#8221;.  </p>

It is a matter of further complaint that as a result he actually did not hear significant parts of what the Appellant had said in court; a matter the judge himself accepted in paragraph 15 of his judgment. The judge then proceeded to order that the Respondent, too, should give evidence from counsel&#8217;s row making reference to the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">feng shui</span>&#8221; of the court room and the screens and saying that it was fair and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;created some kind of balance&#8221;</span> without any application having been made by the Respondent that he needed to give evidence in the same manner as the Appellant. Concerns raised by counsel were dismissed without reasons being given for this decision by the judge. The Respondent was then able to give evidence sitting next to his McKenzie friend who was, as a consequence, able to assist the Respondent in the answers he gave when the Respondent was being crossexamined. It follows that the Respondent was given an advantage and assistance denied to the Appellant.

The judge had directed police disclosure which included the independent witness statement of a neighbour along with police records which supported the Appellant&#8217;s account. In his judgment not only did he find there was no independent evidence he failed to set out why he chose to disregard it, or if he had had regard to it he failed to set out why he found that it was not independent or in any sense corroborative other than to dismiss both a friend and the neighbour&#8217;s evidence out of hand because they were the Appellant&#8217;s  &#8220;friends&#8221;.  </p>

In the next paragraph the judge goes on to dismiss violent behaviour (throwing objects) as part of controlling or coercive behaviour without explanation. I accept the submission on behalf of the Appellant that the judge failed to make any findings about the Respondent&#8217;s use of language neither finding proved or dismissing the specific complaints made by the Appellant, which, if taken together, could be found to be part of a pattern of controlling, abusive and coercive behaviour.    </p>

Certainly the fact that the judge preferred the Respondent&#8217;s case was patent throughout his judgment. His reasons, such as they were for dismissing the evidence of the Appellant were wrong; specifically, the judge made a finding regarding the Appellant&#8217;s psychological state of mind without any forensic expert evidence (the absence of which had been a matter he himself alluded to previously at paragraph 7 of his judgment) when he said, in an exchange during closing submissions with counsel, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;she [the Appellant] gives a description of a woman who is of a highly anxious, it might be said, neurotic, disposition&#8221;. </span>In saying thus the judge had apparently reached a conclusion regarding the Appellant&#8217;s state of mind without sufficient evidence to support it; moreover it was a conclusion which was contrary to the case of the Respondent. It is necessary to interject here that other than denials it was not possible to decern with any particularity the case put by the Respondent (who was the applicant in the case) because of the absence of reference to it in the judgment.  </p>

The failure of the judge to provide the Appellant with the means of giving her best evidence was evidenced by the fact that her oral evidence was not heard by the judge and was not picked up on tape. To go on, as this judge did, to use it as one of the reasons he questioned her evidence is aberrant. Moreover, in his judgment the judge wholly failed to consider or even to entertain any likelihood that her anxious presentation was as a result of previous abuse, including the probability that this had included abuse by the Respondent. Or, as was submitted by counsel for the Appellant that, that as a vulnerable witness, she was likely to have been distressed when she gave her evidence which, in turn, would have had an impact on her ability to recall matters that had taken place.

This is a senior judge, a Designated Family Judge, a leadership judge in the Family Court, expressing a view that, in his judgment, it is not only permissible but also acceptable for penetration to continue after the complainant has said no (by asking the perpetrator to stop) but also that a complainant must and should physically resist penetration, in order to establish a lack of consent. This would place the responsibility for establishing consent or lack thereof firmly and solely with the complainant or potential victim. Whilst the burden of proving her case was with the Appellant in any counter allegation the burden lay with the Respondent. Indeed it was the Respondent who had brought the case as the applicant in the Family Court, thus the burden of proof did not lie solely with the Appellant. Moreover the judge should have been fully aware that the issue of consent is one which has developed jurisprudentially, particularly within the criminal jurisdiction, over the past 15 years (of which more below). </p>

The father suggested the television should be turned off. As I understand it, it is common ground that it was, and then the father, again, requested sex of the mother.  This time the mother's case is that she refused, and when intercourse began it was not with her consent.  She says that she was wearing pyjamas.  The father took the pyjamas off and had intercourse with her, again from behind.  This was at no point, the mother says, with her consent.  The father maintains to the contrary -- that intercourse was initiated by both of the parties and was entirely consensual throughout.  Again, he recalls the occasion of which the mother speaks.  Here, my difficulty with the mother's account centres on the removal of her pyjama bottoms.  I should emphasise that father's account is that in fact she was wearing a nightie.  I do not see why the mother could not, should not, have made life difficult for the father in the circumstances in which she found herself by preventing the removal of the pyjama bottoms.  There is no evidence of any kind that a struggle pursued, nor again is a case advanced that the father was being physically coercive on this occasion.

But there may be some significance in the circumstances in which she did so because one of her friends, [P], in her written statement, appears to imply that the purpose of the visit to the police station at the end of August was to report father's threats made to her [P}, and that it was almost incidental that the question of the mother being forced to have sex (the expression used in [P&#8217;s] police statement) came to be revealed.  Moreover, the terms of [P&#8217;s] statement, again, can hardly be said to be heavily supportive of mother's case as to the terms in which the mother was reporting what happened to her.  [P&#8217;s] account contains the following sentence: &#8216;I asked her what had then happened and she told me that she had let the father have sex with her as it was easier than to keep saying no.&#8217;  That can hardly be said to support a coherent account of rape.&#8221;</span></p>

The friend told the Police, as the judge quoted in his judgment (above), &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I asked her what had happened and she said that she had let the [Respondent] have sex with her as it was easier than saying no.&#8221;</span>&#8217; This, the judge found, could hardly be said to support a coherent account of rape. This conclusion is obtuse, any decision of consent must include a coherent account (to borrow the judge&#8217;s own phrase) and consideration of the extent to which the complainant or victim was free to choose and to consent, or to paraphrase the relevant criminal statute (s74 Sexual Offences Act (SOA) 2003), that person has had the freedom and capacity to make that choice. It is arguable, at the very least, that the evidence before the judge was that the Appellant&#8217;s freedom and capacity to choose had been extinguished or at least gravely compromised. </p>

But if she did so, I emphasise this was something which was usual for her, the product of events in her past and her psychological state in not being able to take physical pleasure from sex.   It was not a consequence of any action on the part of the father.  Moreover, at no point during these occasions do I find that the mother withdrew consent or conveyed to the father any discomfiture that she was feeling about the intercourse continuing.  I cannot even, on this evidence, find that the father was somehow insensitive to the mother's position.

Non-consensual sexual intercourse was considered lawful within a marriage until as late as 1992 (Cf. <span style="font-style:italic">R</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1992] 1 AC 599" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1992">[1992] 1 AC 599</ref>) it has not been lawful in any other sphere for generations. There is no principle that lack of consent must be demonstrated by physical resistance, this approach is wrong, family judges should not approach the issue of consent in respect of serious sexual assault in a manner so wholly at odds with that taken in the criminal jurisdiction (specifically the changes in place since <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/42" uk:canonical="2003 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">SOA 2003</ref> and subsequent amendments). Serious sexual assault, including penetrative assault, should be minimised as an example of coercive and controlling behaviour (itself a criminal offence) although such behaviour may form part of the subordination of a potential victim&#8217;s will (see the guidance set out at paragraphs 19 and 20 above).  </p>

Willingness is usually associated with consent. However, we are satisfied that the jury would not, in the context of this very full direction, have been misled by the use of the word &#8220;willing&#8221;. This was not a case where it was alleged that submission had been achieved by physical force. It was willing in the sense that there was no attempt at physical resistance by the complainant and the judge used it in that sense. That leaves open the possibility that the circumstances were such that the complainant submitted to sexual intercourse rather than consented to it. That was the overall effect of the direction. We are satisfied that, having regard to the full direction given, the jury would not have been misled or distracted, by the use of the expression &#8220;willing submission&#8221;, from the question they were told they had to answer. It is not, however, an expression we would commend for use on other occasions.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0in">Finally, having previously dealt with procedural matters in respect of Part 3A which was ground vii), it is necessary to consider the judge&#8217;s approach as to the standard of proof he was obliged to apply. As Lieven J said when allowing the appeal <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;at paragraph 10 of his judgment the judge made comments on his approach to the standard of proof ought to be considered. The judge appeared to be troubled by the fact that if he made a finding, the binary nature of the law means he would have to proceed on the basis it was correct, even if he were wrong.&#8221;</span> It is evident that in making his observations the judge was, in fact, applying a higher standard of proof than the simple balance of probabilities; for at paragraph 10 the judge said, after describing the standard of proof as a difficulty in this case, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;So, if I find myself in respect of a particular allegation 51 percent favouring the evidence of one party and only 49 percent of the other, if in other words it is finely balanced, there is a grave risk that I get it wrong &#8211; but thereafter would have to treat my findings as absolutely correct.&#8221;</span> He compounded the impression that he was troubled by applying the correct balance of proof when went on to say <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;In short, whilst it is the court&#8217;s duty to investigate and make findings, as best it can in accordance with the evidence, there is very often so</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">far that the court can safely go before the benefits of a fact-finding begin to diminish.&#8221;</span></p>

The law operates a binary system in which the only values are nought and one." </span>The judge gave the appearance of being reluctant to apply that standard, moreover, at paragraph 22, having reiterated that the standard of proof is the simple balance of probabilities he went on&#8230; </p>

	    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0in"><span style="font-family:Arial"/>Judges in the family courts are regularly required to make decisions and find facts in cases where there is domestic abuse; this will include cases where serious sexual assault is alleged to have taken place. Currently there is comprehensive training on the procedural aspects of such trials and the implementation of PD12J in particular. Judges who sit in the family courts are not, however, required to undergo training on the appropriate approach to take when considering allegations of serious sexual assault where issues of consent are raised. Such training is provided to judges who are likely to try serious sexual allegations in the criminal courts. In principle the approach taken in family proceedings should be congruent with the principles applied in the criminal jurisdiction. I have discussed this with The President of the Family Division, and he is going to make a formal request to the Judicial College for those judges who may hear cases involving allegations of serious sexual assault in family proceedings to be given training based on that which is already provided to criminal judges. This is a welcome development, a cross-jurisdictional approach to training on this important topic will be of assistance, support and benefit to all judges and will foster a more coherent approach. </p>
