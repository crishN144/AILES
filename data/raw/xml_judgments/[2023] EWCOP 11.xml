After hearing evidence from Consultants in Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology (&#8220;Ms. A&#8221;) and Psychiatry (&#8220;Dr. B&#8221;) Morgan J adjourned the application to the following week when it became clear that the reason for the application being made urgently was the fact that AX had reached term rather than any particular risk in her case, and proper cross-examination of the psychiatric evidence was not possible because the relevant psychiatric notes were not in the court bundle.</p>

The Official Solicitor has obtained agreement from the Trust that 50% of her costs be paid; this application seeks the other 50% of her costs, or some intermediate percentage. The Order of Morgan J dated 21 October 2022 contained a provision, agreed between the parties, that there be no order for costs. Accordingly it is accepted by the Official Solicitor that her application for costs can only seek costs incurred after that date.</p>

At that point she was 27 weeks pregnant. Since arriving in London she had been experiencing symptoms consistent with a manic episode, including a thought disorder, flight of ideas, and tangential thinking. She had spent $15,000  since arriving and had run out of money. She had tried five times to get on planes to return home, and had reached the departure lounge on several occasions, but had then felt overwhelmed and could not go through with it. She had been staying with people she had met in pubs and had had her bag and phone stolen from her.</p>

By 27 October 2022 Dr B considered that AX had made a vast improvement, even as compared to 22 October 2022 when she had conducted a litigation capacity assessment of AX. Dr B considered that AX had both litigation capacity and capacity to consent to make decisions about her care and treatment. She considered that the change is due to the increase in Olanzapine to its maximum dose of 20mg. She opined that it would be very difficult to predict if AX would lose capacity during labour, but that she would be kept under review, and that psychosis during labour was not a substantial risk.</p>
