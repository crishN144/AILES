Her family are members of the travelling community. She has had many problems from an early age and</span> has been diagnosed with an emotionally unstable personality disorder, severe depression with suicidal ideation, and post-traumatic stress disorder. <span style="color:#000000">In September 1998, she was received into the voluntary care of the authority then responsible for child protection in the part of Ireland where she lived, and she has remained in care to this day.  Soon after her admission to care, SF disclosed that she had been subjected to severe abuse of a physical, sexual and emotional nature, and had also been neglected whilst in the care of her family.   On 10</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:#000000">th</span><span style="color:#000000"> April 2000, SF was made subject of an interim care order.

She remained there until January 2012. At that point, there was an escalation in SF&#8217;s behaviours, which included absconding (and returning under the influence of aerosols and other intoxicants), aggression towards other residents and staff, and self-harm, ranging from superficial injuries to very serious wounds to her arms and legs and, on one occasion, tying a handbag strap around her neck in an attempt to choke herself.  The staff at the high support unit considered that they could not keep her safe, and on 5</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:#000000">th</span><span style="color:#000000"> January 2012 the HSE applied for, and was granted, an order permitting SF to be detained at a special care unit.</span></p>

An approach was therefore made to a unit in England (&#8220;the English Unit&#8221;) to see whether she could be admitted there for treatment and therapy. She was first assessed by staff from the English Unit on 27 January 2012 with a view to her placement there for a period of assessment and treatment.  SF initially expressed very considerable opposition to any move to the English Unit, but by early March 2012, she was expressing the clear view that she wished to leave the Irish special care unit as soon as possible, and consented to a transfer to the English Unit for a three-month period of assessment.</span></p>

Having known SF for 18 months, I have no doubt at all about the serious intent of her claim.  My other concern is that if SF starts to repeatedly put herself at risk again, the SCU staff will have no choice but to more intensely control her immediate environment and confine her completely to the unit.  This will most heighten her sense of hopelessness and lead to serious suicide attempts.  SF must be transferred this week.&#8221; </span></p>

One would anticipate a better prognosis if she was given the chance to engage positively with [the English Unit] while the time is right. I fear that as time goes on, with continued uncertainty, SF will become more frustrated and more negative, resulting in less chance of a positive outcome. SF is likely to continue to engage in risky self-harm behaviour as a result of her high levels of frustration, and once again I must say I am concerned that this could result in a serious untoward incident. Therefore it is my opinion that SF needs to move to [the English Unit] as a matter of urgency.</span><span style="color:#000000">&#8221;</span></p>

Secondly, pending the making of orders securing the recognition and enforceability of the Irish order, this urgent application has been made to the High Court for provisional relief pursuant to Article 20 of Brussels II Revised. The specific relief sought by the HSE is, first, an order that SF do reside at the English Unit for purposes of such care and treatment as may in the opinion of the Director of the English Unit be necessary; secondly, that there be leave to the staff of the English Unit to detain at or return SF to the English Unit and to use reasonable force (if necessary) in so detaining her or returning her, and third, that there be leave generally to Director of <span style="color:#000000">the English Unit</span> and those under his direction (to include all or any of the multi-disciplinary team including clinical, care or similar professional and/or ancillary health care staff) to furnish such treatment and care to SF as in their opinion may be necessary. <span style="color:#000000">That application was listed ex parte before me on 4</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:#000000">th</span><span style="color:#000000"> May and I duly made the order requested.

It is unnecessary to recite these provisions in detail for the purposes of this judgment. An application for permission to register the judgment is to be made to a district judge of the PRFD.  Such an application must be accompanied by a witness statement or affidavit exhibiting certain documentation. By FPR r.31.6, the district judge is then required to give such directions as considered appropriate. By FPR 31.11, if the Court then decides that the judgment should be registered for enforcement, the judgment is then entered into the central index of judgments, and the order of the court shall be served on the parties endorsed with the court officer&#8217;s confirmation that the judgment has been registered. By FPR r.31.11 (4), a sealed order with this endorsement stands as notification that the judgment has been registered in accordance with the provisions of Article 28(2) of Brussels IIR, and hence is enforceable.  The FPR then provide a clearly defined route for appeals against such decisions, which must be brought within one month of service of the notice of registration, extended to two months in the case of a party habitually resident in another Member State. Importantly, as currently drafted (in FPR r.31.17), a Court will not enforce a judgment registered under r.31.11 until the expiry of any period for appeal, although </span>FPR r.31.22 provides that an application for provisional (including protective) measures under Article 20 Brussels IIR can be made notwithstanding that the time for appealing against an order for registration of a judgment has not expired or that a final determination of any issue relating to enforcement of the judgment is pending.</p>

Again, clinical professionals in Ireland considered that there was no institution in that country which could meet her needs and identified an establishment in England where she could be accommodated and appropriately treated. As in the present case, an application was made to the High Court in Ireland which, having received a consent from an English authority which it considered valid under Article 56, made an interim order on 2</span><span class="apple-style-span" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span><span class="apple-style-span"> December 2011 authorising the placement of SC in the establishment in England and embarked upon the process of seeking registration and enforcement of that order in England. As in the present case, an application was made ex parte to the High Court in England for provisional relief under Article 20 and an order granted (as it happens, by me). At the same time, however, the Irish court, having a number of concerns about the interpretation of the relevant provisions of Brussels II Revised and whether the processes adopted in that case complied with the Regulation, stayed the proceedings and referred the case for a preliminary ruling to the CJEU. Six questions were posed by the Irish Court of which numbers (1), (3) and (4) are relevant to the current case. </span></p>

Judicial cooperation is not only encouraged but essential to facilitate the making and enforcement of orders for the welfare of children. Manifestly, </span>it is appropriate that there be direct judicial communication between the High Court in Ireland and the High Court in England regarding SF&#8217;s circumstances, so as to ensure that her circumstances are to be reviewed on a regular basis. I shall therefore include a recital to that effect in the order.</p>
