	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This has been the second and final stage of care proceedings which were commenced as long ago as December 2011. They relate to MR, born at the end of October that year, so that he is aged 18 months. He sustained life threatening injuries when only a month old. Since his discharge from hospital in early February 2012, he has lived with foster parents. His mother, KH, has not seen him since 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2012; the last contact between him and his father, NR, was on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October that year. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The key issue at this hearing is as to whether I should resolve the local authority&#8217;s applications by making care and placement orders or instead embark upon a process of the kind suggested by Miss Ball QC and Mr Squire so as to evaluate whether rehabilitation between MR and his mother is a viable option.</p>

The purpose of that 7 day hearing was to investigate the circumstances in which MR came to be so gravely injured and to make findings as necessary about the role of the parents in the circumstances leading up to his admission to hospital.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the immediate aftermath of the judgment, Mr Squire, the mother&#8217;s Counsel, indicated that she did not invite me to make any order for the resumption of contact or for any further assessment of the mother. Her parents, the maternal grandparents, were prioritising the need to look after their daughter, provide her with a home and give her the emotional support she required after the hearing. The mother&#8217;s sister, CH and her husband AH, were put forward by the mother as the individuals who should be assessed as a potential long term prospect for MR. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The final part of the proceedings had been listed for three days in mid December. Most regrettably, as it turned out, two of the those three days were vacated at the end of the November hearing primarily because it was thought that the proceedings might and probably would be resolved consensually as the result of a positive assessment of the maternal aunt and uncle.</p>

The application for permission was refused on the papers by MacFarlane LJ on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2013 who observed that the process &#8220;is one single hearing with the potential for change and development in the evidence and the judicial view as the hearing progresses.&#8221; He also related that his refusal of permission &#8220;does not prejudice the mother&#8217;s ability to seek to raise some or all of the matters currently raised if, following an opportunity to take the points of clarification and / or argument in front of Pauffley J, the mother wishes to seek permission to appeal the judge&#8217;s final determination.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the first day of this hearing, having afforded the mother&#8217;s legal team some time to construct a draft document, I was confronted with a list of questions by Miss Ball and Mr Squire entitled &#8220;Request for Clarification.&#8221; I then proceeded to hear the oral evidence of Ms Dungate, the allocated social worker, the mother, KH (she has reverted to using her maiden name) and then Miss Doolin, MR&#8217;s guardian.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the conclusion of the evidence, Miss Ball suggested I should provide my written responses to her clarification questions <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">before</span> I heard submissions as to how the &#8216;welfare&#8217; stage of the process should be resolved. Miss Ball argued it would be illogical for her to be required to make her submissions before she knew how I had answered her questions. Miss Ball said she would be able to provide written submissions as to the outcome of the welfare stage very quickly after delivery of my answers. I was pressed to fall in with her request.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_16">
	  <num>16.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I did not to accede to that proposal and indicated to Miss Ball that she should make her submissions on the basis of the facts found against her client last November. After all, the mother&#8217;s evidence in response to the November findings at this hearing had been more or less identical to that given at the hearing in December. It is as clear now as it has been all along that the mother does not accept the various significant criticisms of her contained within the November judgment. I saw no reason to defer hearing submissions until after the provision of my answers to Miss Ball&#8217;s questions. It would have been both inconvenient and creative of further delay. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Moreover, as Miss Habboo correctly identified, the two processes are distinct and separate. The Request for Clarification is so as to assist the mother in her proposed appeal. The judgment resulting from the late April hearing is the last part of the care proceedings when decisions are made about MR&#8217;s welfare needs.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn to consider the mother&#8217;s proposals as to how the case should proceed. In summary, Miss Ball and Mr Squire suggest there should be some form of combined assessment of the mother to evaluate risk (perhaps), her emotional and psychological functioning as well as parenting capacity. A quantity of material has been supplied from Parenting Profiles Ltd., and also Nigel Blagg Associates (Adult and Child Psychology Expert Witnesses) with the names and curriculum vitaes of a number of psychologists who, it is suggested, might be suitable to evaluate the prospects for rehabilitation. At the same time, or it could be a sequential exercise, the mother&#8217;s team suggests involving an expert such as Dr Berelowitz to advise in the vexed area of contact, how if at all it might be successfully re-started and what might be done to improve the circumstances for the child.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_19">
	  <num>19.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A little later in her submissions, Miss Ball accepted on behalf of her client that in reality she cannot ask for a risk assessment because the mother does not accept she presents any kind of a risk. Miss Ball accepts that KH&#8217;s position is very clearly the same as it was at the November and December hearings. She is adamant that she has not lied, did not fail to protect MR and will not admit to something she maintains is not true. So, says Miss Ball, her client is caught in a terrible bind.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_20">
	  <num>20.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Ball submits that this is not the right time to close the door, that the local authority&#8217;s care plan for adoption represents &#8220;the most draconian outcome&#8221; for this child and that, as yet, all avenues towards rehabilitation have not been explored. This child, argues Miss Ball, deserves the opportunity for full exploration of the mother&#8217;s capability to look after him particularly given that she has a very supportive family. </p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_21">
	  <num>21.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is also relevant, so Miss Ball submits, that before the events of 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2011, there were no historic concerns. The mother had been keen to attend ante natal classes, welcomed professionals into her life and reacted entirely appropriately by very swiftly separating from her husband after MR&#8217;s admission to hospital. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_22">
	  <num>22.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Furthermore, it is argued on behalf of the mother that there is really nothing to work on in relation to the question as to whether the mother has the emotional resources to parent the child. The social work and guardian assessments, it is said, are inadequate and although further evaluation would cause delay which is regrettable it would be proportionate. The paramount consideration must be so as to achieve an outcome for MR which will secure his best interests throughout his childhood and beyond.</p>

The prime example is to be found in what she said to Ms Dungate on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January this year when, in general terms, KH was refusing to acknowledge her role in the events that led to MR&#8217;s hospitalisation.

An assessment of the kind suggested by Miss Ball would not take matters further. The single most important factor is as to whether the mother might be able to develop sufficiently in her understanding of her own shortcomings so as to guarantee for the future MR&#8217;s physical and emotional safety. I am afraid to say that now almost six months on from the fact finding hearing she is more resistant than ever she was to acknowledgment of her failings. She shows no interest at all in developing an ability for reflection or insight into why it was that she did not respond protectively.</p>

On behalf of Miss Doolin, it was suggested that expert advice should be sought so as to better understand why MR was responding so poorly to contact and also to give advice as to how it might be ameliorated.

He is her son. Seemingly she has little or no regard for the likely impact upon him of such an event. She said that all she wants to do, as a Mum is to be in the same room as MR so that he can see her and she can see him.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When seen by Dr Llewellyn Jones in preparation for her June 2012 report, the mother was viewed as an emotionally vulnerable woman with a more problematic instability of mood as revealed by her medical records than she had disclosed. She did not appear mentally unwell when Dr Llewellyn Jones saw her though she has a history of recurrent depression. It had been her impression that KH seemed to have a significant level of anxiety, generally around her own competency and more particularly about caring for her son.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It follows as the result of what I have already said, that I see no basis for concluding that any further assessment of the mother is necessary and even although the effect of so deciding will be to extinguish the only remaining chance for KH of being rehabilitated with MR. His overwhelming and pressing need now is to be placed within an adoptive home where he is able to feel secure, settled and protected from harm. He is fortunate indeed to have had an excellent experience of being looked after by loving and nurturing foster parents who have been attuned to his every need. As the result, the chances of him making a good attachment to adoptive parents are seen as high.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, I should make clear that Ms Dungate, in my assessment, is an extremely thorough and professional social worker whose evidence impressed me greatly. She was thoughtful, orderly and clear thinking. MR is her priority and very properly so. In so far as it may be necessary, I exonerate her of the charge levelled by the mother of any bullying behaviour. It seemed to me that the mother has been all too ready to accuse Ms Dungate of bullying without a shred of evidence that she had done any such thing. It may be, I know not, that when the mother senses an individual is against her, it is her default position to accuse that person of bullying.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Dungate had a responsibility, as did Miss Doolin, to discuss the November findings with the mother &#8211; a process which she did not welcome. They had their tasks to perform. Both attended to their work with professionalism, diligence as well as humanity. They have each contributed to this part of the hearing with insightful analysis culled from carefully recorded events. They may not be experts with a capital E but they provided me with all of the assistance I required to perform this exercise justly. </p>
