On 29 June 2007 he had a telephone conference to discuss the CT scan with Dr J. Dr J was a consultant neuroradiologist at one of the hospitals treating X who, although not responsible for the CT scan, had been involved in conducting MRI scans on 7 December 2006 and 15 December 2006 and a CAT scan on 22 December 2006. I have a note of that conference prepared by the children&#8217;s solicitor. Dr Stoodley produced his final report the same day, 29 June 2007.</p>

I was not surprised that the local authority was reconsidering its position in the light of the expert evidence. After all, once Dr Stoodley had reported on 28 May 2007 it must have been apparent, even if not before, that there were significant difficulties in the local authority&#8217;s way. And the outcome of the two experts&#8217; meetings can have done nothing to improve the local authority&#8217;s assessment of its situation. (That said, the local authority&#8217;s position statement dated 12 June 2007 which had been filed for the pre-hearing review on 14 June 2007 made clear that, subject to any &#8220;dramatic&#8221; shift of expert opinion at the experts&#8217; meeting, the local authority would be seeking findings against the mother. Indeed, that still remained the local authority&#8217;s position when it filed its case summary and statement of issues dated 27 June 2007 &#8211; a document which indicated that the local authority was seeking findings against the mother and which identified the expert and other witnesses who it was proposed should be called to give oral evidence.)</p>

On 10 May 2007 I had been asked to give directions for the preparation of a risk assessment of the parents if that became relevant following the fact-finding hearing. And as recently as at the pre-hearing review on 14 June 2007 there had been no hint of any change in the local authority&#8217;s stance. It was only on 28 June 2007, when I received the mother&#8217;s position statement, that I learned for the first time that the local authority and the children&#8217;s guardian were of the view that the children should be returned to the care of their parents whatever the outcome of the fact-finding hearing.</p>

After all, the children&#8217;s guardian had expressed her support for such an approach and given solid reasons to justify it. And it seemed entirely appropriate in all the circumstances that the children should indeed be returned home, and without further delay. My concern was rather as to whether this decision had been taken as soon as it might have been. The stress on parents in the situation in which these parents found themselves must be absolutely appalling. And for parents to be separated from their children without good cause can only be damaging not merely to the parents but also to the children. I am happy to make it clear that there was, as it turned out, no basis for my concern. I am satisfied that the decision was taken and communicated to the parents at the earliest practicable stage.</p>

Was the local authority inviting me to make the order on the basis that it had a properly arguable case against the mother that she had in truth injured X, albeit that for pragmatic reasons it did not wish to pursue its allegations to trial? Or was the local authority inviting me to make the order on the basis that it accepted, even if it was not prepared to acknowledge openly, that there was no longer any reasonable prospect of it succeeding in establishing its case, that there was, as it were, no longer any case fit to go to a jury? It seemed to me wholly inappropriate in a case such as this for the court to be making an order without the order making clear on its face the basis upon which it was being made. Otherwise the order itself might be a fruitful source of future uncertainty and confusion. (This is not, of course, to require that the parties necessarily agree the basis upon which an order is being made. The parties may agree that the local authority should have permission to withdraw an application for a care order whilst disagreeing very profoundly as to why that is the proper order to make. In such a case it may be appropriate for the order to recite the parties&#8217; differing and unresolved positions, as, for example, was done in <span style="font-style:italic">X Council v B (Emergency Protection Orders) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2005/2105" uk:canonical="[2005] EWHC 2105 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] EWHC 2105 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 FLR 341" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 FLR 341</ref>: see at para [24].)</p>

Sometimes, as typically in cases of alleged sexual abuse, the first question is whether something did or did not happen &#8211; was the child sexually abused? Sometimes, as typically in many cases of alleged physical abuse, the question is not so much whether the child has been injured &#8211; the medical evidence is often clear enough as to the existence of the relevant injuries &#8211; but rather, as in the present case, as to whether the injuries were caused accidentally or non-accidentally. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In many cases of alleged abuse there may not be too much difficulty in deciding whether there has been abuse. Sometimes the much more difficult question is whether it is possible satisfactorily to identify the perpetrator(s). The first stage is for the court to identify those who are to be considered as included in the pool of possible perpetrators. Someone is to be included in the pool of possible perpetrators if, but only if, there is a &#8220;real possibility&#8221; that he or she was the perpetrator, or one of the perpetrators, of the abuse, or part of the abuse: <span style="font-style:italic">North Yorkshire County Council v SA</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2003/839" uk:canonical="[2003] EWCA Civ 839" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] EWCA Civ 839</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 2 FLR 849" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 2 FLR 849</ref>, at para [26]. Having excluded any potential perpetrators on the basis that there is no real possibility that they caused any part of the abuse, the court is left with a pool of possible perpetrators. The next stage is to consider which of the possible perpetrators was in fact the (or a) perpetrator. For this purpose the standard of proof is the ordinary civil standard of the &#8216;balance of probability&#8217; as defined and described by Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in <span style="font-style:italic">In re H and others (Minors) (Sexual Abuse: Standard of Proof)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1996] AC 563" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">[1996] AC 563</ref> at page 586.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I draw attention to these matters to bring out a point which needs to be borne in mind. There may be cases in which the court is able to find, to the relevant standard of proof, that A has abused B. There may be cases in which the court is able positively to exonerate A from an allegation of abuse; there may be material which enables the judge to find, not merely that the case against A is not proved but to go further and say that he is satisfied to the relevant standard of proof that A is not an abuser. Sometimes, however, in the nature of things the judge is unable to come to such clear-cut findings. Suspicion may remain, even if there is not a sufficient likelihood of A&#8217;s guilt to include him in the pool of possible perpetrators. Or A may find himself in the pool of possible perpetrators, because there is a &#8220;real possibility&#8221; that he is a perpetrator, but in circumstances where, even at the end of what may a long trial, there is insufficient evidence to enable the judge to make a finding to the relevant standard of proof either that A is a perpetrator or to exonerate him positively from the allegation. Not infrequently the outcome of a &#8216;threshold&#8217; or fact-finding hearing is to leave the identity of the perpetrator(s) uncertain. </p>

It is not to be assumed, when determining that question, that every child who is made the subject of care proceedings derives an automatic advantage from having them continued. There is no advantage to any child in being maintained as the subject of proceedings that have become redundant in purpose or ineffective in result. It is a matter of looking at each case to see whether there is some solid advantage to the child to be derived from continuing the proceedings.&#8221;</p>

Although care proceedings are inquisitorial, and often involve a detailed investigation of a child&#8217;s home life and history, they are not a general inquiry into everything that has happened. The local authority has, in the final analysis, two concerns, both of course directed to the child&#8217;s protection and welfare: first, to establish &#8216;threshold&#8217; so that the court has jurisdiction to make a care order and, second, to establish such facts as will persuade the court not merely to make a care order but also to approve the particular plan for the child that the local authority has produced under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref>A of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. </p>

It may seek to persuade the judge to make additional factual findings which it is thought are important either for the child or, possibly, for another child of the family. But often there will be no present need, and if no need no justification, for exploring, perhaps at some length and at great cost and ultimately without any clear conclusion, matters the proof of which is not necessary to enable the local authority to obtain the order it seeks. A local authority may have little difficulty in proving abuse. It may have more or less well-founded suspicions that a parent is the abuser. But if the parents are prepared to concede threshold on the basis of failure to protect, and do not resist the local authority&#8217;s plan (whatever it may be), the local authority may conclude that there is nothing, or nothing sufficient, to be gained by pressing on with what it knows may be the unsuccessful attempt to prove that the parent was an abuser. And even if the local authority is initially minded to press on, the judge in the proper exercise of his case management powers may conclude that, on balance, and for a variety of reasons, the possible advantages of the exercise are outweighed by the disadvantages.</p>
