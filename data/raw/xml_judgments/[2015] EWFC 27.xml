	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These are care proceedings in relation to two children, B, a boy, born in July 2010 and G, a girl, born in July 2011 (these are not their real initials). In terms of their ethnic origin, both the father, F, and the mother, M, come from an African country which I shall refer to as country A, though the mother was born and brought up in a Scandinavian country which I shall refer to as country S (again, these are not the real initials). The family are Muslims. The proceedings were commenced in November 2013, triggered by M&#8217;s seeming abandonment of G in the street. B and G were placed in foster care the same month and have remained with the same foster carer throughout.</p>

I said that I would give detailed reasons in due course. On 14 January 2015 I handed down a further judgment dealing with the most important issue in the proceedings, whether G had been subjected to female genital mutilation (FGM) and, if she had, what the implications of that were in relation to planning for her and her brother&#8217;s future: <span style="font-style:italic">Re B and G (No 2) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2015/3" uk:canonical="[2015] EWFC 3" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWFC 3</ref>.

A revised version dated 6 November 2014 was served at the conclusion of the oral evidence. Apart from the issue of FGM, the local authority&#8217;s case was arranged under four headings: (i) M&#8217;s mental health, (ii) domestic violence, (iii) neglect and physical abuse, and (iv) lack of cooperation / engagement. An earlier allegation of substance misuse by F had, very properly, been withdrawn.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Leaving on one side the issue of FGM, which is now out of the way, the local authority&#8217;s care plan for B and G was critically dependent on my findings, in particular in relation to domestic violence. Putting the matter shortly, the local authority&#8217;s case was that sufficiently serious findings of domestic violence by F, against either M or B and G, would justify B and G&#8217;s adoption. Otherwise, the local authority&#8217;s case was that they should be placed with F subject to a supervision order, M being ruled out by the local authority because of her continuing mental ill-health. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although, as I have said, in terms of their ethnic origin, both the father, F, and the mother, M, come from the same African country A, their personal histories are significantly different. M was born in Europe in country S in 1991. She and her family moved to this country in 2007. F was born in country A in 1973, though war in country A drove him and his family to another African country in 1991. F arrived in this country in 2005. F is not merely much older, he is significantly less &#8216;westernised&#8217;, than M. An important aspect of this is F&#8217;s belief that M was possessed by a spirit, a &#8216;jinn&#8217;. In his final submissions on his behalf, Mr Ekaney described F as a simple man with a relatively unsophisticated background, limited education and unconventional views about mental illness, principally influenced by his background and culture. I agree. F and M met in this country in 2008 and married in an Islamic ceremony in 2009. I am satisfied having heard their and other evidence that there is no basis for any suggestion that the marriage was arranged, let alone forced. They found each other and they decided to marry. It is clear that the marriage is now over and that their relationship is at an end. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is, I am satisfied in the light of all the medical and other evidence I have read and heard, no doubt that M has, as the local authority alleges in its revised threshold document, suffered since her teenage years from Schizo-Affective Disorder; that this has made her very vulnerable to stress-induced psychotic episodes marked by erratic and aggressive behaviour; that there has been a pattern of non-compliance by M with medication and mental health services; and that this has impacted adversely on her ability to meet her children&#8217;s needs and exposed them to chaotic and inconsistent parenting and neglect. A key question is whether M&#8217;s mental health is now sufficiently under control as to enable her to look after B and G. My conclusion is that it is not.</p>

The illness is currently in remission but it is a lifelong condition vulnerable to relapse through stress. Dr T in her evidence described it as a &#8220;chronic grumbling psychosis&#8221; and referred to M&#8217;s &#8220;fluctuating mental state.&#8221; She describes M as having been &#8220;floridly unwell&#8221; when admitted to a psychiatric unit in country S in April 2014. In answer to the suggestion that there was a &#8220;marked difference&#8221; between how M had presented when she saw her in January 2014 and in September 2014, Dr T&#8217;s response was &#8220;she didn&#8217;t present any differently at all to me&#8221;, though accepting that there was &#8220;cause for more optimism.&#8221; I accept that evidence. </p>

If stability and compliance could not be maintained over that length of time, it would be &#8220;very risky&#8221; for them to be returned to her care. M, in her opinion, remained vulnerable to stresses. Dr T thought that there needed to be ongoing supervision of contact. She could not support B and G&#8217;s return to M&#8217;s full time care. She drew attention to the fact that M&#8217;s attitude was unchanged:</p>

The local authority&#8217;s case, that F subjected M to verbal abuse, controlling behaviour and, on occasions, violence, is therefore dependent on the accounts given by the various professionals to whom M spoke. I have no difficulty in accepting, as I do, that these accounts are accurate.

First, it is said that B and G have experienced multiple moves of home in this country and abroad, causing instability and inconsistency of care. Secondly, the local authority points to specific instances of neglect: in October 2013, G was taken to nursery with spare clothes that were damp, soiled and smelled of urine; much more significant, on 7 November 2013 M, it is said, abandoned G in an alleyway in the city centre, where she was found cold, wet and very distressed. Thirdly, the local authority points to incidents when, it says, B and G were hit. The mother admits that she hit B in October 2013 on the back and face. There are confusing, and to an extent internally inconsistent, accounts given by M and F of physical assaults by the other on B and G the children, for instance, hitting the children with spoons. Fourthly, it is alleged by the local authority that B and G have been exposed to the volatility and violence in their parents&#8217; relationship.</p>

They do not present as children who have suffered from exposure to significant or repeated violence, whether domestic violence or violence directed at them. The foster mother&#8217;s evidence does not suggest that there was anything significantly wrong with either B or G when they were first taken into care. More generally, as Mr Ekaney correctly submits, the clear impression one derives from all the evidence is that B and G are lively, well-adjusted children, who have a free, easy, warm, positive and loving relationship with F. In saying that, Mr Ekaney is at pains to emphasise their relationship with M and the important need for it to continue.</p>

This, I accept, was driven by the two factors to which Mr Ekaney drew attention. The first was F&#8217;s perplexity about the family situation, largely caused by his failure to recognise the nature and extent of and inability to understand M&#8217;s mental health difficulties. The other was F&#8217;s desire to protect his family and his fear, from his perspective well-founded fear, that B and G would be removed from their care. Since B and G were taken into care, F&#8217;s attitude has changed. There has been, as Mr Ekaney puts it, a high level of co-operation and engagement with the local authority, coupled with a high level of commitment to B and G. And, as I accept, this is not due to any compulsion; it reflects F&#8217;s growing realisation and acceptance of the underlying realities.</p>

Adoption in the circumstances would not be in the best interests of either child.

If, nonetheless, B and G are to be placed with F, M would contend for that to be under the aegis of a care order. In essence her argument is that, given all that has happened, F will require the strict monitoring which can only be secured by the local authority sharing parental responsibility, and that without that level of statutory involvement there is too great a risk that M will be cut off in country S from contact with B and G.</p>

In relation to the appropriate form of order, Mr Ekaney observes correctly that no-one has advocated that placement with F is predicated on a particular order.

Two separate arguments propel me in this direction: first, the arguments from Mr Ekaney to which I have already referred and which I prefer to the arguments from  Mr Myers; and, second, the fact that the local authority is not seeking care orders. It would be a very strong thing, in circumstances such as exist here, to impose on a local authority an order more stringent than it is proposing, and in my judgment there is no adequate justification for doing so. Over and above all this, and at the end of the day of determinative importance, I am satisfied that F is trustworthy and can be relied upon. Care orders are simply not necessary. Otherwise I agree with the guardian&#8217;s recommendations in relation to transition planning and that M&#8217;s contact should initially be supervised.   </p>
