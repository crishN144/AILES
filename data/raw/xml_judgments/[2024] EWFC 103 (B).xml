	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">On 17 November 2023 I gave judgment following a fact-finding hearing. I found that the father had perpetrated very serious domestic abuse against the mother. That abuse had included coercive and controlling patterns of behaviour, rape, and non-fatal strangulation. The father had also manipulated the two older children to copy his behaviour towards the mother, and had seriously undermined her relationship with them. </p>

For obvious reasons, the situation urgently required the intervention and assistance of LB Tower Hamlets, which had been working with the family for some time.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">It is very unfortunate that this assistance has not been forthcoming. The local authority&#8217;s response to my findings has been to reject them, in substance if not explicitly. Since the fact-finding hearing it has continued to work with the family on the basis that this is a case involving cross-allegations by both parents in a high-conflict scenario, and that the children are safe in the care of their father. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The parents were married for about 15 years. The marriage broke down in 2022 after the mother reported that the father had raped her. The father left the home but moved back in late 2022, and the final separation took place in February 2023. The children made allegations at school that the mother had been physically and emotionally abusive towards them and the local authority and police became involved. The mother left the family home and the father remained living there with the children.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">After the mother left the family home the local authority worked with the family under child protection plans and then child in need plans. A, who had been expressing suicidal thoughts, was referred to CAMHS. The father was closely involved in the CAMHS work, which proceeded, as far as I can tell, on the basis that it was only the mother and not the father who had behaved abusively towards the children. </p>

There were some practical issues around how this would work, due to the fact that the mother did not have accommodation in the area of the children&#8217;s schools, and there was some uncertainty as to whether the maternal grandmother, who lives nearer to the schools, could assist. Following the hearing, when these issues had been clarified, the parties agreed that the children would spend time with the mother at the grandmother&#8217;s home on the following schedule:</p>

However, at the outset of this hearing both counsel informed me that they did not consider the court could yet make final decisions about the children&#8217;s living arrangements because the local authority had not yet completed (in fact, had not yet started) various assessments it planned to undertake as part of the PLO process. It was suggested that the hearing should be adjourned for an unspecified period of time, likely to be for several months, and that the current arrangements should continue in the meantime. </p>

Indeed, when the mother&#8217;s position was further explored it became apparent that even if a final decision were adjourned she would want the court to consider the interim arrangements, on the basis that she believed the risks to be too high for the current arrangements to continue. I took the view that in order to consider the arrangements for the children, on either an interim or final basis, I would need to hear evidence. I said I would defer the issue of whether any change should be interim or final until the conclusion of the hearing. </p>

In short, a pattern of coercive and/or controlling behaviour can be as abusive as or more abusive than any particular factual incident that might be written down and included in a schedule in court proceedings (see &#8216;Scott Schedules&#8217; at paragraph 42 -50). It follows that the harm to a child in an abusive household is not limited to cases of actual violence to the child or to the parent. A pattern of abusive behaviour is as relevant to the child as to the adult victim. The child can be harmed in any one or a combination of ways for example where the abusive behaviour:</p>

From what I can gather from the local authority records, the work with CAMHS appears to have been undertaken solely on the premise that A had experienced physical abuse from his mother, with little or no information being provided to CAMHS about the more nuanced and complex aspects of the situation. It is also clear that the father was closely involved in the CAMHS work and in regular contact with the therapist. A recommendation from CAMHS during the work was that the mother should apologise to A. I have real concerns that this work unintentionally perpetuated the father&#8217;s false narrative, and that it has contributed to A&#8217;s perception of his mother as the harmful parent and his father as the person who has his best interests at heart. </p>

He is 13 and has expressed strongly negative views about the prospect of a move to his mother&#8217;s care. These views have some foundation, although A does not have a full understanding of why his mother behaved as she did. There is a risk of harm to him if an order is made which forces him to accept that outcome without sufficient preparation and support.</p>

A, I accept, should not do so immediately but there should be a clear plan for him to join his siblings as soon as that can safely be achieved. In the meantime, the mother suggests that the maternal grandmother should support her with the care of A. She lives near to the family home and the mother and children have been spending substantial time there since February. She is willing to have A stay with her. I am hopeful that she will be able to assist with a transition plan, so that A&#8217;s return to his mother&#8217;s care takes place at a pace that he is able to manage. </p>

That arrangement will enable the father to continue his involvement in the boys&#8217; football training and also to spend time with C. </p>

All three children would find it hard, after such a long period when they have lived with their father, to understand why their time with him needs to be supervised, and the boys I think would not accept it. I recognise the risks, but they can be managed if the contact takes place at the times specified: it is then likely to be mostly activity-based, and it will not take place overnight. It goes without saying that if there is evidence of the father seeking to influence the children&#8217;s views against their mother, or otherwise to undermine her parenting, the issue of supervision will need to be revisited. </p>

She needs to recover from the trauma which he has caused. When the mother moved out of the family home in February 2023 it was on the basis of an assessment of risk by the police and local authority which has subsequently been found to be wrong, or at the very least incomplete. Unfortunately, that decision reinforced the harm already caused to the mother who for a long time was treated as a perpetrator rather than a victim. It is necessary now to provide the mother with stability and a safe space so that she can begin to recover and heal. </p>

Secondly, where the values under the two articles are in conflict, an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case is necessary. Thirdly, the justifications for interfering with or restricting each right must be taken into account. Finally, the proportionality test must be applied to each. For convenience I will call this the ultimate balancing test.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">In my judgement the appropriate balance as between rights under Articles 8 and 10 leads to a decision that in the published version of this judgment the names of family members and the name of the individual social worker should be anonymised, but the local authority should be identified. I reach that decision for the following reasons:</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">I recognise that the mother has a legitimate wish, and a desire, to speak publicly about the fact that she has been a victim of domestic abuse who has been failed by the local authority. I have had regard to the approach taken by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Griffiths v Tickle</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2021/1882" uk:canonical="[2021] EWCA Civ 1882" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] EWCA Civ 1882</ref>. However the circumstances of this case are different, in that there has so far been no publicity about any member of the family. A and B are considerably older than the child in <span style="font-style:italic">Griffiths v Tickle</span> and A is particularly vulnerable; the risks of publicity affecting them adversely are therefore higher. In my view the mother&#8217;s Article 10 right to &#8220;tell her story&#8221; is outweighed in this case by the children&#8217;s rights to privacy. </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">There is no real risk that naming the local authority will lead to identification of the family. Tower Hamlets is a large urban area. The judgment can be redacted in such a way that the identities of the children are protected, without the need for the borough in which they live to be redacted. On the other side of the scale there is a strong public interest in a public body being held accountable for failings of this nature, so that they are not repeated in future. </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">The issue of whether the individual social worker should be named is finely balanced. I do not consider that naming her would add to the risk of the family being identified, so the argument for anonymisation can be based only on her own Article 8 rights. In <span style="font-style:italic">Tickle v Herefordshire CC</span> [2022] EWHC 1017 Lieven J accepted a local authority&#8217;s generalised arguments based on the potential impact of naming social workers on morale and recruitment, but nevertheless refused to anonymise a social worker in the absence of evidence of likely vilification and harassment. When Lieven J gave her judgment the decision of the President in <span style="font-style:italic">Abbasi v Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Trust</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2022] 2 WLR 465" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2022">[2022] 2 WLR 465</ref> to anonymise a class of professionals on a similar basis had not yet been overturned by the Court of Appeal. <span style="font-style:italic">Abbasi</span> has now reached the Supreme Court and a decision is awaited. As the law currently stands, the starting point must be that professionals will not usually be anonymised in published judgments, in the absence of evidence that there is a real likelihood of interference with Article 8 rights. </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">However, in this case the fault did not, in my judgment, lie with the individual social worker but with those in positions of greater authority, particularly those with legal qualifications who should have been expected to understand the local authority&#8217;s obligation to accept the findings of a court. Essentially the social worker misunderstood the legal position in circumstances where she was not properly advised. In my view it would be unfair to expose her to public criticism for that, when the real failing was on the part of others in the local authority who could and should have steered this case in a very different direction. </p>
