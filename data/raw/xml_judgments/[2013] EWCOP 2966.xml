This is rather like the subplot in a play by Shakespeare, in as much as it is slightly subversive and distracts from the issues on which the court is required to adjudicate. Nevertheless, it complements the main theme and adds a touch of realism.</p>

Because they were oblivious to the seriousness of the situation, I recommended that they seek legal advice and suggested that it may also be appropriate to consider making an application to the court for authority to execute a statutory will on GM&#8217;s behalf. Having given advice of this nature, I recused myself from adjudicating on any statutory will application. </p>

They pay GM&#8217;s fees regularly by banker&#8217;s draft. The care home advised that she receives a weekly discounted rate of &#163;495.00. The visitor advised that since GM&#8217;s admission her weekly fees had been below that of other residents because the care home proprietors felt that the client did not have much money and did not wish the deputies to consider uprooting her. The visitor stated that the impression in the care home is that money is very limited for GM and she herself told our visitor that &#8216;she does not have the money to buy things.&#8217;</span></p>

The visitor said &#8216;GM is both capable and would appear to the staff to greatly enjoy looking at and choosing clothes for herself when the opportunity arises. The manager felt strongly that an allowance of even &#163;100 extra per year through the resident spending money account for GM to choose some of her own clothes would significantly enhance the quality of her life.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>

I believe that this restricts GM&#8217;s civil liberty to make a choice if these are the only clothes she is allowed to wear. &#8230;</span></p>

		    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.25in"><span style="font-size:11pt">&#8220;The second consideration is the need to protect the interests of the donor when he has become incapable. Once that event has happened, the attorney would, in the absence of special safeguards, be able to use his power without any supervision by anybody. The donor&#8217;s incapacity involves a material change of circumstances and deprives him of the control that a capable attorney can exercise over his attorney to prevent misuse of the power, accidental or otherwise. While we do not think that deliberate fraud would be likely to be commonplace, we suspect that many relatives of donors might be tempted to use their EPAs in ways which were not strictly for the donor&#8217;s benefit. This would not necessarily be done dishonestly. Attorneys might persuade themselves that, if their donor had been capable, he would have wanted them to benefit from his property out of gratitude for their help. Or they might wish to reduce the incidence of taxation that would arise on the donor&#8217;s death by giving away much of his estate in advance.&#8221;</span></p>

What we do know, however, is that, according to the form COP1A, completed by MJ on 11 October 2011, before she lost the capacity to manage her financial affairs, GM had set up a monthly direct debit for &#163;20 payable to the National Deaf Children&#8217;s Society. Surprisingly, this was not one of the many charities to which the applicants made a substantial gift on her behalf. This level of gifting is consistent with the applicants&#8217; evidence at the hearing on 3 April 2013 that, before the onset of her vascular dementia, GM made relatively modest monetary gifts in the region of &#163;20 a time. As regards GM&#8217;s present wishes and feelings, the Court of Protection Visitor&#8217;s observations are noted.</p>

The approval of only &#163;73,352 has left them personally liable to GM&#8217;s estate in the sum of &#163;204,459.74, which they must pay back.</p>

GM&#8217;s finances are in disarray because of their conduct, and it is in her best interests that someone with experience of cases of unjust enrichment and restitution, such as a panel deputy, is appointed to manage her affairs in their place. </p>
