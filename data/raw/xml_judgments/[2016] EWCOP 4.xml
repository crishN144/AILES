	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is well known that young people take risks.   Risk-taking is often unwise.  It is also an inherent, inevitable, and perhaps necessary part of adolescence and early adulthood experience.   The central issue which arises in this case is whether risks taken by a 20-year old young woman with autism represent &#8216;unwise&#8217; decision-making, or evidence her lack of capacity.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Z is a young woman aged 20.  In very many ways she is typical of a young person of her age; she is passionate about music, and has some talent in that respect; she is fascinated by celebrity status; she enjoys social media, through which she recently met a partner; she currently lives at home where she plainly values being cared for by her mother (&#8216;X&#8217;), but aspires to live independently.  She has a group of friends locally with whom she socialises.  Her bedroom at home is described as being &#8220;in complete disarray, with numerous items strewn on the floor and every surface&#8221;, a familiar sight to a parent of an adolescent or young adult.   She dresses fashionably, and plainly takes great pride in her appearance.  She is not currently employed but spends her time preparing for music and performance exams.  Z has, as my judgment reveals, taken many risks in the past in the way she has lived her life and made her relationships; some of that risk-taking has probably caused her harm.  The essential questions in this case now are whether (a) that risk-taking arises from her lack of capacity, or is an ordinary feature of her adolescent life (or both), and (b) whether over the last year or so, since the inception of these proceedings, she has matured and/or learned from her mistakes.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In order to reach conclusions, I heard evidence from Z, from X (Z&#8217;s mother), from WBC&#8217;s current key social worker, and from Dr. Lisa Rippon (consultant developmental psychiatrist).  Additionally, I received considerable documentary evidence, including most helpful attendance notes from the consultant solicitor appointed on behalf of the Official Solicitor.  X opposes the Local Authority&#8217;s case.  The Official Solicitor, on Z&#8217;s behalf, having called Z to give evidence and having tested the evidence of the Local Authority, invites me to conclude that the local authority has failed to prove its case, and that Z has capacity in the various matters under review.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This hearing, at which I am considering the &#8216;gateway&#8217; jurisdiction of capacity, is taking place 18 months after the issue of proceedings.  The hearing (which was conducted over two days &#8211; 2 and 3 December 2015) was set up by directions which were given on 23 December 2014, one year ago.   I have examined with counsel the listing difficulties; no blame for this falls on any one body.  However, valuable time has been lost in resolving basic issues about Z&#8217;s capacity to make routine decisions, and all the while she has been subject of interim orders under the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref></span>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, the expert assessment of Dr. Lisa Rippon Consultant Developmental Psychiatrist, on which much reliance is placed by the local authority in this case, was conducted well over one year ago now.  Dr. Rippon was asked to see Z again in preparation for this hearing, but was able to do so only on 30 November (less than 2 working days before the hearing); Dr. Rippon&#8217;s updated views were communicated to the parties and the court in a short e-mail.  This was far from satisfactory.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, the hearing has been set up for me to consider the issue of Z&#8217;s capacity in respect of the relevant &#8216;matters&#8217;, but (in the event of a finding of lack of capacity) no substantive welfare issues.  I am concerned that no specific provision had been made for the listing of a follow-up hearing before me in the event that I was to find that Z lacked capacity.  Judicial continuity is as important in this jurisdiction as it is in the family courts; it would be inappropriate, in my view, for another judge to consider the best interests issue concerning Z once I have determined capacity.  Quite apart from any other consideration, the issue of capacity may require re-visiting, particularly if in the meantime &#8216;P&#8217; has been assisted to reach a capacitous decision (<span style="font-style:italic">section 1(3)</span>).  When case managing litigation of this kind, attention must be given to achieving judicial continuity.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Quite apart from the burden on Z herself of these proceedings hanging over her for an unacceptable period of time, these procedural shortcomings render all the harder the decision-making in this case.  Steps are being taken to improve the case management efficiency of the Court of Protection, as signalled by Sir James Munby P in <span style="font-style:italic">Re MN</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2015/411" uk:canonical="[2015] EWCA Civ 411" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWCA Civ 411</ref>.  In that judgment (at [100]) he spoke of the &#8220;striking contrast between the time some personal welfare cases in the Court of Protection take to reach finality and the six-month time limit applicable in care proceedings by virtue of <span style="font-style:italic">section 32(1)(a)(ii)</span> of the [<span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref></span>]&#8221;, and the fact that &#8220;the recently established ad hoc Court of Protection Rules Committee is actively considering the need for reform&#8221;.  This case illustrates well that more efficient case management rigour is urgently required in this jurisdiction.</p>

In the days immediately prior to this hearing, MacDonald J delivered judgment in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust v C and V</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2015/80" uk:canonical="[2015] EWCOP 80" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWCOP 80</ref>. Both counsel appearing before me relied on the summary of the law relevant to capacity conveniently summarised in that judgment at paragraphs [24]-[39]; I agree broadly with his distillation of the law, and adopt it without reproducing it in full here.  Nonetheless, it is right that I should identify some of the key principles which have governed my approach in this case.</p>

I remind myself that I should not treat Z as &#8220;unable to make a decision&#8221; unless &#8220;all practicable steps to help [her] have been taken without success&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic">section 1(3)</span>), and significantly should not treat Z as unable to make a decision &#8220;merely because [she] makes an unwise decision&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic">section 1(4)</span>).

She reported that she had many friends at school, although contemporaneous records in fact show her to have been rather isolated and a loner.  After school she went on to train in the field of beauty therapy at a local education college, but her passion has always been, and is, music; Z keenly wishes to be a singer.  In 2012, Z appeared in a televised talent show; it was not a success.  Sadly she now regards the experience as humiliating and she is embarrassed by her performance.  She dropped out of college and became depressed.  A referral was made to CAMHS.  She started to display risky behaviours; her performance was available to view on the internet, and she was deluged with contacts through web-based social media, mainly from men.  She met with some of those who contacted her, some of whom allegedly abused or exploited her.  She became sexually disinhibited, and some of her sexual experiences were believed to be non-consensual.  Over a period of time, Z received support from SECOS (Sexually Exploited Children&#8217;s Outreach Services); although she appeared to show some insight into the risks of her behaviours, it became apparent that she did not always apply this insight or learning into practice, and continued to place herself at risk.  The last evidence of this kind of risky behaviour with men now goes back to 2013 or (at the latest) 2014. </p>

[Z] expressed an understandable wish to be independent but, in my view, because of her under-estimation of the risks involved in living by herself without the support of another individual, be that her mother or a care worker&#8230;&#8221;</p>

Even during the first day of the hearing her view changed; when the hearing began, she was expressing the preference to live independently. But on the afternoon of the same day, when she gave her evidence, she said that she wanted to remain living at home.  Z&#8217;s change of mind during the hearing about her choice to live independently did not appear to be capricious or without reason, but instead a direct reaction to the confirmation given (during the course of the oral evidence of the social worker, to which Z was listening as she sat in court) that if she were in independent accommodation, her home would be alarmed, so that the care agency would know when she was coming and going &#8211; an understandable resistance to a deprivation of her liberty.  Dr. Rippon was clear that this oscillation was not of itself reflective of a lack of capacity.</p>

Inevitably lengthy assessment sessions need to be summarised for court reports.  Equally inevitably, in summarising the exchanges between the interviewer and the interviewee some of the context, nuance, and character of the discussion is lost, even where the summaries are supported with directly quoted text.  Having read the reports several times, with care, I was left unsure that I had received a complete or rounded picture of what Z was saying; some of Z&#8217;s specific responses were included to illustrate the expert opinion that she lacked capacity, but on my reading of them could just as easily have shown merely naivety, immaturity, diffidence, or embarrassment. That naivety, immaturity, diffidence or embarrassment may well not translate into (or necessarily evidence) a lack of capacity.  It was, in the circumstances, particularly valuable to have the chance to hear from Z myself, and form an assessment of her, assisted by Dr. Rippon&#8217;s expertise, when Z herself gave evidence in court at the hearing.</p>

Attention was inevitably focused on the only episode which has caused professional concern in the period since the reports were produced &#8211; Z&#8217;s trip to visit A in Brighton.  Dr. Rippon considered that this episode shows that Z still struggles to estimate risk, understand abstract concepts, and manage problem-solving as a consequence of her autism.  She felt Z over-estimates her ability to keep herself safe, and underestimates her own vulnerability; that in order to be confident that Z has capacity, Dr. Rippon indicated that she would be looking for Z to develop and display insight, that she is not putting herself in risky situations and is understanding of other people&#8217;s motives.  Dr. Rippon was concerned that A&#8217;s hoax profile on Badoo had not triggered alarm bells for Z, though acknowledged that as Z (and her mother) had met A several times before the Brighton trip, any objective concerns would have been moderated by having been able to form a personal view about A.  That Z still regarded A as a &#8220;sly&#8221; person even before the trip to Brighton revealed to Dr. Rippon that Z was not protecting herself from risk.</p>

In terms of the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref></span> test, it was, in her view, Z&#8217;s inability to &#8216;use or weigh&#8217; (<span style="font-style:italic">section 3(1)(c)</span>) the information relevant to risk which rendered her incapacitous in the relevant &#8216;matters&#8217; to which attention is drawn in this case, which she summarised as an inability to understand the positives and negatives on emotional wellbeing.  Dr. Rippon said that it was &#8220;very difficult&#8221; to identify what Z needed to demonstrate in order to permit for the conclusion that Z was indeed capacitous in the key matters under discussion. Dr. Rippon accepted that Z understands the difference between living alone and living with her mother, and that if living alone, bills would need to be paid, the cooking and cleaning done; Z appeared to understand in broad terms the difference between living in a good and bad area of town.  Dr. Rippon accepted that Z could have help with her finances, had a &#8220;rough idea&#8221; of her benefits, and understood that the proposal of the local authority was that any independent accommodation would need to be alarmed.  In resisting the need for help, Dr. Rippon acknowledged that Z may simply not have wanted to admit that she needed support.  Dr. Rippon thought that Z could learn new skills, particularly if she formed positive relationships with people who could help her; she recognised that there is now evidence that she is already learning skills to keep herself safe without a relationship with a key social worker.  Going forward, Dr. Rippon recommended that Z should have access to supports to help her to make sense of risks, whatever my decision on capacity.  </p>

Mr O&#8217;Brien invited me to &#8220;infer&#8221; that the same level of risk remained the same throughout 2015, to the date of trial; the absence of clear evidence of risk-taking (he contended) arises simply from the fact that that during 2015 the local authority has simply not been able to monitor the situation as effectively as it had previously been able to do.  He contended that the Brighton trip was &#8216;all of a piece&#8217; with Z&#8217;s pre-proceedings risky behaviour: Z had not considered the consequences of her actions in travelling to Brighton to stay with A when it was apparent (it was contended) that this would be essentially risky.  Lack of capacity to make decisions concerning residence and care is established by Z&#8217;s lack of appreciation of her need for support, and community based supervision, to enable her to life safely; it is argued by the Local Authority that Z does not want support yet (it is contended) she so palpably needs support that this exposes her lack of ability to &#8220;use or weigh&#8221; the relevant information.

She argued that the Brighton trip does not provide evidence of careless risk-taking; on the contrary, while the decision to travel to Brighton may have been, on one construction, unwise, the evidence discloses a degree of awareness of the various risky situations which arose, and an entirely appropriate response (i.e. to leave) when Z felt that the situation had become intolerable.   She contended that Dr. Rippon had insufficiently analysed the current data, and had (like the Local Authority) given insufficient credit to Z for her greater maturity and experience; she speculated that by suggesting that Z needed to demonstrate that she could avoid risk, Dr. Rippon had inadvertently reversed the burden of proof.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Local Authority was perfectly justified in initiating proceedings in June 2014, at what was a very low point in Z&#8217;s life when her self-destructive behaviour was posing a significant threat to her well-being, and her capacity to process key decisions was significantly in question.  I am inclined to the view (this is not, for obvious reasons, a finding) that she probably did lack capacity to make decisions on the matters under review at that time. However, having reviewed the contemporaneous material with care, and on the evidence available to the court at this hearing, I have reached the conclusion, on a fine balance, that the local authority has not rebutted the presumption of Z&#8217;s capacity in relation to the matters under review in this case, at the present time. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is no dispute in this case that Z does suffer from an &#8220;impairment of &#8230; the mind&#8221; within the meaning of the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref></span>, namely her autistic spectrum disorder, with a secondary component being her learning difficulty.  The issue as to her capacity focuses in this case on the functional element of the test.  At the heart of the dispute is the assessment of Z&#8217;s ability to &#8216;use or weigh&#8217; information (<span style="font-style:italic">section 3(1)(c)</span>) about risk to herself, and her ability to keep herself safe in independent living, and in her social contacts.  Only if I were to find that Z is &#8220;unable&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic">section 3</span>) (and I emphasise &#8216;inability&#8217; rather than &#8216;impairment&#8217; &#8211; see again [15] above) to process information relevant to risk (in the ways defined in <span style="font-style:italic">section 3(1)</span>) could I find her incapacitous in relation to the matters in dispute.  As the wording of the statute makes clear, the point in time at which I must capacity is to be tested is now (i.e. &#8220;at the material time&#8221;).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In order to determine Z&#8217;s capacity, it is not necessary for her to use or weigh <span style="font-style:italic">every detail</span> of the respective options available, merely the salient factors (see <span style="font-style:italic">CC v KK and STCC</span>: [12] above).  In this case, it is apparent to me that Z does indeed understand the essential implications of living at home or living independently; as indicated above, Z acknowledged the benefit of having some &#8220;guidance&#8221; on living independently.  She recognised that she would reasonably expect to be allocated a flat, and was able to distinguish between the &#8216;good&#8217; areas and &#8216;bad&#8217; areas of town in which to live.  I am (perhaps unlike Dr. Rippon) sufficiently persuaded that Z recognises at a material level the benefit of third party support in the event that she is to live on her own.  She showed insight into the possible loneliness of living independently; she felt that one of the downsides of leaving home is that she will lose the benefit of having her mother&#8217;s &#8220;shoulder to cry on&#8221; when things are getting her down.  She has an outline knowledge of her financial circumstances, and currently appears able to perform basic budgeting.  She seems aware that her life is easy now, as all the bills are paid, and she is cared for; I felt that she recognised that she would be giving these comforts up if she were to move.  Overall, I am satisfied that Z is able to &#8216;use or weigh&#8217; the evidence relevant to the matters set out by Theis J in <span style="font-style:italic">LBX v K and L</span> (see above) at [14].</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to social contacts, Z needs to be able to weigh up the risks of associating with strangers, particularly those whom she meets through the internet &#8211; something which she says that she has indeed learned to deal with through experience. Dr. Rippon acknowledged that, other than with A, there was no evidence of Z making contacts through social media which were of any concern.  The fact that she has rejected any ongoing support or care from Dimensions is not evidence in itself that she lacks the capacity to decide on its usefulness.  She has articulated her reasons: she does not feel that she currently needs the package, and she feels that the workers are constantly talking about the past not the future, and they &#8216;talk down&#8217; to her.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr. Rippon expressed the view in November 2014 (see [29] above), that with time and increased maturity, Z&#8217;s ability accurately to assess risk may improve; it is my view that the evidence now available (December 2015) indicates that time and increased maturity, and the benefit of learning from experience, have indeed had that effect.  There is no real issue but that 2015 has been a period of relative stability for Z; she has engaged (to a limited extent at least) with the support which is provided for her through Dimensions, and even within the limits of that work, she has impressed the workers with her display of increased maturity.  In 2014, Dr. Rippon advised that it would be sensible to re-assess Z&#8217;s capacity in &#8220;two to three years time&#8221;, plainly contemplating a potential future change in capacity, but timescales of this kind are notoriously difficult to gauge, and in my view the evidence appears to have revealed change rather sooner.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">While it may have been that Z showed an &#8220;unusual&#8221; degree of interest in fame and celebrity in the past (to some extent in 2014, when first interviewed by Dr. Rippon), and a limited appreciation of the quality of her talent-show performance, I do not find that she continues to hold or display these views. More recent discussions (including her evidence in court) reveal a good degree of awareness of the deficiencies of her performance, and a more realistic appraisal of her quest for fame.  At the hearing before me, she impressed as someone who was more than just aware that &#8220;people should treat you with respect&#8221;, apparently mindful that people had not done so in the past.   Dr. Rippon expressed scepticism in her 2014 report about Z&#8217;s ability to understand the evidence which was to be given in Court, process this information and use it to instruct her counsel appropriately; this scepticism was I believe misplaced.  Z showed a good level of attention to the evidence, gave instructions to her solicitor and counsel, and &#8211; even on Dr. Rippon&#8217;s own view &#8211; answered questions in evidence better than she had during the three previous interviews.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr. Rippon entirely fairly observed that young adults are generally able to learn from negative experiences, and use this to support their future decision making.  She felt that Z had failed to do this; I do not agree.  Z&#8217;s behaviour in 2013 and 2014 was, I am prepared to accept for present purposes, intensely destructive; I accept Z&#8217;s own assessment that she has at least to some extent &#8220;learned how to make decisions&#8221;.  I accept that she has changed, and I was impressed with her own assessment that &#8220;&#8230; everything has happened for a reason. It made me stronger and made me more mature&#8221; (see [30] above).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr. Rippon indicated that she would be looking for Z to develop and display insight, that she is not putting herself in risky situations and is understanding of other people&#8217;s motives; the trip to Brighton to stay with A was risky to some extent, but not more than usually risky for a young person who is in love, and who has met the object of her affections a number of times on home territory before heading off to see her at her home. Moreover, when the Brighton trip became intolerable, she left. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As indicated at the outset of this judgment, some risk-taking in adolescents and young adults can be perfectly healthy, such as in sporting activities, or artistic and creative pursuits, travelling, making new friends (including internet dating and friendship groups), or entering competitions.  Healthy risk-taking helps young people to learn.   Some adolescent risk-taking can be unhealthy and dangerous &#8211; casual sexual relationships, unprotected sex, driving too fast on the roads, excessive consumption of alcohol, consumption of non-prescribed drugs, dealing with anger and confrontation.  These forms of risk-taking are inherently unwise and unsafe.  In dealing with risk issues in relation to a young person in the context of assessment under the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref></span>, it is necessary to separate out as far as is possible the evidence which indicates that second category of risk taking (unhealthy, dangerous, unwise) from that which reveals or may reveal a lack of capacity.  As Lewison LJ said in <span style="font-style:italic">PC v City of York </span>(above) &#8220;adult autonomy&#8221; includes the freedom &#8220;to make unwise decisions, provided that they have the capacity to decide&#8221; (see [64]). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Lewison LJ also referred in the same case (<span style="font-style:italic">PC v City of York</span>) to the need for a &#8220;solid evidential foundation&#8221; on which the judge's decision as to capacity can rest.  In this case, as I have earlier mentioned, Mr O&#8217;Brien invites me to &#8216;infer&#8217; a continued existence of risk, and Z&#8217;s inability to &#8216;use or weigh&#8217; information relevant to such risk.  An inference can barely be described as an evidential foundation, let alone a &#8216;solid&#8217; one. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have not found this a particularly easy decision, in the main, because more than a year had passed between the filing of the principal evidence and the hearing.  Moreover, I am conscious that I am differing in my conclusion from Dr. Rippon, who in many ways was an impressive and helpful witness and who, as I have indicated above (see [52]) also found the case &#8220;incredibly difficult&#8221;.  In differing from Dr. Rippon, I remind myself that her role and mine are distinct: the expert advises and the court decides.  While the opinion of an independently instructed expert in a case such as this is &#8220;likely to be of very considerable importance&#8221; (Baker J in <span style="font-style:italic">PH v A Local Authority </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2011/1704" uk:canonical="[2011] EWCOP 1704" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] EWHC 1704 (COP)</ref>), as indeed I find her evidence to be, the decision as to capacity is a judgment for the court (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re SB </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2013/1417" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCOP 1417" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 1417 (COP)</ref>), weighing the expert evidence against my findings on the other evidence.   I consider that Dr. Rippon may well have been right in her assessment as to Z&#8217;s capacity over a year ago (November 2014), but in my judgment, the passage of time and Z&#8217;s greater maturity, coupled with some support from Dimensions and enhanced self-esteem through her music, Z appears to have matured, learned from her mistakes, and developed sufficiently in her capacity to make relevant decisions, and keep herself safe.  While the Brighton trip illustrates some unwise decision-making, in fact its greater significance lies in its revelation to me (in contrast to Dr. Rippon) that Z had developed sufficient ability to &#8216;use or weigh&#8217; information which indicated risk, and insight into the consequences of her choices.  In the way she described the visit when giving her unsworn evidence, it is apparent that she was alert throughout the trip to the potential hazards (i.e. the events which made her uncomfortable) and when the relationship with A appeared to be deteriorating badly, she took the appropriate step, entirely independently, of returning home. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have conscientiously cautioned myself against considering outcome when determining Z&#8217;s functional ability; I repeat this point, as I am conscious that Z is a vulnerable young person who deserves to have, and should be persuaded to receive, support from adult social services going forward.  It is tempting for the court to take a paternalistic, perhaps overly risk-averse, approach to Z&#8217;s future; but this would be unprincipled and wrong.  I am satisfied in any event that Z currently has a reasonably fulfilling life, which enjoys; she has a loving relationship with her mother who currently cares for her well and who, I hope, could be encouraged to do so for a while longer while Z grows further in maturity and confidence.</p>
