	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The court is giving this ex tempore judgment in relation to a hearing that was listed today with a time estimate of one-and-a-half hours (presumably to include reading, submissions, and judgment time).  I observe in passing that it is now 4 o&#8217;clock.  The matter has been in court for submissions in excess of two hours so on any view it was an over-optimistic time estimate, for which counsel who appear before me did not demure from or take any steps in advance to ensure the court was informed of what was a more realistic time estimate. </p>

The directions read: &#8220;On the basis that the mother intends to travel abroad with the child on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August the stay application which is made by the father and the application for permission to appeal subject to the judge&#8217;s discretion is listed [today] with a time estimate of one-and-ahalf hours&#8221;.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The matters that the court is considering, therefore, is not only permission to appeal but also the application for a stay.  During the course of the hearing, there has been a debate which comes first. It is accepted by all parties that in fact the two are closely entwined and both parties have accepted, or at least nobody has taken any objection to, the fact that the court should consider both issues today.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The appellant is the father and the respondent the mother of Z.  They have been extremely well represented at this hearing, not only in terms of the written submissions that have been put in but by the eloquent submissions on behalf of the father by Mr. Edwards and by Mr. Setright Q.C. on behalf of the mother.  I have read the bundle and skeleton arguments before coming into court.   </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The relevant background can be summarised as follows.  The father and the mother had a relatively brief relationship, separating in early 2016 when Z was very young. They did not marry and there have been subsequent proceedings issued by both of them.  Shortly after the separation the mother applied for an order under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1996</ref> and a Prohibited Steps Order, due to her concerns about the father&#8217;s alleged drug use and behaviour.  Orders were made without notice to the father at the end of August 2016 by MacDonald J. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">There then followed a number of inter-partes hearings during which time the father made an application for a Child Arrangements Order.  This culminated in an order made in October 2016, which set out a staged process whereby Z would spend increasing times with the father, initially starting on Saturdays, moving to Saturdays and Sundays, and then progressing to alternate weekends.  According to the mother, this contact did not work out as planned. She says there were times, which have been a feature of their post-separation relationship, when the father would not be around or available to see Z.  To some extent that is disputed by the father. </p>

There were undertakings given by the parties about use of or not using controlled drugs or alcohol during any time that Z was in their care to the extent that it may impair their ability to be able to care for Z. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">There was then again a structure of time that Z would be spending with the father starting off with some times during the week, moving on to alternate weekends from the short weekend from Saturday till Sunday moving on to Friday to Sunday and then building up again on one weekend a month from Friday to Monday. There was provision for alternate Christmas periods that Z would spend with the parents and if either parent went away, there would be provision for time to be made up. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Following on with the chronology, the mother&#8217;s case is that again the father did not follow and adhere to the planned arrangements for the time that he spent with Z and there is some suggestion he had not spent a night with the father in his sole care for a considerable period of time.  More recently, according to the mother, the father has been more involved prior to the ex parte hearing in July and, according to her in the statement she submitted to the court in support of her recent ex parte application, that exposed her and Z to the father&#8217;s behaviour as described by her in her statement.  This is denied by the father and directions have been made for him to file evidence. </p>

The judge was dealing with an interim position, there is sufficient reasoning given where he gives the father an opportunity at each stage to be able to say what he wants to say.  He does not shut out that opportunity and when one looks at the objections made the only one of any substance, he submits, is the one in relation to a flight risk. That needed to be looked at in the context of the history of the case where there have been numerous trips abroad and where there has been no suggestion that the child has not been brought back to this jurisdiction. The trips abroad include up until February of this year. He submits, with the suitable safeguards in place, as he set out and listed, there would be no or very limited risk in relation to non-return because of the fact that the proposed destination is in Europe and the necessary safeguards that can be put in place. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Mr. Setright, on behalf of the mother, submits this court can deal with this issue, proportionately looking at the welfare position of Z.  He says it should be done against the background of the litigation and this is family that has had regular trips abroad where there has been no issue about the mother not returning back to the jurisdiction.   He submits that with the safeguards I imagine that would be in place with the June 2017 order, with the addition of the safeguards that he proposes, namely evidence provided of the return flight, the holiday address where the mother and Z will be staying at, confirmation that the nanny will be present, and that she will have charge of the passport.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Mr. Edwards raised that there are now concerns in relation to the nanny, however in the father&#8217;s statement that was put before the court on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July he relied heavily on the nanny to be able to be the guardian not only on any trip but also to be trusted with Z&#8217;s passport.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Mr Setright proposes a further undertaking that Z will not spend a night away from the holiday address and there will be an Annex 2 certificate which will ensure that if there are any difficulties or concerns steps can be taken under either the Hague Convention or Bllr. Additionally, matters are to be in place in relation to security as provided for in the June 2017 order.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Mr Setright makes the additional points that the mother has her own property here in her own name, she does not own any property abroad, and her home has been in England for a number of years. There is, he submits, nothing to suggest that she will not be returning here, if anything, all the indications point in the opposite direction. A place for Z has been agreed between the parties at the school they both wish Z to attend, and it would be inconceivable, he submits, that the mother would wish to place herself at risk by not returning, not only the financial loss that would be almost immediate but also the damage in relation to her position in these proceedings. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Mr. Edwards submits that the objections by the father should be allowed to be developed further than they were in front of Judge Tolson.   He says it was necessary to look at what the substance of the objections are.  However, he accepts that this issue of the holiday in Europe is at the root of this appeal and that once that issue is determined it is very likely that the appeal will fall away. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I have reached my conclusion on the information that I have with Z&#8217;s welfare being the paramount consideration of this court. Looking at the context of the background to these proceedings where there have been regular trips abroad, where there is a comprehensive package of safeguards that are not only going to be in existence through the June 2017 order but also by the additional safeguards that have been offered on behalf of the mother by Mr. Setright there is minimal, if any, risk of Z not being returned back to this jurisdiction.  In any event, the jurisdiction where they are going to has effective procedures in place that would swiftly ensure Z was returned, although I consider that to be a very unlikely event.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The father&#8217;s other objections in relation to psychological and other matters seem to fall away when his position is, according to his position statement, that he would have no objection to a holiday in this jurisdiction, it is the significance of it being abroad which is his issue. In my judgment that distinction, in the circumstances of this case, makes no difference to Z&#8217;s welfare and does not provide a rational basis for objecting to the proposed trip.   </p>

I have balanced the competing considerations and taken into account the additional safeguards offered by Mr. Setright, that can be incorporated in an order discussed between the parties outside court. In my judgment the proposed trip meets Z&#8217;s welfare needs. </p>
