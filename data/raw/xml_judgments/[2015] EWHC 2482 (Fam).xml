	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have found beyond reasonable doubt that H has breached the order of Mr Justice Roderic Wood on 6 May 2015 to attend court and to file the statement specified and the order of Mr Justice Hayden on 4 June 2015 to provide specified information, and the undertaking given to Mr Justice Mostyn on 26 February 2015 to lodge with W&#8217;s solicitors share certificates in respect of not fewer than 5,000,000 of his shares in Mart Resources Inc, to stand as security for his obligations (to make capital payments to W) such shares to be held in escrow pending H&#8217;s  compliance in full (with payment of the lump sums).</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">H&#8217;s breach of the orders to attend and produce documents/information is not trivial.  A non-paying spouse in H&#8217;s position is able to frustrate the court&#8217;s process and enforcement unless such orders are complied with.  Attendance is particularly important.  If a party is present the court can compel evidence to be given, and can impose various sanctions in aid of enforcement, such as a temporary restrictions on leaving the jurisdiction until such information is provided.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Watson has advanced a number of points on behalf of H on which he seeks to mitigate H&#8217;s breaches, and in particular to avoid an immediate custodial penalty.  H&#8217;s assertions are wholly untested and untestable without oral evidence and intervention by the court to compel the production of further information and documents in consequence of what comes to light during the process.  This case further exemplifies the problems that can be caused by non-attendance, and by disclosure not being subject to the court&#8217;s control. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_4">
	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This was of course not the first occasion on which H had breached such an order.  The first enforcement application was issued after H had failed to deal with Stewarts&#8217; letters chasing explanation and payment leading to orders to file a statement and attendance.  H belatedly filed his affidavit dated 17 December 2014 following the hearing before Mostyn J on 10 December 2014 which he did not attend although his legal team did.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_5">
	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I know from Mostyn J&#8217;s judgment that H asserted that he had not attended because he was undergoing medical treatment in the United States of America.  From Mostyn J&#8217;s doubts expressed about whether that was indeed so, I conclude that no medical evidence was provided for the court on that occasion.  As before me H had made no attempt to provide documentation and evidence as ordered by Mostyn J.  If it is said that he had parted with Vardags as a result of simple inability to pay their fees, in itself a debatable assertion, since H had access to funds for that purpose, and it may be that he was simply unwilling to pay them.  Maybe there were other reasons lying behind their parting, I do not know.  As before Mostyn J, H was grossly in breach of the orders for payment, and had made no attempt to bring this matter back to court or to communicate with the wife or her advisers in any way in order to explain his alleged difficulties in respect of compliance with any of the orders made.  Like Mostyn J, I regard H&#8217;s contempt as blatant and defiant.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I note that Mostyn J regarded the 2014 breach as meriting a sentence of imprisonment of six months, but in the light of H&#8217;s belated attempts to comply, and in the circumstances at that time, considered that the balance between coercion and punishment at that time merited suspension of the order.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Now that the matter comes before me I am faced with not just identical contempts, but H&#8217;s breach of his undertaking.  The whole purpose of the undertaking was to provide security for W&#8217;s claims.  H&#8217;s actions have utterly frustrated that purpose.  It is quite plain that he lied in order to achieve realisation of the shares, and that this was a carefully coordinated and executed plan.  It is impossible for the court to tell whether there is any merit or truth at all in H&#8217;s argument that his financial difficulties led him to take this step, but I have very considerable doubts.  His affidavit and the information/documentation contained in it and its exhibits are presented in such a way that it is impossible for the court to form any educated view as to his financial affairs. I recorded in the main judgment that I had not been able to make any sense of H&#8217;s finances from the exhibits to his affidavit filed before me.  The exhibited material, mainly statements relating to a number of bank and credit card accounts worldwide operated by H but held in the name of various entities in various locations and jurisdictions (H&#8217;s address been c/o these entities) does not give any picture of anything other than the most limited aspects of his more minor expenditure on himself and others.  Some large unexplained credits, are, if they relate to the shares, unidentifiable; H asserts that these documents show that he has only small credit balances, if at all, on his disclosed accounts.  It is not possible to check the assertion that this is all H has, or that the share proceeds were paid into any of these accounts.  I note that H discloses an earned income of over $800,000 per annum.  He does not suggest that this has been utilised for the support of W and the children. </p>

	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">H&#8217;s failure to attend makes evaluation of his assertions impossible.  There is no evidence whatsoever to support his case that he intended to comply with the disclosure/information orders by 19 June 2015.  He made no attempt to inform W or her solicitors of the steps that he was taking to obtain replacement certificates and destroy the security.  H asserts now that he thought that he was not in breach of the undertaking in respect of the share certificates as he used the majority of the proceeds to pay of the outstanding mortgage on the former matrimonial home.  His failure to disclose to W&#8217;s legal advisers what he was doing is in that context inexplicable.  He had every opportunity to access legal advice from Vardags at the time. </p>

It is of course common knowledge that the oil industry has suffered over the last 12 months due to probably irresistible global forces, but no particularity has been given by H as to how this has affected his financial position.  H produces as a print out from a website, unattributed, and unauthenticated,  a  document entitled &#8220;share price&#8221; dated 30 June 2015, entitled &#8220;crude oil futures&#8221;, perhaps showing a fall of about 30%, but otherwise unexplained.

She is attempting to obtain compliance with a court order step by step, so far frustrated by H&#8217;s machinations. </p>

From my experience of H&#8217;s litigation stance however in the last two hearings I accept that this case has required out of the ordinary attention to detail so as to prepare for the unexpected and a contest on all fronts. </p>
