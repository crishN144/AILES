He was a sociable and fun-loving man who lived life to the full.  He did, however, on one occasion say, in relation to somebody who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, that he would not want to live in that state.</span></p>

He was working on a machine when his overalls got caught in the machine.  Unfortunately, although it is absolutely no criticism of the individual whatsoever, the person he was working with had briefly left to undertake some other operation.  His overalls twisted round his neck and choked him.  His oxygen was cut off for some 15 minutes and, when he was released from the machine, he went into cardiac arrest.  He had extremely serious spinal injuries including an atlanto-occiptal dislocation, which I am told is usually fatal.  This involved trauma to his high cervical spinal cord.  The cardio respiratory arrest led to severe hypoxic brain damage.  He was placed in an induced coma for some seven weeks but, when he came out of the coma, he was able to breathe for himself but in all other respects he was lacking any awareness or capacity.</span></p>

I am told she has not seen Christopher for some 19 to 20 years.  Their marriage broke down and a decree absolute has been pronounced.  She, therefore, is no longer his next of kin and in those circumstances, I take the clear view that it was not necessary to inform her of this application.</span></p>

She says there has been no improvement in Christopher's state for 23 years.  He does not respond to stimuli.  There is no behaviour to indicate any level of awareness.

A full assessment was undertaken by Professor Turner-Stokes between 5 June and 19 June 2017 which was later reviewed by Professor Wade.  One of the reasons for that was the fact that some of the carers raised possible indications that Christopher might be experiencing a degree of awareness.   It was said he occasionally jumped at loud noises; moved his eyes a little in the direction of sound; became tense in the shower; woke before urinating; became frightened when ill but more relaxed when comforted; and, possibly, that he screwed up his face when his face was touched.  </span></p>

It is a comprehensive report, which I accept without reservation.  It tells me that the diagnosis, in 1995, of Dr Tony Clarke was one of persistent vegetative state which was confirmed again, in 1999, by Dr Clarke and Dr Stuart Butler.  The Professor considered in detail all the matters raised by the carers. She undertook all the appropriate and necessary investigations.  She is quite clear that these behaviours do not reflect awareness.  She says they are all reflexive behaviours exhibited by many patients with PVS but she did acknowledge that the eyes moving required investigation and she did so.  Her conclusion was that there was no visual tracking.  There was no response to command, smiling, grimacing or the like.  It is right that Christopher&#8217;s eyes were open and he would blink spontaneously but all her tests were compatible with a vegetative state and she concludes her report as follows:</span></p>

	      <content>
		<p class="BodyTextIndent3" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic">'The response to sound occurs spontaneously and is just as often unrelated to sound.  We consider he is in a vegetative state.  There is no evidence of significant change or recovery in the last 18 years.  There is no prospect of improvement in his condition and continuing life-sustaining treatment is not in his best interests.  If his nutrition and hydration was not withdrawn he could live for a further 5 to7 years&#8217;.</span></p>

He is a consultant in neurological rehabilitation and his opinion is dated 25 June 2017.  He also considered all the points above that were mentioned by the carers.  He came to exactly the same conclusion as Professor Turner-Stokes, namely there was no evidence that Christopher was aware of his environment.  His report, in fact, reaches his conclusions to the criminal standard of proof, in other words he concludes beyond reasonable doubt that Christopher is completely unaware of himself and his environment.  He did not need to do so because I am hearing civil proceedings where the test is the balance of probabilities, but it gives me significant comfort that he was able to reach a conclusion that he was sure of his diagnosis.  He says that Christopher is in a vegetative state.  It was caused by the severe hypoxic brain damage.  It is very unlikely that Christopher is in some very low awareness state.  If he was, it would be probable that he would be experiencing some discomfort, if not pain and distress.  The Professor referred to an obvious startle response to a clap but it was not localised.  There was a spontaneous rotation of his head but his arms did not respond to pain and there was no consistent meaningful response to auditory stimuli.</span></p>

He also accepted or agreed that life expectancy would otherwise be seven years.  He came to the clear conclusion that Christopher gains no pleasure or satisfaction from his life.  If he has any awareness, the Professor feared it would be an unpleasant one and the Professor supports the decision to withdraw the gastrostomy feeding.</span></p>
