Neither the LAA nor the SSJ are entirely clear, the term &#8216;lay advocate&#8217; usually being used to describe a nonlegally qualified individual who may represent an otherwise unrepresented party &#8211; in some contexts called a &#8216;McKenzie Friend&#8217;. [The] SSJ understands that the proposal to be that an individual with experience dealing with persons with learning difficulties is made available to the mother and father both during Court proceedings to help explain what is going on, and at all meetings with the solicitor to help explain advice given and pass instructions. They would also meet with the mother and father to reinforce what they have been told by their solicitors and what they have heard at Court. </p>

It is highlighted that, as a matter of practice (and SSJ would submit, as a matter of law), it is the role of HMCTS to fund a translator for a party whilst they are at court. It is the role of the LAA to fund a translator out of court.&#8221; </p>
