The care proceedings arose out of allegations of sexual impropriety on the part of the grandfather.  As a result of the mother&#8217;s failure to co operate with the local authority in the area in which the mother now lives in the preparation of a court ordered report, (a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s37</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> report), Birmingham City Council told the court that this lack of co-operation coupled with the information received from the North West meant that they were considering taking child protection proceedings in relation to JN.</p>

It followed, the mother said, that the English proceedings should therefore come to an end; so far as SA is concerned it would be almost as if he had never had a daughter never having seen her in her lifetime.

Equally if it were true the JN were dead, how dreadful it would be for the mother not to be believed and to have to relive the events of that terrible time.</p>

During the course of the trial all the evidence gathered in the Congo was examined.  This documentary evidence related not only to JN&#8217;s alleged death, but also to the truth or otherwise of the paternal grandmother having died and her funeral having taken place on 3 March 2011, the day JN was said to have died.</p>

In his words: &#8220;I know Pera very well because she saw me on two occasions and I signed the documents to confirm that the documents she presented to me were false.  If you tell me there is a signed letter on December 2013, this involves only the person who signed it because I do not recognise it.&#8221;</span></p>

The calls were made from Miss Hodgkiss (counsel for the mother) telephone.  The parties&#8217; representatives were present.  It is agreed by all parties that at no time did the telephone make a connection with the number dialled.  It follows therefore (and is also accepted by all parties), that no connection having been made; Miss Hodgkiss&#8217;s telephone number did not become available to the person whose number she was calling.</p>

The call was returned, again with the assistance of an interpreter.  This time the call  was answered and a male at the other end said that he was Mr. Mupu.  Quite properly, no further questions were asked of him.  All this naturally begs the question as to how the person speaking knew to ring at all (no connection having been made earlier) let alone to know Miss Hodgkiss&#8217;s phone number.</p>

During that brief adjournment the mother, offered an explanation to her legal team as to how Mr. Mupu (if it were he on the telephone) came to have the telephone number of Miss Hodgkiss.  The mother told her legal team that during the course of the lunch adjournment she had unbeknownst to them gone into the city centre and telephoned her uncle in the Congo, to ask him to ring Mr. Mupu and ask him to ring Miss Hodgkiss.</p>

Both simply cannot be true and it should be remembered that each gave evidence within a couple of hours of the events described.</p>

I held before, and I remain of the view, that the grandfather controls the mother.  In my judgment I recorded that I had been told that the mother had married and was expecting a child.  I queried within my judgment whether the grandfather would now let her go, and allow her to build her own life.  The mother inadvertently in evidence today provided me with the answer.  When I asked the mother about her husband, she quickly said that she sometimes goes to Milton Keynes to see him and then later tried to say she only comes to Birmingham for &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">appointments,&#8221; </span>unspecified.  It is quite clear to me that she continues to live alone with the grandfather and not with her new husband.
