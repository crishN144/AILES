	    <p style="text-align:justify">This judgment (originally consisting of 70 paragraphs) was originally handed down on 25 June 2012 in open court but subject to a reporting restriction order. It was later augmented and was handed down in augmented form in private on 16 January 2013. It consists of 80 paragraphs and has been signed and dated by the judge. The Judge hereby gives leave for it to be reported in this anonymised form as <span style="font-style:italic">W v M (TOLATA Proceedings: Anonymity)</span>. The judgment is being distributed on the strict understanding that in any report no person other than the advocates or the solicitors instructing them may be identified by name or location.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 12 November 2010 the Claimant (&#8220;C&#8221;) commenced proceedings against the Defendant (&#8220;D&#8221;) by issue of a claim form under CPR Part 8. The claim is made pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/47/section/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s14</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/47" uk:canonical="1996 c. 47" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996</ref> and concerns two valuable properties in Surrey.  C claims that by virtue of their common intention, formed over the course of a long cohabitative relationship, she is a beneficial tenant in common of both properties. The case was originally fixed to last nine days in June 2012. At the PTR on 9 May 2012 it was agreed that this was an insufficient time estimate; the fixture was broken and the case was re-fixed to last 15 days in February 2013.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By agreement two of the original nine days have been used to hear an application by D dated 9 May 2012 for an order pursuant to CPR 39.2(4) that in the proceedings at the main hearing, and in my final judgment, all relevant people and places be anonymised. This application had been made just prior to the PTR and was before me on that occasion. I pointed out that pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/12/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s12(3)</ref>(a) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref> reasonable notice should be given to the press. Consideration was given to the terms of FPR 2010 PD12I, which deals with this aspect where applications are made for reporting restriction orders in family proceedings governed by those rules (which these are not, so the Practice Direction is only relevant by analogy). PD12I para 3.2 states that service of applications for reporting restriction orders on the national media can now be effected via the Press Association&#8217;s Copy Direct service. Para 3.3 states that legal advisers to the media are used to participating in hearings at very short notice where necessary. This suggests that not very much notice needs to be given. Here notice was given via Copy Direct at 8.45 a.m. on the very morning of this hearing. That led to an email being forwarded to me from the Press Association which stated:</p>

I have five children: two older children respectively are now adults and are the children of the claimant. They both carry my surname. Three aged between 9 and 1 respectively are the children of A. All my children with A bear my surname, and I am correctly named as their father on all school parents' lists, which are widely circulated by the school to parents. They each have a two name surname starting with A's surname with the last name being mine; it is not hyphenated either on their passports or elsewhere. They currently use just A's surname at school partly due to reasons associated with this case. I intend them to use my surname at all times and they have expressed a wish to do so and my son will do so.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>This case has inevitably had a very detrimental impact on my children and on their mother, A, and our relationship. A is extremely ill. Her health had in fact stabilised prior to the first letter I received from Charles Russell in late September 2009, but has increasingly deteriorated since that period. A notable collapse in her health took place within two or three weeks of our holiday last year and followed the service on my solicitors of an application while I was on holiday, with the hearing listed for a few days after my return. It ruined our holiday. There had been an attempt to list it on short notice while I, and my solicitor, were away. It was in my opinion an entirely inappropriate application and was supported by what I have stated to be a misleading witness statement. It put me under considerable pressure as have these proceedings.  A was very upset by it. The effect of the relapse was that A effectively ceased to be able to walk and had to be taken to hospital Her health is continuing to deteriorate and she is now once again at a point where walking at all has become extremely difficult. She cannot now cope with even simple matters without becoming overwrought. </p>

I also believe if there is any publicity over this case, or she is approached by anyone about it, or there are issues with our children arising from it, or its publication including them being teased at school, it will materially further impact on her health and result in our relationship breaking up. She will then seek to move away and go to live near her mother. A and my children have a right to be protected from a situation which is not of their making and a right to a family life. Any further serious deterioration in A's health could deprive them of their mother. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>A further matter that arises is that a very important witness to my case, B , has made it clear he is not prepared to give evidence if his evidence could result in his previous conviction, which is now spent, coming out. He was a professional person and ceased to practice in circumstances within my full knowledge.  Neither he nor his wife are, quite understandably, prepared to risk the life they have built since his conviction, to assist me in this case. In fact his mother was originally prepared to give evidence on my behalf and remembered the fact that she had lent me money, and that the claimant had also lent me money as a loan, to buy Blackacre. She also said in my presence that she remembered that the claimant had not wanted to be involved in buying either Blackacre or Whiteacre . However after she had recounted her memory of events, B said he was very concerned about his involvement in this case in the light of his earlier conviction and any publicity associated with the case. As soon as he said that B&#8217;s mother  changed her attitude, and she has consistently refused to make a witness statement, citing her wish not to do anything that would harm  C as a woman. I accordingly ask that his name is also anonymised in this case so that he cannot be identified and can give evidence freely.&#8221;</p>

They began an intimate relationship in 1984. They have two children - both of whom are now adults. According to C (but denied by D), although D promised to marry her, and C changed her surname to D&#8217;s in anticipation of that event, they never did. Blackacre in Surrey was bought in 1991 in D&#8217;s sole name. Whiteacre also in Surrey was bought in 1997, again in D&#8217;s sole name. C claims that their common intention was that they would be jointly owned. Among other things she claims that they ran an inseparable joint economy. According to C their relationship ended in 2009 when D told C that he was in a relationship with  A and had two daughters with her; according to D, their relationship ended years earlier.</p>

It moves Bentham over and over again. &#8220;In the darkness of secrecy, sinister interest and evil in every shape have full swing. Only in proportion as publicity has place can any of the checks applicable to judicial injustice operate. Where there is no publicity there is no justice.&#8221; &#8220;Publicity is the very soul of justice. It is the keenest spur to exertion and the surest of all guards against improbity. It keeps the judge himself while trying under trial.&#8221; &#8220;The security of securities is publicity.&#8221; But amongst historians the grave and enlightened verdict of Hallam, in which he ranks the publicity of judicial proceedings even higher than the rights of Parliament as a guarantee of public security, is not likely to be forgotten: &#8220;Civil liberty in this kingdom has two direct guarantees; the open administration of justice according to known laws truly interpreted, and fair constructions of evidence; and the right of Parliament, without let or interruption, to inquire into, and obtain redress of, public grievances. Of these, the first is by far the most indispensable; nor can the subjects of any State be reckoned to enjoy a real freedom, where this condition is not found both in its judicial institutions and in their constant exercise.&#8221;</p>

Nor are the reasons in the slightest degree difficult to find. The Judges speak and act on behalf of the community. They necessarily exercise great power in order to discharge heavy responsibilities. The fact that they do it under the eyes of their fellow citizens means that they must provide daily and public assurance that so far as they can manage it what they do is done efficiently if possible, with human understanding it may be hoped, but certainly by a fair and balanced application of the law to the facts as they really appear to be. Nor is it simply a matter of providing just answers for individual cases, important though that always will be. It is a matter as well of maintaining a system of justice which requires that the judiciary will be seen day by day attempting to grapple in the same even fashion with the whole generality of cases. To the extent that public confidence is then given in return so may the process may be regarded as fulfilling its purposes.&#8221;</p>

Take the example I have just given of the ordinary citizen whose attendance at NA [Narcotics Anonymous] is publicised in his local newspaper. The violation of the citizen's autonomy, dignity and self-esteem is plain and obvious. Do the civil and political values which underlie press freedom make it necessary to deny the citizen the right to protect such personal information? Not at all. While there is no contrary public interest recognised and protected by the law, the press is free to publish anything it likes. Subject to the law of defamation, it does not matter how trivial, spiteful or offensive the publication may be. But when press freedom comes into conflict with another interest protected by the law, the question is whether there is a sufficient public interest in that particular publication to justify curtailment of the conflicting right. In the example I have given, there is no public interest whatever in publishing to the world the fact that the citizen has a drug dependency. The freedom to make such a statement weighs little in the balance against the privacy of personal information. &#8221;</p>

They are bound to be harmed by immediate publicity, both because it would undermine the family as a whole and because the playground is a cruel place where the bullies feed on personal discomfort and embarrassment. &#8221;</p>

He was confining himself to articles 8 and 10 and not ranging more widely to take note of the other Convention rights of children. He expressed his opinion long before <span style="font-style:italic">Neulinger</span> called for a re-appraisal of the position. In any event, the emphasis he added makes it clear that he was concerned strictly with the balance between article 10 and article 8 "<span style="font-style:italic">as such</span>", i.e. where the only rights in balance were those conferred by articles 8 and 10. If, as he requires, an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case is necessary, then the additional rights of children are to be placed in the scale. The question then is whether the force of the article 10 considerations outweigh them given what I have said in paragraph 19&#8221;</p>

I also emphasise that I make no finding as to whether what the Defendant has done is reasonable in any other meaning of the word reasonable. It is not appropriate for the court to express opinions on matters which are not relevant to a legal issue. Matters of style, and to a large extent what is or is not relevant, are matters within a journalist or editor's field of independence, upon which the court should express no view. The Defendant is one of the most successful news publishers in the world. So there are many readers who are not offended by what it publishes. On the other hand, there are people who are very critical of what the Defendant publishes. A court cannot express a view in the way that anyone else can. All the court can do is to find whether or not it is necessary and proportionate to sanction or prohibit a particular publication on one of the grounds specified in Art 10(2).&#8221;</p>

Certainly some members of the public will have noticed the end of her employment: a proportion of them will even have speculated why she left. But the reasons for her leaving give rise to no debate of general interest. The reasons for her leaving may interest some members of the public but the matters are not of public interest.

Perhaps they will concentrate on the personal life of D which I have referred to, in which case it might be said that the publication is merely to satisfy public prurience. On the other hand, perhaps they will concentrate on the legal complexities that attend this case and the failure of the Government as urged both by the Law Commission and the Supreme Court to enact a fair discretionary system for disposal of these cases (as has happened in Scotland), in which case it could certainly be said that publication contributes to a debate of general interest concerning the social and political life of this country.

However, the key concern with introducing automatic rights of attendance for the media without ensuring an appropriate scheme for reporting restrictions is that violent, distressing and salacious details could be available to the media. Articles relating to domestic violence or forced marriages might be informative for the public, but could name the victims involved or provide identifying personal details. The possibility of such reporting could be to deter victims from coming forward to obtain the protection of the court.</p>

It is my view that, generally speaking, only if the court is prima facie satisfied that the case will result in proof of iniquity in some shape or form should that starting point be departed from. As the White Paper put it &#8220;families need to be confident that their privacy will be protected&#8221;. Or in the words of Stanley Burnton LJ &#8220;parties to a matrimonial dispute who bring before the Court the facts and documents relating to their financial affairs may in general be assured that the confidentiality of that information will be respected&#8221;. The powerful statements, referred to by me at para 17 above, warning of the danger of anonymisation leading to a curtailment of the right to freedom of expression in the reporting of public civil proceedings do not, in my opinion, militate in favour of a derogation from the core privacy that attaches to the special class of (officially private) case that is a claim for financial remedies following divorce. It would be a strange thing if the court&#8217;s undoubted power to anonymise its judgment were to be emasculated by an unfettered right to report fully the proceedings leading to the judgment.</p>

They argue that D regards him as an indispensable witness, and does not wish to have his chances of success at trial prejudiced by the absence, or merely enforced presence, of this witness. They suggest that his openness and candour may well be compromised if he is summoned to appear and has to give his evidence completely openly. By way of analogy they draw my attention to FPR 2010 PD 27B which gives as one instance where media representatives may be excluded from family proceedings the ground that justice will otherwise be impeded or prejudiced at any hearing at which a witness states for credible reasons that he or she will not give evidence in front of media representatives, or where there appears to the court to be a significant risk that a witness will not give full or frank evidence in their presence.</p>

The &#8220;evidence&#8221; amounts to mere assertion or hearsay, and unimpressive hearsay at that. Where they ask is a statement from A giving primary evidence of her health and distress? Where is independent medical evidence concerning her health? Why is there no statement from B confirming what D says he says in para 8 of his witness statement? They say that there has been no attempt to comply with the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/38" uk:canonical="1995 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Civil Evidence Act 1995</ref> or with CPR rules 33.2 &#8211; 33.4. They argue that there must be a duty of promptitude in relation to such an application and that what has happened here is that the application has been cobbled together very late in the day. Therefore their first submission is that the application here simply does not get to first base; the evidence is too thin and too defective even for the Articles to be become engaged. </p>

They do not seek to down-play the fact that these are potentially serious issues for these comparatively young children.  However, this must be seen against the backdrop of a situation where D&#8217;s daughters are not actually known by his surname at school.  They are actually known by A&#8217;s surname.  The only reason that D advances for withholding his surname so far as the children are concerned is that it will identify his daughters.   This, they submit, is over-stated; it is a long way from <span style="font-style:italic">K v L </span>where the children&#8217;s whole life style and upbringing would be undermined by the publicity, and where they might even have been exposed to the risk of kidnapping had anonymisation not been granted. In this regard they suggest it is significant to consider the decision of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S (A Child)</span>.  One might argue that the little boy there had far greater call for his article 8 rights to be upheld; but they were not.  </p>

The central issue was the fact of an adulterous relationship between the applicant and X which was over, which the children did not know about and which would be likely to cause them distress. There were absolutely no issues of public interest in the true sense of the word engaged in the case. By contrast, in this case, the children are well aware of the relationship between C and D and of the fact that they had two children, now both adults, over the span of a very long relationship; and it is a case the primary focus of which is property rights. The vast majority of these cases involve former partners and they are heard in public without any difficulty.</p>
