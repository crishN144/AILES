For a number of months after the mother&#8217;s death, T was cared for by a close friend of the mother, financially supported by K.  In March 2019 K made an application for a child arrangements order.

In the meantime, K was to file and serve counsel&#8217;s advice in the UK in relation to permanently adopting T.  On the making of the order the court expressed concern (which is set out on the face of the order) as to why the local authority had not made an application for care proceedings to protect T&#8217;s welfare.  An order was made requiring the local authority to file a statement as to why this had not happened.  </span></p>

Accordingly, the mere fact that a child is a ward of this Court or is subject to orders requiring his return to this jurisdiction if the court so orders when, for example, granting permission pursuant to Section 28 of the 2002 Act to remove a child from the jurisdiction, that cannot of itself prevent the child from acquiring  habitual residence in another country in which he stays with the leave of the Court.

Dr. Morgan referred me to paragraph 6 of the judgment where the wording of the orders of Sir Peter Singer were set out.  The recitals included undertakings by the maternal aunt to return the children to the jurisdiction when called upon to do so, that the children remained wards of court, and that they were habitually resident in the United Kingdom.  The orders in this case have not contained those recitals.  He submitted that despite the orders permitting K to retain T out of the jurisdiction being time limited on each occasion, and needing to be renewed, nobody has ever raised the possibility of the child coming back to this country. </span></p>

T has been in the US (apart from a very few days), continuously since November 2019, and she also spent some weeks there between June and August 2019.  Extensions to the permission to remain there have always been granted.  The intention is, and has always been, for T to stay in the US being cared for by K.  From T&#8217;s perspective &#8211; which is the perspective from which the court must view things, the USA is her home.   </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Ms Cabeza for T, supported by Ms Wood for K, argues that T&#8217;s situation means that she has not achieved habitual residence in the USA.  Whilst it is true that she has been with K throughout and has become very attached to her, that she has indeed made friends, attended school, had counselling, and is registered for health and dental care, her situation has been precarious.  Focussing on the child&#8217;s situation does not mean only looking at what the child is consciously aware of, but all the circumstances surrounding her presence in the US.  The orders in this case may not have precisely declared that T&#8217;s habitual residence remained in this jurisdiction, or contained specific undertakings that she should be returned to the UK &#8216;on demand&#8217; as in the case of </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Re S, Re T</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">,  but a reading of the orders and a consideration of the circumstances make it abundantly clear that T&#8217;s situation had not achieved either permanence or stability.  This court retained jurisdiction and did not give K open ended permission to keep T in the US.  Indeed Ms Cabeza pointed out that orders granting and extending permission for T to be in the US temporarily included a standard recital that removal from the jurisdiction without an order of the court could be a criminal offence.  At no point was an order extending permission ever, or ever intended to be, a &#8216;rubber stamp&#8217; exercise. Other individuals made applications for orders at various points, challenging the proposal that K care for T in the long term.  The local authority made a public law application in August 2020.  T has no permanent leave to remain in the US (the section 8 order here is not sufficient for the US immigration authorities) and indeed now she is an overstayer.    </span></p>

T left for the US on that day,  then returned to the UK again in January 2020 for a few days.  In the meantime, there were other applications before the court relating to T&#8217;s long term future.  Her maternal grandmother made an application in March 2019, and her stepfather  made one in May 2020.

It is wonderful to read how T&#8217;s attachment to K has developed, but not much more than eighteen months ago this was a relatively new relationship, following the loss of T&#8217;s primary carer.  The events of the last two years will have had an effect on T&#8217;s psychological stability, added to everything else. During the course of this hearing,  I noticed that T had come into the room where K was attending the hearing (it must have been about 7am US time).  T sat on K&#8217;s lap. K dealt with this with the greatest of skill and tact, but I could not help note a concern that a child of her age is quite capable of understanding that something is going on which relates to her future and her future care.  I myself was worried that being able to hear some things being said could make T anxious and insecure.  The hearing adjourned for a while and T went to school. Of course care is taken to avoid T being exposed to the litigation about her, but she must be aware of conversations going on, and meetings between her carer and other people. </span></p>

Other family members have made with a view to caring for T themselves. The last one of these was dismissed in July 2020, having been made in May 2020.  No party questioned the jurisdiction of the court  to make orders relating to T&#8217;s care and welfare, including (until very recently), the local authority. In the section 37 report compiled by the local authority in July 2020 the social worker stated &#8216;[T] is still habitually resident in the UK.
