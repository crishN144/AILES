	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">On 30 January 2014 Ms Justice Russell delivered a judgment after a contested hearing. She concluded that the children remained habitually resident in England and Wales as at the time wardship proceedings commenced and that the court therefore had jurisdiction to make the children wards of court and to make orders concerning them. As no final order has been made on the wardship application and as the children remain wards of court this court retains jurisdiction over them to this day. As I shall return to later the question of whether this Court or the courts of Nigeria have jurisdiction over the children is a legal fact which has played a significant role in how the case has evolved.   </p>

I have not been provided with all the information about the substantive matters and have not sought to delve into it too far given the possible risks of prejudicing the position of the Father by hearing about facts or matters which don&#8217;t truly relate to the committal issue before me. Inevitably there is some cross-over because one of the central issues within the Committal application is whether the Father has been honest about the current whereabouts of the children and his ability to make plans for and implement their return if that was what the court was to order.  However it is NOT a live issue within these Committal proceedings whether the Father is currently in breach of an order to actually return the children to this jurisdiction.   </p>

For reasons which I haven&#8217;t explored counsel for the Father had not received full instructions from the Father and I allowed Mr Flood until about noon on Day 1 to see the Father to ensure that he was fully instructed. Having had that opportunity Mr Flood was able to confirm that the Father sought to rely on the statement of 22 August 2017 and the other statements referred to therein and did not wish to file a further statement. At that stage Mr Flood indicated that the father would wish to give evidence.   </p>

I indicated to Mr Khan at the outset of the hearing that I considered the range and duplication of allegations contained within the Committal Application together with various procedural defects might present practical and forensic difficulties to the just determination of the application and that a more precise focus on those allegations which were not affected by technical procedural barriers and which properly reflected the nature of the wrong-doing alleged might be appropriate.  </p>

I consider that to be sensible and appropriate. Mr Flood, not surprisingly, had no objection to them not being pursued and that course of action has simplified the legal and evidential landscape to some degree.  As I do not consider it fair to leave them unadjudicated (or on the file) and thus technically capable of resurrection I propose to dismiss those Grounds which are not pursued.  </p>

The application C2 indicates that permission was sought to make the application [B2] elaborated in the mother&#8217;s statement in support of her committal application [C15, para 43]. It is evident from the FPR and the authorities that permission is anticipated to be sought as a preliminary issue and before any substantive application is issued. In the context of this case I can understand why it was not sought given the number of other matters for which permission was not required and the desirability of avoiding some sort of parallel process. In any event as I pointed out to Mr Khan at the outset the reality is that the application in respect of the alleged false statements of truth are inextricably linked to the subsequent Grounds 10, 12 and 13.

I got the impression that she was rather worn down and tended to moderate her expression &#8211; perhaps in an attempt to distance herself somehow from the content of what she was saying. However at times she seemed on the verge of tears but brought herself under control.  She came across as a fairly intelligent and moderate character. She became somewhat agitated when forced to concede that she had misled her GP and benefits agency over her mental health but in the main she maintained her composure and I thought she tried to answer questions asked of her. At times &#8211; as I will relate below &#8211; she was spontaneous and I thought was clearly reliving real events.  </p>

To mislead a doctor and then subsequently a benefits agency is a serious matter but it does not mean the mother lies about all matters.  The matters which the Father refers to at C-C1118a-19 up to paragraph 30 largely relate to historic matters which were &#8216;live&#8217; in the hearings in January 2014 and March 2015. Notwithstanding those matters the judges at both hearings considered the mother to be a credible witness and none of the father&#8217;s criticisms of the mother seem to have found any traction with Russell J or Roderick Newton J. I am not in a position at this hearing to try to explore that evidence &#8211; and nor did Mr Flood seek to cross-examine the mother on those aspects.  The relative weakness of the Father&#8217;s criticism of the credibility of the mother is illustrated by his asserting that her claim that he unlawfully retained the children in Nigeria is wrong. Given that Russell J found that he had retained them and the remainder of these proceedings has been on the basis that the Father did retain the children in Nigeria without the Mother&#8217;s consent the Father&#8217;s recent statements including that of 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"/>June 2017 show not only the weakness of his argument that the mother is not a credible witness but also his on-going denial of previous court judgments.  </p>

Her account from the witness box was broadly consistent with that given in her statements and with that given by other witnesses. Any differences in fine detail are unsurprising given the passage of time and the way people recall things. It is well recognised in the courts and supported by research that a number of different individuals will recall matters differently. Her demeanour in the witness box was at times angry or upset, she certainly feels strongly and has issues she wishes to emphasise but overall she attempted to answer the questions. </p>

In the witness box and in his documents he expresses himself forcefully both in the delivery of the evidence and in the language he uses to express himself.  He asserted he never tells lies and is a man of principle. Although mostly he was self-assured at times when he seemed to be under pressure he seemed to resort to bluster to avoid answering </p>

Until relatively recently it is clear that he has always maintained that the English court should not have exercised jurisdiction, that it was wrong legally to do so, was disrespectful to the Nigerian courts and orders and to the family culture.  He is convinced that he has been done a wrong AND that he is in the right.  </p>

Later he suggested he had not understood the effect of wardship until the currency of this latest set of proceedings and in reexamination Mr Flood asked him to clarify when he came to understand the effect of wardship.  I am satisfied that by May 2015 he understood the effect of wardship.  Mr Khan spent some time on the issue basing his examination on the Father&#8217;s own statements in particular that [B-C149] and F&#8217;s evidence was sufficiently clear to me that I suggested to Mr Khan that May 2015 was probably a sensible baseline and that prior to that date there was certainly room for doubt as to Father&#8217;s understanding. The emphasis of the Father&#8217;s case on this issue as at other times was that the English court had no business making orders in respect of the children; they were Nigerian children in Nigeria and the Nigerian court had jurisdiction over them. The Father believed they had been wards erroneously because they could he understood, only be made wards if they had been maltreated in England; which they had not. As his statement of April 2015 made clear he considered the actions of the English court to be wholly wrong (the January 2014 judgment he described as an &#8220;<span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">OPEN RAPE OF JUSTICE&#8221;</span> and the March judgment as a &#8220;<span style="font-weight:bold">complete FARCE&#8221;) </span>and under-pinned by white supremacy.

I conclude that during the period January 2014 through to 2017 he has exercised his parental responsibility to undertake significant steps in the children&#8217;s lives without the permission of the court &#8211; and without reference to the Mother. He accepted in evidence that he had changed the children&#8217;s schools and had changed where they lived.

The father left the jurisdiction on or about 6 February 2014 and it is not clear that the order was personally served on him. However I consider in the particular circumstances that it is just to dispense with personal service pursuant to FPR 37.8 given that the Father was present in court and had notice of its terms thereby. In addition to that it is clear that Father has had a copy of the order because he himself makes reference to it in his own documents and he was committed for contempt of court in relation to other provisions of that </p>

Furthermore he was found guilty of contempt in March 2015 for breaches of similar if not identically worded undertakings given in December 2013. I therefore do not consider there to be any doubt that the father was aware of the injunctions and their meaning and effect by the time the earliest of the breaches now pursued occurred in March 2015.  </p>

It seems that even within the Mother&#8217;s family (see what Chief Sam had to say) there is a degree of anger or embarrassment at the situation. Although I generally have concluded that the mother is a credible witness her response to the questions about the existence of Mekus Iwuala was such that I was left wondering whether she was being wholly honest about this cousin.

It commences &#8216;Please inform Ijeoma that..&#8217; It goes on to contains a warning to the Mother not to speak to or make contact with the children without the Father&#8217;s consent. Breach of the warning is said to provoke the anger of a variety of groups including vigilante groups.  The document says &#8216;This is very serious. Ijeoma must not ignore this warning for her own safety and for the [family members] supporting her.&#8217;  The language is explicitly threatening violence and is intimidating, harassing and pestering. The mother said she feared for her safety if she were to return to Nigeria and she feared for the safety of her family members referred to. Her use of expressions such as &#8220;I was not happy&#8217; cannot be interpreted as meaning she was only unhappy, angry or frustrated.

The father had arrived back in the UK on 6 March with the intention as I find of seeking to persuade the mother to withdraw the proceedings. It would be natural for him to attempt to make contact at the home address. The Mother&#8217;s account of his attendance given from the witness box was clear and convincing; it was told spontaneously and with a degree of emotion which I thought was consistent with her reliving events.  Her account is supported by a contemporaneous attendance note taken by her solicitors at [B-C356] which records the Mother telling them on 8 March 2017 that &#8216;Bernard is here on my doorstep banging on my door&#8217;.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In respect of Ground 4(g) the father accepts that he visited the church on the dates alleged. He also accepts that he approached the mother. There is a slight divergence in their accounts of precisely what he said when he went down on his knees before the Mother. There is a much wider divergence in respect of what else he said and how he behaved during that visit and subsequently. I heard evidence from Pastor Samuels who had previously given a statement. Mr Flood is right to point out that there is some divergence between his statement and his oral evidence as to what occurred before he took the Father into his office. In his written statement he said he saw the Father &#8216;abusing&#8217; the mother but in oral evidence he said he could not hear what was being said; the overall impression he got was of what might best be described as a &#8216;scene&#8217; developing  and that he sought to resolve it by inviting the Father into his office. Overall I found Pastor Samuel to be a credible witness who spoke with spontaneity and was willing to acknowledge a lapse of memory. He did not seek to fill in blanks but told what he could remember. In respect of the attendance at church on Sunday 12 March I conclude that F attended to seek to persuade Mother to abandon her action. The Father&#8217;s evidence about why he returned to England was completely contradictory. At one point he said he returned to serve his sentence at another he said he returned to seek to implement an agreement they had reached in November 2016 for the children to remain in Nigeria and to persuade Mother to end the proceedings. He said he attended the church that day because it was his church. Quite why he would do that when Pastor Samuels is (on the Father&#8217;s account) a Muslim and had been involved in a plot to assassinate him was not clear. The Father attended at the church to initiate his plan to exert pressure on Mother; his opening was to seek forgiveness or peace by effectively prostrating himself in front of the mother before her Church community. I have no doubt that was intended to harass or pester her in a way that would further the father&#8217;s goals. I do not believe the Mother was present on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March and I am not satisfied that anything said or done on that occasion amounts to a breach of the order.  In respect of the visit on the 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March it is right that this was a meeting initiated by Pastor Samuel. In it I am satisfied that the Father said he would meet any condition the mother imposed if she would drop the proceedings. However when she named her condition of the return of the children I am satisfied on the evidence of Pastor Samuel and the mother that the father said initially he could not afford it and when the church and the mother offered to pay that he said over his dead body. The father has used similar language [B-C151] in communications and his impulsive statements are consistent with earlier statements such as that to Pastor Samuels that the children were at a boarding school contactable on a number which turned out to be completely false when Pastor Samuels rang it.  I am satisfied that the mother found this obstructive behavior and fruitless meeting upsetting and frustrating and that it amounted to the father pestering and harassing her. </p>

I think it is relevant that even at that stage the Father was asserting that Chief Sam Osuji had custody of the children and that at that stage Chief Sam Osuji was explicitly denying that he did.  The father had also said that he had left the children in the care of a driver and a nephew and at other times in the care of Prof Madu and that he did not know their current situation as he was in the UK and could not contact the carers.  Russell J not only considered that the Father was an unreliable witness but made findings of fact as to the circumstances in which the children came to be in Nigeria and concluded that they had been retained there without the Mother&#8217;s consent and against her will by unilateral action of the father.  She rejected the father&#8217;s contention that he did not know where the children were and concluded that the father had ongoing control over them and knew their whereabouts.  That was a clear demonstration of the Father exercising unilateral control over the children to the exclusion of the only other person at that time with parental responsibility. It is significant that at a time when the Father was in the UK he was asserting that he had no control over the children and had little or no knowledge of their whereabouts or situation and that his evidence was found to be untrue. His current assertions in the various documents filed in June and July 2017 in purported compliance with the order of 7 June 2017 are a mirror of his asserted position before Russell J. </p>

Ms Ibirim was clear the person she gave the box to was Caro or Chitru as she knew her by.  I thought her evidence was reliable and it was of course largely corroborated by the Father&#8217;s own version of these events save for the bizarre suggestion that someone impersonated Caro and had her SIM card. I am unable to understand why arrangements would have been made by Caro to receive items for the children when she was not caring for them and why someone would have been sent to impersonate her. The father&#8217;s account is simply incredible and I accept Ms Ibirim&#8217;s evidence.  </p>

One way or another he was contemplating being absent potentially for some time and yet he did not feel it necessary to take any steps to make formal arrangements (by way of a court order or other formal document delegating PR to Grace and Chief Sam).   I feel sure he would have taken steps in advance to address the care of the boys in his absence if there was any doubt in his mind about whether he retained control or not&#8211; particularly given what happened in 2013/14 when he says he was out of touch and control.  The only logical explanation in the circumstances of this case for him not making arrangements is that he did not consider it necessary to do so because he was sure he would retain long-distance control and that those in Nigeria would do his bidding.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I think it is significant that in 2013/14 the Father whilst stating he had no control over the children and whilst vehemently disputing the jurisdiction of the English court and asserting that of the Nigerian court, agreed with the mother and gave undertakings to the court in support of a voluntary return of the children to England. This included asserting that he had booked tickets for them when in fact he had not. Russell J concluded that this was a device to buy himself time. After the hearing on 30 January 2014 the father left the jurisdiction in breach of an order and was subsequently found to be in contempt of court and in breach of various orders and undertakings.  The fathers position in this latest round of litigation show a similar pattern. In March in discussions with Pastor Samuel and the Mother he asserted that the children would return over his dead body &#8211; and the fact that they had not returned between 2014 and 2017 is ample evidence that he did not wish them to return &#8211; being in absolute control of them as he was.  </p>

The father now maintains that he is willing for the children to return but matters are out of his control.  The similarity between 2017 and 2013/14 is I consider significant.  I have no doubt that the Father was in control of the children before he left Nigeria and that he left without making any arrangements knowing that he would remain in control and people would do his bidding according as he says to Nigerian court orders and custom that gives custody to Fathers.   </p>

He also invites me to be cautious about the note of the conversation between the solicitor and Sam and Grace given the difficulty in hearing the recording of the later conversations. Whilst I accept that caution in dealing with summaries of conversations is wise there is a considerable difference between listening to a recording of a conversation which takes place on speaker phone and participating in a conversation with another English speaker. Furthermore the significant aspect of the solicitor/Chief Sam conversation is consistent with what Chief Sam was </p>

The transcript is helpful but adds little of substance to what can be gleaned from the audio tapes.  What is clear is that both Chief Sam and Grace are not very forthcoming &#8211; indeed they appear to be unwilling to speak openly. Chief Sam Osuji is not co-operative because of the problems that the case has caused for him by airing family dirty linen in public in particular with a conflict between the Nigerian and English courts. However neither says the children are living with them or say anything that would come close to suggesting they are. However neither denies that the children are living with them. The most obvious conclusion that can be reached from the tapes is Sam and Grace is that they would prefer not to be drawn into the proceedings, would like the mother to deal with matters with them directly and without the involvement of lawyers.  However I consider that the tapes do support the Mother&#8217;s case because: </p>

[C-C1134 -1137]  I do not know whether they are the children&#8217;s or not. They are addressed variously to &#8216;Mummy&#8217; or the Presiding Judge. They are dated around 3 June.

Again I am not sure whether they are written by the children or not. They are similar in content to the June letters.  They are variously addressed to the Judge, to daddy, and the President. They say their mother is wicked and evil, that she is a liar. Chidera says he is living with auntie Grace.  The contents of the letters from boys still only aged 15, 12 and 10 is alarming if it is indeed them writing it.  </p>

Indeed he gave the ludicrous explanation that Chidera had discovered the case on the internet and had instituted the letter writing. Given it is clear he has been in contact with those caring for the children whilst in prison &#8211; notwithstanding his earlier assertion that was not, and that he has been in touch with the children directly I think it more likely than not that the letters were written at his instigation by or on behalf of the boys and with their contents dictated or influenced by the Father or those caring for them.  The fact that these letters have been sent to the court on two separate occasions in an attempt to support the father&#8217;s case adds further to the weight of evidence that the father remains in control of the boys.  The fact that he has had contact whilst he is in prison but he has not ensured they have contact with the mother who is under no such restriction is significant.  </p>

He could put forward school reports, photos of the children at home and at school, details of any medical treatment they have had. If Chief Sam and Grace had acquired parental responsibility no doubt it would be in a court order the father could produce. It is clear that he himself has a custody order from the Nigerian court and Chief Sam is apparently a lawyer of some description.   </p>
