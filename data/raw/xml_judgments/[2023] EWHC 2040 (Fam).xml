X&#8217;s father and the paternal family are unaware of X&#8217;s birth. Prior to and at the time of X&#8217;s birth, X&#8217;s mother made clear to the local authority that she was not going to be able to care for X, she relinquished him at birth so he was placed immediately with foster carers, where he remains.</p>

A child and family assessment was undertaken and reported in December 2022 that no further action was required as the parents were living separately and the mother was able to protect the children. A safety plan was agreed to enable the father to see the children when they were with the paternal grandmother.

There remains an ongoing police investigation arising from these allegations. The father was on police bail until late June 2023 which gave the mother a level of protection, although the mother alleges the father breached the bail conditions on five or six occasions which included calls to the mother, turning up at her property and waiting outside it. Each of these events the mother reported to the police.</p>

She informed the local authority she wished to relinquish care of the baby at birth as she was not in a position to care for the child, she feared the consequences of the father finding out, he would not be able to care for X and she did not consider any wider family members would be able to care for X. A social worker was allocated who saw the mother on two occasions prior to X&#8217;s birth and had other contact with the mother during this time, when her decision was discussed as to what the options were regarding placement of X with the wider maternal and paternal family. The mother was clear there were no realistic options in the wider family.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The psychological risks to the mother and the children she cares for that would result from disclosure of X&#8217;s birth to the father and extended family is an important consideration. The history as described by the mother, supported by the information the court has from the local authority and the police, enables the court to conclude that the father, in particular, is likely to act in an emotionally and physically abusive way to those he is emotionally involved with, primarily the mother. These risks are more than short term difficulties, they are likely to be long term due to the evidence about the father&#8217;s behaviour, his particular circumstances and the fact that his behaviour has not changed over many years. The police disclosure provides examples of the father&#8217;s inability to manage his behaviour going back over many years, for example in 2009 when he became upset in his mother&#8217;s home over what he considered to be actions taken by his girlfriend at the time with the result that his mother had to call the police. That pattern of behaviour has not changed and is magnified when the father has been drinking.</p>

He submits that the objective safeguarding information does not undermine the account given by the mother, it corroborates what she states about the father and the wider family. In her analysis of all the information the Children&#8217;s Guardian concludes that neither the father nor the wider family can realistically provide a future family placement for X and there would be appreciable risks to the mother and X&#8217;s siblings if notification was provided. to them. </p>

All these factors lead the Children&#8217;s Guardian to support the application.</p>

So, he is exercising his Article 8 rights in relation to those children and, on the information available to the court, is likely to continue to do so. This is in the context of the mother and father having been in a relationship for about three years.  He has parental responsibility for those children, although does not exercise that in any meaningful way other than see the children on an irregular basis supervised by his mother.</p>

This has to be considered in the context of the other evidence regarding the likelihood of X being placed with the father or wider family. The local authority are actively considering the option of X being placed with one of his two half siblings who have been adopted, which is unlikely to take place if the father or wider family are notified of X&#8217;s birth. More generally, X&#8217;s right to family life includes there being limited further delay before long term decisions can be made about his future care. From the mother&#8217;s perspective her Article 8 rights include being able to keep herself and the children she cares for safe and in a stable environment. Bearing in mind the history of her relationship with the father and the wider evidence about his behaviour, that is likely to be put at significant risk if he is notified of X&#8217;s birth.</p>

From the long history, there is no evidence that is likely to change bearing in mind the chronic nature of his behaviour, his mental health difficulties and the risks he poses to others. In terms of the wider family the evidence demonstrates that they too are very unlikely to be in a position to care for X, with the added complication of the risk of the father finding out if other members of the wider family are contacted. The wider family have not previously put themselves forward to care for the older children on both the maternal and paternal side who have now been adopted.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The evidence regarding the mother is important for a number of reasons. First, there is no evidence to suggest that she has been other than entirely child focussed in her decision regarding X&#8217;s future care. It is right that the local authority gave the mother sufficient time to consider her position. From the accounts given by the local authority and the Children&#8217;s Guardian, which I accept, she reached her decision in a way that was supported by clear rationale. Second, the third party evidence that has been made available by the local authority and the police has corroborated what the mother has said about the father&#8217;s behaviour, the position of the wider family and the impact on her and X if notification took place. It would involve her and her children being put at an unacceptable risk of harm, with no obvious benefit for X as neither the father nor the wider family are likely to be able to care for him in the future and the risks of  notification are likely to lead to increased risks for both the mother and X. It would further delay any meaningful decisions being made about X&#8217;s future care with no corresponding benefit of a real prospect of a change for X. Any delay also risks the option of X being placed with one of his half siblings who are currently in adoptive placements. The court also needs to consider the mother&#8217;s position, which there is no basis upon not to be able to rely upon, that she will co-operate with any life story work that is undertaken for and with X.</p>

There is a real risk, in my judgment, that if he is notified either directly or indirectly his behaviour is likely to increase the risk of harm to the mother and the children she cares for based on the evidence from the mother, corroborated by the evidence from the police and the local authority regarding the father&#8217;s behaviour towards the mother during their relationship, his previous partners and his own mother. It is also an important feature of this case that due to the history it is unlikely that any measures put in place will mitigate the level of risk of harm to the mother and the children who live with her resulting from the father&#8217;s behaviour.</p>
