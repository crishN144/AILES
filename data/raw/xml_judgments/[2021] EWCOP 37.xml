	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">AI was born on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> March 1973. He has a history of Schizophrenia and had been under the care of the community mental health team for some time. He lives in supported accommodation. He was diagnosed with end stage kidney disease (&#8220;ESKD&#8221;) on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2019. He has required long term haemodialysis to remain well but has only intermittently accepted treatment. It is his fixed delusional belief, in consequence of his Schizophrenia, that there is nothing wrong with his kidneys and that he does not need dialysis. AI has also expressed delusional beliefs that the hospital is stealing his blood and that he is accruing a large bill for his treatment that he is unable to pay. This causes him great agitation. AI&#8217;s mental capacity has been formally assessed, on a number of occasions, and he has been found to lack the capacity to make a decision to accept or refuse dialysis. It is axiomatic that these intrusive delusional beliefs prevent AI from weighing and evaluating the advantages of treatment. No party at this hearing has sought to dispute the fact that the presumption of capacity has been rebutted. </p>

He had last accepted dialysis on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2020. He spent some time on the ICU before being transferred to the Renal ward at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. He thereafter received haemodialysis (HD) twice per week, verbally refusing each time but when the nurse arrived at his bedside, he would passively let them connect him to the machine using his dialysis line. No sedation or restraint was required. During his admission AI was, inevitably, subject to a standard authorisation granted under the Deprivation of Liberty Scheme (DoLS). Throughout the admission AI consistently stated that if he were to be sent home he would not voluntarily return for dialysis. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> July he was reviewed by Dr Drubha Bagchi and it was his view that depression was impairing AI&#8217;s capacity. The plan was made to start citalopram and escalate the dose over the next few days. On 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd </span>of September AI was again reviewed by the liaison psychiatry team (Dr Siddiqui, staff grade in psychiatry), it was his view that AI remained delusional and continued to lack mental capacity to refuse dialysis. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The stage was therefore reached when AI was physically well enough to be discharged but continued to state that he would not attend his outpatient dialysis appointments. It was the clinical view that it was in his best interests to be discharged back to his care home and thereafter not be compelled to attend for treatment but instead to be treated &#8216;reactively&#8217; (see below). The family, who have given evidence before me today, took the view that AI should be compelled to attend and to receive dialysis. This would have involved physical and/or chemical and was not, in the view of the treating clinicians, reconcilable with AI&#8217;s welfare interests. I agree. </p>

He was admitted to the ward and commenced emergency dialysis at 4am on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May. He had a chest x-ray which showed progressive fluid in the lungs and around the lungs. On the 19th May he was seen by Dr Jenny Pinney, Consultant Nephrologist, on her morning consultancy round. Dr Pinney had been involved in AI&#8217;s care since his diagnosis in September 2019. She told me in evidence that she was struck by the extent to which he had physically deteriorated since she last saw him in 2020. There was significant weight loss and AI now appeared very frail. He was requiring oxygen and was very short of breath. His blood test results revealed anaemia but there were no signs of infection. He agreed to have a further dialysis session during the ward round. He commenced dialysis at 3pm. At 17:18hrs while on the dialysis machine he pulled his tunnelled line out. 3 litres of fluid had been removed during that session. There was no overt bleeding at the time. AI remained in a parlous condition. The short time on the dialysis machine fell a long way short of what he required.  </p>

Despite reinsertion of a temporary dialysis line and a successful 4h dialysis session yesterday during which fluid was removed, today&#8217;s dialysis has proved considerably more problematic. There has been prolonged bleeding from the groin were the dialysis line was inserted. During today&#8217;s HD session, he received blood and platelets in attempt to manage the blood loss, but he remained moderately hypotensive and dialysis had to be discontinued. Post dialysis despite application of compression dressings to the groin, bleeding continued, and we were obliged to remove the dialysis line to achieve haemostasis (which appears to have been successful). AI is, however, still in pulmonary oedema meaning that there is an excess of fluid in his lungs which is causing significant breathless and leaving him dependent upon supplemental oxygen via a face mask (which he has kept on). He is markedly enfeebled and still appears agitated and distressed.  </span></p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.65in;text-indent:-0.01in"><span style="font-style:italic">What will happen from here on is uncertain. Low blood pressure during and after dialysis is a comparatively common occurrence in some patients and often recovers as fluid redistributes between vascular and extravascular compartments in the body (ie blood volume expands as fluid moves from tissues into the blood stream and blood pressure then improves). Notably however, AI has not exhibited intradialytic hypotension before and in fact he was taking BP lowering medications until today due to high BP. The abrupt onset of low blood pressure and consequent infeasibility of removing fluid during dialysis may signify a significant deterioration in his condition. In simple terms, it may indicate onset of heart failure which would portend a significant and irrevocable deterioration in his overall condition. There is no immediate evidence of another reversible pathology such as infection, but we are treating him with antibiotics as a precaution. Although he may stabilise over the next 24-48h, there is also a significant risk of death.  </span></p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.65in;text-indent:-0.01in"><span style="font-style:italic">At best, if his BP stabilises then we may be in a position to insert another temporary dialysis line into the groin and repeat dialysis sessions in the hope of getting him to the point where he is well enough for a new tunnelled line to be inserted. Unless another tunnelled line is place, AI would not be able to leave hospital but the likelihood of being able to achieve this is significantly uncertain. It is not exceptional for us to subject patients to potentially painful and distressing medical procedures in the context of what can prove to be very limited longevity but ordinarily, we are doing this with their explicit consent and in the context of the physician providing guidance on what is proportionate and reasonable for that individual. Where in the physician&#8217;s judgement the risks of harm and futility are disproportionately high, we would counsel the patient and their next of kin accordingly against pursuing treatment and direct them towards appropriate palliation.  </span></p>

The tipping point in these situation is often difficult to define and whilst we have put in place a ceiling of care and a DNACPR decision which will provide safeguards to ensure AI is managed appropriately if he deteriorates in specific ways, based on his condition this evening, I am still significantly concerned that we are in danger of pursuing inappropriate efforts to re-establish dialysis without any realistic likelihood of durable benefit after the point when treatment should be fully focused on palliation.&#8221;  </span></p>

On the contrary, they remain integral to his autonomy, which this court is charged to protect (see:<span style="font-weight:bold"> SS v London Borough of Richmond Upon Thames &amp; Anor <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2021/31" uk:canonical="[2021] EWCOP 31" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] EWCOP 31</ref></span>).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Behaviour, when assessed carefully, may sometimes communicate feelings more effectively and accurately than words. Indeed, it may sometimes contradict what is said. AI has gradually reduced even his superficial cooperation with dialysis when in the community. Initially limiting it to twice, on two separate occasions, and finally to noncompliance (which was always his stated position whilst in hospital). On his most recent admission he withdrew the tunnel line, as I have recorded above. This was an unprecedented action. I was also told by Dr Pinney that it would have been painful. I note too that this has occurred at a time when AI has deteriorated very significantly. It is difficult not to draw the most obvious inference that he has become tired by the effort of the dialysis, which has been made much more difficult by the pattern of noncompliance, followed by urgent medical treatment. Whilst his belief system may be delusional, his exhaustion is real. The signal is, to my mind, that he has had enough. Interestingly, when describing AI&#8217;s personality, his brother in law (R) told me that he had always been fastidious about clean and smart clothes but latterly had, he implied, become neglectful of and disinterested in, his appearance.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Dr Pinney told me that the view of her Department, including that of Dr Peter Hewins, was that if no further dialysis was administered AI would likely last a maximum of 2 to 3 weeks, though potentially a shorter period. The process of dialysing him might in and of itself precipitate collapse and death. This risk would be further increased if sedation were required, given AI&#8217;s already repressed respiratory system. Respiration is also compromised as a result of the kidney failure itself. Thus, this is assessed as a real risk. Additionally, the indicators of the onset of heart failure may <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;portend a significant and irrevocable deterioration&#8221; </span>which generate the possibility of heart failure during the course of dialysis. If AI collapsed and died in these circumstances, he would do so in a room in which several other patients were receiving dialysis. I was told that he struggles to achieve a comfortable position whilst receiving dialysis, due to his breathing difficulties and that dialysis itself can be uncomfortable and extremely tiring. Were he to &#8220;crash&#8221; as Dr Pinney put it, it would be extremely distressing, not least to the other patients. AI would not have the comfort of his family around him. Relatives are not permitted in the dialysis suite. From what I have learnt of AI, entirely from his family, he would wish them near him, if possible, at the end and he most certainly would not want to cause distress to others.</p>

The Court of Protection has emphasised this approach in what is now a substantive body of case law. Over the course of the pandemic I have been told by several senior doctors that they have had conversations with patients over these last difficult months which have been far more extensive and candid than had formally been the case. More than one has said to me <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;these are the kind of conversations we should have been having all along.&#8221; </span>This sharper focus on  understanding the personality and character of the individual patient assists decision making in the hospital every bit as much as in the court room. If I may say so, with diffidence, it strikes me that good forensic medicine and clinical medicine are one and the same. For the avoidance of doubt, I do not intend any of the above to be read as a criticism of the doctors in this case. On the contrary, they have been diligent, thoughtful and kind. </p>

That is not to say that his wishes must prevail, any more than those of a fully capable patient must prevail. We cannot always have what we want. Nor will it always be possible to ascertain what an incapable patient's wishes are. Even if it is possible to determine what his views were in the past, they might well have changed in the light of the stresses and strains of his current predicament. In this case, the highest it could be put was, as counsel had agreed, that "It was likely that Mr James would want treatment up to the point where it became hopeless". But insofar as it is possible to ascertain the patient's wishes and feelings, his beliefs and values or the things which were important to him, it is those which should be taken into account because they are a component in making the choice which is right for him as an individual human being."</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The family has been asked by Ms Simcock, instructed by the Official Solicitor on AI&#8217;s behalf, about their choice in the various options contemplated. Given that they have been opposed to the plan, it is understandable that they have not been able to engage with the various options to date. When I met with AI, on the video conferencing platform, with his counsel, AI nodded vigorously at the suggestion he might go home with his brother K. The care plan notes that such arrangement is a considerable <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;emotional and physical undertaking&#8221; </span>but it would be supported by the hospital if that was the course they wished to take. I am confident that I can now leave the detailed formulation of the arrangements to the Trust and the family.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I consider that AI is tired and consistently indicating that he does not want further dialysis. I am satisfied that reinstating dialysis at this stage creates significant risk, given the identified deterioration. I note the evidence that sedation increases risk when attempting to restore dialysis. Finally, the recent abrupt onset of low blood pressure and the consequent infeasibility of removing fluid during dialysis indicate the futility of and disproportionate risk involved in restoring dialysis. AI requires peace, rest, the presence of his family and the prescribed palliative medication referred to in the care plan. This, in my judgement, conveys dignity to him at the end of his life. No other plan could achieve this. Accordingly, I endorse the care plan and grant the declaration in the terms sought.</p>
