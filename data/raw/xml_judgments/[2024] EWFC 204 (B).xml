She said yes, she copes with work, and tried to do it the best she could. She said in many ways her work was rewarding, she had learned new things, but in other ways there were limitations, she was not able to do all the things that she had done as a hospital pharmacist in Country Y. While of course she could laugh with her colleagues at times, that did not mean she was happy. She said she was in survival mode.</p>

If they return to Country Y, she will ensure that their relationship with their father is promoted. She was resolute in this, and to this extent came across as strong and determined, as described by father&#8217;s counsel. However, she is in a state of limbo. The life she has lived at least since separation has been one where she has made plans in response to the situation she has found herself in. She is not at this point in control of her own future, but must wait for the court&#8217;s decision. </p>

She is no doubt that it is in the children&#8217;s best interests to return with her to Country Y, to the life they had before January 2023. It is obvious why she herself would choose not to remain living in a country that she has not chosen to live in, where she has experienced the breakdown of her marriage, and where, as a newly separated parent, she would be away from all the networks of family and friends that she would have in Country Y. I considered it ungenerous and unfair for it to be suggested to her that in bringing her application she was seeking to punish the father, that she wished to be &#8216;compensated&#8217;, or that she was knowingly putting her own desire to return home before her children&#8217;s best interests. </p>

However, the reverse situation of them returning shortly to a house in Country Y where they have lived all their lives until January 2023 offers immediate certainty and stability. It is a place where they would have guaranteed support from all four maternal and paternal grandparents, as well as other members of the extended network of family and friends.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">The father&#8217;s proposal places significant constraints on the mother. He says if life in England is too difficult for her, she could go back to Country Y without the children. This does not represent any kind of choice for her; she is clear that she would never leave her children. The father suggests that it is the mother who has reneged on a promise to settle in England, and they agreed this was in the best interests of the children. This is not a reasonable position. Firstly, he accepted in evidence that he agreed that if things did not work out in England, they would return to Country Y as a family. The mother did not promise to stay in England come what may. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">Secondly, the context has changed. The plan to settle permanently in England was predicated on the marriage sustaining, but it has broken down. The father does not regard himself as bound by any promise to return to Country Y, because they are no longer together. Yet he asks the mother to stay in England on her own while he establishes a new life with a new partner.</span></p>

They will lose the opportunity to become bilingual with comparative ease. However, there is no dispute that the children were settled and thriving at their schools in Country Y, and that there are good schools in the public and private sector that they can return to. Both their parents are highly intelligent and speak excellent English. Their father intends to remain in England, so they will be able to build on the English language skills they have acquired in the eighteen months since they have lived in this jurisdiction.</span></p>

I have not received any evidence to support that, and no issue has been taken with the quality of the [Country Y] schools proposed by the mother. I do not accept that the family&#8217;s original plan for the children to be educated in England is one that should be pursued at all costs.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">The most significant negative for the children of a relocation is of course the change in the relationship with their father that will be brought about. After many years in which they were primarily cared for by their mother and their father was abroad, visiting five or six times a year (save for the six months from October 2020 when the father lived in Country Y), they then had nine months of living in the same household as their father. Following separation, they see him four days out of every two weeks.</span></p>

They will spend quality time with him during school holidays and at additional times when he can visit Country Y. On any view it will be different from the current situation. He will not be able to take the children to school, or take them to activities at the weekend. He will not be the &#8216;every day&#8217; parent that he has been, nor the &#8216;equal&#8217; parent that he hopes to be, having the children with him every other week. He will of course continue to share equal parental responsibility for the children with their mother, regardless of the amount of time the children spend with each parent.</span></p>

Nonetheless, they have a loving and strong bond to their father, which existed before they came to England and despite the fact that the father lived in a different country. That loving and strong bond was nurtured and supported by his regular visits, by the phone and video calls, and through his continuing interest and pride in them, and from the loving care and attention he gave to them when he saw them. </span></p>

By the very nature of the relationship and the parents&#8217; joint commitment to supporting it, the loss of their father as an &#8216;everyday parent&#8217; can be minimised. </span></p>

He says that the years when he lived on his own in cramped doctors&#8217; quarters building his career in order to earn money in order to support his family were difficult and lonely. </span></p>

Firstly, because on any view there is an element of choice in his decision to remain in England. As well as nurturing his relationship with his children, he wishes to pursue a fulfilling career and to maintain his new relationship. Secondly, because the mother also made sacrifices; while he was in England, she was alone in Country Y, caring for two young children. </span></p>

The father of course will see this as a loss for him, but it must also be recognised that caring full-time for school age children whilst holding down a job brings its own demands. It is right that the children get the chance to have some &#8216;down-time&#8217; and holidays with their mother as well as their father.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">My starting point would also be an equal split of the summer holidays, which in Country Y is twelve weeks long. This is because I doubt the father would in fact be able to take six weeks off from the NHS during the summer holidays, and if he could take that amount of holiday, it may be preferable for him to use some of that time to spend time with the children during term times so that he sees them more regularly throughout the year. However, I have not had detailed information about the father&#8217;s work schedule or intentions around this. I have seen a letter from his work indicating that he would be afforded flexibility in his work to accommodate childcare needs. If the parties agreed in all the circumstances that there should be a shift in the father&#8217;s favour, I wouldn&#8217;t have a difficulty with that, although I would agree more with the mother&#8217;s suggestion of seven weeks out of twelve rather than any more, for the reasons given. </span></p>

I have full confidence in these parents to continue to be the very best parents they can be to their children. I wish them all the best for the future. </span></p>
