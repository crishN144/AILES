On 10 July 2012, the appellant changed her name for the first time by deed poll, adopting a female name. She commenced gender affirming care that same year by way of hormone replacement therapy and testosterone blockers. The appellant has taken these medications since, except for a brief period around 2017 when she ceased taking testosterone blockers to retain capacity for sexual activities. The appellant has not undergone, and does not wish to undergo, gender reassignment surgery. The law does not require her to do so in order to obtain a gender recognition certificate.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On that same date, the appellant, rather oddly, received an email stating that her application for a gender recognition certificate had been &#8216;granted&#8217; and that clarification was only required as to the name to be used on the certificate. It is clear that the certificate had not been granted on 16 June 2022 because the letter from the administrative team on 16 June 2022 made clear that the application had not yet been submitted to the Panel for consideration. Therefore, the first part of this email must have been an administrative error. As to the second part of the email, the confusion as to the appellant&#8217;s correct name arose out of an earlier call from the appellant to the administrative team during which she had informed them that she had obtained a third Deed Poll after submitting her application for the certificate, this time changing her surname to that of her current partner. The appellant had apparently telephoned to enquire about the name that she should use, as her most recent change of name did not reflect that used in her application. The administrative team asked whether the appellant had married since submitting her application as <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/7" uk:canonical="2004 c. 7" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">GRA 2004</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/7/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 3</ref> adds an additional requirement if a person applying for a certificate is married: </p>

Ms Giovannetti KC, on behalf of the appellant, informed the court that the appellant&#8217;s name on the gender recognition certificate application is not the appellant&#8217;s current legal name but that she was about to change her name back to her family name by deed poll. This step has now been taken and, if granted, the Gender Recognition Certificate will be issued in the family name used in her application.</p>

The appellant had submitted her UK Passport, issued in 2016, which stated her sex as &#8216;F&#8217; for female. She had provided the two Deed Polls of 2012 and 2015, by which the appellant had adopted female names, together with a Dutch Residence Card dated 2021 (in both Dutch and English) showing her sex as &#8216;F&#8217; and two Dutch Covid Vaccination Cards displaying her female names.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At paragraph 7 of the decision letter, the Panel states: &#8216;Even if [Dr Longworth&#8217;s] reports are accepted as confirmation of gender dysphoria for the purposes of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/7" uk:canonical="2004 c. 7" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Gender Recognition Act 2004</ref>, they are far from providing a firm <span style="font-weight:bold">diagnosis</span>&#8217; [emphasis added]. That statement is at odds with the clear conclusions of both Dr Longworth and Dr Lorimer, who were both clear that the appellant was suffering from gender dysphoria and that was their diagnosis. It is not the role of the medical witness to go further and to &#8216;diagnose&#8217; whether or not an individual is &#8216;living in the other gender&#8217;, that is a matter of fact for the Panel on the basis of the totality of the evidence. Whilst what is said in a medical report may detract from a finding that a person is living in one gender or another, that is not a matter for medical diagnosis as the Panel&#8217;s statement appears to suggest. </p>

In terms of evidence of whether the appellant had been living in the female gender, that assessment was clearly supportive of her application, rather than one that failed to bolster it.</p>
