In the days beforehand, the parties had been told at an advocates&#8217; meeting that the aunt intended to reengage with the proceedings, she having failed to file the statement which was by then long overdue.  In light of what the local authority considered serial and entrenched non-engagement by the aunt, Mr Harrison QC invited me, effectively summarily, to proceed to make a final SGO at that hearing.  I declined to do so.  The case fell short, it seemed to me, of one in which, it would be appropriate to do so &#8211; there was a real issue to be tried.  It would be, I considered, an unfair exercise of case management powers to prevent a genuine contender for Y&#8217;s care from putting her case and challenging that put forward by others.  Instead, I extended the time for the father and the aunt to file their final evidence, setting out in a little detail the matters to be addressed in the aunt&#8217;s statement.  The aunt was to file her statement by 19</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">th</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> April 2022, by which date I also directed that she issue any such application as she intended to make (for example, for permission to apply for a child arrangements order).</span></p>

No application had been issued by her or on her behalf in relation to her contention for the long-term care of Y.  Again the local authority invited me to make final orders.  Again I declined to do so.  I reduced the time estimate of the final hearing from ten to six days, the first day to be set aside for judicial reading.

I stood the matter down for urgent enquiries, suggesting that the father might be able to contact his sister.  He duly informed his lawyers that she had told him that she had not been able to take the day off work, and that she would not be able to do so all week.  The father facilitated contact between the aunt and her lawyers, who were eventually told by her that she had been asked by her employers to attend work, so had been obliged to do so.  She would be unable to give evidence or to attend at any point during the week during normal sitting hours.  Her legal team were not able to give me a reason for the aunt not having notified them or the court when she learned that she would not be able to attend court, even for the single day.</span></p>

The foster carers, strongly supported by the local authority and the children&#8217;s guardian, contend that she should remain with them, the underpinning regime to be transposed from one of local authority control to one of special guardianship.  The Official Solicitor, on the mother&#8217;s behalf, also supports this contention.  Conversely, the aunt, with the support of her brother, Y&#8217;s father, seeks Y&#8217;s placement with her in Hungary.  Although there is no application from the aunt in relation to how, legally, this would be achieved, it would not be particularly difficult to effect the move, if it were appropriate, nor to craft the appropriate legal regime to allow for this, not least as the aunt is already the beneficiary of a final guardianship order in relation to Y in Hungary.</span></p>

Their preference would be that her current surname (which she takes from her father, not her mother) would be the first half of a double-barrelled surname, theirs to be the second half, so, [forename] [father&#8217;s surname]-[foster carers&#8217; surname].  They are not wedded, however, to this particular configuration.  This proposal is supported by the children&#8217;s guardian, but is &#8216;vehemently&#8217; opposed by the father, and fairly strongly opposed by the aunt and the local authority.  The mother, although lacking capacity and so represented by the Official Solicitor, is noted to be broadly supportive of the proposed change.</span></p>

It should be noted that currently &#8211; and this might well change in the future &#8211; what is anticipated is either indirect contact, or direct, but remote (i.e. video-call) contact, rather than in person, direct contact.  In the future, it may well be appropriate for Y to see any or all of the father, the mother and the aunt in direct, face-to-face contact, whether in this country, Hungary, or even somewhere else.</span></p>

The worker experienced significant difficulty in making contact with the Central Authority and the Guardianship Authority, found that consent had not been given for her (despite what the aunt had told her) to speak to the aunt&#8217;s son&#8217;s kindergarten and was unable, despite efforts, to make contact with the paternal grandmother.  She did speak to the paternal grandfather, although the net result was that she was more, rather than less, worried about the quality of care which would await Y in Hungary.</span></p>

Further she offers a valuable link to Y&#8217;s birth family, and to her Hungarian heritage. There are multiple difficulties however with respect to her assessment to care for [Y] specifically, and most pertinently not being able to understand the significance of [Y]&#8217;s overall welfare needs. Furthermore, there is doubt about her protective capacity and her motivation to care. Despite attempts, [the aunt] continues to have a limited relationship with [Y] and therefore a recommendation of [the aunt] to care for [Y] would mean transitioning [Y] from an established foster placement with secure attachments to a relative stranger in an entirely new and unfamiliar country.&#8217;</span></p>

One of the first questions asked by friends and relatives following the birth of a child is &#8216;what is the baby&#8217;s name?&#8217;  It may be thought that any individual who has had the happy experience of debating with his or her partner possible forenames for their unborn child would be astonished at the proposition that the choice of the name of their child could be regarded as other than their right as the child&#8217;s parents, and their first act of parental responsibility.  The name given to a child ordinarily evolves over the months of the pregnancy through a bundle of cultural, familial and taste influences.  The forename finally chosen forms a critical part of his or her evolving identity.  The sharing of a forename with a parent or grandparent or bearing a forename which readily identifies a child as belonging to his or her particular religious or cultural background, can be a source of great pride to a child and give him or her an important sense of &#8216;belonging&#8217; which will be invaluable throughout his or her life. </span></p>

Miss Boyd&#8217;s answer on F&#8217;s behalf is that if adoption is not appropriate and if maintenance of some link with the parents is to be achieved, then the natural corollary is to preserve the parents&#8217; name. This is not the case where that dispute needs to be resolved. Ultimately the welfare of the child concerned is the litmus test and here the welfare of the child so overwhelmingly justifies the judge&#8217;s decision that no presumption or starting point one way or the other makes any material difference.&#8217;</span></p>

The child has a right to those names and retains that right, as indeed, the parents have rights to retention of the name of the child which they chose. Those rights should not be set to one side, other than for good reasons ... Having said that, one has to recognise, in reality, that names do change. Children acquire nicknames and even nicknames sometimes take over from the name that they were given as their chosen name. Children do have diminutives and they may themselves, as they get older, prefer their third name to their first name and choose to be called by it.&#8217;</span></p>

This is a legitimate tactical move under our adversarial system of litigation. But a defendant who adopts it cannot complain if the court draws from the facts which have been disclosed all reasonable inferences as to what are the facts which the defendant has chosen to withhold. A court may take judicial notice that railway lines are regularly patrolled by linesmen and Bangers. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is entitled to infer that one or more of them in the course of several weeks noticed what was plain for all to see. Anyone of common sense would realise the danger that the state of the fence so close to the live rail created for little children coming to the meadow to play. As the appellants elected to call none of the persons who patrolled the line there is nothing to rebut the inference that they did not lack the common sense to realise the danger. A court is accordingly entitled to infer from the inaction of the appellants that one or more of their employees decided to allow the risk to continue of some child crossing the boundary and being injured or killed by the live rail rather than to incur the trivial trouble and expense of repairing the gap in the fence.&#8221;</span></p>

There is a public interest in the proper maintenance of the wife by her former husband, especially (but not only) where the interests of the children are engaged. Partly for that reason, the proceedings although in form adversarial have a substantial inquisitorial element. The family finances will commonly have been the responsibility of the husband, so that although technically a claimant, the wife is in reality dependent on the disclosure and evidence of the husband to ascertain the extent of her proper claim. The concept of the burden of proof, which has always been one of the main factors inhibiting the drawing of adverse inferences from the absence of evidence or disclosure, cannot be applied in the same way to proceedings of this kind as it is in ordinary civil litigation. These considerations are not a licence to engage in pure speculation. But judges exercising family jurisdiction are entitled to draw on their experience and to take notice of the inherent probabilities when deciding what an uncommunicative husband is likely to be concealing. I refer to the husband because the husband is usually the economically dominant party, but of course the same applies to the economically dominant spouse whoever it is.&#8217;</span></p>

Without intending to disparage the sensible statements made in that case, I think there is a risk of making overly legal and technical what really is or ought to be just a matter of ordinary rationality. So far as possible, tribunals should be free to draw, or to decline to draw, inferences from the facts of the case before them using their common sense without the need to consult law books when doing so. Whether any positive significance should be attached to the fact that a person has not given evidence depends entirely on the context and particular circumstances. Relevant considerations will naturally include such matters as whether the witness was available to give evidence, what relevant evidence it is reasonable to expect that the witness would have been able to give, what other relevant evidence there was bearing on the point(s) on which the witness could potentially have given relevant evidence,</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:Garamond"/><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">and the significance of those points in the context of the case as a whole.

At one end of the spectrum, there will no doubt be cases where the court is satisfied that a person has deliberately refused to come to court to support their written statement and where there is no excuse or explanation. In that scenario, the court might take a bright line approach and refuse to place any weight on any of their evidence and draw inferences against them that any allegations are true. In other cases, the court will need to consider the circumstances of their failure to give evidence, any explanations offered or which present themselves and the evidence itself and the issues it goes to. Where there is compelling evidence explaining an inability to attend full weight might be given and no inferences drawn. In between will be cases where the court might determine it is appropriate to rely on and give weight (even full weight) to some evidence but not to other evidence and to draw some but not necessarily all possible inferences.&#8217;</span></p>

She may have recognised, at least at a cerebral level, that taking a new, young, non-Hungarian-speaking child into the newly single-parent home would have represented a formidable challenge; yet she was not emotionally able to withdraw her status as a contender for Y&#8217;s care, given that this would be, for her and for the family, to lose Y into a foreign country&#8217;s care system, and so yet more loss.</span></p>

She would scarcely be exposed as standing out at school in this day and age by virtue of having a different surname to the people who drop her off and with whom she lives.  If she were ever to ask why she has a different name to the family she lives with, the answer can simply be given, and the very act of doing so will helpfully reinforce her understanding of her heritage and life story.  Her birth family, it is said, is so resolutely opposed to the proposed change that it would create an issue which could become a &#8216;running sore&#8217;.  It might be inconvenient to her to be known by a different name to that on her birth certificate, amendment of that not being a possibility.  Finally, if ever the time were to come when name change were indicated, it could take place then.</span></p>

Her carers are surrounded by family members most of whom also bear their name.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">It is important, in my view, to look carefully at the nature of Y&#8217;s placement.  It is to be underpinned by an SGO which, it has rightly been pointed out to me, is a very different beast to an adoption order.  The principal relevant difference is that under the SGO, while the foster carers will gain status, the birth parents will not lose status: Y remains, in law, their child.  However, notwithstanding the type of order, it is a fact that Y was placed with the foster carers when a tiny baby and will remain with them, now as special guardians, for her entire childhood.  They will be the only </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Garamond">acting</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> parents she will ever know as a child.  Conversely, Y has never been, and will never be, looked after by either of her birth parents.  It is hoped that she will see her parents in contact, but even that is some way off and by no means a certainty.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">I am struck by the fact that Y will have to make sense of her place in the foster carers&#8217; family.  The process of explaining why she does not live with her birth parents may, perhaps oddly, be rather easier than explaining how she fits into her now permanent family.  Her special guardians each have one or more of their own children by birth; they share three adopted children, now adults; and they have grandchildren, far closer in age to Y than are her adult &#8216;siblings&#8217; (by virtue of the SGO).  Given the fact that she is now the only child for whom her special guardians are responsible, she will occupy an absolutely central place in their household, regardless of whether other adult children live there or visit with grandchildren.  Moreover, while an SGO does not have the legal finality of an adoption order, as a matter of fact, this SGO is intended to be permanent and final, and it represents a placement with two people which began when Y was a week old and will continue until she is an adult. It seems to me, in these most unusual circumstances, that there would be a real benefit to Y in linking her, by name, with her carers and their family.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">It further seems to me that the argument against the change based on Y&#8217;s heritage militates rather more strongly in the other direction.  Undoubtedly Y&#8217;s birth heritage is Hungarian; and Y&#8217;s birth parents chose her Hungarian name.  However, Y&#8217;s lived reality has always been and will now always be that she resides in England, with English carers, speaking English, attending an English school.  She is not a visitor, nor a temporary charge in her special guardians&#8217; care and she must be secure in that knowledge.  In those circumstances, the proposed name change would represent a tangible link to the other, the lived, aspect of her identity.</span></p>

There is no doubt but that the special guardians will honour their side of the agreement, such that I see no reason for them to be bound by the terms of an order.  This is especially so, given that it is not difficult to envisage circumstances in which the terms of any order ceased to be appropriate, potentially obliging the special guardians to return to court to seek its variation.</span></p>

The history leads me to believe that if contact is taken up as agreed, if it is proactively and positively managed by all parties, and if, in consequence, it is a genuinely positive experience for Y, then the special guardians will readily agree to an increase in its frequency, if this is indicated.  Conversely, sadly, history suggests that any greater frequency than that proposed is unlikely to be honoured with any regularity by the aunt, leading to disappointment for Y and frustration for her carers.</span></p>
