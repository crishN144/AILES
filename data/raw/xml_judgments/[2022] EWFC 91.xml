We waited and then decided to start the hearing at 2pm. Just as we were about to start, N phoned and she explained that she had been unable to attend as she had lost her purse.

The Council, the Guardian and I were worried about delay and delay is not good for the girls so I decided it would have to be the next day. Instead of an intermediary, N would have her advocate, her barrister and her solicitor/paralegal and I said that we would make sure that she was able to understand by going slowly. I would make sure that the hearing was fair. I did this by letting N have breaks whenever she wanted and allowing as much time as she needed. Miss Jones and Miss Cropper came to court with her and they were able to speak to her and take notes during the hearing.</span></p>

The harm they might suffer could be physical or emotional harm. The plan for X and Y to be adopted is the only one that can meet their needs now and in the future, and I agree that it is in their best interests.</span></p>

I would like both parents to write or send cards to them every year so that they can get these letters or cards when they grow up. I would like the social workers to help N with this because she will need some support as she isn&#8217;t very good with words or at reading and writing. I will make sure that they do help N by making them put this in the care plan and in the court order.</span></p>

It is very sad that I haven&#8217;t been able to agree to that. She is their mum and if there was any way she could care for them safely she should be allowed to do so. My job is to put X and Y first at all times. Sadly the problems that I have read about were so serious that I decided these orders had to be made &#8211; the law says I should not make such a serious decision unless there is no other option. I don&#8217;t think there is another option that is good enough for X and Y.</span></p>
