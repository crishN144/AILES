	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">This judgment concerns the latest stage in a long running saga concerning Reverend Charles Gibbs and Mrs Jean Gibbs. I will refer to them throughout as H and W although their roles in the history and the litigation change over time and they have been divorced for many years.  I have before me four applications: an application by H to commit W for breach of a non-molestation order; a further application to commit for breach of an order made on 5 October 2017; an application by H for an order for sale of W&#8217;s house; and an application by W to discharge the orders made against her. There is a preliminary issue as to the anonymisation of this judgment which I will deal with at the start of this judgment. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_2">
	  <num>2.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I will produce a short summary of this judgment that can be used by H to explain why I have reached the very clear conclusion that the W&#8217;s allegations against him are without foundation and that she has been pursuing a cruel and destructive campaign against him.   </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_3">
	  <num>3.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The underlying facts concern W&#8217;s absolute conviction that H has sexually abused their son, J, who is now aged 33. When the matter first came before me, I determined that I could not fairly determine the applications, and in particular W&#8217;s argument that she had a reasonable excuse for breaching the orders and her application to discharge those orders, without my considering something of the background facts. However, those facts go back to 2000 and involve enormous quantities of documentation from that period. In those circumstances I sought to take a proportionate approach and had before me the earlier judgments and some, but by no means all, of the primary material. Where appropriate I will refer to that below.  </p>

Section 3 allows for a judge to give a direction, but the wording of section 3 would appear to only apply to criminal proceedings and not to give a power in civil proceedings to dispense with the requirement for anonymisation in section 1. J is a complainant who falls within the terms of section 1 and, as such, in principle the prohibition in section 1 applies.  </p>

In order for me to explain my reasons for rejecting W&#8217;s case, but also to achieve justice for H in clearing his name, I cannot avoid referring to names and facts which will make it relatively easy to identify the alleged victim. </p>

The prohibition in section 1 can only take effect therefore to the degree it has any operative effect. Otherwise the statutory provision becomes a nonsense where the judgment has to be wholly anonymised even though the facts are already fully in the public domain.  Therefore, I will anonymise this judgment to the extent of calling the parties&#8217; children J and B but I will not make any further anonymisation. B has not made any allegations and therefore does not herself fall within section 1 but to restrict the identification of J it seems proportionate to anonymise B. </p>

W argued that H had had a terrible temper and had exercised coercive control over her. She said that children were terrified of him.

I simply cannot recognise and reconcile the demeanour of Mr Gibbs and what I saw, with what he is alleged to have done. On conflicts of evidence I prefer Mr Gibbs, I am satisfied he is doing his best to tell the truth, although he says he is not perfect, if I have a Minister saying not perfect I do not know if that is the normal standard or something deeper. He refers to frailties and not having acted perfectly but who could say they have. I have to decide on the balance of probabilities, whose favour, in the scales, which way do they tip, in Mrs Gibbs&#8217; favour, to acknowledge there has been emotional abuse or in his favour. They tip in his favour, I do not find the allegations of emotional abuse made out. It may be that both have been guilty of emotional abuse of children, this happens in any marriage that breaks down.

I have read the report of the Child&#8217;s Guardian, Ms Miller, where she explains J&#8217;s presentation at that time. It is apparent from that report that J was adamant that he did not wish to see his father but that J was very unwilling to explain more. However, there are reports of J telling Leverton Hall that his father had held him underwater and broken his arm. H denied, and continues to deny, ever hitting J or holding him underwater. Importantly, Ms Miller interviewed B who was 9 at the time, and she said she did want to visit her father as long as her mother accompanied her. She said she got on alright with her father and gave no suggestion to Ms Miller that her father had ever abused her in any way. </p>

Dr Bruce&#8217;s position is important because W contends that Dr Bruce had always believed her that H had sexually abused J. However, that is not at all the position set out in Ms Miller&#8217;s report. Dr Bruce is reported as referring to J&#8217;s anxiety and emotionally disturbed behaviour and that this may relate to the proceedings. There is absolutely no suggestion that Dr Bruce thought H had sexually abused J and that was the cause of J&#8217;s behavioural issues.  This is an example of W asserting that someone believed her, or said something, which on closer examination simply proves not to be the case.  </p>

On 10 April 2002 the matter came before Munby J (as he then was) listed for a 10 day hearing. On the first day W conceded that contact should resume and that her allegations were unfounded. The parties agreed contact at court and Munby J clearly felt that a major step forward had been achieved. Sadly, that progress was very short lived. On 7 November 2002 there was a hearing before Johnson J after contact had broken down. He described the process of that breakdown and heard evidence from the Court appointed children and family reporter, Mrs Langham-Fitt. It is important to note at this stage that B had been having regular contact with her father. Johnson J said: </p>

What they tell me is that your best course of action is to go back to the High Court and ask them to revoke the non-molestation order that was granted by a deputy high court judge on 9th November 2017. There is now clear evidence that you have been telling the truth all along. I saw the evidence and that was why the CPS offered no evidence against you and why I ordered a not guilty verdict. The High Court would need to see the summary of the interview your son did with the police and the High Court has the power to order the CPS to disclose that to them. There is no way the High Court would have made a non-molestation order against you if they had seen the latest Norfolk Police evidence. </span></p>

However, I took the view that for W to be able to advance her reasonable excuse defence, as well as advance her own application, and for me to be able to properly adjudicate on the issues, I had to understand to a proportionate degree what lay behind HHJ Holt&#8217;s concerns and what J had said in his police interview. It was plain that there was more additional material, to put the matter neutrally, than had been before the judges in 2000-04 and Hayden J and the Court of Appeal in 2017, and it would be wrong to proceed with an application to commit W without making proportionate efforts to see the further information.

As far as W is concerned she is carrying out a duty to expose H&#8217;s abuse and to vindicate J, and she sees it as her duty to stop such abuse happening in the future and expose the failings of the family justice system.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The other pieces of evidence relied upon by W are as follows. Firstly, a letter from the Director of Children&#8217;s Services at Norfolk County Council to Rev Atkins, General Secretary of the Methodist Church in 2014 where they raise W&#8217;s complaints and say that they are very alarmed about the situation and concerned if H has contact with children. It does appear that Norfolk County Council were concerned about what they had read on the files, but neither J nor H were interviewed and it is not clear what Norfolk County Council knew about the earlier Family Court proceedings. Much more recently Norfolk County Council have confirmed that there are no current safeguarding issues around H. It seems likely, though I cannot be absolutely certain, that the concerns raised in the Norfolk County Council letter of 2014 were linked to the investigation undertaken by Cornwall County Council, which I have referred to above, and by which ultimately the LADO accepted that there was no continuing safeguarding issue. This material is therefore all simply based on the complaints that W herself was making, and both Norfolk County Council and Cornwall County Council, after having carried out whatever investigations they considered appropriate, took no further action. This material merely shows that W has created an echo chamber by which she makes allegations and these are then repeated by various agencies without there being any evidence of the underlying truth of the allegations.  </p>

This refers to J having made allegations about H having broken his arm and held him underwater. I have referred to these allegations above but there is nothing even vaguely comparable to J&#8217;s allegations in 2018 or the abuse that W sets out in her numerous emails. In my view, the fact that these earlier allegations were made makes the 2018 allegations less likely to be true. J was willing to make serious allegations against his father but he gave no hint of the type of abuse which he now says occurred. Further, these are allegations that were present at the time of the earlier family court proceedings in which none of the judges accepted whatever allegations J and W were making at the time.  </p>

It is clear from this entry that the focus was on emotional and physical abuse. Although child abuse has become increasingly frequently referred to in recent years, in 2002 social workers were very conscious of the possibility of and occurrence of sexual abuse. At this time J was subject under the oversight of numerous professionals and they would have had close regard to any concerns being raised.  </p>

Contempt will not be established where the breach is of an order which is ambiguous, or which does not require or forbid the performance of a particular act within a specified timeframe. The person or persons affected must know with complete precision what it is that they are required to do or abstain from doing. It is not possible to imply terms into an injunction. The first task for the judge hearing an application for committal for alleged breach of a mandatory (positive) order is to identify, by reference to the express language of the order, precisely what it is that the order required the defendant to do. That is a question of construction and, thus, a question of law. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The central issue on the committal is as to whether the W had a reasonable excuse to breach the order. In a prosecution for contempt, reasonable excuse would be a defence to the charge. In a civil contempt it appears that if the order is knowingly breached then a contempt has been committed and reasonable excuse goes to the sanction rather than the breach. The burden of showing reasonable excuse is on W but only to the standard of balance of probabilities.  </p>

Family cases, it has long been recognised, raise different considerations from those elsewhere in the civil law. The two most obvious are the heightened emotional tensions that arise between family members and often the need for those family members to continue to be in contact with one another because they have children together or the like. Those two factors make the task of the court, in dealing with these issues, quite different from the task when dealing with commercial disputes or other types of case in which sometimes, in fact rarely, sanctions have to be imposed for contempt of court. </span></p>

That is the only procedure which is available. Not surprisingly, therefore, the court is directing its mind to whether or not committal to prison is the appropriate order. But it does not follow from that that imprisonment is to be regarded as the automatic consequence of the breach of an order. Clearly it is not. There is, however, no principle that imprisonment is not to be imposed at the first occasion: see Thorpe v Thorpe <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1998] 2 FLR 127" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">[1998] 2 FLR 127</ref>, a decision of this court. Nevertheless, it is a common practice, and usually appropriate in view of the sensitivity of the circumstances of these cases, to take some other course on the first occasion. </span></p>

The full range of sentencing options is not available for contempt of court. Nevertheless, there is a range of things that the court can consider. It may do nothing, make no order. It may adjourn, and in a case where the alleged contemnor has not attended court, that may be an appropriate course to take, although I would not say so in every case. It depends on the reasons that may be thought to lie behind the non&#8722;attendance. There is a power to fine. There is a power of requisition of assets and there are mental health orders. All of those may, in an appropriate case, need consideration, particularly in a case where the court has not found any actual violence proved. </span></p>

There are two objectives always in contempt of court proceedings. One is to mark the court's disapproval of the disobedience to its order. The other is to secure compliance with that order in the future. Thus, the seriousness of what has taken place is to be viewed in that light as well as for its own intrinsic gravity. </span></p>

This may be aggravating or mitigating. The context is often the break&#8722;up of an intimate relationship in which emotions run high and people behave in silly ways. The context of having children together, if that be the case, cannot be ignored. Sometimes that means that there is an aggravation of what has taken place, because of the greater fear that is engendered from the circumstances. Sometimes it may be mitigating, because there is reason to suppose that once the immediate emotions have calmed down, the molestation and threats will not continue.  </span></p>

The court cannot ignore those parallel proceedings. It may have to take into account their outcome in considering what the practical effect is upon the contempt proceedings. They do have different purposes and often the overlap is not exact, but nevertheless the court will not want, in effect, the contender to suffer punishment twice for the same events. </span></p>

One understands all the constraints in a busy county court, dealing with large numbers of these cases these days, and one would not wish to impose too great a burden on the judiciary in this respect. Nevertheless, it would be appropriate in most cases for the contemnor to know why he or she was being sentenced to a period of imprisonment; why it was the length that it was; if it was suspended, why the suspension was as it was, but only very briefly. </span></p>

There is no doubt that the conduct as described in the witness statement which I have summarised was extremely upsetting and damaging.

I strongly urged her to get legal advice but she was adamant that she wanted to continue without legal representation. I also advised W of her right not to give evidence and, if she did give evidence, not to answer questions that would incriminate her. She said she wished to give evidence on oath. </p>

She wants to publicise her allegations against her ex-husband as widely as possible and for them to be heard by as many people as possible. As such, all statements by the Court about getting legal advice or not self-incriminating were wholly ignored and W treated all my attempts to explain procedural safeguards with total disdain. </p>

However, having seen W in court at some length on three occasions I am of the clear view that although she is obsessed by her campaign against H, and that leads her to ignore all contrary evidence, there is no reason to believe that the tests for lack of capacity in the Mental Capacity Act would be met.  </p>

She is also now totally convinced that she has been the victim of a miscarriage of justice and a cover-up within the legal system. W has already spent over 4 months in prison and made it quite clear that she was going to go on sending the emails whatever I did and that she was prepared to go to prison and indeed sacrifice her house pursuant to an order for sale rather than, as she sees it, be silenced. </p>

In criminal law reasonable excuse is a defence to the offence. But for civil contempt it appears that reasonable excuse goes to sanction rather than whether there has been a contempt. Therefore, in a civil case the distinction is academic because if the judge finds there was a reasonable excuse then there is no legal consequence for the alleged contemnor. </p>

Ms Illsley argues that I should simply rely on the findings of the various judges who considered the matters in 2000-2005 as well as Ms Eaton QC and Hayden J. However, in the light of what happened in the Crown Court and the comments of HHJ Holt I took the view that I could not simply dismiss W&#8217;s defence on the basis of the earlier findings alone. I do however have close regard to those earlier findings and particularly to the fact that DJ Hayes heard both parties close to the time of the alleged events and reached very clear conclusions in the light of the evidence he heard; and subsequent judges had reports from professionals relating to J&#8217;s presentation and none of them supported W&#8217;s allegations.  </p>

This is not a case of a child who was hidden and who was not being listened to. Those professionals include the Guardian, a child psychiatrist and at least one psychologist. For a lengthy period, J was in a secure unit at Leverton Hall with extensive access to professionals. I have seen the report from the Guardian, and DJ Hayes saw much more extensive evidence of what J had been saying at that time. In none of that contemporaneous documentation is there any suggestion of the kind of allegations now being made, let alone of any evidence that such allegations were true.  </p>

It is important to differentiate between the primary and secondary material. The diary from a friend may suggest that the H had not been entirely truthful about something, perhaps financial, but that is the absolute height of the contemporaneous evidence. It does not support any allegation of abuse. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The most important primary evidence is J&#8217;s police interview in 2019. I can only assume that it was this interview which led to HHJ Holt&#8217;s concerns. In my view that interview suggests a very unhappy and angry man, but it does not support the truth of the allegations. Firstly, the allegations are so extreme and involve third parties in a way that has never previously been suggested by J or W. If H had been abusing other unconnected children, and doing so with other men, then I find it impossible to accept </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">that no suggestion of such events would have been raised years ago by other children or their parents. Secondly, J alleges that H frequently abused B and from a very young age. Not just has B absolutely denied this to the police but also at the time when B was a child there was not the slightest sign of such abuse. At that time, when she was about 9 years old, she was happy to spend time with her father and had a good relationship with him. This is wholly inconsistent with the kind of abuse which J now alleges was taking place. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I have no doubt that J&#8217;s allegations are made up. They read as the product of either a fantasist, or perhaps J being desperate to appease his mother, and hoping that she will be pleased by the strength of the allegations. The evidence shows that W was placing enormous pressure on J to make these allegations, bombarding him with letters urging him to support her and make complaints to the police. One of the many concerns about W&#8217;s conduct is the degree to which she will drag J and B into her vendetta against H and has been doing so since at least 2000. She justifies this to herself as protecting J but it is in fact no such thing, it is merely causing J great emotional harm. It is not possible for me to reach any view as to J&#8217;s current mental state and it would be wrong for me to try to do so. However, I have reached the conclusion that J&#8217;s interview does not support W&#8217;s case. </p>

I do not know precisely what documentation HHJ Holt had seen before making his comments. However, it is extremely important to understand that although he will have seen at least some of the same recent material as I have done, he will not have seen the earlier family court proceedings including the material from the Guardian. I am therefore in a significantly better position than he was to take an overview of the case and of J&#8217;s allegations. HHJ Holt&#8217;s views are not primary evidence and are merely a commentary on whatever material he saw. Further, he was not purporting to make any findings and he heard neither submissions nor evidence in respect of the allegations. For those reasons I consider myself to be in a significantly better position to reach conclusions about W&#8217;s allegations than HHJ Holt was.  </p>

I have read H&#8217;s witness statement about the impact that W&#8217;s conduct has had upon him and it is very moving. W has left no stone unturned to publicise the most lurid allegations against him to as wide an audience as possible and to destroy his life. This had a devastating impact on his quality of life including his Ministry and contacts with other people. </p>

Ignoring court orders undermines the judicial system and the protections for the whole of society from upholding the rule of law.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The difficulty, as I see it, is how long would I send W to prison for. Hayden J sentenced her to 9 months and she served 4.5 months. Therefore, to sentence her to a short period, perhaps 3 months, would be entirely tokenistic. It would serve as little disincentive to further breaches and would serve no purpose. However, I then face the prospect of sending W to prison for a year or perhaps more. If I believed that this would persuade her to stop breaching the orders I would make such a sentence. However, I am convinced it would have no such effect. Further, it would not persuade W that she should obey the authority of the court, she will merely view herself as an even greater victim of the justice system. Having regard what Hale LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Hale v Tanner</span> at [37], W&#8217;s campaign is hurtful and deeply unpleasant but there is no violence or threats of violence involved. Further, the campaign must to some degree be self-defeating. I would assume that all H&#8217;s acquaintances, personal and professional must be well aware of the allegations and will have reached their own view. I would be surprised if the recipients of W&#8217;s emails by now took them seriously given their tone and abusive nature. In my view, the greatest protection of H is for him to be able to send this judgment to anyone he wishes to show a full analysis of the truth of the position. I also intend to draft a short executive summary of the judgment which again H can send to anyone he wishes.  </p>

However, sending W to prison for a year or more to provide such respite seems to me to be disproportionate. If imprisoning W would give H long term respite I would do so, but it will not. I am confident that W will simply start sending the emails again once she is released and the respite will only be temporary. At some point the court has to conclude that enough is enough and it cannot continue to send W to prison. I have reached the conclusion that to send W to prison now for any more than a tokenistic period would achieve nothing and would merely absorb prison resources at a difficult time for no purpose whatsoever. The rule of law will not be assisted by W spending another 6 months or more in prison.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0.01in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">I am setting out a short summary of my judgment so that Mr Gibbs can, if he wishes, send it to those who have received Mrs Gibbs&#8217; emails and those people can understand what I judge to be the truth of the allegations made by Mrs Gibbs.  </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0.01in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">Mr Gibbs applied to commit his ex-wife Mrs Gibbs to prison for breaching two orders of the court that she should not publish allegations that he had abused their son (J) 20 years ago. Mrs Gibbs applied to discharge those orders. Mrs Gibbs accepted that she had breached the orders on very many occasions but said that she had a reasonable excuse for doing so, arguing that the allegations are all true. </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0.01in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">In order to be fair to both parties, and so that I could set out in a judgment a complete overview of the case, I examined a large amount of material which Mrs Gibbs said supported her case. I read the police interview of J in 2019, the police report into the investigation of J&#8217;s allegations, and much of the original documentation which was before the family courts in 2000-2006 when Mrs Gibbs started making her allegations. I also read the various earlier judgments concerning those proceedings.  </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0.01in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">Having read these documents I have come to the clear conclusion that Mrs Gibbs&#8217; allegations are not true. She has for many years been convinced of the truth of the allegations and has been conducting an obsessive campaign against her ex-husband. She frequently distorts the truth and alleges that various people have believed her when on examination this is not true.  </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0.01in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">The reasons that I have found against Mrs Gibbs are, in summary, that many professionals were involved with J at the time of the original allegations. None of those professionals suggested that that he had been sexually abused, and the judges who considered the matter at the time did not accept Mrs Gibbs&#8217; allegations. All the subsequent investigations stemmed from Mrs Gibbs&#8217; complaints, not from any evidence of abuse. J in 2019 gave an interview to the police when he made very extreme and lurid allegations. Having read these I judge that they are not true and that they may stem from a desire to appease Mrs Gibbs who has pressured J to make allegations against his father for many years. J made allegations that Mr Gibbs had abused J&#8217;s sister, which she has denied, and which has absolutely no supporting evidence.  </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0.01in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">Mrs Gibbs has placed much reliance on the comments of HHJ Holt in Norwich Crown Court when the CPS decided not to prosecute Mrs Gibbs for breach of the non-molestation order. I have not spoken to Judge Holt, but it is important to understand that I have read all the papers he had and I have read many of the original papers dating back to 2000 which he did not have access to. I am therefore in a better position to consider the truth of the allegations than he was.  </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0.01in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">I have decided not to send Mrs Gibbs to prison despite the fact that she has breached the orders on numerous occasions and has no reasonable excuse for having done so. This is because she has already been to prison for breach of an earlier order and has simply persisted with her campaign. I am confident that if I send her to prison, for however long, when she comes out she will continue her vendetta against Mr Gibbs. I therefore consider the more effective remedy for Mr Gibbs is for me to publish a full and detailed judgment with an executive summary so that he can distribute this to anyone who has been sent Mrs Gibbs&#8217; allegations. I have also ordered the sale of Mrs Gibbs&#8217; house to pay the costs of the various proceedings Mr Gibbs has been forced to bring.  </p>
