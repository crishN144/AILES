AB is currently placed at a residential children&#8217;s home.  She is separately represented in these proceedings by Mr Twomey of King&#8217;s Counsel and Dr Bianca Jackson of counsel.  CD and EF are placed together in foster care.  They are represented through their Children&#8217;s Guardian by Ms Laura Bumpus of counsel.  The mother of the children is NM (hereafter &#8216;the mother&#8217;) represented by Ms Martha Gray of counsel.  The father of the children is PR (hereafter &#8216;the father&#8217;).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At this hearing, I am concerned with a difficult case management decision regarding the proper ambit of the finding of fact exercise in this case.   The proceedings are currently listed for a combined hearing in six days&#8217; time on 11 March 2024 before HHJ Cox with a time-estimate of 13 days.  HHJ Cox has held a <span style="font-style:italic">Re W</span> hearing in the proceedings and determined that AB will give evidence.  AB currently expects that to happen on the second day of the final hearing.  Given the nature of the case management decision that falls now to be made at this late stage in the case, the proceedings have been reallocated to me for the purpose of considering that case management issue.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The case management issue before this court is whether the court should engage in a fact finding exercise with respect to allegations made by the mother against the former allocated social worker, WR, and two residential workers, TT and KS, arising out of an email sent to the mother on 14 November 2023 by the residential placement in which AB then resided, the details of which I will come to below.   In short, the mother contends that the email demonstrates that the social worker colluded with one or other or both of two residential workers to elicit negative evidence from the placement and to achieve the deletion of records regarding the case.  The mother has filed and served a schedule of findings in respect of that issue and contends that the court should now undertake a finding of fact exercise to determine the same.  The local authority and the Children&#8217;s Guardian contend that, applying the principles set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Oxfordshire CC v DP, RS and BS</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 2 FLR 1031" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 2 FLR 1031</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re H-D-H (Children)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2021/1192" uk:canonical="[2021] EWCA Civ 1192" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] EWCA Civ 1192</ref>, a finding of fact exercise is not necessary or proportionate.  The father and AB are formally neutral on the issue, although both Mr Anelay and Mr Twomey made short submissions on factors specific to their respective clients that may inform the court&#8217;s decision.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parents married in 2010 and separated in 2019. The mother alleges that the father was physically violent towards her during their relationship and the father likewise alleges domestic abuse by the mother.  Following the separation, the children lived with the mother.  In November 2019, the mother left the children with the father to attend a family funeral.  The mother accepts a subsequent finding made by the court in previous proceedings that this was done without proper preparation, leaving the children confused and distressed.</p>

At the conclusion of these previous care proceedings on 19 March 2021, HHJ Wright found that the children had suffered emotional harm due to exposure to the parents&#8217; long-term and ongoing conflict and by reason of the mother&#8217;s poor decision-making and impulsivity.  HHJ Wright was not invited to make further findings in relation to domestic abuse or coaching by either parent and did not do so.  HHJ Wright determined that all three children should live with the father and spend reasonable time with the mother.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During the course of the first set of care proceedings, there were reports on two occasions of the mother apparently encouraging AB to make false allegations about the father.  On an unannounced home visit on 28 April 2020, AB reported that her mother told AB that an injury to AB&#8217;s ear had been caused by her father, notwithstanding that AB had reported that it had been caused by EF and the mother was not present at the time.  On 18 May 2020 the mother is recorded as having contacted the Emergency Duty Team to report that the father had hit AB, causing a bruise to her arm.  When AB and CD were spoken to during the welfare visit undertaken in consequence of the mother&#8217;s referral, CD reported that she often scratched herself and that the mother had told her &#8220;if you say your father has done this then you can come and live with me&#8221;.  Both CD and AB reported that they felt sad about lying regarding their father and were happy living with him.  On 29 May 2020, the mother reported to the Team Manager that all three children have arrived at contact with scratching and bruising and sent photos.  The mother stated that AB had said that EF caused her scratches, CD has caused the ones on EF and CD would not say who had caused her bruises.</p>

WR visited AB on the morning of 25 October 2021.  AB denied that her father had caused the injury and reported that she had had a fight at school with another pupil on 20 October 2021.  AB told WR that she had informed her mother four times about this but that her mother had not believed her and, in the end, AB had just agreed with her.  AB asked WR not to say anything to her mother, who she said would be angry if AB contradicted her.  AB reported that CD wished to live with the mother and that CD had told her mother that it was the father who injured AB&#8217;s wrist.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">AB was taken to the Emergency Department on the evening of 25 October 2021 by the mother.  At the hospital AB reported that her father had twisted her right arm, hurting her wrist and had done so on four other occasions.  She stated that a bruise to her leg had been caused by her father hitting her with a wooden spoon and that her father had called her &#8220;a disappointment&#8221;.  AB reported to WR later that she had told a female doctor about the incident at school but that the first doctor and her mother had said the injuries had been caused by her father.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 28 October 2021, WR again spoke to AB on her own and AB repeated her claim that her wrist had been hurt at school, demonstrating how this occurred.  However, AB then also said that her father had grabbed her wrist on 18 October 2021 in order to stop her hitting her sister.  She described this as &#8220;not hard&#8221; and being the same as when teachers prevent pupils from hitting other students.  AB said she did not know how she got her bruise to the leg.  AB claimed to WR that her mother and a doctor told her the injury was caused by a spoon.  A day later, on 29 October 2021, AB telephoned WR and stated that her father had twisted her wrist, hit her with a wooden spoon and that the doctor had told her it was not safe for her to return to her father&#8217;s care.  WR considered that AB was being prompted by people in the background.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 1 November 2021, AB informed a pastoral support teacher that her father had twisted her wrist, that her father always did such things and blackmailed her to say she wanted to live with him when she really wants to live with her mother.  AB alleged that her father called her and shouted at her and threatened her.  When WR visited AB at school on 1 November 2021, AB repeated those allegations and further alleged that her father punched, kicked and hit her, attacked her with a plank of wood, locked her in the bathroom, attacked CD following an incident with a tablet, punched her and gave her a black eye and hit her head with a metal spoon.  WR was informed by school staff that AB&#8217;s aunt was listening to the conversation on AB&#8217;s phone and that AB was speaking to someone on the phone when she went to the toilet.  It is contended by the local authority that at an interview with WR and a police officer on 8 November 2021, AB and CD retracted their allegations, although a recently received CRIS report does not bear this out.</p>

The therapist reported that this account appeared to provide AB with reassurance to join CD in providing this narrative.</p>

The anonymous informant making the report believed that this was a result of the children at the address having been beaten.  A further call was received by a friend of AB&#8217;s, who reported AB had sent them a voice note of their father beating her.

The police considered that the father appeared aggressive and agitated.  AB told the police that her father had punched her on her arm and hit her in the face several times and that her father had hit her numerous times throughout the day and had previously strangled her and beat her on the legs with a crutch.  AB showed police officers bruising to her legs and marks to her left upper arm.  The father was arrested on suspicion of assault and taken into police custody.  The police placed the children under their protection.  The children were thereafter first placed with a maternal aunt before being placed in foster care.

AB was saying &#8216;daddy hits and chokes us.&#8217; CD said that AB had bad behaviours at home and that her father was trying to stop her.  She said that AB sent inappropriate images to others and her dad discovered a video that she sent to her crush, J.   CD stated that her father was angry and took away AB&#8217;s phone to remove the camera.  CD said that her father had never hit her. She asserted that AB was lying that she was hit by her father, that AB got her bruises from school and she was lying when she stated the father caused these.  CD said that it was a usual day on 13 November 2022 and there was no argument between AB and the father.  She reported that she and EF were sleeping on the bed until the police came. They did not hear any shouting or other things unusual. CD said that she knows AB&#8217;s friend, J, called the police, but she had no idea why he did that.

AB stated her father had been physically abusing her since 2019 and said that she did not tell anyone as she feared she would not be believed.  AB said that on 13 November 2022, she was speaking to a group of friends on Snap Chat. Her father had come into her room and accused her of sending inappropriate videos to a male friend. AB denied this and stated she was talking to a group of young people via Snap Chat. AB showed a video from her phone. AB said she rejected her father&#8217;s stated view that the video was provocative, and he began to hit her. She then showed a photograph of bruising on her arm and stated the bruising was a result of her father hitting her on Friday. AB said that the bruising became more prominent after her father struck her on the same location of the previous bruise on the 13 November 2022. AB stated her father also hit her younger brother EF on the head, which caused him to cry.  </p>

Ms Gray submits that WR, for whom she submits the email of 14 November 2023 was intended, has led the local authority&#8217;s case in this regard in circumstances where she was the allocated social worker for over two years and during that period was responsible for all the evaluative judgements in the case.   In these circumstances, Ms Gray submits that the email of 14 November 2023 is not a peripheral issue but rather a vital piece of evidence that is corroborative of WR&#8217;s approach to the case, her methodology, her record keeping and her evaluation of the evidence and requires examining when the court is considering the extent to which it can be satisfied that WR&#8217;s evidence and analysis is balanced and fair.  Ms Gray further submits that, in light of the litigation history in this case, it would be potentially contrary to the children&#8217;s long-term interests for the issues arising from the email of 14 November 2023 to be left undetermined.</p>

It is not always a straightforward decision. Care proceedings are quasi-inquisitorial. They are not confined within the tramlines of adversarial pleadings. There is therefore a recurrent danger that they veer off track. In a case with a complex family history, the court will often be encouraged by one party or another to explore an issue that has been unearthed during the investigation. Judges have to be very careful before acceding to such an application to avoid the unnecessary use of the limited resources available. In deciding whether to hold a fact-finding hearing, it is imperative that they conduct a proportionality analysis by reference to the factors identified in the Oxfordshire case and Re H-D-H ."&#8221;</p>

It will never be appropriate, however, to carry out a detailed evaluation, not least because the court can only make findings on the totality of the evidence and at the case management stage not all of the evidence will have been filed. Anything akin to a mini-trial of the allegations would therefore be wrong in principle and wasteful of time and resources. Although each decision will depend upon the circumstances of the case, the apparent quality of the evidence is accordingly unlikely to be a powerful factor in the overall decision unless it is clear without the need for detailed assessment that the evidence appears to be particularly strong or particularly weak.&#8221;</p>

This would necessarily include the provision of expert evidence with respect to the contents of the telephones of WR, TT, KS the mother and AB.  With respect to TT, KS their willingness to participate in the proceedings is yet to be definitively established.  It is known that KS has returned to her home country in Africa.  In these circumstances, securing her phone may raise issues with respect to securing evidence from a foreign jurisdiction.  There remains a question mark over the extent to which further computer analysis would be required.  In light of the potential consequences for the professional standing of WR, TTand KS, they would have to be accorded the opportunity to seek legal advice and decide whether to intervene.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The question of the likely evidential result of any fact finding hearing as a factor in deciding whether such a hearing should be held requires the court to look at the impact of findings one way or another.  Were the court to embark on a finding of fact hearing with respect to the findings sought by the mother in this case, there are a number of possible outcomes.  The court could conclude, as the mother invites it to do, that the email was intended by TT or KS for WR as part of a conspiracy by WR to obtain negative evidence against the mother and destroy records.  The court could also conclude that the email was sent by TT or KS in order to stir up trouble, conclude that the email was sent by AB using a script provided to her by the mother in order to undermine WR&#8217;s credibility or conclude that no conclusions can be drawn to the civil standard of proof having regard to the evidence before the court.</p>

If the court concluded that that the email was sent by AB using a script provided to her by the mother, in order to undermine WR credibility then the finding would inevitably reinforce the local authority&#8217;s case with respect to threshold and placement as far as it relates to the mother.

In previous proceedings, <span style="font-style:italic">prior</span> to WR&#8217;s involvement, at an unannounced home visit on 28 April 2020, AB reported that her mother told AB that an injury to AB&#8217;s ear had been caused by her father, notwithstanding that AB had reported that it had been caused by EF and the mother was not present at the time.  In May 2020, again prior to WR&#8217;s involvement, the mother is recorded as having contacted the Emergency Duty Team to report that the father had hit AB, causing a bruise to her arm but when AB and CD were spoken to during the welfare visit undertaken in consequence, CD reported that she often scratched herself and that the mother had told her &#8220;if you say your father has done this then you can come and live with me&#8221;.  Both CD and AB reported that they felt sad about lying regarding their father and were happy living with him.  Subsequent to WR&#8217;s involvement, she is still not the single source of the accounts relied on by the local authority to establish threshold.

It is one of the oldest principles of our law &#8211; it goes back over 400 years, to the earliest years of the seventeenth century &#8211; that no-one is to be condemned unheard: see Re G (Care: Challenge to Local Authority's Decision) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2003/551" uk:canonical="[2003] EWHC 551 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] EWHC 551 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 2 FLR 42" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 2 FLR 42</ref>, paras 28-29. As I observed (para 55) &#8220;The fact, if fact it be, that the circumstances are such as to justify intervention by the State, . . . does not absolve the State of its duty nonetheless to act fairly. It is not enough for the State to make a fair decision: the State must itself act fairly in the way in which it goes about arriving at its decision.&#8221; A parent who wishes to give evidence in answer to a local authority's care application must surely be permitted to do so. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst Ms Gray is right to caution the court by reference to the foregoing passage, a refusal to direct a fact finding hearing with respect to the findings sought by the mother against WR, TT and KS does not have the effect either of preventing the mother giving evidence in answer to a local authority&#8217;s application or, subject to what I say below, from cross-examining witnesses whose evidence is being relied upon by the local authority in respect of threshold and placement.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Once again, given the nature and extent of the evidence before the court, the absence of any finding with respect to the email would not prevent the mother advancing her current case as to threshold and placement as articulated at this hearing by Ms Gray. A finding that WR had sought to elicit negative evidence concerning her would supplement the mother&#8217;s case but the absence of such a finding does not preclude that case being put effectively. Whilst of continuing and seminal importance, the context of the observations in<span style="font-style:italic"> Re S-W (Children) (Care Proceedings: Final care order at case management hearing)</span>  must be borne in mind, namely that the FPR 2010 gives the court wide case management powers when seeking to ensure that the case is dealt with <span style="font-style:italic">both</span> fairly <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> expeditiously.  </p>

Peter Jackson LJ recognised in <span style="font-style:italic">H-D-H and C (Children: Fact-Finding)</span> that most decisions will have their downsides.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Were the circumstances such that this application could have been brought much earlier in the proceedings, the outcome of the balancing exercise <span style="font-style:italic">may</span> have been different.  However, this case is six days away from a final hearing in proceedings that have now been going on for over a year and in which any further delay would be entirely antithetic to the welfare of all three children.   In these circumstances, and where the findings sought by the mother would not be determinative of the substantive application before the court one way or the other having regard to nature and extent of the evidence before the court, and where I am satisfied that the mother can receive a fair trial by reference to that existing evidence, on a fine balance I am satisfied that it is not necessary to direct a finding of fact exercise with respect to the findings sought by the mother in order to deal with this case justly.  Whilst such an exercise may be desirable, when balanced against the detrimental effect on the children of the final hearing being adjourned over a year after the issue of proceedings, it cannot in my judgment be said to be necessary.</p>

I further accept their submission that, in the circumstances, to follow a decision that a fact finding exercise on the findings sought by the mother is not required with a decision that cross-examination of WR on the email of 14 November 2023 will nonetheless be permitted would be contradictory and would circumvent the disciplined approach articulated in <span style="font-style:italic">Oxfordshire CC v DP, RS and BS</span>.</p>
