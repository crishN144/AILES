	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is a claim in Hague Convention proceedings by the father, 56 year old Jose A, a Portuguese national, for the return of 2 of his children to Portugal.  They are 13 year old F, born on 16 May 1990 and his sister 9 year old I, born on 10 August 1994.  This claim is defended by the children&#8217;s mother, 41 year old Precinda A, who was born in Angola but is also a Portuguese national.  I shall refer to the parties as the mother and the father.</p>

By that stage I was scared that the Defendant was planning to take the children to another address where I could not find them.  The Defendant was putting a lot of pressure on me to consent to the children remaining in England.  Every telephone conversation we had was dominated by this topic.  On this occasion I considered that there was a significant possibility that the Defendant would take the children to another address so I pretended that I would allow the children to remain in England and that I would send the children&#8217;s clothes to the Defendant.  However, at the time I had no intention of allowing the children to stay in England and I never intended or indeed sent their clothes to the Defendant.&#8221;</p>
