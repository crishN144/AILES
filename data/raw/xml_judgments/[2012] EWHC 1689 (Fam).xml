After a time, the search for adopters was abandoned, but the freeing orders were never discharged and all links with the boys&#8217; family were cut.  They remained under the freeing orders for 11 years, moving from foster placement to foster placement and becoming increasingly unsettled and disturbed.  Their experiences are described in part 2 of this judgment.  They have suffered irreparable harm, reflected in declarations now made under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref>.  </span></p>

In February 1998, when they were aged just 2&#190; and 6 months old, they went into the care of Lancashire County Council (LCC).  Their parents had separated, their father was homeless, and their mother had abandoned them.  LCC were responsible for them for the next 14 years, but unfortunately did not succeed in finding them a new family.  Freeing orders, made in 2001, remained in existence until this hearing in 2012.  In A&#8217;s case, his foster carers (Mr and Mrs SG) have now become his special guardians.  For S, a family placement is not possible and he lives in a children&#8217;s home under a care order.  </span></p>

LCC and the IRO accept that they have breached the boys&#8217; rights under Articles 8, 6 and 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 1950.  Declarations, set out below, have been made, and the boys will now seek damages for negligence and breach of statutory duty by separate civil action.  At the same time, any claims for damages under the Human Right Act will be transferred to the Queens Bench Division.</span></p>

If the court has authorised a local authority to look for an adoptive home under a freeing order or a placement order, all energies will be directed towards achieving that outcome, with the maintenance of family ties a much lower priority.  That is, in the current jargon, the direction of travel.  But if adoption is not possible, the direction changes.  The child will not be losing membership of his birth family and the question of what family connections (if any) are in his interests needs to be reviewed.  </span></p>

Her mother, who had given good support, was then diagnosed with cancer.  She had no respite.  She told social services that she was not coping and the boys were taken away, with everyone crying.  She was told that they would be adopted, and until 2011 she thought they had been.  Later on, after the death of her mother, and with an improvement in her own circumstances, she asked social services if the boys could return to her care.

My manager was on long term sick leave and I was &#8220;promoted&#8221; temporarily to position of senior IRO.  My work load more than doubled.  I was undertaking supervision of six IROs as well as running my own caseload.  I was also responsible for &#8220;children missing from care intervention meetings&#8221; in Lancashire.  Consequently, my time and my attention to detail in these reviews was limited.  The significant behavioural problems displayed by both boys in placement were the priority.  S had declined input from CAMHS and this was a matter of concern.  The school was struggling to manage S&#8217;s behaviour.  It was noted that the Mother had not responded to indirect contact and this reduced the immediacy and lowered the profile of this issue.  In that context I did not prioritise the legal status issues.</span></p>

My focus was on welfare issues, and I was concerned about A who needed psychological input and emotional support and who was rejecting CAMHS.   I was also concerned about the stability of the placement for both boys together and reflected the potential uncertainty of their care arrangements.

Until the IRO service is properly resourced,<span style="font-style:italic"/>that situation will not change.  I am very pleased to be able to say that, even as late as yesterday, because of the pressure that I have brought to bear on<span style="font-style:italic"/>senior management since my appointment, I was given permission to advertise for four further IROs.

In the past some local authorities have been of the view that CAFCASS duty lawyers provide this service. However, CAFCASS duty lawyers can only provide guidance, not legal advice.
