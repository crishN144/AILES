		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in">&#8220;Having considered the authorities to which I have referred, and others, there is, in my view, a danger in placing too much emphasis on the phrase "last resort" used by Thorpe LJ and Coleridge J in Re: A. It is well established that the court cannot put a gloss on to the paramountcy principle in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1</ref>. I do not read the judgments in Re: A as purporting to do that. The test is, and must always be, based on a comprehensive analysis of the child's welfare and a determination of where the welfare balance points in terms of outcome. It is important to note that the welfare provisions in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1</ref> are precisely the same provisions as those applying in public law children cases where a local authority may seek the court's authorisation to remove a child from parental care either to place them with another relative or in alternative care arrangements. Where, in private law proceedings, the choice, as here, is between care by one parent and care by another parent against whom there are no significant findings, one might anticipate that the threshold triggering a change of residence would, if anything, be lower than that justifying the permanent removal of a child from a family into foster care. Use of phrases such as "last resort" or "draconian" cannot and should not indicate a different or enhanced welfare test. What is required is for the judge to consider all the circumstances in the case that are relevant to the issue of welfare, consider those elements in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1(3)</ref> welfare check list which apply on the facts of the case and then, taking all those matters into account, determine which of the various options best meets the child's welfare needs.&#8221; </p>

The marriage broke down and the parents separated in August 2007.  There have been since then almost continuous court proceedings relating to H.  This is the sixth set of private law proceedings.  In 2007 to 2008, there were proceedings relating to the contact the father should have with H, during which the mother made allegations of domestic abuse against the father but no findings were made.  Then in 2009 to 2010, the father made an application for leave to remove H from the jurisdiction and for holiday contact.  In 2011, the mother suspended contact to the father and in the course of proceedings in that year she raised the domestic abuse allegations which had already been adjudicated upon. Then in 2013 to 2014, the mother made further allegations against the father, all of which were dismissed and contact between him and H was reinstated.  The fifth set of proceedings between 2016 to 2017 related to the mother&#8217;s refusal to cooperate with father for the choice of secondary school for H and the issues of contact.  </p>

On the matter of its degree, however, mother reported threatening messages, but the police disclosure document did not support this, reporting &#8216;aggressive, but not threatening&#8217;, even though it did not &#8216;excuse the aggressive nature&#8217; in expressing his </p>

However, his despair at H&#8217;s predicament now looking more set on a trajectory of loss of the paternal relationship, has triggered more reflection, remorse, sadness, and a wish to re-establish his connection without interference.&#8221; </p>

She said that at &#8216;all other times&#8217;, he was good, and they were close, and that &#8216;when someone&#8217;s a diabetic you gotta let them have their breakfast&#8217; and that in the case of her mum&#8217;s part &#8216;my mum has a bit of blood pressure&#8217;.

She has an obsessive concern that PA (and particularly his mother who deems inflences him unduly) are malevolent in nature.  Beginning from a position of feeling put down by others, with a conmpensating need to prove her worth,  her sense of right/wrong and good/evil lead her to view the paternal family all things bad.  There is splitting, with idealising and denigrating; a problem of integrating angry feelings with love&#8221; </p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in">&#8220;Explanations of TT sustaining her views of the father and transferring them onto H may indicate a wider problem of reflective function.  Mentalising is the process we use to understand our own and others&#8217; mental states, intentions, feelings, thoughts, desires and beliefs.  TT does not always make reasonable links between mental states and behaviour, creating realities reflecting what she wishes or fears, rather than what others are likely to intend.&#8221;    </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in">&#8220;She experiences herself as a victim, badly treated by others, rising above it in a saintly manner in her mind, but not in practice.  TT constructs narratives based on her feelings, projecting her concerns and convictions out on the world, so that others&#8217; behaviours fit her own preconceived ideas and concerns.   </p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in">There is difficulty shifting that perspective in light of any new evidence.  TT&#8217;s reflective function can be distorted, unintegrated and almost bizarre at times, particularly when applied to the paternal family.  Her narratives are designed to reveal herself in the best possible light at the expense of any plausible understanding of the relationships around her, to the point where fantasy and ideals may impact on her grasp on reality at times.   </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in">People with such difficulty mentalizing may assume that what exists in their mind reflects what actually exists in the world, so their internal ruminations can prevail regardless.  With reduced ability to take the perspective of others, there is greater difficulty for TT in making coherent sense of the emotional world in a manner which can act almost like a sensory deficit.   </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in">TT disavows any responsibility at all for what is happening between H and his father, suggesting it is entirely between them, with no personal role at all.  What makes this bizarre is her failure to grasp that professionals will all have access to a documented history pointing to her own historical behaviour around contact as a more plausible explanation.  This is the case, notwithstanding PA&#8217;s own lack of sensitivity and loss of child-focus with argumentative/aggressive sibling-like behaviour with H in attempting to resolve matters.&#8221;   </p>

She would have been exploring and redefining H&#8217;s experiences in terms of her own deeper concerns and needs, gradually changing his perception of what happens to him with his father (and possibly others) to fit her own view of herself as protector, so that she can continue to provide the special nurturing she feels H needs to feel safe and cared for.   </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in">This is likely to have made it harder for H to make coherent sense of his own world and relationships. His world is now also populated by a hero and villain view of his parents, and is likely to generalise into wider black and white thinking.  There is a risk of H developing rigid schemas precluding him from making good enough sense of his social and emotional world to negotiate his relationships successfully as he matures. </p>

She is vigilantly guarded and alert to warding off expected derogation and malice and possible deception.  A very traumatic background of being badly burned and victimised by her peers, whilst being cared for and made to feel special by her father, has led her to compensate with an undisciplined imagination of immature, self-glorifying fantasies, taking liberties with facts, create an idealised fantasy childhood, with grandiose ideas which can be irrational and flimsy, constructed to redeem lost pride, substituting for the painful realities she has endured&#8221; </p>

She actively disowns her undesirable personal traits and motives, attributing them to others, so that by means of this reversal, she can then justifiably act out her own anger, feeling vindicated.&#8221; &#8220;H&#8217;s presentation suggests that he is triangulated within his parents&#8217; conflictual relationship.  His angry rejection of his father serves a function for his mother within the parental separation. H&#8217;s own emotional needs, including his right to have a relationship with his father, is being ignored by TT in order to serve her conflict with PA. </p>

She presents as distraught at the prospect of anything happening to her, lest H be left without a carer.  She positions father as unreliable, neglectful, aggressive/hot tempered, a disorderly alcoholic, seemingly incapable of caring for him at all and requiring therapeutic input.  However, she also spoke about father not being there for H, fearing he is suicidal and unable to cope with life because of his health.  I could not find evidence of a mental health problem of this extreme nature, neither in my assessment, nor in PA&#8217;s medical notes.&#8221; </p>

TT presents with as if the consequences of a false negative (deciding there is no aggression/alcoholism, when there is) is much more dangerous than a possible false positive (deciding there is aggression and alcoholism, when there is not), ignoring the potential harm of her own actions and beliefs in colluding or co-creating these allegations and depriving H of his father, despite the Fact Finding saying they are unsubstantiated.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In her oral evidence, she said that H may on the surface appear to be fine emotionally, but he is not.  If the court were to contemplate transferring residence from the mother to the father there were risks to H; he may run away and he may not settle in his father&#8217;s care if it was not properly supported.  Dr Braier advised that prior to contemplating a transfer of residence the court had to be sure that the father was not an abusive parent. The father has not been blameless over the course of the years and has, from time to time, acted inappropriately (e.g. the email of 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May, see above). But, as Dr Braier commented, he has expressed remorse and I consider it to be genuine. The mother&#8217;s level of conviction about the rightness of her position is not open to challenge or to outside evidence.  She is firmly entrenched in her view and is most unlikely to change. Parental alienation is very harmful to a child. It skews the child&#8217;s ability to form any and all sorts of relationships and is not limited to the failed relationship with the other parent. In this case, there is now no other option but to transfer residence of H to his father in the welfare best interests of this child. If, short of a transfer, an attempt was made to re-establish contact H, whilst remaining in his mother&#8217;s care, is likely to become even more entrenched against his father.  </p>

For the purposes of compiling her report she spoke once to each of the parents briefly on the telephone. There is no reference in the report to the author having a lack of time to complete her enquiries or to make a recommendation. Rather there is a clear and unequivocal recommendation that H should live with his mother and have no contact whatsoever with his father. In her report, she only considered the negative issues about the father and set out the mother&#8217;s criticisms of him.<span style="font-weight:bold"/>There is no consideration at all of the adverse role of the mother in H&#8217;s life nor did she give any consideration as to the extent, if at all, to which the mother had alienated H against his father.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">At the conclusion of the submissions on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September, I announced my decision but reserved judgment. In light of my decision the Independent Social Worker was to collect H from school that afternoon and transport him down to his father&#8217;s home in City A in the South of England. The paternal family had agreed to leave the family home for a short period to enable H to have time and space to settle into his father&#8217;s care. I have been informed that that process proceeded without incident and the transition plan to date has been effective.  </p>
