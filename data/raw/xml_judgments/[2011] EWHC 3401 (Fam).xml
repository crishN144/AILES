SJ is now 10 years and PJ 17 years. Among the sources of evidence to support the LA&#8217;s case are SJ and PJ&#8217;s ABE interviews, where they make allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour with them instigated by the mother, and in relation to PJ involving the father. As a defensive measure the mother had filed a schedule of findings of fact she sought against her mother (DJ), grandfather (PJ), brother (PJ) and sister (SJ). Due to the findings sought against these members of the wider maternal family each of these people had been joined as interveners to the proceedings. Due to their ages PJ and SJ were represented by the Official Solicitor.</span></p>

The court is concerned with serious allegations, and its determination of them is important to future welfare decisions regarding X. The court already has the evidence from PJ via the ABE interviews which the court will, as it does in many other cases, assess together with other evidence. The application for PJ to give oral evidence has arisen in the context of the case now put forward by the mother, that the matters described by PJ in his ABE interview are contaminated from a number of sources but, in particular, by reason of influence, suggestion, distortion and/or coaching by DJ. DJ wants the court to hear from PJ on this aspect of the case, which is not covered is his ABE interview. It is acknowledged that the court can proceed to determine the issues without additional evidence from PJ, but, all things being equal, in a case where credibility is in issue the court is likely to be assisted by his evidence.</span></p>

The raft of measures that are proposed would carry too many risks that would seriously, if not fatally, undermine the evidential value of the resulting material to such an extent that the court should not embark on that process.

In her oral submissions, following Dr SG&#8217;s evidence, she submitted there were two important considerations from X&#8217;s welfare; fair trial and delay. In considering what advantages PJ&#8217;s evidence will bring to the determination of the truth the court will need to consider PJ as he is. A vulnerable anxious young man, with significant processing difficulties who knows the case is ongoing with the inevitability that, even with support in place, his anxiety levels will increase. For there to be a fair trial the court has to consider the weight that is likely to be attached to further evidence from PJ, in the light of the way that it would need to be given. The fairness to the parents would involve questions being put to PJ which would cover many matters which would include the circumstances in the family home and his feelings towards the mother. Many of these questions, even with ground rules, would involve abstract concepts which would be difficult for PJ to process, even with support. She submits the best way, balancing the evidence, would be by way of pre-recorded interview. If that happened he would need to be prepared for that, the parents would not be able to ask questions directly and PJ would need to be the subject of extensive preparation, going through the material to be challenged in some detail in advance of that pre-recorded interview. She submits the weight the court is likely to be able to attach to such evidence is unlikely to assist the court in the determination of the truth. She accepts the evidence of Dr SG that there is more adverse risk to PJ&#8217;s welfare if he gave evidence (with all the safeguards in place) than not giving evidence. She submits that his distress if the court decided that he should not give evidence can be managed by emphasising to him that the court already has his evidence, through his ABE interview, and he has done what he can for X. If the court did decide that PJ should give oral evidence, she submits the risks of adjournment of the January hearing would be very high, which is not in X&#8217;s best interests. She submits there is evidence from many other sources on the issues the court now has to determine, in particular from the mother and DJ. If the evidence from PJ, due to the inherent difficulties in enabling it to be put before the court, is unlikely to add much to the determination of the truth and there is no significant disadvantage to DJ the court should exercise its discretion and refuse the application. She submitted the balance now came down clearly on the side of the court refusing the application.</span></p>

The Witness Intermediary Scheme was implemented as a result. Unfortunately, outside the scheme of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/23" uk:canonical="1999 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">this Act</ref>, no provision has been implemented for the use of Registered Intermediaries. Accordingly, the only option is the use of one of the few specialist private intermediary services, of which an organisation called Triangle is one. However, this involves a fee.</span></p>

Registered Intermediaries have been available in all 43 police forces and CPS areas in England and Wales since 2008. the police fund the use of Registered Intermediaries at the investigation stage and the CPS fund their use at the trial stage. However there is no provision beyond the YJCEA for using Registered Intermediaries. Where the judiciary has used its inherent powers to grant the use of an intermediary (for example for a defendant) the MoJ says that &#8216;the appointment of a Registered Intermediary has only been made when doing so has not impacted upon their provision for those for whom the legislation was intended.&#8217; The MoJ position with regard to family cases is that &#8216;it will agree to assist in the provision of a Registered Intermediary only when there is a direct linking to a criminal case in which the witness is involved and where one has already been provided through the Witness Intermediary Scheme.&#8217; (Email from Jason Connolly, MoJ, 30 August 2011)&#8230;&#8217; </span></p>
