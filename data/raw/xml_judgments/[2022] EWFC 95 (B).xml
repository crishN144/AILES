Z suffers, I accept on the evidence, very severely with M.E. and is housebound for much of the time, requiring a huge amount of care from the wife and with little imminent hope of recovery or even improvement. A also suffers from what appears to be M.E. &#8211; although their problems are less serious at the moment than those of Z, some of what I heard caused me to be concerned for their future as well, and they does not appear to be attending any school currently, which in itself is a big source of concern. The contact between the children and the husband is limited and it is appropriate for my purposes to regard the wife as very much the children&#8217;s primary carer for the foreseeable future, and at a level which (even though they are not young children) will make the taking of employment very challenging or indeed impossible for the wife.</p>

On the face of it anyway, when they moved to London they continued to live a good life style involving expensive rental accommodation (&#163;10,250 per month from 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2017 at a property in Wimbledon Village), good holidays and private education for both children.</p>

The husband left the rented family home, and the wife and children also had to leave in June 2018 as the husband stopped paying the rent and arrears were fast accruing. The wife had to rent alternative and cheaper rented accommodation. The husband stopped paying the children&#8217;s school fees and, in May 2019, they were both excluded from their private school, apparently to their great distress. These episodes seem to have had a significant effect on the children&#8217;s stability, health and wellbeing.</p>

The wife preferred to remain in the husband&#8217;s home country. In order to persuade the wife to go along with his plans the husband informed the wife that, if he was permitted to move the family to London and base himself in London for work purposes, then they would be financially successful. The wife was not convinced and required some proof of benefit. The husband indicated that Company X wished to buy his company for &#163;80,000,000. He produced a document which appeared to be a legitimate draft sale contract at that price. He also produced, and showed to the wife, a bank statement which appeared to record that somebody (presumably, it was thought, Company X.) had indeed, on 16</span><span class="within-new" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:initial">th</span><span class="within-new" style="color:initial"> June 2014 or immediately before, made a down payment of &#163;8,000,000 on this contract and that the money was in the husband&#8217;s (or strictly the company&#8217;s) possession. The presented paper bank statement, which (I accept) was retained by the wife from 2014 to the present, appears on its face to be genuine and it certainly convinced the wife at the time that the husband&#8217;s plan was a serious and substantial one with some real benefits for her. The wife duly gave up her opposition, resigned her employment in husband&#8217;s home country, and the family duly uprooted itself from there and moved to London in January 2015.</span></p>

The husband has sought to suggest that the monies were later returned to Company X., and thus they would legitimately cease to appear on the bank statements, but I reject that explanation &#8211; they would still show on the statements. On a balance of probabilities I am satisfied that the husband dishonestly and falsely manufactured the presented 2014 bank statement to mislead the wife into moving to London. I find that there never was a payment of &#163;8,000,000. Because I have reached this conclusion I regard with suspicion the &#163;80,000,000 Company X sale contract. In view of the late disclosure of the genuine bank statements there has been insufficient time to pursue the issue of whether the Company X sale contract was itself a falsely produced document and I can make no definite finding on this.   </span></p>

My general impression of him was that he was both evasive and obstructive in his presentation. His written disclosure was both very late and very incomplete and he demonstrated very little respect for the numerous directions orders made. When asked a direct question in oral evidence he very frequently did what he could to avoid answering and he was prone to going off on irrelevant tangents. His written statements tend to deal with largely irrelevant points (often making unhelpful attacks on the wife which, even if they were true and I am satisfied they were mostly untrue) and largely ignore what, for me are the relevant areas in the case &#8211; for example they fail to give any detailed explanation, properly evidenced for example by company financial statements, as to what became of the  businesses. Further, when presented with evidence obtained by the wife from the internet (for example pictures of the husband on his Instagram or Facebook account recently enjoying apparently expensive activities) the husband told me that he had deliberately photo-shopped the images and that they were fake, suggesting that he thought everybody did this sort of thing on the internet.  </span></p>

His mother, a 78 year old retired lady of modest means, has (he says) transferred substantial amounts of money to him by way of loans (approximately &#163;40,000 between January 2021 and April 2022), apparently placing her home in jeopardy, but it wasn&#8217;t possible to call her as a witness to explain her position. Can it really be true that this was money borrowed by her against her home or has some of the husband&#8217;s money been &#8216;parked&#8217; with her to be retrieved at his command?</span></p>

The husband told me that this liability subsisted even though the earnout clause was subsequently cancelled by Company X (a fact which I regard as highly implausible, but the husband told me &#8220;</span><span class="within-new" style="font-style:italic;color:initial">was the law in my home country</span><span class="within-new" style="color:initial">&#8221;) and that such sum remains payable to this day. The husband has produced documentation purporting to come from his native tax authorities in which they apparently assert this debt. In view of the conclusions reached above about the bank statement, I have real doubts about whether this asserted tax liability can be genuine and those doubts are enhanced by the fact that in an earlier document, I think annexed to his Form E, this tax debt was said by the husband to relate to &#8220;</span><span class="within-new" style="font-style:italic;color:initial">unpaid discretionary capital gains tax for tax years 2005 to 2009</span><span class="within-new" style="color:initial">&#8221;.

I propose therefore to adjourn the wife&#8217;s capital claims generally with liberty to restore, provided that any application to restore must be issued before 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> August 2032, failing which they will stand dismissed. I propose alongside this to adjourn the question of the costs of these proceedings on the same terms.

I formed the clear impression that the husband was down-playing his ability to earn income and I think that it is a reasonable proposition for me to say that, given a nine month period to get back to remunerative employment, the husband could be reasonably expected to earn enough to make of contribution of &#163;5,000 per month to the wife and children. I have fixed this at nine months (rather than, for example, six months) because it may take that sort of time for him to re-establish himself in the sort of Chief Technical Officer-type role  which would enable him to earn a salary more like &#163;300,000 per annum. Of course if there was clear and compelling evidence of a salary at a much lower level then a variation application might have to follow, but the husband&#8217;s record suggests that this is his earning capacity. Whilst I could make some sort of apportionment between the wife and children, my preference is to make an order for spousal periodical payments. If a CMS application was ever made (and at the moment it could not be because the husband is not living in this jurisdiction) then I would expect any CMS figure to be subsumed into the total figure of &#163;5,000 per month; but (to be clear) this is in part intended in practice to be to enable the wife to house and care for the children. If they did in due course become independent then there might have to be a re-assessment. Taking into account the provisions of Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, section 25A, I take the view that the proper order is to make is this an extendable term order. The first payment will be due on 1</span><span class="within-new" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:initial">st</span><span class="within-new" style="color:initial"> May 2023 and the final payment will be due on 1</span><span class="within-new" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:initial">st</span><span class="within-new" style="color:initial"> August 2032 (unless it has been varied or discharged in the meantime).

This order will be subject to CPI upgrading on 1</span><span class="within-new" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:initial">st</span><span class="within-new" style="color:initial"> May 2024 and each anniversary thereafter.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">One reason for my wishing to have this judgment published is that I wish to draw wider attention to the ability of dishonest parties to manufacture bank statements (and other documents) which, for all practical purposes, look genuine, but which are in reality not in that category. This has occurred in the present case and the wife has significantly suffered as a result of it and it is important for litigants, practitioners and judges to be aware of the issue. May I draw the reader&#8217;s attention to an article in the Financial Remedies Journal: <span style="font-style:italic">Dodgy Digital Documents: Where are we now? Where are we going?</span> by Helen Brander [2022] 2 FRJ 139 which gives a full description of the existence of this issue.</p>
