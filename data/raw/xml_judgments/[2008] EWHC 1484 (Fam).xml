However, in the days before the commencement of this hearing she took a brave and courageous decision, which is greatly to her credit, that she will not oppose the making of the orders sought in respect of the two children.  She is concerned about the level of her contact to the children, and that has been an issue before me, and one which I shall have to decide.</p>

I have no doubt that it is in the best interest of both children that I do so.  Both Mr F and Mr K have expressed their gratitude to the mother for her decision.  There are remaining issues to be resolved between the fathers and the mother, but those issues and concerns should not detract from the mother&#8217;s courage in reaching what must have been a very difficult emotional decision.  I know that she loves her children very much, wishes the best for them, and her very decision causes her distress.</p>

That will be long-term homes and not ones which should be disrupted without very good cause.  It will be very important after this hearing for the long-term nature of the placements to be impressed upon the children.  They are not intended to be short term, or something which can be altered in the near future or in a couple of years or at the mother&#8217;s whim.  It is a serious commitment by their respective fathers, it is long-term, and that I have specifically sanctioned the long-term nature of the Orders.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother in part came to her decision not to oppose the placements with their respective fathers, because since 21 December 2007 the children have been residing with their fathers, and have begun to settle in their new homes.  She also in part came to that decision so that she could concentrate all her efforts in respect of obtaining a further assessment of herself and her parenting capacity as a single carer for L.  It is very much her wish to recover the care of L who since 21 December 2007 has been cared for by a foster carer, whilst having very regular and generous contact on almost a daily basis.  She earnestly opposes the Local Authority&#8217;s care plan and application for a Placement Order.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Local Authority base its case against the mother resuming care of any of her children, L in particular, because it is the belief of the social workers that the mother has not fully and for ever separated from her husband, and L&#8217;s father, whom I shall refer to as the father, and that any apparent separation is a fiction (my word) and once the proceedings are concluded and L recovered, the parents will continue their relationship.  The Guardian also shares this belief.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_14">
	  <num>14.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is also said that the mother&#8217;s parenting style is such that she cannot emotionally parent L adequately or sufficiently once L ceases to be a toddler; that I need only look at the history of concerns raised by the emotional difficulties encountered in the past by D and D.  It is said that such are the concerns L would be at risk of significant emotional harm if she were to be placed permanently with her mother.  In any event work with the mother is necessary to improve her parenting style with D and D; that this will take some time.  The mother seeks an assessment and assistance in her emotional parenting style of L to enable her to care for L long term.  The Local Authority and Guardian are of the opinion that even if the mother were to be able to change and improve her parenting, and of that there is doubt; such changes would not be within L&#8217;s own timescale.  She is now 15 months old and the window of opportunity for a good transition into an adoptive placement is limited and reducing.  L cannot wait to see if her mother can change sufficiently and thus time is not on the mother&#8217;s side.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I heard from Dr Tully and Dr Eyres concerning any possible assessment and type of help the mother could be offered to improve her parenting style.  They were not in total agreement in terms of the assistance required, but they both firmly stated that such assessment and work should not be embarked upon unless the Court was satisfied that there had been a total and forever separation by the mother from L&#8217;s father, and she understood and accepted the reasons and the necessity for that separation.  The Local Authority and the Guardian are also of that opinion.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 21 December 2007 Mr Justice Moylan, after a lengthy contested hearing, held that L&#8217;s father had seriously sexually assaulted his own son when he was about 6, and two nephews when they were teenagers.  The Learned Judge described him as &#8220;a very sexually dysfunctional man.  It means there exists a real likelihood of significant harm to all three children, whether boys or girls, regardless of age, unless or until there is other evidence in the way of psychological or other reports that demonstrates the contrary or demonstrates the level of risk;  he must be taken as a man who presents a risk of significant harm to children&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Tully who assessed the father and reported said of him, &#8220;he isn&#8217;t co-operating in a full open assessment process.  He appears a periodic opportunist and even reckless offender who may try not to offend over long periods but can give no confidence to himself or others as to whether any occasion in the future might not be an occasion where a serious offence could occur.  Untreated, he remains a dangerous risk although there is a potential his risk could be reduced if he were to be open and available for treatment.  There seems to be little real prospect of either just now&#8221;.  &#8220;The risk he poses to the mother&#8217;s children is significant and serious&#8221;.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;I have no doubt that the mother seeks to do her best for the children.  I note the social workers comment that the mother&#8217;s failure to engage and/or fully co-operate with the Local Authority was not in issue until December 2006.  However, she has shown a complete refusal and transparent unwillingness even to consider that the father might be a risk to the children.  This has led her not to co-operate with social services as much as she did previously, and has allowed her to act in a way which I can only describe as being extraordinarily irresponsible, and showing a marked inability to think through the consequences of her actions both for herself but more particularly for the children&#8221;.  </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;I am of course referring to her flagrant breaches of the orders made by Hogg J.  She had given no thought to the consequences of acting in breach of these orders, in particular that it could well lead to the children being removed from her care.  This appeared not even to have featured in her decision to permit contact.  She also seemed unwilling or unable to see what effect this could have on the children.  They knew they were not supposed to have unsupervised contact with the father, so they either had to lie about it or keep it secret.  The contact supervisor who wrote that the greeting felt rehearsed was being insightful.  D&#8217;s greeting &#8220;Haven&#8217;t seen you for ages&#8221; was, as I have said pure theatre.  I would hope that the mother will not be able to see how damaging this is for the young and vulnerable children&#8221;.</p>

It was apparent from their evidence that they had not discussed, given no thought at all to the likely consequence of what they were doing, and they had given no thought at all to the consequences for the children of being involved in contact which the children knew was in breach of an order.

Mr F was unaware of the contact; the social workers while suspicious were not appraised of it.  The mother maintained the secrecy as did D, and thus more emotional harm can be laid at the mother&#8217;s door notwithstanding the very clear findings and reasoning of Mr Justice Moylan.  In my view another example of the mother putting her needs first, and not considering the consequences or impact on her daughter.</p>

When challenged that his mother in January had told the social workers that the breaches were more frequent and included visiting her (his mother&#8217;s) home and staying overnight she denied it, and said the breaches only took place in the public house.  The father also denied what his own mother had said.  I do not accept their joint denial.  The grandmother had no reason to elaborate the unauthorised contact;  it would not have been in her, or the father or mother&#8217;s interest to do so.  In my view the parents lied about this.  It is indicative of their approach to minimise their wrongdoing, and only &#8220;own up&#8221; when there is firm evidence against them.  Even now when the mother is keen to reassure the Court that she can be relied upon to co-operate with the Local Authority and adhere to orders and advice, she cannot bring herself to be open about the past.</p>

Mr Justice Moylan said the father was manipulative and had influence over the mother.  I agree with that assessment.

Her professed anger was not apparent; and this is a mother who has anger management difficulties.  She had little or no sense of the horror and harm he had caused his victims or the risks he posed to her children.  Without that sense she cannot protect them.  In my view there is a risk that after these proceedings she could reunite with the father.

The children need to be told they are to stay with their fathers, an explanation needs to be given. &#8220;Settling down&#8221; may not be the correct term, an adjustment period may be most apposite.  The children need to adjust to the new and long-term situation.  They will need some time, as the Guardian said a &#8216;breather&#8217; from the litigation and pressure of the proceedings.
