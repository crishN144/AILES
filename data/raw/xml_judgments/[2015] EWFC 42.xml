	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the heart of this dispute lies the future of three young children, aged 6, 4 and 3, whose young mother has learning disabilities, and is acknowledged by the Official Solicitor, her litigation friend, not to be in a position to care for any of them.  They are all currently together in foster care, and the Local Authority seeks their permanent placement for adoption, albeit split as a sibling group and placed in two separate homes.  The mother has a fourth child, born only within the last few weeks, who is the subject of separate public law proceedings.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The three children with whom I am concerned have different fathers; the father of the oldest child is unidentified, the father of the middle child has not seen her for many months and does not seek the return of his daughter, and the father of the youngest child was until recently in custody serving a prison term for sexual offences against his own step-daughter.  The children are second generation of a family (on the maternal side) of asylum seekers from Somalia, and have lived in England a considerable distance from their extended family. The oldest child (aged 6) has a degree of developmental delay.  The mother&#8217;s younger sister (maternal aunt to the children) seeks the full-time care of the oldest two, but not the youngest of the, children.  The youngest child is mixed race.  Those are just some of the factual complexities of the case.  </p>

The aunt&#8217;s lawyers did not apparently explore the implications of this condition before the hearing began.  The extent of her significant visual disability was astonishingly only revealed at the conclusion of her oral evidence, and only when I asked to describe it (she had obviously been struggling to read from the documents presented to her while giving evidence); this led to a short adjournment during the hearing to obtain necessary expert medical evidence;</p>

The mother has significant communication difficulties, both with understanding and using language; this is likely to be attributable in part to her learning disability, and in part to acquiring English as a second language.</p>

Ms Jones was regrettably unable to attend the final hearing, and the intermediary service was therefore provided by Ms Fletcher, who performed her role with great skill and discretion. Ground rules had been set by HHJ Hudson at the IRH; these were re-visited at the outset of the hearing.  Specific ground rules were set for the mother&#8217;s evidence, which we all endeavoured conscientiously to observe.</p>

The mother has one older brother (AbM) who is aged 28; he has a history of serious criminal offending, for offences involving drugs and serious violence.

She was assessed in July 2008 (as part of an early parenting assessment with her then baby daughter HY) as functioning in the learning disability range with an IQ of 61.  The accuracy of that assessment may be affected to some degree by the fact that it was conducted in the mother&#8217;s second language (English); she is said to have a complicated communication profile due to her educational, cultural and language learning background.  Consistent with the required approach under the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref></span>, more recent psychiatric evidence has considered separately the discrete issues arising for consideration in these proceedings, and points to the following:</p>

By that time she had met AM, who facilitated her move to Newcastle (where he lived).  HY was born three months after her arrival.  AM&#8217;s name was recorded on HY&#8217;s birth certificate as HY&#8217;s father, though as the history indicates, and it is now confirmed (by DNA testing), he is not in fact HY&#8217;s father.  The relationship between the mother and AM was said to be occasionally violent, and on at least one occasion it is agreed the police were called to the family home.   The mother and AM married in October 2009 and divorced in 2012.  HA had in the meantime been born into that relationship (September 2010).</p>

JR was at that time on licence following his release from prison where he was serving an 8-year sentence for offences of sexual activity with his 10 year old step-daughter; he has an extensive criminal record including convictions for sexual offences, offences of dishonesty and violence.   The mother became pregnant by him, and in due course gave birth to TY.  In early 2012, numerous social work referrals identified the mother as vulnerable and socially isolated. In October 2012, the police were called to a domestic abuse incident at the home, and there located JR; as a consequence of this, in November 2012, JR was recalled to prison for breaching his licence requirement by forming this relationship with the mother.  Later that month, the children were all made the subject of a child protection plan.    The mother was warned that JR was an unsuitable person to be around her two children.  She ignored that warning, maintaining contact with him while he was in prison.  In January 2013, a pre-proceedings letter was sent to the mother and AM; in February 2013, pre-proceedings meetings were held with the mother and AM.  Both were legally represented.</p>

In June 2013, HY told her nursery worker that she did not want to go home as her mother had hurt HA, and had hit her.  In July 2013, HA told her nursery staff that she did not want to go home to her mother; some days later she presented with physical signs consistent with sexual abuse, although medical examination revealed no abnormal findings.  On 15 July 2013, the mother told a core group meeting that she had begun a new relationship with DR (following JR&#8217;s incarceration), and that she knew he had a historical sex offence.  In fact, DR too was on licence following release from prison following his 6 year sentence for offence of rape of a 15 year old female, and had also been convicted of breach of a non-molestation order in relation to a previous partner.  Given the high levels of concern about this relationship and the mother&#8217;s capacity to protect her children, she was asked to give her consent to accommodation of the children.  She did so on 18 July 2013.</p>

When the children were accommodated by the Local Authority initially they were placed separately, but by August 2013 they were brought into a single placement.  In November 2013, the children moved placement and have now been in the current foster placement for nearly 18 months.  The Local Authority by the first social worker (who I shall refer to as &#8216;SWA&#8217;) undertook an assessment of the mother between July and October 2013.  It concluded that the mother would not be able to offer safe or consistent parenting for the children; a significant question was raised about the capacity of the mother (I return to this below).  In January 2014, a new social worker (SWD) was appointed.  Viability assessments of the maternal grandparents were conducted, and were positive; further assessment of them (finalised in the summer of 2014) were negative.  </p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">I am satisfied that in 2004 the mother was taken to Somalia by her own mother and left there because she was increasingly troublesome to her parents in London.  This was not a punishment as such, nor was it done to &#8216;teach her a lesson&#8217; (as the mother herself maintains).  The frustrations which the mother presented to her family by her learning disability and her increasingly defiant attitude were challenging to the maternal grandparents, and this was an expedient way of addressing (and despatching) an increasingly difficult problem.  While there is some evidence that having moved to London the mother had wanted to return to live in Somalia (see Dr. Thorpe&#8217;s first report), I do not accept (as the maternal grandmother sought to persuade me) that the mother suddenly expressed a wish to remain in Somalia at the end of the holiday (&#8220;she liked the place and said she wanted to stay&#8221; said the maternal grandmother when cross-examined by Ms Moulder), any more than I accept that the grandmother would have simply allowed the mother to stay there if she <span style="font-style:italic">had</span> expressed such a wish, given her intellectual limitations.  The grandparents could point to no plan nor purpose for the mother&#8217;s extended stay, nor could they show any ostensible benefit to the mother of her doing so; no consideration was given to the impact on the rest of the family from the mother&#8217;s sudden and prolonged disappearance.  The family had fled Somalia not long previously, and the country was still being ravaged by civil war; Somalia was still then a relatively dangerous place to live.  The maternal grandmother and maternal grandfather offered inconsistent accounts as to how the grandfather was apparently informed that the mother was to be staying in Somalia; these inconsistencies are an indicator that I was not being told the truth about the plan for her to remain. That the grandparents held a &#8216;welcome home&#8217; party on her return does not detract from the conclusions I have reached about the circumstances in which she was left there.</p>

SM was adamant (in cross-examination) that the maternal grandmother had &#8220;never ever slapped&#8221; the mother; it is possible that SM never saw the occasions when this happened (she may have been at school).

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">One final point.  During the assessments, extended family members were asked about the possibility that the mother had been subject to &#8216;honour based violence&#8217;; they disputed this. The phrase appears in the schedule of proposed findings, and has percolated into the witness statements describing the mother&#8217;s experiences.  As I indicated in exchanges with counsel during submissions, I have misgivings about the use of the phrase &#8216;honour-based violence&#8217; in this case to describe the alleged abuse.  I am far from sure that it is necessary or helpful to label the alleged abusive conduct of the maternal grandparents in this (or indeed any) way; indeed, asking the family about abuse in this way may have affected their responses.  &#8216;Honour-based violence&#8217; is often used to describe abusive practices, which are used to control behaviour within families or other social groups to protect perceived cultural and religious beliefs and/or honour. Such violence can occur when perpetrators perceive that a relative has shamed the family and/or community by breaking their honour code (see CPS Guidance).   As Wall P said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B-M </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2009/205" uk:canonical="[2009] EWCA Civ 205" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] EWCA Civ 205</ref> the actions of those who perpetrated crime in pursuit of some purported cultural objective should not be dignified with the term &#8216;honour&#8217;; &#8220;they have nothing to do with any concept of honour known to English law&#8221; (para.117). </p>

I have little doubt that the relationship was occasionally volatile; I note that the police were called on at least one occasion in January 2009 (possibly earlier also in December 2008).  I am not able to conclude that AM had in fact been violent towards the mother, and the police report refers to a verbal altercation; it is just as likely that she had invented or exaggerated his conduct for attention.  Reports of the alleged incident in 2011 contain unattributed references to the mother being hit; the evidence is insufficient on which I can properly make a finding of fact, and I decline to do so.</p>

The complexity of the case was tentatively offered as an explanation for the delay of a further six months before the issue of proceedings, but he accepted in evidence (rightly, in my view) that the level of complexity was the very reason why proceedings should have been commenced much sooner.

On one level it would have made more sense for the grandparents to care for their grandchildren (with support from SM).  When the full assessment of the grandparents was negative, SM did not delay in advancing her own case to care for her nieces; she is able to acknowledge now that there may have been difficulties in her parents caring for the children.  As for [62](iii) above, while she has not lived independently, she has assumed many of the practical and administrative tasks of running her parents&#8217; financial and other affairs, budgeting, and paying their bills.

Since that time, SM has sought to address some of the concerns raised in the reports, and has filed evidence which outlines her endeavours.  Mrs Fournel had read that material before she gave oral evidence at the final hearing. From the witness box her view had shifted; her final recommendation to the court was that the girls should be placed with SM after all.  She told me &#8220;there is a lot of me which goes with the family placement &#8230; children do better with their birth families&#8221;.  Later she added &#8220;I am moving more towards family placement&#8221; &#8230; &#8220;the more I have understood her better, the more I think she can do it&#8221; but cannot do it without support.  Mrs Fournel considered that SM has &#8220;quite a lot of insight&#8221;, &#8220;is quite capable&#8221;, considered that she &#8220;welcomes support in whatever form&#8221;.</p>

In 2008, the mother complained of SM harassing her; in 2010, there was an occasion when they argued in the home to such a pitch that the police were called.  There have been long gaps when the sisters have had no meaningful contact (April 2012-July 2013).  On at least one occasion (June 2013), the mother has reported SM to the police for &#8216;harassing her&#8217;; she has in the past accused SM of attacking her.  She has spoken of a lack of trust in SM, because SM passes all information back to the maternal grandmother.  The mother&#8217;s support for her sister&#8217;s application to care for HY and HA is only relatively recent; this change of heart may mask a deeper ambivalence about this outcome.</p>

Mrs Fournel raised in her written report that SM suffers from a rare eye condition called keratoconus, a degenerative disorder of the eye. There was no medical evidence filed.  At the conclusion of the advocates&#8217; questions I asked SM about this (no one else had).  She went on to describe extraordinarily impaired vision for which she had no corrective lenses (glasses or contact lenses).  She told me that when she looked at me, sitting not more than 6 feet from the witness box, I was little more than a blur; she said that she cannot see small objects on a table, and would not be able to detect a glass-paned door.  She told me that she had been so sight-impaired for two or more years, and was waiting for assessment or treatment.  I was frankly astonished that neither her solicitors nor her counsel had picked this up, or if they had, had failed to bring it to the attention of the court. I am not for one moment indicating that sight-impairment is an insuperable impediment to parenting (see my comments about this in <span style="font-style:italic">RCW v A Local Authority </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/235" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 235 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 235 (Fam)</ref>, for instance), but the case being advanced by SM and the Guardian was that SM would assume the care of these boisterous children in the next few weeks, when in reality, she would have little chance to see their activities unless they were extremely close at hand.  A short adjournment following the conclusion of the evidence allowed SM&#8217;s treating senior optometrist at Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, Mr B Rughani, to prepare a report which revealed the following encouraging information:</p>

This may only be part-time work.  In acceding to her application to care for her nieces, I urge SM to exercise considerable caution about this.  It will take a considerable time for HY and HA to settle with their aunt; the transferring of attachments will take months or years, not days or weeks.  SM has to prioritise their needs, and not subordinate them to her desire to forge her own career.</p>
