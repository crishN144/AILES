	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">This matter concerns the applicant father&#8217;s application challenging an arbitral award made on 12 August 2022 (&#8220;the award&#8221;) (&#8220;the first application&#8221;). The award concerned provision for the parties&#8217; two young children pursuant to Schedule 1 of the Children Act 1989.  The grounds of challenge are, broadly, that the arbitrator (and the court) had/has no power to make an award requiring the applicant to borrow money by way of a mortgage on a joint purchase with the respondent mother and that the award was wrong and unfair in that it failed, in various ways, to take into account the applicant&#8217;s own needs, his reducing income and his ability to meet the award. </span></p>

The applicant has made a second application seeking permission to adduce further evidence which, he says, establishes both that the arbitrator was wrong in the award he made but also that, in the light of subsequent events, to make the award an order of the court would be unfair. Further, says the applicant, having admitted the additional evidence, I should deal with both the applications together.  This would require directions permitting the respondent to lodge evidence in reply and require a hearing of 3 days.</span></p>

Alternatively, says the respondent, I should deal with the first application first, which would take a day, and only go on to consider the question of fairness in light of subsequent events thereafter, if necessary.  The respondent also seeks, again, for the matter to be allocated to a full High Court Judge.</span></p>

A very significant change of circumstances may render it unjust or unfair to make the arbitral award an order of the court. If a change of circumstances is relied upon, that could only be established by admitting evidence of the change. I would put the test as being is the further evidence necessary to deal with the case justly?  Plainly, the additional evidence will be neither useful nor necessary if it does not, on its face, establish a relevant, significant change of circumstances which is likely to be long lasting and is likely to have an effect on the award.  A small, short term blip in a party&#8217;s finances is unlikely to be sufficient.</span></p>

This is because the funds under AB&#8217;s management have reduced to $242 million, below the break-even level of $290 million, which means no management or performance fees are payable to him.  This compares with net earnings of &#163;438,000 in y/e 2019, &#163;220,000 net in y/e 2020, &#163;367,000 net in y/e 2021 and &#163;448,000 net in y/e 2022.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">At the time of the arbitration, the funds under management were $394 million, down from a high of $851 million in 2019 and at its lowest level since 2017.  The arbitrator was subsequently informed of a further withdrawal of $44 million prior to the date of the award, but decided that he would not take that into account and determined that, on the basis of other financial storms weathered by AB in earlier years, it was likely that the fund would recover and he was more concerned with the applicant&#8217;s earning capacity than with his actual current earnings.  He set the applicant&#8217;s earning capacity at &#163;410,000 per annum gross and &#163;223,000 net, while finding that his actual gross income would be &#163;273,000 for the current financial year and &#163;150,000 net for 2023/2024 on current performance of the fund. Management/performance fees are paid in the financial year following that in which they are earned.  This equates to &#163;152,000 and &#163;89,000 net for each year respectively.  The additional evidence suggests that the arbitrator&#8217;s expectations were wrong and that the fund is considering winding itself up. A further change in circumstances is the change in mortgage interest rates which have nearly doubled in the interval since the award.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The respondent submitted that the additional evidence was not truly new in that the issue of a reduction in the fund was argued before the arbitrator and the $44 million reduction in the fund brought to his attention.  This is correct, as far as it goes.  However, the additional evidence suggests that, far from recovering, AB&#8217;s fund dropped significantly below its break-even level.  If the arbitrator had been aware of that, there is a real prospect that his award would have been very different.  On 12 August 2022, no-one could have foretold the effects on the financial markets and borrowing rates of the events of September 2022.  These two factors alone might render the award unfair.  I note what is said about the applicant&#8217;s poor disclosure and his lack of frankness about CD being a resource available to him; however, neither of those matters goes to the level of his income from AB or mortgage interest rates.  Nor does the award suggest that this resource would sufficiently offset the change in income from AB.  I agree that the amount spent on costs is eyewatering. Unfortunately, there is nothing the court can do to restore the funds spent on lawyers: that money is gone.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The additional evidence put forward by the applicant appears to be credible.  It is consistent with the reduction in the capital fund managed by AB as at the arbitration and with the further reduction of $44 million, before the date of the award. The arbitrator accepted that the applicant&#8217;s income from AB on a fund of $290 million would be limited to monthly drawings and even that would be at risk. If the additional evidence comes up to proof, it seems to me that to make the arbitral award an order of the court could be unjust and unfair. The unfairness would be amplified by the sharp increase in interest rates, which were largely, if not entirely, unforeseeable at the time of the award, which would render the proposed new mortgage unaffordable and, possibly, unachievable.  For these reasons, in my judgment, the additional evidence should be admitted.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">This has an inevitable impact on the length of the hearing. In my view both the appeal and the question of the fairness of the award in the light of the additional evidence should be considered at the same hearing.  Any other approach would cause excessive delay and would not be proportionate.  Whatever the merits of the other grounds of appeal, there is a very real issue over an order compelling the applicant to borrow money by way of a mortgage in order to house the children and the respondent.  If that ground is successful, a review of the whole award will be necessary.  The parties need an end to this litigation and the best way of achieving that is to ensure that all matters are dealt with at the same time. However, it does not seem to me that a time estimate of 3 days is necessary.  The matters on which the applicant seeks to rely in relation to a change of circumstances do not seem to me to require oral evidence.  The state of the AB fund and its prospects can be established by documentation from its Chief Operating Officer, as before the arbitrator.  Mortgage interest rates may also be reasonably established by documentary evidence.  The appeal itself does not require oral evidence.  If the parties comply with the practice direction on bundles, and I require them to do so, a time estimate of 2 days should be sufficient.</span></p>

If the applicant does not agree to this, I do not see why I cannot make an order against him.  I also see no reason why the applicant should not be required to set out what order it is that he wants this court to make so that the issues may be narrowed.  Other matters such as payment of the costs awarded by the arbitrator against the applicant (&#163;1,500), arrears of child maintenance, albeit voluntary (&#163;7,500) and on-going child maintenance were not addressed before me because there was inadequate time in light of the applicant&#8217;s second application.  I would be prepared to deal with them, and the issue of whether the appeal should be heard in public, on paper or, if it would be more cost effective for the parties, at a short hearing.  I should note however, that the issue of child maintenance and its enforcement is a matter for the CMS.  Any challenges must be made to the appropriate tribunal and not this court.</span></p>
