	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">I heard oral evidence yesterday from Dr Annette Hughes in relation to determining whether or not TP has capacity to make decisions or conduct this litigation.  I have also had regard to the written documentation provided by Dr M (TP&#8217;s GP), and Michael Beck, a social worker who was asked to complete an assessment in relation to a request for a standard authorisation.</p>

He expressed the belief that TP does not have the capacity to manage her own finances.  He referred to TP&#8217;s learning disability which he emphasised had not been formally diagnosed at that stage.  Michael Beck in his report dated 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2016 considered TP lacked capacity to make decisions in relation to her accommodation in the care home where she is placed or in relation to her care or treatment.</p>

The interim declarations have continued to date and have further included a declaration that TP lacks capacity to make decisions about where she should reside.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The local authority did not seek to question Dr Hughes, but Ms Gardner on behalf of TP asked relevant questions in relation to the conclusions which Dr Hughes expressed in her reports.  Dr Hughes prepared six reports dealing with various aspects of TP&#8217;s abilities.  Dr Hughes has seen TP on seven occasions between 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2016 and 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2016.  Three of her reports are prepared in respect of assessment of capacity.  Three of her reports are to comment upon best interests.  Thus, Dr Hughes has had the opportunity to meet, talk to, and assess TP over a period of six months and has been able to form an overview of both TP&#8217;s capabilities and needs from observation over a significant period of time.  The court has been able to receive a professional view from someone whom I am satisfied has come to know TP, in Mr McCormack&#8217;s words, &#8220;pretty well.&#8221;</p>

That would be to put the cart before the horse or, expressed another way, to allow the tail of welfare to wag the dog of capacity.  Any tendency in this direction risks infringing the rights of that group of persons who, though vulnerable, are capable of making their own decisions.  Many who suffer from mental illness are well able to make decisions about their medical treatment, and it is important not to make unjustified assumptions to the contrary.&#8221;</p>

That, in those circumstances, the temptation to conflate a capacity assessment with a best interests assessment must be a live risk and also when a clinician has worked with the patient, TP, and there is a good professional relationship, there must be also a risk as set out at paragraph 39 in the <span style="font-style:italic">King&#8217;s College</span> case where MacDonald J stated:</p>

Dr Hughes stated that in her professional opinion, it was most likely that the learning disability was linked to the cerebral palsy which TP had since birth.  TP herself told Dr Hughes that she was born with cerebral palsy and Dr Hughes concluded in her report:</p>

However, that TP came towards the severe end of the spectrum of mild disability.  Dr Hughes carried out a range of tests, but because of TP&#8217;s physical disability she could not obtain a full IQ score.  However, using the British Picture Vocabulary scale, which measures single word understanding by using pictures, TP achieved an age equivalent score of 5 years 3 months.  The results were in the range that Dr Hughes expected.  There was not a disparity between the clinical picture and the testing result.</p>

Dr Hughes expressed the view that it was quite surprising but that she thought TP had been well brought up by loving parents and supported by parents in using and accessing words.  This would seem to fit the picture of what is known about TP&#8217;s history and background.  Dr Hughes emphasised, however, that there were gaps in TP&#8217;s understanding.  The Wechsler adult intelligence scale was also used in testing.  However, only two of the four index scores were tested, namely the verbal comprehension subtest in the short term and the short-term memory subtest.  The verbal comprehension score was 58, well into the learning disability range and broadly consistent with the clinical picture.  The short term working memory test provided a slightly better score at 63 but not, Dr Hughes said, dramatically so.  She referred to TP&#8217;s slight relative ability to remember which may make people think that she has understood when, in fact, she has not.</p>

Dr Hughes did not see any change or difference over the period of time to lead her to question the results which she had obtained.  Dr Hughes told me that she was curious to see if TP would grow and develop in the care home setting and curious to see TP alone without the domination of FW and his presence, but Dr Hughes told me that TP&#8217;s intellectual cognitive function was not changed by reason of her being apart from FW over the period of time.  </p>

TP said that if she could not go back to FW, she would want to stay at X care home.  She said that she likes the staff and would not want to move somewhere else despite my explanations that she would not have to live with individuals with dementia that in a smaller house she would likely be able to spend more time with staff.  At the end of the session, TP showed me to the door and on the way, I was pleased to see warm interactions between her and the other residents and staff.  She and a member of staff showed me pictures of recent activities she had been doing in the home and spoke of how she enjoyed watching television in the evening, holding on to this female member of staff&#8217;s hand.&#8221;</p>

The evidence therefore provided by Dr Hughes is that TP is unable to weigh information in that the information she understands is that which she has experienced and to project forward to a different reality is where and when TP&#8217;s understanding falls down.

When asked the specific question of whether TP was able to weigh up the positives and negatives, Dr Hughes expressed the view that TP was not able to do so and that TP&#8217;s looking at and considerations of the positives was very superficial.  Dr Hughes told me that as far as looking at the positives are concerned FW buys her perfume, he cooks for her, but TP is not able to consider the full force of the relationship or potential impact the relationship could have upon her if she was not attending appointments, nor could she understand the nature of the financial situation in which she had been placed and that TP considers everything in concrete terms.  </p>

Dr Hughes told me that when someone is not there with TP, she really struggles to think about whether she wants to see them and their role in her life.  Her relationship and contact with KS is illustrative of this point.  TP had told people that FW was not nice to her, indeed assaulted her, but not having seen FW for some time was able, when asked, to say, &#8220;AS is all right, really.
