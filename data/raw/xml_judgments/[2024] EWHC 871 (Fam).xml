The parties married in September 2011. N was born in Ukraine. He has lived there save for a period from February 2022 to March 2023. Since December 2023, he has been with the mother in the north of England. In February 2022, upon Russia continuing its attack from eastern to central Ukraine, the parties decided that the mother and N should leave Ukraine and seek refuge elsewhere. The father, being of conscription age, was unable to leave. In February 2022, the mother and N travelled to a third country. In around July 2022, the mother and N travelled to England under the &#8216;Homes for Ukraine scheme&#8217;. They lived with a host family in the north of England. In October 2022, the mother and N travelled to Ukraine to visit the father. They spent a week there. At some stage the mother formed a new relationship in England. The father states that the parties agreed that N would finish his academic year in England in July 2023, before returning to Ukraine to live. On 5 March 2023, the day before travelling to Ukraine to visit the father with N, the mother informed the father that she wanted a divorce. The mother informed N of her decision on that day.  N was upset by the mother&#8217;s decision and her new relationship.  On 6 March 2023, the mother and N travelled to Ukraine. The mother chose to rent a flat nearby whilst N stayed with his father. On 2 April 2023, the mother returned to England. N studied for and sat an exam in June 2023 for admission to his local school. He was admitted to the school. He is proud of that.</span></p>

Within the context of this tension between the need to evaluate the evidence against the civil standard of proof and the summary nature of the proceedings, the Supreme Court further made clear that the approach to be adopted in respect of the harm defence is not one that demands the court engage in a fact-finding exercise to determine the veracity of the matters alleged as grounding the defence under Art 13(b).

Although I make clear I am considering them holistically and together and I have not considered them in a siloed or linear fashion. I am not persuaded that N&#8217;s separation from his mother would place him in an intolerable position or would otherwise involve a grave risk of harm. The Cafcass evidence is entirely clear he wishes to live with his father in Ukraine. He wants to go to the grammar school in  X Town in respect of which he emphasis how hard he worked to pass the entrance test and observes himself the sacrifices he made in 2023 to pass this important test he had set himself. He misses his football team and he misses his dog. After returning to X Town in March 2023, he has been settled and happy and his main carer was his father. He was not living with his mother. Apart from a period of some weeks where he refused to speak with his mother, he had regular contact with her. I have no doubt I can and should place considerable weight on N&#8217;s ascertainable wishes and feelings. He is an angry young man. He is directing much of his anger at his mother, but it seems very likely he is upset arising out of the circumstances in which a war of aggression has &#8216;upended&#8217; his life and led to him having had to leave his country. In addition this young person has also had to deal, at a sensitive age,  with his parents&#8217; separation and divorce. He may blame some of the latter on the former, I am not sure. It may take some time for N to work through his anguish and upset. This is largely all part of the consequences of the war being fought in Ukraine. </span></p>

The parents largely successfully co-parented N after it was clear they were separated and divorcing between March and December 2023. N lived with his father and for most of the period and had regular contact with his mother, when his anger towards her subsided. The father gave evidence they undertook activities as a family.

Do either or both of these amount to a grave risk of harm to N or intolerability? It is helpful to consider first physical harm in X Town as that helps to set the context for the assessment of psychological harm. I adopt the approach of Williams J set out above and am considering return not to Ukraine as a whole but a return to X Town. Risk of physical harm must be considered, depending upon where N would reside, until such time as the Ukrainian courts make long term welfare decisions for him. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In my judgement there are risks to N of residing, even for a short period until the Ukrainian courts resolve matters, in X Town. I am not able to go further than to say there is a low risk of very serious harm, including death.  103 homicides took place in Greater London in 2023 with its vast population.  7 people were killed by Russian aggression out of a population of 30, 000 since February 2022 in X Town. It would be improper to asses risk by carrying out mathematical comparisons and that is not how I assess the risk to N. If N were returned to X Town, I do not know what the statistical risk of death or injury to him as a result of Russian aggression would be. I do not know how that compares with misadventure elsewhere, for example, in England. I am however, clear that X Town is close to Kyiv. Experienced judges assessing risks at different times for different children have been concerned about the risks in the Ukrainian capital. I am particularly concerned about C Facility and the extent to which it may become a target for a Russian missile or air strike. I accept the FCDO assessment of the risks from missiles and drones and falling debris. I also accept it is likely the Russian armed forces may target civilian infrastructure of importance to the Ukrainian war effort. Having considered the evidence as best I can, I conclude that returning N to X Town would place him at low risk of being a civilian casualty or fatality of a Russian air strike on X Town or one that poorly targets the C Facility. In my judgement this amounts to a grave risk of harm. As MacDonald J sets out, &#8216;grave&#8217; applies to the risk, but there is a common sense read across to the harm envisaged by the Convention as well. Whilst the risk is low, the seriousness of the harm is very grave. The court cannot allow N, a child, to return to those low risks. No child should be expected to tolerate a low risk of being put in harm&#8217;s way by being maimed or killed by a stray missile or drone. It is no answer to this application to observe many Ukrainian children run that risk every day. I am focused on N, who is currently in England. </span></p>

What has been influential in my analysis of risk is the 11 April 2024 air strike on the energy plant south of Kyiv. It has reinforced the risks of living near the C Facility in X Town. The father&#8217;s evidence was not presented in the knowledge of this attack. His solicitor made the briefest of written submissions in a short timescale following the 11 April 2024 attack. The father needs to absorb that, and this judgment. He has given evidence he will give an undertaking to relocate if the war escalates near X Town. The court is being asked to return N to Ukraine for the purposes of permitting the Ukrainian courts to determine his long term welfare. As Williams J made clear the assessment of Article 13 (b) risk is specific to the area within Ukraine where the child is being returned. </span></p>
