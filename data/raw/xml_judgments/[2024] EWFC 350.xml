This applies both to harm which has already taken place (<span style="font-weight:bold">Re M <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1994] 2 FLR 577" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1994">[1994] 2 FLR 577</ref></span>) and to the likelihood of harm in the future (<span style="font-weight:bold">Southwark LBC v B <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1998] 2 FLR 1095" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">[1998] 2 FLR 1095</ref>).</span> This is entirely logical; if it cannot be shown at the relevant date that a child is suffering, or likely to suffer, significant harm, then there is no basis for the application and no justification for state interference. </p>

In my judgment there is no such temporal condition. The reference in <span style="font-weight:bold">Re D (supra) </span>to the court not having jurisdiction in respect of an unborn baby was not a statement that the court cannot take account of acts or omissions of the care giver parent before the birth of the child. The court may not have <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">jurisdiction</span> until the child is born, but in my judgment the court is entitled, when considering threshold, to take into account the parental care given to the child before birth, even if the parent is dead at the relevant date point of either protective measures starting or at the point of application. If the question posed is: &#8220;can the care given by the parent encompass care given to a child in utero&#8221; I suggest that the answer, in principle, is yes. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This seems to me to be common sense, and in accordance with conventional practice. To do otherwise is unrealistic and contrary to the scheme of Part IV of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> which is intended to ensure the protection of children who have been, or are likely to be, subject to significant harm. The acts of a parent while the child is in utero may amount to satisfaction of the threshold criteria: see, for example, the discussion in <span style="font-weight:bold">Re M (supra) </span>at para 34. The court, when considering threshold, frequently takes into account drug or alcohol misuse by a mother during pregnancy. I see no difference in concept between that and (as here) a mother causing harm to the baby by the act of jumping from a high level which led to her (the mother&#8217;s) death just before the birth. </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Indeed, the fact that on this alternative approach I would need to rely upon W&#8217;s father&#8217;s failings demonstrates why it is logical and appropriate that the court can take into account W&#8217;s mother&#8217;s failings even though she died just before W&#8217;s birth. If, hypothetically, W&#8217;s father had been dead or untraceable, would it truly be the case that the LA would have no ability to bring care proceedings because both parents were dead or missing, even if one or both of them was the cause of significant harm?  I accept that wardship might then be a possible fallback, but for Part IV to be unavailable in such circumstances would, in my judgment, be the antithesis of the purpose of that part of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. I am satisfied that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> should be read purposively to ensure that in unusual circumstance such as this the LA may apply for care proceedings, and the court may make care orders. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have reached the conclusion that the LA is entitled to pursue care proceedings, for which the essential foundation stone is threshold under s31 (final) or s38 (interim). That being so, the need for wardship falls away. Part IV becomes the appropriate route to protect W. A wardship order would cut across the statutory scheme and fall foul of s100(4). Had I concluded that Part IV proceedings could not be brought, then wardship might have been the only recourse available to protect W, but that is not my conclusion. I therefore need to say no more about it.</p>
