As for Pieter, she explained that he is a Hare Krishna monk who has lived at a temple since 2000 and has limited access to modern technology.

I noted that there was no power for him to do so (see FPR r.29.17(3)-(4)). I have pointed on countless occasions that the power of transfer to the High Court is limited to puisne judges of the High Court (and judges of yet higher seniority). The limitation has been there for nearly nine years since the creation of the Family Court. Yet I see order after order made by circuit and district judges purporting to transfer proceedings to the High Court. It is completely inexplicable to me why this rule is not known and understood. Its terms were spelt out with crystal clarity in paras 26 &#8211; 28 of the President&#8217;s Guidance &#8211; <span style="font-style:italic">Jurisdiction of the Family Court to High Court Judge level and transfer of cases from the Family Court to the High Court</span> dated 28 February 2018 (as updated and reissued  on 24 May 2021).</p>

I  therefore determined  that there was no good reason why Amy&#8217;s application should be heard in the Family Division, and  treated the order of 9 June 2022 as having allocated this application to High Court Judge level within the Family Court. </p>

In October 1999 Hampshire Social Services wrote to Errol, stating that they had managed to make contact with Amy&#8217;s adoptive parents, who had discussed his request with Amy, who was willing to begin indirect contact. Letterbox contact began through Hampshire Social Services between Errol and Amy on 6 November 1999, but shortly thereafter Amy and Errol met in person, following which they spent much time together, including going on holiday to Florida, until his death on 25 July 2002.</p>

In my opinion this offers strong evidence, relative to the claim, that Amy Boudewijn, Darren Lee Johnson and Ashley Paul Johnson are closely related, with Amy Boudewijn being a half sibling or a genetically equivalent relationship. This opinion is based on a statistical assessment using an African Caribbean population to evaluate the results. that it is likely that Amy is their half-sibling, in fact 1600 times more likely than them being unrelated.
