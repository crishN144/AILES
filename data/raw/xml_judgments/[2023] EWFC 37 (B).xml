Upon examination a potential skull fracture was identified but no other injuries or markings of concern. The parents were interviewed under caution by the police on 15 August 2022. The family was not known to either [REDACTED] police or the Local Authority beforehand.</span></p>

In fact, they did not agree and the Local Authority accepted advice that the threshold for a Child in Need intervention was not met. The Guardian agreed. Ultimately this was not pursued.</span></p>
