The local authority (&#8220;LA&#8221;) is represented by Mr Slater. A is the daughter of M represented by Miss Kabweru-Namulemu. She opposes the application and seeks the return of A to her care. She proposes that she and A should live in Alabama in the USA with an uncle. Alternatively, she asks the court to find that the assessment of her parents in Nigeria by the LA is unfair and a further assessment should be ordered. A&#8217;s father who is separated from the mother is F and he is represented by Mr Roche. He also opposes the application for a care order and asks the court to let him care for A in Nigeria where he lives with his partner, X, their young son and X&#8217;s child, who is 12 years old and attends boarding school. A&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Guardian is Jo Wilkins (&#8220;CG&#8221;) and she is represented by Miss Matthews-Stroud. She supports the LA&#8217;s application.</span></p>

M had suffered a relapse in her mental health. She was arrested by the police and then detained under s2 of the Mental Health Act. Subsequently, on 8 July 2015 she was detained under s3 of the Act. In September she was discharged into community care. She was not well enough to look after A at that time.

A and her parents are Nigerian nationals. She lived in Nigeria until she was 8 years old. In January 2013 M came to the UK to study and do a PhD. A could not travel with her on M&#8217;s visa so lived with her maternal grandparents (&#8220;MGPs&#8221;) for a few months. In May 2013 she joined her mother in the UK travelling with her father on his visa. F did not stay in the UK very long but returned to Nigeria in June 2013 leaving M and A together in the UK. This was the situation until June 2015 when A was removed from M&#8217;s care by the police under their protective powers. </span></p>

It must then satisfy the court that A&#8217;s welfare is best served by the making of a care order. The standard of proof in respect of factual issues and threshold is the ordinary civil standard namely the balance of probabilities. That is to say the LA must persuade the court that what it alleges is more likely than not to be true. The parents are not required to prove anything nor are they required to prove that something alleged against them when findings have not been made and are not sought, did not happen.</span></p>

The allegations of rape are not proof of rape and must be discounted. There is no evidence that F currently abuses alcohol although it is clear that there was period of time in the past when he did. The allegation of domestic violence made by M was not raised before she gave evidence. In Mr Nwoye&#8217;s report the account of the MGM about this incident is given. It accords with M&#8217;s to the extent that the parents argued but she makes no mention of any threats to assault her. If they were made this is surprising as she was both present and the alleged victim of the threats. She does say F was the worse for drink. The court finds that this was an ugly incident in which the parents argued. F accused M of having an affair with a man who was only a family friend and had paid a social visit to see the MGM. F was under the influence of alcohol at the time and this impaired his judgement. The parents argued but there was no physical violence between them or threats of the same.</span></p>

However, if there are proceedings where the child&#8217;s best interests have been considered and it has been established that these require the removal of the child from their parents and the child remaining in the UK, then the Home Office will need to facilitate this, by granting leave to remain. If there are no clear grounds for a child to make an application which fit the immigration rules (based on length of time in the UK) then the Home Office must consider whether there are any grounds outside the rules for granting some form of leave. This decision must also consider the child&#8217;s best interests. A child who is in the care of a local authority is likely to be granted leave. The standard form of leave is for 30 months, but in considering the child&#8217;s best interests, the local authority should consider how long she is likely to remain in the UK, and whether it is in her best interests to grant a longer period of limited leave, or to grant her indefinite leave to remain.&#8221;</span></p>

She suffered from post-natal depression after A was born. In the UK she had 2 episodes in the autumn of 2013 and then a relapse in June 2015 which precipitated A coming into care. Her diagnosis is schizo affective disorder. She declined to participate in the psychiatric assessment ordered by the court and so there is no overview of her condition. However, it is apparent that the episodes of mental ill health in 2013 and 2015 occurred at times when M felt under pressure and stress. F says he would not support A returning to her care because he is not convinced her health is stable and A would be at risk if it were to deteriorate again. Whilst M&#8217;s mental health is currently settled the future prognosis is uncertain and M&#8217;s mental health is unpredictable. M has said that she will co-operate with mental health services wherever she lives.

M&#8217;s evidence was that the cold weather has a deleterious effect on her Sickle Cell anaemia. M had to contend with these issues but the effect on A was that she saw little of her mother in 6 months. This may have contributed to her expressed wishes and feelings over time.

There is a clear attachment between A and her mother but it cannot be said that the mother has provided stability and security to A. Their relationship has not been without its difficulties.

She conceded that had they lived in the UK she would possibly have asked follow-up questions and explored their responses in greater detail. The email responses they sent have been cut and pasted into the assessment document. They are short. There has been no further exploration or detailed discussion upon them. The answers reflect the different cultural approach to dealing with the issues raised.</span></p>

It is unclear what they were told about M&#8217;s mental health. They were not sent any medical reports or police evidence. The LA has not produced cogent evidence to suggest the MGPs knew about M&#8217;s propensity for mental health difficulties before she came to the UK. Post-natal depression is usually a self-contained and time-limited episode and not an indicator of a likelihood of future problems. It is right that MGM is a nurse and may have been expected to have some understanding of the potential issues but that is not the same as having a detailed understanding of how M presented at the time she was unwell and how this impacted on A.</span></p>

The information they had would have come principally from their daughter. Paula Darlison&#8217;s email to them on 23 September 2015 is the only explanation they had from the LA of the court and assessment process apart from a telephone conversation on a very poor line. The court acknowledges that the email from the MGPs dated 4 February 2016 raises concerns about their understanding of M&#8217;s mental health. They blame F for it.  They also appear to suggest a challenge to any decision of the court to limit her contact with A. However, there has been no further exploration of these issues with them as there surely would have been had they lived in the UK and been available for a face-to-face meeting or a decent telephone conversation.</span></p>

She lived with them for about 5 months before she came to the UK. She has said she would be willing to live with them in the UK but not in Nigeria. They are well-educated people who have raised 4 children of their own. They want to care for A and keep her within the family. There would be significant cultural benefits for A if she could be brought up in Nigeria by family members. She has a special place in the family as this couple&#8217;s first grandchild. The court is not persuaded that this viability assessment is adequate for the court to rule the MGPs out as carers for A. Further exploration of them is warranted. The difficulties in conducting the assessment have meant that it is not as detailed as it should have been. It would have been better if Mr Nwoye had been invited to have undertaken an assessment of them as carers as well as F although at the time he was instructed this assessment had not been completed. It began in September 2015 but was still ongoing in February 2016. The court acknowledges that a stumbling block in any further assessment will be the family feud referred to by Mr Nwoye in his assessment of the F. That remains an issue for the MGPs as much as it does for F. But no work has been done with the family on that issue as recommended by Mr Nwoye (see below).</span></p>

M and F did not know they were related when they dated. When M&#8217;s parents found out about their relationship they tried to put her off having a relationship with F but she got pregnant with A and so then there was no choice. In her witness statement dated 14 April 2016 at paragraph 7, M tells the court that, &#8220;the reason for the dispute between the maternal and paternal side of the family arises from the suspicious circumstances in which A&#8217;s paternal grandfather died. It is suspected within the family that the paternal grandmother may have assassinated her husband together with the lady he was with at the time (suspected to be his mistress). That is the underlying reason why my family did not approve of my marriage to the father who is also my cousin.&#8221;</span></p>

However, this cannot be the joint wishes of both paternal and maternal families because F maintains his claim that A should live with him and does not support her living with M. The lack of clarity about M&#8217;s proposals calls into question whether there have been any meaningful discussions between the maternal and paternal family members. F also said there had been but there was no detail or specificity from him upon which the court could place any reliance or confidence. M&#8217;s evidence about the Nigerian lawyer seemed to centre on the fact that he had advised her she was still legally married to F and that the rape allegations had not been pursued in court. There was no credible evidence from either parent that the family rift has been healed or that the issues dividing them resolved. At this time the court is left with the situation described by Mr Nwoye in his report in February. This is a family in which the maternal and paternal branches are divided by long-standing and more recent issues. Hostility between family members is openly expressed.  </span></p>

This raises the prospect of tension and difficulties between M and F potentially in the same household which would expose A to the risk of harm as was the case when the parties were together in 2013. F disagrees with M and says X would not have to leave the home and, if she did, he has other property in which she could live. He said he thought his wife had come to terms with his relationship with X and the fact that he had a son with her. Having heard her evidence, the court disagrees with his assessment.

While 2014 was a more settled period, in the early summer of 2015 her mother suffered a relapse in her mental health during which time she told A her father was a rapist and was dead. A called the police because she did not know what else to do and was scared by her mother&#8217;s behaviour and language. A experienced emotional trauma whilst living in the UK with her mother.  Immediately afterwards she must have been worried about her mother&#8217;s health especially as M was too unwell to have contact with A for several weeks. M was then absent from the UK during the autumn of 2015 renewing her passport in Nigeria and on her return in January did not see A whilst she was awaiting surgery which took place on 1 April.

It is a culturally appropriate match. The foster carer speaks the Yoruba language and A loves her cooking. The last 14 months in foster care has arguably been the most settled and sustained period A has experienced since her arrival in the UK. It is hardly surprising therefore that she articulates a desire to remain and it is only natural that she would be apprehensive about a return to Nigeria. The CG describes A as having &#8220;blossomed&#8221; whilst in care and she has become a confident young woman. She has lived with her parents and does not want to return to their care. Jo Wilkins is an experienced CG and she was firm in her view that A will be best cared for in the UK preferably in her current foster home. The court did not find her to be dogmatic but it must weigh up all the evidence and balance very carefully the competing factors. If it takes a different view from the CG it must explain why.</span></p>

M told the court that she (M) comes from the royal household of a particular tribe in Nigeria and, as the first grandchild of her MGPs A has a particular position and status within that royal family. If she lives in foster care in the UK she will be deprived of all that goes with that including acknowledgement of her position in her family and society, participation in family gatherings, celebrations and traditions. A speaks English as her first language but she also speaks Yoruba which is the native tongue of her family in Nigeria. Whilst her foster placement is a culturally appropriate one it is no substitute for the experience A would enjoy as part of her family in Nigeria. Paula Darlison told the court that A is aware of her position as the daughter of a princess of a Nigerian royal family. However, it is unclear how significant this is for A and what she understands by it.</span></p>

There would be challenges even if a truce were achieved because A has no existing relationship with X and M may seek to return to Nigeria if A were placed with F which would complicate matters further.</span></p>

A&#8217;s articulated wishes and feelings are clear but she is only 11 years old and they must be considered in the context of her history and the life experiences she has had. They are only one of the welfare factors to be weighed and the court is not persuaded that they should carry as much weight as the LA and CG assert they should. In part this is because neither social worker was able to satisfy the court that the issues mentioned in paragraph 52 above have been addressed in any meaningful way with A. She has not been challenged about her concerns, for example, about Ebola and Boko Haram. A is highly unlikely to be at risk from either of these.</span></p>

Neither is it as optimistic as the CG that the relationship between A and her family will be maintained as effectively as she suggests it could and, ideally, should be. The court accepts that there is an onus on the family to make an effort in this regard as well as on the LA and that modern communication and technology make it easier than ever before for people to stay in touch but it is still likely to be a tall order if her family is rarely in the UK. These issues are of concern particularly given the uncertainty about A&#8217;s immigration status and the prospect of her having to return to Nigeria at 18 years if not before, by which time she is likely to have had only limited contact with her wider family for a decade.</span></p>

The current foster placement is a good cultural match. There is affection and a warm relationship between the foster carer and A. It is disappointing that the LA did not seek clarification from the foster carer earlier as to whether she would agree to care for A in the long term. She says that she will but this will need to be approved by the appropriate fostering panel. The LA says it is likely approval will be given but it is not definite. The foster carer has a good track record of caring for children over the long term so the risk of placement breakdown is less than it might otherwise be.</span></p>

Another is the risk of a loss of contact with birth parents and family. In A&#8217;s case this risk is greater because her family lives in Nigeria. Although modern methods of communication make it easier than ever before for people to stay in touch it will be a challenge for the family to maintain contact with A at a meaningful level until she is 18. The CG was confident that it was possible and pointed out that the family had the funds to travel to the UK from time to time and it may be possible for A to visit them in Nigeria. That would be expensive for the LA and there can be no guarantees it would happen. A would be a looked-after child subject to regular reviews, meetings with social workers, likely to change over time, and to regular medical examinations. All these things would mark her out as different from most of her peers at school.</span></p>

Following receipt of Mr Nwoye&#8217;s report the LA should have considered what steps it could take to address the issue identified. Had the parties been in the UK some process of mediation might have been employed or a Family Group Conference arranged. The LA could have instructed Mr Nwoye or one of his colleagues to undertake a similar piece of work in Nigeria. It could have sought his advice about the most appropriately cultural way to explore the issues. It could have sought to identify family members who may have been able to promote a meeting of minds and an agreed way forward so that A could be placed within the family. None of this has happened. Of course it would not have been straightforward but it was not impossible. To do nothing as the LA has is to ignore the positive obligation imposed upon it to promote family life and to seek to reunite father and daughter. </span></p>

The parents say they have but the court was not convinced by their evidence on this point. The fact that the issue has not been resolved during the last 6 months could be said to mean that it is unlikely to be capable of resolution however long is afforded. That is a risk. To afford an opportunity for resolution which fails will simply mean a decision for A has been delayed for longer than was necessary. The court is also aware that A is due to, or has just started, secondary school in the UK and it would be better if a final decision could be made now so as to avoid any disruption to her education. However attractive that may be and having wrestled with the alternatives, the court is not persuaded it is in A&#8217;s best interests to ignore the prospect of a placement with her family in Nigeria and has concluded that this option must be further explored. </span></p>

Whilst it is suggested that F could and would take protective measures if necessary through the Nigerian courts and whilst that may offer a solution of sorts in the short term it does not address the issue in the longer term.
