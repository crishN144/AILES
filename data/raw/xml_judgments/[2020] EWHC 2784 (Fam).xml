Her case is that A was wrongfully removed from Italy to England by (or on behalf of) the father on or about 16 October 2019.   </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0in">The father resists the mother&#8217;s application.  First, he argues that his removal of A from Italy was not wrongful.  Mr Gifford Head submits that such rights as were held by the mother under Italian law did not amount to rights of custody under the Convention.  He also contends that the mother was not &#8216;actually exercising&#8217; any rights of custody she may have had at the time.  Alternatively, it is the father&#8217;s case that the court has a discretion to refuse to make a return order on the basis of the following exceptions under Article 13 of the 1980 Convention: </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">For completeness I should say that in his statement the father also sought to defend the application on the basis that A is &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">settled</span>&#8217; in this jurisdiction.  Although he did not go so far as to concede the point, it was quite rightly not pursued by Mr Gifford Head.  In circumstances where the proceedings were issued less than a year after the date of the relevant removal, the issue of settlement for the purposes of Article 12 does not arise.  The extent to which A is settled (in a non-technical sense) in this jurisdiction remains relevant, however, to any jurisdiction I may have to exercise under Article 13. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0in">The case had been listed for a two-day final hearing on 5 and 6 October 2020.  However, the previous week the parties were notified that the hearing would need to be adjourned to late November as there was no judge available.  The parties then requested that the case should remain in the list on 5 October for a short PTR; it was in those circumstances that on that day it came before me.  After being informed by the Clerk of the Rules that it would be possible for me to hear the case on 7 October 2020, I agreed to do so.  I also dealt with various case management issues on 5 October: I refused an application to join A to the proceedings; I refused an oral application by the father for permission to instruct an unidentified expert in relation to Italian law; I refused an application by the father for permission to file a further statement.  I also determined that the application should proceed on the basis of submissions without oral evidence from the parties. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0in">Although I heard no oral evidence from the parties, I did have the benefit of hearing from the Cafcass officer, Ms Allison Baker.  She met with A at her offices on 20 August 2020 for approximately an hour and prepared a report dated 15 September 2020. She gave evidence for slightly more than an hour, during which she was mainly cross-examined by Mr Gifford Head on behalf of the father.  I would like to extend my gratitude to Ms Baker for making herself available to attend court at very short notice.  As she was already committed to attend another hearing at 10.30 am, she agreed to appear before me at 9.30am and to conclude her evidence at 1pm.  I found her evidence to be insightful.  I deal with it in greater detail below. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0in">I am also very grateful to Ms Baker for agreeing to facilitate a meeting between A and me after I acceded to an application on behalf of the father that I should adopt such a course.  The meeting took place on 8 October 2020 at the Cafcass Offices in Bloomsbury.  A was brought to the meeting by the father. I met with A for some 20 to 25 minutes together with Ms Baker; the father himself was not present during the meeting. Ms Baker took a note and prepared a summary of the meeting which was circulated to the parties; they then made further brief written submissions in relation to its content and other matters which I had raised with them.  The overriding impression I gained from the meeting was that A is a charming boy.  I was impressed with his fluency in English.  He was very polite and well-mannered.  He is a credit to his parents in this respect.   </p>

A nodded politely when I was explaining this to him.  By contrast with the first time he met Ms Baker, he did not become upset during this meeting.  He did emphasise (albeit briefly) his wish not to return to Italy as he said considered his educational prospects to be better in England (as I set out more fully below).  Ms Baker and I listened to what A had to say but did not question him about it.   </p>

However, for the purposes of my evaluation I do not attach significant weight to what A told me during the meeting, as: (a) it was not an occasion for information gathering, and (b) although Ms Baker prepared a summary she has not undertaken a further <span style="font-style:italic">analysis</span> of what was said by A let alone been cross-examined about it.  I attach far greater weight to the content of Ms Baker&#8217;s main report and to the oral evidence she gave. </p>

He says that the mother preferred to work and to go out socialising.  By contrast, her case is that his characterisation of the position gives a misleading impression; she had a job working in a bar and the nature of her work meant that she was unable to return home sometimes until the early hours of the morning.  On her case, when she was not at work she would care jointly for A with the father or sometimes on her own. </p>

The father says in his statement that he obtained a &#8216;custody&#8217; order for the full-time care of A in 2015, but I think he must be mistaken about the year.  </p>

Given the proximity of the two homes, I think it is most likely that there was a fluid arrangement which enabled A to see the mother irregularly but either often or reasonably often (precisely how often, I am not in a position to say); he spent the bulk of his time living with his father until January 2018 and thereafter with his paternal family.  That this was the case is consistent, in my view, with the fact that following the removal A had daily contact with the mother by video or telephone for some nine months until the commencement of proceedings in July 2020 (see below). </p>

I accept the point made by Mr Gifford Head that his ability to travel has been impeded for a number of reasons: first, by the Covid-19 situation which (as is a matter of public record) begun having a serious impact in Italy some time before the start of the English lockdown; secondly, by the travel restrictions which were imposed in the United Kingdom until the beginning of July 2020; and thirdly by the removal of his passport pursuant to the location order made on 3 July 2020.  However, this does not, in my view, adequately explain why he did not travel back to Italy over the 2019/20 Christmas holidays or over the February 2020 half-term.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0in">So far as indirect contact is concerned, the mother&#8217;s case is that in the initial period following the removal she had regular video or telephone calls with A on an almost daily basis.  On her case, he informed her that he did not wish to be in England and was missing both her and his school friends.  He told her that he was struggling at school and finding it difficult to communicate with her peers.  Her evidence in this respect is consistent with the information that has been provided by the school.  She describes that over time her contact gradually reduced as A would not respond to her messages; despite that, she continued to call every day.  The mother says in her statement that &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">for the past two months</span>&#8217; (i.e. since the proceedings were commenced in early July) she has had no contact at all with A.  This is so, despite the father having agreed &#8211; as is clearly recorded on the face of the order dated 8 July 2020 - &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">to the daily telephone, skype and/or facetime contact between [the mother] and [A] and that he will not prevent such contact </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">continuing</span>&#8217;.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0in">Mr Jarman was unable to explain the delay of some five and half months before the mother took the initial step in the Hague process.  He made the general point that it is often the case that left behind parents are disadvantaged by a lack of legal advice and/or inadequate legal advice.  While I accept that general proposition, and also take into account the additional difficulties likely to have been caused by the Covid-19 situation, I am not convinced that it provides an adequate explanation for this delay.  It easy to accept that the mother may not have received timely advice about the 1980 Hague Convention, as it is often the case that the Convention is unfamiliar even to specialist family lawyers.  It is more difficult to understand why seemingly <span style="font-style:italic">no </span>steps were taken by the mother; for example, she did not seek to restore the case urgently before the Italian court (bearing in mind that she was in touch with her Italian solicitors a few days before the removal).  While I accept that her contact with her lawyer on 10 October 2019 supports her case that she was playing an active role in A&#8217;s life, her failure to take active steps post removal is, in my view, inconsistent with the notion that A was living with her even for half of his time. </p>

Actually, in terms of article 3. custody rights may have been awarded to the person who demands that their exercise be respected, and to that person in his own right or jointly. It cannot be otherwise in an era when types of joint custody, regarded as best suited to the general principle of sexual non-discrimination, are gradually being introduced into internal law.

If the narrow meaning was adopted, it could be said that a custodial parent was not actually exercising his or her custodial rights during a period of lawful staying access with the non-custodial parent.

The example he offered to illustrate his point concerned the position of a parent who has the physical care of the child.  He did not consider in terms the position where the relevant &#8216;right of custody&#8217; does not include caring physically for a child but involves being a holder of parental responsibility.  Nevertheless, it seems to me that the broad point he was making &#8211; that the Article must be construed widely &#8211; is plainly correct and consistent with the purpose and philosophy of the Convention. </p>

The mother, who shared parental responsibility with the father as a matter of Australian law, had moved to the United States of America.  The judge at first instance found that she had to a very large extent &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">washed her hands</span>&#8217; of the children; he held that it would be &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">unreal</span>&#8217; to regard her as actually exercising any right of custody within the meaning of the Convention at the time of removal, commenting that were he to hold otherwise &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">it is difficult to conceive of any situation where a parent could not invoke the Hague Convention where a custodial parent has removed a child overseas</span>&#8217;.  The Court of Appeal overturned his decision.  Keith J, delivering the judgment of the court, held that it was not sufficient to find that the mother had largely washed her hands of the children.  As a holder of parental responsibility, she retained the right to determine the children&#8217;s place of residence.

Ms Baker described it at paragraph 22 of her report as &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">a clear wish not to return to Italy to live</span>&#8217;.  She maintained that position in her oral evidence.  I do not consider that the views A expressed can be classified as a mere preference.  He told Ms Baker that he was &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">really happy</span>&#8217; living in the UK and that if he was forced to return this is something he would &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">try to deny</span>&#8217; and avoid thinking about.  Significantly, A reacted with visible shock and tears when he learned from Ms Baker that his expressed views would not necessarily prevail.  This demonstrates, in my view, a strength of feeling indicative of the fact that he holds a genuine objection and was not merely parroting a rehearsed script. </p>

I accept the submission made by Mr Jarman that in cases such as this, where a removal has been procured by a deception in full knowledge that a parent would object if made aware it was to happen, the policy of the Convention carries substantial weight.  On the other hand, the weight to be attached to this factor is diminished, in my view, by the delay on the mother&#8217;s part in initiating the Hague process.  Her delay of five and half months in completing the necessary paperwork meant that eight and a half months had elapsed before proceedings were issued in this jurisdiction.  Although I bear in mind the points made by Mr Jarman about the difficulties applicants sometimes encounter in obtaining legal advice, it is difficult in my view to describe this as a &#8216;hot pursuit&#8217; case.  From A&#8217;s perspective the reasons for the delay are irrelevant; the consequence of the delay is that I am now considering the application in circumstances where he has lived in London for a year and has become accustomed to living here.  In all of the circumstances, in my judgment the policy of the Convention should carry a significant degree of weight; but it is not necessarily decisive of the outcome. </p>

I consider it likely that his wish to live in England will have started to develop from early 2018 onwards when his father came to live here.  He told Ms Baker that the father first spoke to him about the prospect of living in England towards the end of 2017.  If, as I consider probable on the evidence, A had been living mainly in the paternal home, it is likely that he will have missed his father when they started living substantially apart from 2018 onwards. According to what A told his Ms Baker there were two occasions on which he raised with his mother his wish to live in England.  This cannot have been easy for him to do and indicates, in my view, a degree of conviction on his part.   </p>

Mr Gifford Head suggested that the likely cause of A&#8217;s upset was a feeling on his part that his autonomy was not being respected.  Although this is possible, I consider it more likely that he was upset at the prospect of having to live permanently with his mother in Italy while his father remained in England (which, at that time, he believed to be at least a real possibility if a return order were to be made).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0in">On the other hand, in my judgment A&#8217;s objections are the product of significant influence on the part of his father.  Apart from the week he spent in England in May 2019, A had no knowledge of what it might be like to live in England.  His wish to do so at that time will have been based only partly on the fact that he was missing his father; it will also have been because, over a prolonged period of time, his father was selling to him the idea of an exciting new life in another country; a life where he could &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">master his English</span>&#8217; and where he would have access to an education system which the father considers to be </p>

In my judgment, the father acted irresponsibly and contrary to A&#8217;s interests in seeking to influence him in favour of a move to London, knowing (as he must have done) that the mother opposed it.  It was also seriously disrespectful to the mother, and a strong indicator that the father has no proper appreciation of her importance as a parent for A. </p>

As Ms Baker said in her oral evidence, A had known he was leaving and had said goodbye to the city in which he lived. In my judgment, this all demonstrates a degree of manipulation on the father&#8217;s behalf which was seriously harmful to A&#8217;s emotional interests.  It has placed A in a position where he no doubt feels partly responsible for what occurred.  By putting A in a situation where he had to maintain a secret from his mother about the anticipated removal (although it is not clear for how long he was placed in that position), the father cast her in the role of the enemy: she was the roadblock to the promise of a new exciting life in London and to the better future that lay ahead for A. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0in">The degree to which A has been manipulated by the father is apparent from his interview with Ms Baker.  Although I have concluded that A does genuinely object to returning to Italy, his reasons for objecting are largely his father&#8217;s reasons.  His views about the mother lack balance, as Ms Baker has stated; he speaks about her in unequivocally negative terms.  He has aligned himself with his father&#8217;s dismissive opinion of her.  It is striking that he was unable to find anything good to say about her (although he did, at least, acknowledge that he would miss her &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">only moderately</span>&#8217; if he remained in England).  I do not accept Mr Gifford Head&#8217;s submission that A&#8217;s expressed views are <span style="font-style:italic">likely</span> to reflect his genuine experience of life with his mother.  Although I cannot dismiss this as a <span style="font-style:italic">possibility</span> (and Ms Baker acknowledged that it was a possibility), it seems to me that were that the case it is unlikely that he would have enjoyed the frequent level contact by video and/or telephone which continued from the time of the removal until these proceedings were initiated in July 2020.  Moreover, as the parent with primary care it was, in my view, incumbent upon the father to promote A&#8217;s relationship with his mother and to ensure that he held a positive view of her.  Instead of acting as a responsible parent, it is apparent from what A told Ms Baker (see paragraph 15 of her report) that the father </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0in">It seems to me that A&#8217;s main reason for wishing to live in England is his desire to remain living with his father.  When he spoke to Ms Baker, he clearly believed that if he returned to Italy he would either be forced &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">by the government</span>&#8217; to live with his mother or alternatively that he would be living with the paternal family without the father.  He was clearly anxious about either prospect (Ms Baker explained in her oral evidence that he viewed them as long-term prospects).  Notably, in this context, A told Ms Baker &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">so I feel sad for my dad, he waited to have this opportunity for me to live with him</span>&#8217;.   This again suggests that the father has placed him a position where he feels burdened by the decision which I have to make. That said, it is very much to the father&#8217;s credit that he has agreed to return to Italy with A, if that is what I order.  A told Ms Baker that were the father to do so permanently A would feel better about living there again (although he remained anxious that the father would have to give up his job in England).  In her oral evidence Ms Baker expressed the view that the father&#8217;s agreement to return would &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">clearly help [A]</span>&#8217;.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0in">A&#8217;s other expressed reason for wanting to live in England &#8211; articulated when he met with me - is his belief that his educational prospects are better here than in Italy.  This reflects his father&#8217;s view.  Neither Ms Baker nor I asked him any follow up questions when he said during his meeting with me that &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">the school systems [in the city where he lived in Italy] are kinda weak.  It&#8217;s much better here, better options, you have Oxford here&#8230; good English here.</span>&#8217;  However, I find it difficult to accept that at the age of eleven A could have formed a reasoned view about the competing merits of the Italian and English educational systems.  I do, though, accept that after a difficult start to his education in England, A has now become more settled since recently starting at secondary school and that he has made some friends.  Ms Baker agreed in her evidence with the proposition that the problems A encountered at primary school were &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">erased</span>&#8217; by his fresh start at secondary school and by the good progress he has made with his spoken English. </p>

He is aged eleven: not an age where a child&#8217;s views are necessarily considered decisive; but equally not a young child whose views might more easily be dismissed.  He has maintained his view consistently; in part, it is likely to reflect a wish to be living in London with his father which dates from well before the removal.  On the other hand, A&#8217;s views are substantially tainted by serious manipulation on the part of the father and are (or, at least, were) based to a significant upon his belief that returning to Italy may result in a long-term separation from his father.   </p>

They are far better placed than the English courts to conduct the evaluation that is necessary.  A&#8217;s mother is Italian; his father is half-Italian.  A himself is Italian born and bred.  He has lived in the same city in Italy from birth until the age of ten.  Each party would require an interpreter if the litigation were conducted here (the mother speaks no English; the father&#8217;s English is reasonable but not at a level where he could litigate without an interpreter).  The relevant witnesses are in Italy.  Both parties are represented there by lawyers.  Proceedings are well advanced in that jurisdiction: there is a hearing listed in 12 November 2020; Mr Gifford Head informs me that the court will encourage the lawyers to negotiate with a view to reaching agreement, ideally by 5 November 2020.  The father has instructed his lawyer to make an urgent application for permission to remain in England on an interim basis which he expects to be heard on or before 12 November 2020. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0in">Thirdly, in my view A&#8217;s emotional needs are not being met.  Since coming to England he has been deprived of a proper relationship with his mother.  Wherever the fault for this may lie, it is a matter that needs to be given significant priority.  I agree with Ms Baker&#8217;s assessment that A lacks the maturity to consider the long-term impact of not having a balanced relationship with each of his parents and that &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">he is unable to appreciate the growing importance of the role a mother plays in a child&#8217;s minority when their psycho-emotional needs will evolve</span>&#8217;.  For the reasons I have set out above, I have concerns about the father&#8217;s willingness and ability to promote A&#8217;s relationship with his mother at the present time.  I find it difficult to see how it can be properly repaired unless A is able to experience face-to-face contact with her. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0in">These welfare considerations would point clearly and decisively in favour of an immediate return order were it not for the fourth aspect of welfare I regard as significant.  This concerns A&#8217;s education.  The father behaved irresponsibly in bringing A to England in the middle of a school term and his education will have suffered for it (which is ironic given the importance the father attaches to education).  After attending a new English school for two incomplete terms, his school was the shut down for nearly three months as a result of the pandemic.  A returned to primary school briefly at the end of the summer term.  He has now been at secondary school for just over a month and appears to have made friends there and to be reasonably settled.  I am told that if he returns to Italy, A will be able to return to his old school but that he will be placed in the year below as he will need to repeat the year that he has missed.  I do not imagine that this would be easy for him or that he would welcome it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0in">Mr Gifford Head makes the important submission that if I were to return A to Italy and the Italian court were then to sanction him remaining in England on an interim basis this would mean two further changes of school for A.  It would be a further blight on an education that has already suffered serious disruption over the past year.  As Mr Gifford Head says, Ms Baker considered that this has the potential to be destabilising for A.  In those circumstances, it is submitted that I should either refuse to make a return order altogether or, alternatively, delay the implementation of any return until the end of November to allow Italian court to come to an interim determination on the issue and thereafter to give the father an opportunity to seek such orders from the English court as may be required in the light of that determination. </p>

Black J there had to balance her clear view that faradvanced welfare proceedings should be concluded in Poland against the potential for disrupting the life and education of a child who had been in England for two years and was settled here.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0in">Whether or not making a delayed return order in the context of an Article 13 discretion is quite so exceptional may be a matter for debate; although I have not heard full argument on the point, I am inclined to the view that in circumstances where the discretion is &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">at large</span>&#8217; there is scope for greater flexibility.  In the end, however, I am not persuaded that it is appropriate to adopt that course in this case.  I have reached this conclusion for the following reasons: </p>

In my view, this presents a good opportunity for A to return to Italy and for the parties to start taking steps to repair his relationship with his mother.  As well as being essential from A&#8217;s perspective, I hope the father will recognise that it is in his own interests to demonstrate that he is capable of promoting that relationship.  The Italian court may well feel more comfortable about permitting the father&#8217;s relocation application if it can feel confident that the maternal relationship will not be harmed if it does so. </p>

As I recorded above, the court will expect the lawyers to negotiate in order to reach an overall agreement if possible.  In my view, the potential for agreement will be enhanced if both parties are back in Italy and if the mother has been able to spend some time with A.  As matters stand, there is a high level of mistrust which is likely to hinder the potential for compromise. </p>

This will be more easily achieved if he is already in Italy when such a decision is made. </p>

From A&#8217;s perspective he will have been able to spend that time in the city where he has grown up for almost all of his life and to enjoy the acquaintance of his Italian family. </p>

It will be very much in A&#8217;s interests if his parents can find a long-term solution upon which they both agree.  A has had a very disrupted year.  It will benefit him greatly knowing that his parents have reached agreement and that the period of uncertainty is at an end.  I hope that the parents embrace the opportunity offered by the Italian court to negotiate a welfare solution for A. </p>
