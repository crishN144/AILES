	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I start with a very brief summary, which the parents can hear, and then leave if they wish.  I am going to make the findings sought by the local authority.  I find that the father caused the injuries; the mother failed to protect the children.  The medical evidence is compelling.  There are a number of points where I am confident that the parents and the maternal grandmother have lied to the court and, taking the evidence as a whole, it is, in my view, well beyond the balance of probabilities that the father caused these injuries.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case concerns two children, J, aged nearly six, and B, now aged four.  These are the second set of care proceedings and the third fact-finding hearing concerning these children.  The decision of Judge Wicks, dated 8 June 2023, was overturned by the Court of Appeal, and I have heard the re-hearing of the matter over three days.  I heard oral evidence from the mother, the father and the maternal grandmother.  All parties agreed that no medical witnesses needed to be called, but I was provided with all the medical evidence from the earlier hearings, as well as extracts from many of the transcripts.  I will refer as necessary both to the oral evidence, the written evidence of the medical experts and the witnesses of fact below.</p>

J was examined and no injuries were found.  The children were placed with the grandmother and her partner, Mr Y, initially under s.20 of the Children Act.  Proceedings were commenced on 19 February and an interim care order was made.</p>

Both parents denied responsibility for the injuries and a fact-finding hearing began on 28 September 2020.

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Oates rejected the possibility that the injuries could have been caused by J throwing a toy &#8211; that has not been persisted with further &#8211; or that the injuries could have been birth-related.  He thought that the possibility of J jumping from the sofa onto the bouncer was a possibility but very unlikely.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Lawrence was of the opinion that the two fractures were the result of B&#8217;s head making forceful contact with an unyielding object, with the point of contact being in the right parietal region.  Again, he rejected the birth injury idea or the flying toy or iPhone.  He considered it to be unlikely, given the clinical presentation, that it was the result of J jumping off the sofa onto B, largely because of what would have been B&#8217;s likely response.  He also said at that stage that in such a scenario the head would have had to be turned to the right, so that it was the right parietal area that would have contacted the floor.  </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Cartlidge, who is the paediatrician and gave a paediatric overview, considered that the level of distress that B would have presented after an injury of this type would have been a very loud cry, involving a sudden change in volume and the nature of the cry when the fracture was sustained.</p>

	    <num>10</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The fact-finding was adjourned before the parents could give evidence because of late police disclosure, I believe, and the court granted permission for an expert to be instructed in biomechanics.  That expert was Dr Van Ee, who produced two reports.  He concluded that if J jumped off the sofa onto his brother, he would have generated or could have generated sufficient force to have caused the skull fracture, even though B was in a bouncer chair at the time, but if J had jumped from the floor, he would not have generated sufficient force.  Dr Van Ee&#8217;s report very much focuses on an examination of pressure and force rather than how the mechanism would actually have worked to have caused the specific fractures in question.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the light of Dr Van Ee&#8217;s evidence, the medical experts reviewed their conclusions.  <br/>Mr Lawrence accepted the theoretical possibility of that scenario, but said that such an incident would have resulted in symptoms of pain, distress or altered consciousness that would have been noticeable and obvious to a carer, even if that carer had not witnessed the episode.  Dr Cartlidge also accepted the theoretical possibility, but, like Mr Lawrence, thought that the scenario was unlikely, indeed more than unlikely, given the absence of any reactions of J, and that J would probably have hurt himself as well.  Dr Oates did not alter his original opinion.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parents gave oral evidence to Judge Wicks at that hearing when it was resumed in February 2021.  I am told that the mother became very upset during the evidence.  <br/>I do not think it is necessary to record anything more about the mother&#8217;s evidence at that stage.  I note that there are some discrepancies between accounts that have been given in their precise details by the mother, the father and indeed the maternal grandmother.  I very much take into account, and I will come back to this when I come to the law, the fact that February 2020 is now almost four years ago and that accounts have been taken on a number of different occasions.  These kind of minor differences in chronological sequence where there is no objective evidence such as texts to establish a clear chronology, do not carry much, if any, weight.</p>

She said that, on the day of the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, according to her oral evidence and her statement, she had gone into the kitchen at around lunchtime in order to make some toast and a bottle for B, she had left B in his bouncer chair in the living room with J, and she could hear J playing on the floor while making something to eat.  Toys were on the floor before she left the room.  She did not say she heard any incident while the two boys were in the room.  She said she took the boys to a local park and it was on her return, that is when B was being taken out of the pram by the father, that the swelling to B&#8217;s head was noticed.  She then contacted her mother, saying that she did not know how the injury had occurred.  They went round to the grandmother&#8217;s house and then the grandmother said they should take B to hospital.</p>

The father also gave evidence to Judge Wicks and the father, as is the case with the mother, has been consistent that he did not cause the skull fracture.</p>

They said that, and continued to say, he appeared fine that day, but presented with bruising and swelling to the head the following day.  Neither called for medical advice at the time; rather the mother called her mother, and the mother and the grandmother took the boys to the landlord&#8217;s agents to complain about the hard floor.

In the second proceedings, Dr Oates, Dr Lawrence and Dr Cartlidge were again instructed, but Dr Keenan, who is a haematologist, was also instructed to give an opinion on whether B had any underlying disorder which would have made bruising more likely.  He said no abnormality of the blood clotting system had been identified.  The bruising and bleeding seen in B should be considered to have occurred in a child with a normal blood clotting system.</p>

He did not accept that those injuries would have been caused by a fall between a bed and a chest of drawers, which was one of the suggestions put forward by the parents.  He was of the opinion that these injuries were the result of a blow from something which wrapped around the face.  The injury to the ear would have required it to strike something when it fell, if it happened in a fall to the floor.  The injuries to the ear would have required striking two objects.</p>

She said she had cancelled the July health visitor appointment because all four members of the family had a sickness bug, and she was thinking about what was best for the health visitor and her children.  I do not think there are any points out of her evidence at that hearing which really move matters further on than the oral evidence she gave to me.

There is some confusion over precisely which events the father was referring to, but his evidence was, at those second proceedings, that there had been a time when B had been climbing out of bed and had fallen between the cabinet and the bed.  I think the position is, although it probably does not matter very much, that, in those second proceedings before Judge Wicks, he was saying that that was the incident in July.  But when giving that evidence, he accepted in cross-examination that the gap between the bed and the chest of drawers was wide enough for B&#8217;s head not to have been caught between them.</p>

She was asked questions by Miss Turner in chief and by Mr Forbes in cross-examination.  We had a break, but she managed reasonably well through giving her oral evidence.  I note at this point that the mother has been diagnosed with psychiatric adjustment disorder and anxiety disorder and with a longstanding history of generalised somatic and psychic symptoms for which she has been prescribed a variety of psychotropic medications.  For the purposes of the hearing in front of me an intermediary was appointed.  Apparently the mother did not have an intermediary at the earlier hearings.  I have no difficulty in accepting that the mother has found this process, and in particular giving evidence, intensely traumatic and has struggled both to listen to the evidence but also to give evidence herself.  I note at this point the great assistance that has been given by the intermediary, Miss Climpson, who <br/>I think has done sterling service in helping the mother to remain calm, although there have been large parts of this hearing which the mother has not felt able to attend.  It seems to me she managed to give evidence reasonably calmly and probably in the best way that was possible.</p>

She was adamant that she had never hurt the children and neither had the father.  I note, however, that she effectively avoided all the difficult questions because, at every point where things got difficult, she said she could not recall.  I note that if I had simply heard the mother&#8217;s oral evidence in the absence of any other evidence, I might have believed her evidence, but, in my view, all that does is show the problems of relying on demeanour.  In the light of all the other evidence in this case, <br/>I am afraid I have little doubt that the mother was lying to me on a number of critical points, and I have no doubt she knows what happened in respect of the bruising injuries in 2021.

She said there was a short period where the boys were alone in the living room while she was in the kitchen making toast and a bottle.  The living room is at the front of the house, there is then a vestibule or a hall where the staircase goes up and the kitchen is behind.  I note that this is a small house, so any significant noise in the front room would undoubtedly have been heard in the kitchen.  The mother was clear that she heard nothing when she was in the kitchen, and there was no evidence when she went back into the front room, that either child was very upset.  The evidence is, at one point, she says that B was crying, but there was no evidence of anything that comes close to the level of upset that Dr Cartlidge thought B would have been in if he had had a skull fracture.  I also note, because it is important, that when she says she went back into the front room, B was still in the bouncer seat, still facing the right direction and there were no physical signs that anything had happened.</p>

However, the text messages which were put to her by Mr Forbes showed that that account simply was not true.  The texts showed beyond any reasonable doubt, that she saw B on 11, 14, 15 July, then over the weekend of the 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and then on 21 July.

However, he had no explanation as to why it was some hours later, (it is very unclear how many hours because the timeline is so unclear from the parents) that they went to the maternal grandmother and then went to hospital.  <br/>I think the evidence suggests very strongly that he was lying to the police on 7 February.</p>

Where it is alleged that a person has lied, the court must approach this allegation with considerable care (see the very well-known case of <span style="font-style:italic">R v Lucas</span>).  First, the court must consider whether the person in question has lied, and then the court must be concerned to bear in mind that people may lie for a broad range of different reasons, including embarrassment, shame, desire to hide some other wrongdoing.  The court must seek to distinguish a lie from, for example, story creep, mistake or confusion.  If a lie is proven, then the relevance of a lie to the court&#8217;s inquiry must always been considered.  In this case there is an allegation of failure to protect, and the court must be careful that such an allegation does not simply become a bolt-on to the central issue.

In those senses, she was a compelling witness.  She was extremely upset during much of the hearing and could not listen to much of the evidence.  I am afraid, and I say this just to make it very clear in the light of some of the comments Judge Wicks made, that I have reached the conclusion that she could not bear to listen to the evidence because she knows how B has been harmed and she was in a very emotionally conflicted position.

In other words, he was completely non-mobile.  He had a serious skull fracture across the left side and towards the front of his skull, but the parents say they saw no injury and never noticed B being particularly upset.  </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are two periods which come under particular scrutiny.  The children were alone with the father for about three hours on the night of 6 February.  There were texts around that time that suggest that the parents were arguing and that the father was finding it hard to cope with the children.  The father was a regular cannabis user, a fact that the mother has been very unwilling, in the past proceedings, to accept she knew about.  That evening falls within the time window when the experts say the injury could have been inflicted.  On the balance of probabilities, I think that this is the most likely point the incident occurred.  What the father did that evening is impossible to know unless he tells the truth.  </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do accept it is possible that the mother did not realise that B was badly injured until the next day when the swelling arose, and I also accept that the texts suggest to some degree that the mother did not know what had happened.  The mother says there was a short period on 7 February when the children were alone in the front room while she was in the kitchen preparing some toast and a bottle for B.  I place very little weight on the slight inconsistencies of her account about this period.  I accept she would have been extremely stressed when being interviewed by the police and that, since then, she has recounted the events so often it is hardly surprising she has given slightly different accounts.  However, the suggestion that, whilst the children were in the front room, J jumped off the sofa onto B in the bouncer chair in such a way as for B&#8217;s skull to be fractured is, in my view, vanishingly unlikely.  </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The reasons for my conclusions about the alleged sofa incident is, firstly, the basic improbability of the injury.  Although Dr Van Ee demonstrated that, in mechanical terms, it was possible, he did not consider how the forces that could have caused the injury could actually have been inflicted on B&#8217;s head at the places they were.  The injuries were towards the front of the skull, but B must have been propelled backwards so his skull hit the floor for this theory to work.  How the part of the skull with the fracture could have impacted onto the floor is very unclear.  Dr Lawrence said he must have had his head turned for it to happen.  Although that is, of course, possible, the mother herself has said that B generally lay with his head back, though of course there are always outliers and there are always very unlikely events, but this one is definitely on the very unlikely scale on those grounds alone.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, all the clinical experts said they thought this was an unlikely mechanism to have caused an injury of this type, although accepting it was theoretically possible.  In a jurisdiction which applies a balance of probability test, a theoretical possibility is by no means sufficient. </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, and importantly, the mother does not suggest she heard or noticed anything at the time.  Dr Cartlidge was clear that B would have been upset and cried at the type of injury that would have led to a cracked skull.  Even assuming a highly stoic baby who rarely cried, and that is not the evidence about B, for a five-week-old not to cry out and be very upset after a skull fracture is more than extremely unlikely.  </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fifthly, the idea of this causation seems only to have arisen after the maternal grandparents said they had seen J jumping off the sofa towards the bouncer.  In my view, this was a concocted story.  If the mother had been aware of any kind of incident on the day of the injury, then surely she would have mentioned it immediately to the police.  </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">I take all those factors into account to dismiss, with little hesitation, the sofa theory.  I find the injury was inflicted by the father when he was alone with the children the day before.  There is nothing to suggest that the mother caused the injuries, and I find on the material before me, both in terms of timing and the other evidence referred to above, that it is far more likely that the father inflicted the injuries than the mother. </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn to the injuries in 2021.  The children were returned to the parents in late March.  This must have been a very difficult period, particularly for B, who had lived with his maternal grandmother since he was six weeks old.  There is plenty of evidence that the parents struggled with the children at this time, particularly the father.  There is some evidence of B bruising fairly easily and of being hyperactive.  The parents have a small house and there were two young and active children in that house.  However, the series of injuries shown in the photographs is striking and the facial injuries shown on 21 July are shocking.  I have looked at the photos of the bruises on B when in the maternal grandmother&#8217;s care and in foster care.  Although B plainly does have bruises at those times, they are not of anything approaching the severity of the injuries shown in the summer of 2021 when he was with the parents, and I note and rely on the fact that that is precisely the same view Dr Cartlidge, a very experienced paediatrician, took.</p>

In my view, any responsible, however nervous, parent would have taken B to get help with the injuries shown on 21 July if they had not been trying to hide something.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">In terms of causation, some of the bruises may have been caused by B&#8217;s clumsiness and running into things.  However, some of them, in particular 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"> </span>July and 14 August <br/>(I used the dates of the photos because we do not know the dates of the injuries), are unlikely to have been caused by such events, in fact more than unlikely, extremely unlikely.  There were very serious bruises on the left cheek and side of B&#8217;s face on 21 July.  By far the most likely cause of that injury is a very hard slap from a right-handed person across his face, around his face, a wraparound injury, and that was the view of Dr Cartlidge.  In terms of the August injury, the injury to the ear, as the expert said, is a very difficult one to cause accidentally.  It is of course, as Mr Vine says, possible.  There is such a sequence of unlikely events in this case that I find them not to be believable.</p>

For one thing <br/>I would have expected B to scream loudly if he had incurred such an injury, but neither parent suggested that had happened.  The mechanism seems strange, with a gap between a bed and a cabinet wide enough for B to bump his head but not to cause the massive bruise on his cheek and the black eye.</p>

The likelihood of this happening so often in a short period seems low, but even less likely given that the same level of injury did not happen a few weeks later when he was back with the maternal grandmother.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">A final piece of the evidential jigsaw is the excuse for cancelling the health visitor on 14 July.  I am confident that the story of the stomach bug was a lie.  The parents were texting each other that day about having sex and getting a takeaway.  This is the point where the evidence concerning the maternal grandmother is particularly stark.  There are texts between her and the mother on 14 July which show beyond any doubt that she had B that day and which makes no mention of a stomach bug.  The story is a lie and the maternal grandmother has deliberately supported it.</p>

I cannot make specific findings in respect of the other bruising but, on the balance of probabilities, I find that the father hit B on other occasions during the period he was at home.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are, I acknowledge, surprising elements of the case which do support the parents&#8217; case.  B does not seem to have been reluctant to go to his parents, including to his father, which one might expect to be the case if either parent was regularly hitting him.  But children can behave in unexpected ways as can adults.  I do not put anything close to this issue as did HHJ Wicks.  Also, the fact that the parents took a series of photos when B was showing such serious injuries is an odd thing to do if one of them had caused the injuries.  However, these were photos on phones, so they may not have appreciated that they could ultimately be retrieved by the police.  I give those matters weight but, ultimately, in the balance, they are well outweighed by the other factors.  </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">In terms of looking at the case overall, I do not think I need to analyse propensity or take an overly technical or complex approach.  B had a serious head injury for which the parents put forward no possible explanation other than the one that I consider utterly improbable.  This was a five-week-old baby, never out of their care, non-mobile and rarely out of their sight.  In the times when B was out of their care, i.e. after he was taken into care the first time and after he was returned the second time to care, he incurred no serious injuries.  In the five months he returned to the parents&#8217; care there was a series of photos with very serious bruises.  In the overview is also the fact that the parents lied about 14 July.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">So the evidence here is overwhelming that the injuries were non-accidental injuries caused by, in terms of the bruising, I find, the father.  As I say, I do not think it is helpful to try and analyse this in terms of propensity, but once I have found that the father caused the skull fractures and once I have considered the nature of the bruising, and also once I consider their overall presentation in evidence, I think it is much more likely than the father caused the injuries than the mother.  I also take into account the evidence that he was struggling with B when B returned in 2021.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, I make a finding that the mother has palpably failed to protect B.  Although I accept she may not have known for certain that the father caused the injuries in 2020, she must have known what was happening in 2021.  She has, in my view, lied to the police and the court about the stomach bug, and I am confident that she has been covering up for the father.  Quite apart from all of that, at the most simple, most unanswerable level, a failure to take B to the doctor on 21 July with those facial injuries was also a failure to protect.  She has, and I say this deliberately, utterly let down a young child in her care.</p>

She was living with the father in a small house and must have known what was happening.  I therefore make a finding of failure to protect.</p>
