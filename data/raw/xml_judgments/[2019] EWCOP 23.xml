	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I have had the benefit of detailed position statements on behalf of the applicant NHS Trust and on behalf of the Official Solicitor. I have had the benefit of brief submissions in support of those documents and I also heard from Dr Press, a consultant anaesthetist, and Dr Sullivan, the consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist. I have been able to read various statements and reports, from her treating clinicians, and notes from meetings by the Official Solicitor. Over the course of the hearing on 18 June it became clear that the evidence as to the nature of the condition that was said to amount to the impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain of JP lacked clarity. It emerged from the oral evidence of the consultant gynaecologist that JP was under the care of a consultant psychiatrist in the learning disabilities team who would be able to shed light on the issue. In some situations, although unsatisfactory, this would not have represented much of a difficulty and a short delay although undesirable would have had limited impact on the ground. However given that JP was close to 36 weeks pregnant and might go into labour at any moment time was of the essence. On that basis, I indicated that were the consultant psychiatrist to confirm that JP had a learning disability, the totality of the evidence would lead me to conclude that she lacked capacity and that subject to certain amendments to the care plan it would be in her best interests for the care plan to be implemented. Time proved to be of the essence because by the morning of the 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, I was informed that JP had indeed been taken to hospital and was believed to be in the early stages of labour.  By this stage the consultant psychiatrist had indeed confirmed that JP had a mild to moderate learning disability which affected her cognitive ability. I therefore made the orders with judgment to follow.  </p>

The listing of the final hearing on a date between the 36<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 37<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> weeks of her pregnancy introduced unnecessary pressure into the process. Unless it is unavoidable because of late awareness of a pregnancy, I see no reason why it should not be possible for these applications to be issued and heard before they become time critical. </p>

Over the ensuing months those around JP have been seeking to support her through the pregnancy and to reach a decision as to how the delivery was to be managed. The team at the applicant Trust eventually concluded that the only safe way to manage the labour for JP was for her to have a caesarean section under general anaesthetic. This is contrary to JP&#8217;s wishes; she had expressed a wish to have a natural birth. However as the Trust considered JP lacked capacity to make a decision for herself this application was issued. </p>

The diagnosis that was contained in the COP 3 at paragraph 7.1 was &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">Microcephaly (behavioural disorder)</span>&#8217;.  The COP 3 stated that JP was unable to make a decision in relation to care in labour and delivery for her baby and care before and after childbirth because she is unable to understand relevant information namely she does not understand the possibility of any complications or difficulty with childbirth for either herself or the baby. The COP 3 stated that she was unable to retain that information, that she was unable to use or weigh that information and that she was unable to communicate her decision by any means at all because she refuses or is unable to discuss the possibility of any complications in childbirth or the potential need for any interventions, even in the simplest format. The COP 3 confirms that the opinion is based on her own experience of JP, that JP has said she does not want a Ceasarean and that there is no prospect that JP might regain or require capacity because &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">microcephaly is a condition that will not resolve.

The statement also referred to her contacting the learning disability team to get their opinion on whether JP lacked capacity regarding her own medical treatment and care. It does not appear that a clear answer was received from them; at least if it was it is not recorded in her statement. However in her evidence Dr Sullivan referred to the fact that JP was under the care of a consultant psychiatrist in the learning disabilities team, Dr Gomez. She gave evidence to the effect that Dr Gomez must have accepted that JP had a learning disability or he would not have accepted her as a patient under his team&#8217;s care. No evidence had been filed from Dr Gomez. Dr Sullivan said that she is the lead consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist for women with mental health or learning disability and she has extensive experience of expectant mothers with learning disabilities. She said she was satisfied that JP had a learning disability and that from her discussions with her that she lacked capacity because in particular she was unable to comprehend the risks associated with vaginal delivery either to herself or to her unborn child. Being unable to comprehend the risks meant that she was unable to take an informed decision on the means by which she delivered her child. She was clear in her opinion that JP&#8217;s lack of engagement in the decision-making process arose from her learning disability rather than from her simply being obstructive. She said that her lack of engagement was &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">due to the combination of her limited intellect being exacerbated by her stress level and the behaviour that this brings about&#8217;. </span>When the complexities of childbirth are discussed she immediately disengages and becomes distressed and aggressive and thus cannot retain, weigh or communicate information or a decision. </p>

Ms Powell submitted that the microcephaly condition was in effect a red herring and that the critical issue for the purposes of the Mental Capacity Act was whether the learning disability that Dr Sullivan said JP demonstrated was sufficient to meet the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2</ref> MCA diagnostic criteria of &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">an impairment of or a disturbance in the functioning of the mind or brain</span>&#8217;. I declined to do so. I consider that where an applicant Trust asserts that a patient is suffering from a condition such as microcephaly leading to a significant learning difficulty that appropriate evidence demonstrating the condition (microcephaly) and its consequences (learning disability or significant learning difficulties) is placed before the court. Whilst I would not rule out the possibility of a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, particularly one with the expertise of Dr Sullivan, providing the only evidence of a learning disability, it seems to me far from satisfactory in matters of such profound importance to JP for the evidence of the impairment or disturbance in the functioning of the mind or brain to come from a clinician other than a consultant psychiatrist or psychologist, particularly where it is known that JP is known to a psychiatric team. Where such evidence is likely to be available because JP is and has been under the care of a learning disabilities team for some 2 &#189; years the first port of call for such information ought to be from that specialist team, preferably the lead consultant. </p>

He concludes her condition is lifelong and affects her ability to make cognitive decisions. On making enquiries with JP&#8217;s GP it was confirmed that she was on their learning disability register and they confirmed that JP was diagnosed with microcephaly when she was 2 years old.  Dr Gomez confirms that psychological support will be provided to JP at the hospital as soon as the baby is born. He, the community nurse, and health facilitator will be there to conduct a psychiatric assessment and they will visit JP as often as is needed whilst she remains in hospital and thereafter will visit her at home when she returns to her residential unit. A consultant psychologist is also available to attend upon JP in the community. His proposed support has now been incorporated into the care plan. </p>

In particular she is unable to make a decision for herself because she does not understand the information relevant to the decision and is unable to use or weigh that information as part of the process of making the decision. The evidence from the health visitor and Dr Sullivan make it clear that many attempts have been made to convey information in a way tailored to JP&#8217;s learning disability about the process of delivery and the risks attendant upon it and the options available but because of her learning disability JP has been unable to understand that information or to use or weigh it. This inability to make a decision for herself is caused by the impairment or disturbance of the functioning of her mind or brain arising from her diagnosed learning disability. The evidence of the efforts made by the health visitor, learning disability support and Dr Sullivan make clear there is no means by which she could currently be enabled to make a decision. The lack of capacity is likely to be permanent but will certainly endure until after the baby is born </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.01in">Dr Sullivan is clear that an induced delivery or a natural vaginal delivery whilst having the benefits of being the least restrictive and in accordance with JP&#8217;s expressed preference (amongst others) carries with it very considerable risks. Dr Sullivan considers that it is highly unlikely that JP would have a successful vaginal delivery and that to attempt it would be highly risky. The evidence suggests that JP&#8217;s response to pain and distress would be to run, hide or become aggressive. If she were to seek to leave the hospital the consequences could be very serious in terms of her health; infections or haemorrhages. The process of natural childbirth would involve some degree of pain and discomfort which would be difficult to manage particularly as JP is averse to needles. An epidural would not be possible given the need for a high degree of cooperation. Gas and air has to be administered in a methodical way and in any event does not provide complete pain relief. She does not consider that JP would be able to agree to normal maternal observations to monitor her health and that of the unborn child. In the absence of such monitoring the onset of complications could not be detected placing the health of JP and the baby at risk. Likewise abdominal and vaginal examinations, and foetal monitoring. Further treatment such as intravenous antibiotics would also likely be impossible. In the event of complications JP would be likely unable to make decisions leading to delay which would place her health and that of the baby at risk. There would be an increased risk of JP requiring an emergency ceasarean section and a risk of her needing a general anaesthetic as a result of a vaginal birth. </p>

The risks of pre- hospital sedation or anaesthesia to JP are very high. However the risks range from the minor to potentially fatal. At the lower end the administration of midazolam can marginally affect CO<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span> and oxygen levels although that would potentially affect the unborn child more than the mother. It also affects the drive to breathe and the cough or gag reflex thus resulting in a higher risk of aspiration. The use of ketamine can result in hyper salivation and laryngospasm which can cause the vocal cords to shut and block the airway causing difficulty breathing. The insertion of airways can then be complicated. 2 experienced anaesthetists would therefore be present to manage these risks. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The plan envisages that JP&#8217;s baby would be removed from her after birth. The local authority have convened a pre-birth child protection case conference. It seems likely that, depending on the time of day the Caesarean section takes place, that either the local authority will immediately apply for an interim care order or EPO or that police protection powers will be used. Although the evidence as to JP&#8217;s attitude to the baby is not unambiguously positive it seems probable that she will experience great distress as a result of having undergone an operation against her expressed wishes and the separation from her baby. She will therefore need looking after very sensitively in the aftermath of this dramatic intervention in her life. I invited the Trust and the Official Solicitor to consider what amendments would be needed to make provision for this in the care plan for JP and that I would not approve it without such provision being made. I do though recognise that the evidence as to JP&#8217;s ambivalence also gives rise to the possibility that she may react differently and unexpectedly perhaps. The care package proposed by Dr Gomez has now been incorporated into the care plan. </p>

The level of pain that she experiences at the movement of the baby inside her and the distress it causes her, the level of pain that she experiences with the taking of blood, her aversion to needles, her inability to cooperate with relatively standard medical procedures all mean that a vaginal delivery will probably result in serious risks to JP&#8217;s health. It is also likely to lead to risks to the baby. Given the evidence as to JP&#8217;s response to relatively low-level pain and stress, her reaction to the far more challenging process of giving birth might result in her either seeking to flee from the hospital, or harming herself or refusing monitoring which might lead to serious complications including haemorrhaging. It is highly likely that any attempt at normal vaginal delivery would ultimately lead to the need for sedation and probably an emergency caesarean under general anaesthetic. That would be the worst of all possible outcomes. </p>

It will also maximise the chance of the baby being delivered successfully.   </p>

The evidence demonstrates that JP does not tolerate pain well and welcomes intervention which reduces pain. She appears to believe that gas and air will eliminate the pain of childbirth. Regrettably that is likely to be an erroneous belief. It is more likely that JP would experience considerable pain, discomfort and distress from the process of childbirth. This is in part a natural physical consequence but the emotional distress that she might experience will in my view be all the greater because she does not understand truly what will be happening to her. If she were able to understand the great physical and emotional toll that giving birth naturally can give rise to it seems likely that she would wish for an intervention that would minimise or eradicate that pain. Were she to have capacity I conclude that she would, along with many other expectant mothers, opt for an elective caesarean probably under general anaesthetic.   </p>

The risks attendant upon an attempted vaginal delivery are so high that they plainly outweigh the risks linked to the proposed treatment plan. The other disadvantages to JP of approving the proposed treatment plan are not such as to outweigh the overall medical advantages to her of approving it. The reality is that this is a case where the proposed treatment plan is the least worst option. There is no ideal solution. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The evidence demonstrates that JP lacks capacity to make decisions as to her antenatal care and the delivery of her baby. That lack of capacity arises from a learning disability which renders JP unable to make a decision because she is unable to understand the information relevant to the decision and to use or weigh that information as part of a process of making a decision.  The overall balance in the evaluation of JP&#8217;s best interests is thus in favour of the proposed treatment plan provided it is supplemented to address the psychological or psychiatric consequences of giving birth in this way.  </p>

Thus JP, against my evaluation of the probabilities, was able to give birth to her baby naturally. The capacity for individuals to confound judges&#8217; assessments is a reminder (to me at least) of the gap between probability and actuality. </p>
