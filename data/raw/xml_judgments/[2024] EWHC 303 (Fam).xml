On 23 July 2023, she travelled with her father to Florida for a 2 week holiday, and was due to be returned by him to England and Wales on 6 August 2023. This, he did not do. Since then there have been a series of applications to court to seek to secure Alice&#8217;s return to the jurisdiction, Alice has been made a Ward of Court, and although the father has engaged remotely on a number of occasions, he has declined direct invitations from the court to identify where he and Alice are staying, and has not returned her to this jurisdiction despite a series of orders that have required him to do so.</span></p>

The application was issued only after a further return order which she made on 18 December 2023 had expired on 11 January 2024. The matter was before her again on 5 February, and she made a further return order, which requires Alice&#8217;s return by 20 February 2024.

It is not for the defendant to establish that it was not within his/her power to do it. That burden remains on the applicant throughout, but it does not require the applicant to adduce evidence of a particular means of compliance which was available to the defendant provided the applicant can satisfy the judge so that s/he is sure that compliance was possible. The judge must determine whether s/he is sure that the defendant has not done what s/he was required to do and, if s/he has not, whether it was within his/her power to do it. Could s/he do it?

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="color:#000000">"25&#8230;. Family cases, it has long been recognised, raise different considerations from those elsewhere in the civil law. The two most obvious are the heightened emotional tensions that arise between family members and often the need for those family members to continue to be in contact with one another because they have Children together or the like. Those two factors make the task of the court, in dealing with these issues, quite different from the task when dealing with commercial disputes or other types of case in which sometimes, in fact rarely, sanctions have to be imposed for contempt of court.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.01in"><span style="color:#000000">Having said that, firstly, these cases have to come before the court on an application to commit. That is the only procedure which is available. Not surprisingly, therefore, the court is directing its mind to whether or not committal to prison is the appropriate order. But it does not follow from that that imprisonment is to be regarded as the automatic consequence of the breach of an order. Clearly it is not. There is, however, no principle that imprisonment is not to be imposed at the first occasion: see Thorpe v Thorpe <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1998] 2 FLR 127" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">[1998] 2 FLR 127</ref>, a decision of this court...</span></p>

The full range of sentencing options is not available for contempt of court. Nevertheless, there is a range of things that the court can consider. It may do nothing, make no order. It may adjourn, and in a case where the alleged contemnor has not attended court, that may be an appropriate course to take, although I would not say so in every case. It depends on the reasons that may be thought to lie behind the non-attendance. There is a power to fine. There is a power of requisition of assets and there are mental health orders. All of those may, in an appropriate case, need consideration, particularly in a case where the court has not found any actual violence proved.</span></p>

The context of having Children together, if that be the case, cannot be ignored. Sometimes that means that there is an aggravation of what has taken place, because of the greater fear that is engendered from the circumstances. Sometimes it may be mitigating, because there is reason to suppose that once the immediate emotions have calmed down, the molestation and threats will not continue.</span></p>

They do have different purposes and often the overlap is not exact, but nevertheless the court will not want, in effect, the contender to suffer punishment twice for the same events.</span></p>

In that case, Mr Lock KC concluded his consideration of whether to impose a sentence of immediate imprisonment as follows:</span></p>

I do not consider it would be appropriate to take either course for four reasons. First, this is a very serious and continuing breach of court orders. The Father has been in deliberate breach of the terms of court orders for over two years. Secondly, the Father has not just acted in breach of one court order but has breached ten orders made by the High Court. Thirdly, his defiance of the Court is continuing. Even at this stage, his counsel indicates to me that he has no intention of returning E from the UAE. Hence if a lesser penalty was to be imposed it seems inevitable that its only effect would be that the Mother would have to make a further application for contempt and on that further occasion, the court would be invited to impose a custodial sentence. Fourthly, rather than imposing a suspended sentence, it seems to me that it would be better to allow the Father a short period of time to return to the UK with E before this order takes effect rather than imposing a suspended sentence.</span></p>

Doing the best that I can based upon the available information and having regard to all of the factors set out above, it seems to me that the appropriate length of the sentence should be one of 12 months. That is a sentence which is sufficiently long to send out a message both to the Father and to others that repeated breaches of orders of the High Court have extremely serious consequences.</span></p>

In this case, I expressly invited Mr Bennett to consider with his client whether he would agree to comply with Arbuthnot J&#8217;s last order, for a return by 20 February, in which case I made clear that this application could be adjourned. The father simply declined to confirm that he would comply with that order, in the absence of what he deemed satisfactory progress between himself and the mother in mediation &#8211; of which he would be the arbiter. In other words, that unless everything was agreed to his satisfaction, he would continue to wilfully disregard the court&#8217;s orders. </span></p>

There is thus no obvious benefit to any period of adjournment or reflection, at the end of which a further application would inevitably have to be made. </span></p>

As I have said, I accept the evidence of Dr Horrocks and the guardian that a move from the mother as primary carer, especially one which would take her to Hemel, would have a significant impact upon Alice.  Alice might in the longer term adjust, but such a move should only be ordered if it will improve her overall welfare.  I cannot see that a move from the mother to the father does that.  The same problems of parental conflict will endure, but the father, of the two parents, seems less able to take on board the need to change.  He continues to lack empathy and insight.  The mother, despite her anxiety, has shown the green shoots of change (as it was put to me).  She was able, as I have commented already, to support the holiday, which is what the court required of her.  The father takes, in my judgment, an overly simplistic and fixed view of things, and his posts show that he does not see things from others&#8217; perspectives.  He needs to make very real shifts&#8230;</p>

He is well aware that if he has a grievance, he can make his case to the family court on his return with Alice to England. For him to sit in hiding with her, whilst incredibly important months of her childhood pass without direct time spent with her mother, will be the cause of serious harm not just to Alice, most importantly, but to all concerned, not least the father himself whose actions have brought upon him the serious application which is before the court today.</span></p>

If, therefore, the father has returned Alice to the jurisdiction by the time of that hearing, he can apply to the court on that day to purge his contempt, and invite the court to lift the sentence of imprisonment. If he fails to do so by that date however, then he will risk arrest on his later arrival. Clearly, he can always apply for relief from such a sanction in advance, in the event that he does decide to return Alice, but he should understand that the longer he continues to keep her away, the more likely it becomes that that sentence will in due course be imposed.</span></p>
