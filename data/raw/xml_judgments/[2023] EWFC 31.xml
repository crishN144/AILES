	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am concerned with twins, G and H, who were born in July 2019.  X is their mother.  Y is their father.  They are both 30 years of age and are nationals of a third country.  As a result of allegations made by one of their nannies, P, to the Metropolitan Police in late 2021, an emergency protection order was granted in respect of the twins in November 2021.  The local authority, then issued an application for a care order three days later, subsequent to which the children were made the subject of interim care orders three days later. At a hearing on 24 January 2022, the court approved a plan for the children to return home under 24-hour care provided by the former nannies.  The children were made wards of court and remained so until the judgment given today. The local authority, in circumstances in which I shall allude to later in this judgment, issued applications for placement orders in respect of both G and H on 13 December 2022.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This matter was listed for a fact-finding hearing in June of last year, and I shall set out what occurred at that hearing in a moment, but I reserved judgment on the fact finding to this final hearing.  The local authority&#8217;s plan is for the twins to be placed for adoption and they seek care orders and placement orders in respect of both of them.  Those plans are supported by the Children&#8217;s Guardian but are opposed by the father.  The mother in circumstances which I shall describe has not engaged in these proceedings for a very long time and her views are unknown, but I will assume she would oppose the applications made by the local authority.</p>

I take into account that the welfare best interests of the twins are the court&#8217;s paramount consideration, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(1)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref>.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I also take account that I must, when considering the issue of making placement orders, have regard to the consequences of doing so for the twins throughout the whole of their lives.

In October of that year, the father and a nanny brought the twins to the United Kingdom where the twins were cared for by nannies and lived in a separate home from mother and father which arrangement I was told is customary in wealthy families from that country.</p>

In police interview, the mother admitted doing so but the father denied it.  A few days later, on learning of the fact that P had reported allegations of child abuse to the police, the father, using a false name, falsely reported P to the police for child mistreatment and physical punishment of the children.</p>

		<p class="Quote">Y does not present with a mental health or personality disorder.  He is described as having emotionally repressed and avoidant personality style which decreases his capacity for empathy, emotional literacy, and ability to confide in others.  Overall, I would be very worried about the safety of G and H if they were to return to the care of  Y or X in the other country.  This includes a scenario of whereby the boys are cared for by paid carers but under Y&#8217;s authority.  I argue the risk of further physical harm, emotional abuse, and neglect remains high.</p>

		<p class="Quote">I am worried about Y&#8217;s potential for collusion with X and his protective capacities as well as his own capacity to inflict physical abuse and emotional harm towards his children.  There is an absence of clear, robust, and protective factors in this case.  This is concerning as the court&#8217;s findings indicate the children were subjected to repeated physical abuse, cruelty, neglect, and emotional harm by the parents.  Y continues to deny all of the court&#8217;s findings both in relation to himself and X.</p>

I outline my concerns about possible coercion, control, and dominance from X toward Y, however without disclosures from Y these remain speculative.  I can say that the relationship was not protective for the children and would increase risks if the parents reunited.  I do not identify any support services or psychological interventions that would be indicated for Y due to his avoidant psychological profile; reluctance to engage with professionals and lack of readiness to change.  I conclude this case is not suitable for a resolutions assessment.&#8221;.</p>

My decision is this is not a safe or sustainable risk management plan.  Carers employed by parents should not be used to protect children from risky parents in my view.  Indeed, the history of this case demonstrate the flaws, pitfalls, and power differentials in this kind of arrangement since the children were still subject to repeated harm and abuse despite the parents employing a nanny.</p>

There does not appear to be robust involved family network who could mitigate the risk and act independently of the parents.  A resolutions approach where the risks from the parents are so significant would also be strongly reliant upon proactive high quality and open engagement by both parents.  This is absent in this case and would make embarking on such an intervention unsafe in my view.&#8221;.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In these circumstances, I agree with the experts, the social workers, and the Guardian, that the children would be exposed to a real risk of suffering further serious physical, emotional, and psychological harm if they were returned to the care of their parents.  It would be wholly inimical to the welfare of either of the children to expose them to this risk of harm.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Unfortunately, I was unable to conclude the final welfare hearing in December and give judgment because during the course of the hearing it emerged that due to an internal error the local authority had not issued the applications for placement orders.  These were issued on 13 December last year.  I readily acknowledge that by making placement orders and the children being placed for adoption this will sever the legal and emotional bonds between the parents and the children.  I remind myself that this will have an impact on the children throughout the whole of their lives.  However, I take account of the fact that there is no subsisting relationship with the mother and they call one of their nannies &#8220;mummy&#8221;.  They do recognise the father and call him &#8220;daddy&#8221; when remote contact is taking place but the emotional bond with their father is at best tenuous.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">One of the principle submissions made on behalf of the father against the children being adopted was the loss of the benefit of their parents&#8217; considerable wealth and the loss of the right to inherit their parents&#8217; wealth in due course.  This is an important consequence to take into account.  These losses could be ameliorated if the father and/or the mother chose to make alternative financial provision for the children upon their adoption.  In any event, I am entirely satisfied that the loss of these benefits of material wealth are plainly outweighed by the very considerable benefit of enabling the children to spend the rest of their lives in a safe, loving, and nurturing family.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The choice faced by the court is stark, namely to place the children in the care of the father, where they will both be at very real risk of suffering further serious physical, emotional, and psychological harm, or being placed for adoption in a safe, loving, and nurturing family.  In my judgment, it is overwhelmingly in the welfare best interests of the children for them to be placed for adoption.  </p>
