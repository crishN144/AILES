At the conclusion of a hearing on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2015, (at which PD was neither a party nor represented), I made an order in line with the application and, as a result, PD has moved from a hospital in Ireland to a specialist unit in this country. I was satisfied that the circumstances, in particular PD&#8217;s urgent need for specialist treatment, justified such an order. But, having regard to two significant developments in the law around the time of the hearing &#8211; namely, the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re X (Court of Protection Practice)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2015/599" uk:canonical="[2015] EWCA Civ 599" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWCA Civ 599</ref> on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2015 and the coming into force on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July 2015 of amended Court of Protection Rules, in particular the new rule 3A &#8211; I listed the matter for review on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July.

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The background to this case can be summarised as follows. PD was transferred to an eating disorder programme at a hospital in Ireland in June 2014 and subsequently admitted as an involuntary patient under the Irish Mental Health Act 2001 on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2014. On 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2014, the HSE, as the statutory body in Ireland responsible for securing her welfare, made an urgent application to the Irish High Court for an order to permit the force feeding of PD, in addition to various ancillary orders. Since that date, she has been the subject of a number of court orders which have permitted the HSE to use reasonable force to enable her to undergo force-feeding and/or life saving treatment as an in-patient, including PEG feeding and naso-gastric tube feeding. In those proceedings, she has been represented by her father as her guardian ad litem, the Irish High Court having found that she lacked the capacity to conduct the proceedings. The Irish order was discharged for a short period in January 2015 but then reinstated until a date in April 2015 when PD was placed under a comprehensive after-care plan. Unfortunately, towards the end of that month, her condition deteriorated again and she was readmitted voluntarily to the same hospital unit in Ireland. On 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May, she was discharged from the unit again but a week later committed an act of self-harm and was readmitted to hospital for treatment. Due to a combination of her physical health and anorexic symptoms upon admission, she did not accept the necessary treatment and tried to leave the unit. In addition, she was expressing suicidal thoughts and was considered by her treating team to have lost capacity to make decisions as regard medical treatment and the intake of food. She was therefore re-certified under the 2001 Act and placed on one-to-one special nursing. On 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2015, the earlier orders of the Irish High Court were reinstated. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The HSE then identified a placement for PD in a specialist unit in England and a bed was made available for her with effect from 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June. Her treating team in Ireland concluded that she had undergone all the treatment options available in that country and that the placement at the unit in this country would provide her with one last opportunity to get the necessary medical and clinical care she so urgently requires. On 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2015, an order was made by the President of Irish High Court providing for the compulsory admission for treatment of PD to the unit in England on a time-limited basis and subject to the continuing oversight of the Irish High Court. The parties to the Irish proceedings, including PD&#8217;s father acting as guardian ad litem, agreed, with the endorsement of the Irish High Court, that the HSE should take urgent steps to seek recognition and enforcement of the relevant measures contained in the order of 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June so as to secure authority in this country for the placement and treatment of PD at the unit, protection for her rights under ECHR whilst admitted and treated there, and recognition of the continued jurisdiction of the Irish High Court over the person of PD whilst she is physically present in this country. The application was particularly urgent because, as described in detail in medical reports put before the Irish High Court and before this court, the treatment options for PD in Ireland had been exhausted and it was essential that she be admitted to the unit in England as quickly as possible. In view of the urgency, the HSE submitted that the order be made on the basis that PD would not at this stage be made a party to the proceedings, but acknowledging that, in the event that PD indicated that she wished to challenge any aspect of the order, the HSE would take steps to ensure that the matter returned to the Court of Protection forthwith for further directions. The HSE submitted that, in light of the urgency of the matter and the fact that PD had been represented in the Irish proceedings by her guardian ad litem, even if the court did wish to consider questions of her party status, that should not operate as a bar to the immediate recognition and enforcement of the order at the hearing listed before this court on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_5">
	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At that hearing, I made an order (in terms that closely followed the orders made in the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">PA</span> case) including a declaration, pursuant to Schedule 3, that the protective measures of the Irish High Court contained in its order dated 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June should be recognised and enforceable in this jurisdiction. I joined the Trust responsible for the unit in this country as respondent, but excused them from attending any hearing unless so advised. The order recited that the court had concluded, after an evaluation of the information presented, that it was satisfied that the deprivation of PD&#8217;s liberty had been subject to sufficient scrutiny and effective procedural safeguards before the Irish High Court (and on a preliminary basis before this court) to obviate the need for PD to be joined as a party for the purposes of making an urgent order, but that the matter of her participation (including the question whether she was required to be a party) should be considered at a further hearing listed for 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July. As indicated above, the Official Solicitor was invited to attend the hearing (and I later clarified that his attendance was intended to be as advocate to the court). In addition, PD&#8217;s father was also invited to attend the hearing. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> June, the Irish High Court made a further order providing for the transfer of PD from the specialist unit to a local general hospital in this country should her health so require, and providing (under paragraph 5 of the order) that the general hospital was permitted to rely on the authority granted by the Irish orders in facilitating such care as is deemed necessary and in her interests. Under paragraph (B) of the order, the Irish High Court added: &#8220;for the avoidance of doubt and save in the event that the provision of such is necessary immediately to save [PD]&#8217;s life, paragraph 5 does not stand as authority to the [general hospital] either to carry out or withhold treatment constituting serious medical treatment (as defined in Practice Direction 9E to the Court of Protection Rules 2007) such authority must be sought by the Plaintiff from this Honourable Court [i.e. the Irish Court].&#8221; On the same day, I made a further order on the papers (without any representations from PD) declaring that this supplemental order be recognised and enforceable.</p>

It is plain from the way in which Schedule 3 paragraph 19(3) is drafted that the Court only has a discretion to decline to recognise a foreign order if all three of the conditions in the subparagraph are satisfied. In other words, the Court only has a discretion to disapply a measure in a foreign order if it &#8220;thinks&#8221; that the case in which the measure was taken was not urgent <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">and</span> the adult was not given the opportunity to be heard <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">and</span> that omission amounted to a breach of natural justice.

It could then be argued that the observations of the judges of the Court were (at best) obiter dicta or (possibly) merely dicta. It would, however, be extremely unwise for any judge at first instance to ignore what was said by the Court of Appeal. On the contrary, I consider that I must treat the dicta as the strongest possible indication of how the Court of Appeal would rule on the question before it, in the event that the issue returns to that Court as part of a legitimate appellate process. </p>

In secure accommodation proceedings, as indeed in care proceedings, the child is a party. What this might indicate, it seems to me, is that it is generally considered indispensable in this country for the person&#8217;s whose liberty is at stake automatically to be a party to the proceedings in which the issue is to be decided. The President&#8217;s conclusion that it was unnecessary for this to be so in relation an adult without capacity appears therefore to run counter to normal domestic practice. It might, therefore, be thought to require very firm foundations if it is to be regarded as acceptable.&#8221;</p>

Secondly, it depends entirely on the reliability and completeness of the information transmitted to the court by those charged with the task.

The Schedule A1 procedure (with the initial authorisation conferred by the local authority but with provision for a challenge under section 21A) has been accepted as providing appropriate safeguards in relation to deprivation of liberty and I entirely accept that it could be extended to cover a wider category of case. Furthermore, I accept that it might be possible to take the best of that procedure and to devise a less complex process which will still protect those whose liberty is in the balance. I cannot agree with the President, however, that the streamlined scheme he devised provides the elements required for compliance with Article 5. I stress that I am only concerned, at present, with whether P must be a party to deprivation of liberty proceedings.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of the HSE, Mr Setright and Mr Ruck Keene submit that joinder of PD as a party is neither compulsory nor necessary on the facts of this case. They point out that, unlike in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re X</span>, the Court here is not concerned with an application for an order under section 16(2)(a), or under section 21A, but rather for the recognition of an order authorising the deprivation of liberty in a process in Ireland in which PD was given a full opportunity to participate. Within the compass of the &#8220;limited review&#8221; identified as being necessary by this court in the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">PA</span> case to ensure compliance with the Court&#8217;s obligations under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref> and ECHR, the concerns expressed by Black LJ could and should lead to a clear focus on the matters already identified as relevant by paragraph 19(3) of Schedule 3, that is to say whether the adult concerned was given the opportunity to be heard and, if not, whether that omission amounted to a breach of natural justice. Further or alternatively, they point out that the new rule 3A requires the Court in each case to decide how P is to participate in the proceedings. As an example of how such a scheme might work, they point to the recent decision of Mostyn J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Bournemouth BC v PS and DS</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2015/39" uk:canonical="[2015] EWCOP 39" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWCOP 39</ref>, in which the learned judge discharged P as a party having been wholly satisfied that his voice had been fully heard on the question of deprivation of liberty through his independent mental capacity advocate. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By way of further analogy, Mr Setright and Mr Ruck Keene also refer to the Hague Child Protection Convention 1996 and the Council Regulation (EC) 2201/2003, commonly known as Brussels II Revised. Under these instruments,  children are not automatically parties to applications for recognition and enforcement of foreign orders brought under Family Procedure Rules 2010 Part 31. Indeed, FPR 31.8(2)(b) specifically provides that, where the application is for registration of a foreign judgment (either under the 1996 Convention or Brussels II Revised), the court will not accept submissions from any child in relation to whom the judgment was given. Mr Setright and Mr Ruck Keene do not argue that there is a similar bar to any adult who is the subject of a protective measure being considered under Schedule 3 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> making submissions or being made a party to applications brought under the Schedule, but rely on these instruments in support of their proposition that joinder of the subject of a foreign order is not an essential prerequisite on an application for its recognition and enforcement.</p>

Mr Rees submits that, notwithstanding the description by Hedley J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re MN (Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Protective Measures)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2010/1926" uk:canonical="[2010] EWHC 1926 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWHC 1926 (Fam)</ref> of applications under Schedule 3 as being &#8220;summary and mandatory&#8221; (paragraph 28), the questions arising under such application (as analysed by this Court in the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">PA</span> decision), are in fact more substantial and provide a context within which the court must consider what it needs to do to ensure that the adult&#8217;s voice is properly heard. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Rees acknowledges that the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re X</span> was only considering applications brought under the original jurisdiction of the Court of Protection and that an order recognising and enforcing a foreign order is not a welfare order as defined by section 16A(4)(b). He submits, however, that recognition and enforcement of the Irish order depriving PD of her liberty cannot proceed without the authorisation of this Court and that the issue of how ECHR rights are to be respected is a matter of substance and not form. In oral submissions, Mr Rees observed that, although the substantive decision depriving PD of her liberty was one of the Irish court, the authorisation for the deprivation of liberty in this country derives from this court&#8217;s order for recognition and enforcement and, without such authorisation, the Irish order is &#8220;nothing but a piece of paper&#8221;. Although the review to be conducted by this court is necessarily limited as explained in the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">PA</span> decision, it is necessary to ensure that this country&#8217;s own obligations under Articles 5, 6 and 8 of ECHR are met and that an appropriate process for securing PD&#8217;s participation in the Schedule 3 proceedings needs to be adopted. Manifestly, this can be achieved by joining her as a party to the proceedings. Mr Rees accepted that an alternative course might be to make some other order within Rule 3A (2). In his submission, however, it is difficult to see how her participation in the proceedings could be adequately secured if the Court were to proceed without making any direction under Rule 3A at all.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In oral submissions, Mr Rees further contended that a direction short of joinder as a party could fall foul of the difficulties identified by Black LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re X</span> at paragraph 100. Unless the adult concerned in the proceedings is joined as a party, or another course under rule 3A(2) is adopted, the Court will be depending &#8220;entirely on the reliability and completeness of the information transmitted to the court by those charged with the task&#8221;, who will usually, as in this case, be the very persons who have sought to deprive the adult of her liberty in the court of origin. Mr Rees therefore concludes that care should be taken to ensure that a genuine opportunity is given to any adults such as PD for his or her voice to be heard when the Court considers the questions required to be scrutinised by an application under Schedule 3.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Rees goes on to make some specific submissions relating to the present case. First, he draws attention to the provision in clause (B) of the supplemental order of the Irish court dated 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> June 2015 (quoted at paragraph 6 above). Mr Rees points out that, under Schedule 3 paragraph 7(1)(c), the Court of Protection is able to exercise its &#8220;full, original jurisdiction&#8221; in relation to an adult present in this country if the matter is urgent. He submits that clause (B) of the Irish order of 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> June purports to oust the coordinate jurisdiction of the Court of Protection in this regard and raises the possibility that such an attempted ouster could be seen as manifestly contrary to public policy and therefore opens the door to the court refusing recognition under schedule 3 paragraph 19(4). Mr Setright and Mr Ruck Keene respond that this is intended as protection for PD and clarifies that a treating general hospital may not seek to carry out serious medical treatment upon her without further authority being sought by the HSE from the Irish High Court. Were such authority to be sought and granted, the next step would be an application for recognition and enforcement in this country for purposes of implementing the measure here. They submit therefore that it does not offend against any principle of public policy. I agree with their submission on this issue.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_28">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, Mr Rees identifies a concern as to the extent to which PD&#8217;s father is able to represent her in an even-handed and balanced way in the Irish proceedings, given that he was instrumental in bringing about her hospitalisation and ultimate transfer to the specialist unit in this country. He submits that there are grounds for believing that PD&#8217;s ability to challenge her detention in Ireland is limited with no clear mechanism to ensure that her own views, as opposed to those of her father, are placed before the Irish court. In effect, therefore, he invites the Court to review its decision not to refuse recognition under Schedule 3 paragraph 19(3).  In response, Mr Setright and Mr Ruck Keene submit that, were the court to accept without question the submissions by the Official Solicitor as to the ability of PD&#8217;s father to represent his daughter before the Irish court, it would essentially be concluding that the Irish proceedings were a sham. This would, they submit, be a very profound step to take. They accept, however, that it is the ongoing responsibility of the court considering an application under Schedule 3 to consider as required by paragraph 19(3) whether the adult was given an opportunity to be heard, and, if not, whether that omission amounted to a breach of natural justice. In this context, Mr Setright very properly drew attention to a transcript of the hearing before the Irish High Court on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2014 which led to the appointment of PD&#8217;s father as guardian ad litem. Mr Setright pointed out that, up to that point, the HSE had been proposing the instruction of a professional guardian.</p>

	  <num>29.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, Mr Rees submits that PD appears to have fluctuating capacity and that in those circumstances the wide terms of the Irish orders, which promote the indefinite imposition of medical treatment and the use of force and restraint, may go beyond what is permissible when the only apparent trigger for a review of the Irish orders is if PD no longer meets the criteria for detention under the Irish Mental Health Act. In reply, Mr Setright and Mr Ruck Keene submitted that Mr Rees&#8217;s observation as to the open-ended nature of the deprivation of liberty do not take into account either the regularity of the reviews that have in fact taken place before the Irish Court or the requirement specifically referred to in the Irish order of 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2015 for the HSE to obtain regular updates from the specialist unit in this country to be provided to the Irish court.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, Mr Rees submits that, in the absence of specific rules governing applications for recognition and enforcement under Schedule 3, the court may wish to consider the extent to which it is appropriate for such applications to be disposed of on a &#8220;without notice&#8221; basis. In the present case, this court made an order which essentially recognised and enforced the Irish order but then listed it for review. Mr Rees submits that a better approach (which was in fact adopted in two of the cases in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">PA</span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">)</span> would be if an initial inter partes hearing is impracticable for any recognition and enforcement to be for a limited period of time. On this point, Mr Setright and Mr Ruck Keene submit that each case will turn on its own facts and require a different approach depending on the circumstances. In some cases, faced with a without notice application for recognition, the court will refuse relief. In other cases, the court may be persuaded at a without notice hearing that the urgent circumstances require an interim form of relief to be granted but then identify matters to be reconsidered or investigated further at a further hearing. Such a course of action provides urgent short term relief but requires at the same time a further hearing to ensure that the provisions of Schedule 3 are satisfied. In a third category of case, the court may  be satisfied, on the information before it, that it is appropriate to make an indefinite order for the recognition and enforcement of the protective measure without any further hearing. In this case, Mr Setright and Mr Ruck Keene submit that, if the court feels on reflection, having regard to the more detailed information now available as to the proceedings in the Irish court, that a further review is required, it would be appropriate for this court to give directions requiring the HSE to revert to the Irish court, identifying those areas in respect of which it would require further assistance in order to extend the recognition and enforcement of the order in this country.</p>

They were not asked to consider applications for the recognition and enforcement of foreign orders under Schedule 3.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In fact, this lies at the heart of the process of recognition and enforcement provided in Schedule 3. As set out above, paragraph 19(3) requires the court to consider whether the adult was given an opportunity to be heard before the court of origin and, if not, whether that omission amounted to a breach of natural justice. Save in cases of urgency, this gives the Court power to refuse recognition of orders if it considers that such a breach of natural justice has occurred. If, however, the adult has been given such an opportunity, the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Winterwerp</span> criteria as reiterated by the ECtHR on many occasions, most recently in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">M.S v Croatia (2)</span>, supra, will have been satisfied.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Each case will turn on its own facts. In some cases, the court will conclude that the adult needs to be joined as a party immediately. In other cases, the court will adopt one or other of the alternative methods provided in Rule 3(A)(2). In a third category of case, the court will be satisfied on the information before it that the requirements of Schedule 3 are satisfied without taking any of the measures provided by Rule 3A(2)(a)-(d). In very urgent cases, the court may conclude that an interim order should be made without any representation by or on behalf of the adult, but direct that the question of representation should be reviewed at a later hearing. Such a course seems to me to be consistent with the analysis of Black LJ at paragraph 104 of <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re X.</span> In every case, however, when carrying out that analysis, the court must be alive to the danger identified by Black LJ, at paragraph 100 in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re X</span> that the process may depend &#8220;entirely on the reliability and completeness of the information transmitted to the court by those charged with the task&#8221; who may &#8220;be the very person/organisation seeking authorisation for P to be deprived of his liberty&#8221;.</p>

It is therefore to be hoped that the scheme for accreditation is swiftly established.

As a result, in such cases there is likely to be repeated requests to scrutinise a succession of orders. Recognition and enforcement is likely to require close co-operation, not only between the medical and social care authorities of the two countries, but also between the Courts and legal systems. The Convention provides a mechanism using the Central Authorities but, pending ratification of the Convention, there may well be the need for direct communication between judges of the two jurisdictions.&#8221;</p>

At the time of the hearing before me on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2015, I was satisfied, applying Schedule 3 paragraph 19, that the protective measures should be recognised. I have now had an opportunity to consider the transcript of the hearing in November 2014 at which PD&#8217;s father was appointed guardian ad litem and with that in mind have looked at the evidence of PD&#8217;s wishes and feelings which were before the Irish court. That evidence comprised, so far as I can see, principally her comments as recorded in the reports of the treating doctors. Now that the urgency of her circumstances has lessened and PD has been admitted to the unit in this country, I consider that I should ask the Irish court for clarification as to how PD was given, and is currently being given, an opportunity to be heard on the issue of her deprivation of liberty. I make this request to facilitate the limited scrutiny required by Schedule 3. I shall therefore adjourn this matter to a date to be fixed in the week of 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July for a further hearing with a time estimate of 1 hour. I ask the HSE urgently to draw my comments to the attention of the Irish High Court.</p>

In the circumstances of this case, I consider that this course lies within the scope of the flexible provisions of Rule 3A(2), in particular paragraph (e). Whether or not further steps are necessary to secure P&#8217;s interests and position at or after that hearing will depend in part on the further information presented to the court. I do not rule out taking one or other of the steps provided for in Rule 3A(2) at that stage.
