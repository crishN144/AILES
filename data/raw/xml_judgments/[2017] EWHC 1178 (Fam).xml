Accordingly, she attained the age of eighteen on 31</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">st</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> January 2017 and is now aged eighteen.  She is of Pakistani descent and is currently a citizen of Pakistan and no other state.  She is the younger of the two daughters of the marriage of her parents.  Tragically, that marriage broke down and her parents became divorced.  Even more tragically, her mother died several years ago after a long and heroic struggle with cancer. </span></p>

She already has an offer of a place at Oxford University, and is clearly a person of great achievement.  She herself strongly desires to be adopted by her aunt, whom she clearly now regards as her parent in the sad circumstances that I have briefly described.</span></p>

Undoubtedly, both the person to be adopted and the applicant are habitually resident in the United Kingdom, but that does not seem to me in any way at all to diminish the importance of the Home Office and Secretary of State for the Home Department being able to make submissions, if they or she wish, in a situation such as this.  </span></p>

However, counsel has also readily accepted that the making and fact of an adoption order would be liable considerably to strengthen any subsequent application which the person to be adopted might make for the grant of British citizenship.  It seems to me that even in a situation in which British citizenship is not automatically conferred by the making of an adoption order, it is still necessary and important that notice should be given to the Home Office before the making of the adoption order, rather than that on a subsequent application for citizenship the Home Office should be presented with the fait accompli of an adoption order having been made. </span></p>

That may or may not be so, but it does not seem to me to be any reason for not giving prior notice and the opportunity for doing so. </span></p>

That sub-section merely employs the phrase &#8220;on the date of the application.&#8221;  As counsel for the applicant submitted today, it may strongly be argued that &#8220;the date of the application&#8221; should not be the date when staff in the court office got around to &#8220;issuing&#8221; an application, but rather the actual date upon which the application was lodged with the court.  That said, any application may have to be one which sufficiently complies with the requirements of the rules and the prescribed forms.  To take an extreme example, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/49/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 49 (4)</ref> would be unlikely to be satisfied by simply lodging with the court some very informal form of application, such as a letter. </span></p>
