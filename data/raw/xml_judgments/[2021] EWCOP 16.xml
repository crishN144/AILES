But<span style="font-weight:bold"/>this is an insidious virus, and NZ contracted it in January this year. I am told that she was deeply fearful of the virus and had somehow sensed she would be vulnerable to it. She had, her sister told me, contacted the NHS health line, when she first became unwell and was advised to rest and take care of herself. According to her sister, her condition worsened, and she was worried that if she went in to hospital she might not come out. I do not know, nor can I evaluate, the accuracy of this, although I do not, for a moment, doubt the sincerity of the perception. What is clear is that NZ&#8217;s condition deteriorated dramatically. She was admitted by ambulance to hospital on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2021. </p>

Her treating clinicians were concerned that her pregnancy might be exacerbating her difficulty in breathing, due to the enlargement of the uterus. The following day a decision was made to deliver NZ&#8217;s baby by emergency caesarean section. Because she had known that she was carrying a boy, she had already selected a name for him, MZ, which he now bears. Following the delivery of her son, NZ&#8217;s condition continued to deteriorate and within a short time, her oxygen levels became dangerously low.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It was necessary, within 48 hours of her admission to transfer NZ to an intensive care unit. This took place on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd </span>January 2021. Mr H, Director of ECMO, commenced a number of treatments. He gave evidence before me and filed a statement, dated 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> February 2021. I found his evidence to be kind, reflective and unwaveringly focused upon his patient. Mr H is the clinical lead consultant for ECMO, which is a highly specialised area of medicine. He has held that post for 9 years. The ECMO essentially involves oxygenating a patient&#8217;s blood; unlike a ventilator, it provides a mechanical ventilation that does not superimpose breathing on a patient but allows a patient&#8217;s own breathing to be supported. For NZ an accompanying sedative regime was put in place to help repress her periodic agitation and discomfort. Pain relief, by morphine, has also been given, as well as anti-biotic and anti-fungal medication, designed to reduce the risk of almost inevitable infection. </p>

I had the firm impression that, for this 32-year-old woman, in this most tragic of circumstances, he had wanted to try anything that was possible. The supported ventilation responding to the patient&#8217;s own breathing is designed to enable the patient to rest, so that their lungs can have the opportunity to recover from damage and scarring. In that sense, it is not a proactive treatment; it is designed to help the lungs recover. In order to provide it, cannulas are inserted into the patient&#8217;s blood vessels to enable blood to be transported from the body into the ECMO machine, a process which Mr H referred to as a cycle.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">He further explained that due to the nature of the treatment, ECMO has, at least until recent times, only really been considered as a viable option for patients who are otherwise regarded as fit, prior to their admission.  It is rarely administered to those over the age of 70, as those in that age group have diminished lung capacity and is only generally used for patients whose clinical condition places them at a 40% (or lower) chance of survival, despite having received all other intensive care treatments.  During the course of the pandemic, the use of ECMO has increased approximately by a third. On average, 25% of patients do not recover. However, those patients who are placed on ECMO in consequence of conditions which are sequelae of symptoms arising from Covid-19 infection, have lower success rates than previously seen with other conditions. Mr H emphasises that there are a range of factors to take into account, he observed that fewer than 50% of ECMO patients have been recovering in this second wave of the pandemic. </p>

Mr P,  a consultant in intensive care, has spoken with the family; so too have Dr D and Dr S. There was a belief, and a hope, that the doctors and the family were progressing towards an agreement as to the way forward. But as the days passed, that consensus, if it was ever there, evaporated. Because of the escalating gravity of NZ&#8217;s situation, the Trust have made their application this afternoon to have withdrawal from the ECMO declared as being in their patient&#8217;s best interests.  </p>

Mr H explained that a patient in NZ&#8217;s condition requires a high degree of intensive care. This, NZ does not find easy to accept. She becomes agitated and displays signs of discomfort. Many patients receiving ECMO, Mr H tells me, are alert enough to communicate. NZ, however, is described as being in a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;pharmacologically induced coma&#8217;</span>. There have been multiple attempts to reduce the level of sedation, but whenever this has been attempted,  it has led to a significant reduction in NZ&#8217;s blood oxygen levels and to her increased distress, exhibited by visible grimacing. In the absence of any prospect of recovery her present circumstances are irreconcilable with any clinical evaluation of her best interests. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On the 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2021, a multi-disciplinary meeting was convened, and there was a unanimous conclusion that the focus of NZ&#8217;s treatment could no longer be the preservation of her life, but should move to palliative care, intended to promote her comfort and her dignity. Mr Karim pressed Mr H on the analysis that underpinned the conclusion of the clinical team. He identified four central aspects to his reasoning: Firstly, NZ&#8217;s lungs, for the reasons he described, and which I have set out above, have become too fragile to withstand any further surgical intervention. This presents a high risk of bleeding and to a degree that would be both fatal to her and very distressing. Getting the balance of the clotting functioning right, with the heparin medication, has become a delicate and risky process. Secondly, NZ&#8217;s overall condition has now so deteriorated as to permit no realistic chance of recovery. Mr Karim pressed as to whether there might be a slim or vestigial hope but Mr H, considered that the prospect is, as he put it, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;zero&#8217;. </span>Thirdly, Mr H considered that the continuing connection to the ECMO machine places her at risk of both a fatal bleed and a potentially distressing death. </p>

Professor A was consulted; he is a Professor of Respiratory Medicine and Intensive Care. Sadly, he agreed that there is evidence that NZ&#8217;s lungs have continued to deteriorate despite the ECMO treatment and concluded that there is no chance of her recovering. </p>

But they are all patients in whom a trajectory of improvement is identified relatively quickly. He told me that, having regard to the views of the clinical team and to the second opinion from Professor A, he had come to the conclusion that he had passed a stage where he was seeking to preserve his patient&#8217;s life, but had reached a point where he was, in reality, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;prolonging her death&#8217;</span>. Though he expressed himself in sensitive terms, he signalled, to my mind, unambiguously, that he had reached a threshold beyond which further treatment would be professionally unethical.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">NZ&#8217;s husband and sister take a different view. This is not grounded in any real difference as to the medical situation; it is, for them, a conflict between a religious belief, genuinely and devoutly held, and medical science. It is a conflict which cannot be reconciled. To condone any act that would be seen to bring life to an end would, the family believe, be inconsistent with their faith. They recognise the medical evidence and engage with it. In particular, they accept that continuation of treatment may cause NZ to suffer but consider that such suffering is the will of God and attracts God&#8217;s love. MA told me that such suffering is to be welcomed and that NZ would welcome it. It is through suffering that we know God, he explained. This principle echoes not only throughout Islam, but throughout the whole of the Judeo-Christian tradition. It poses real ethical dilemmas for those who understand their faith in these uncompromising and uncompromisable terms. I do not doubt that these are the genuinely held beliefs of NZ&#8217;s husband. Her sister also articulated them with equal force, though I note she required to be prodded to do so by her brother-in-law. I think it is likely that NZ, had she confronted this dilemma, would, in principle, have expressed the same religious view as her family. I am quite sure that she would have wanted to do all that she could to be with her children.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Evaluation of &#8216;best interests&#8217;, as all counsel have impressed upon me, is not confined to medical opinion alone, nor religious beliefs in isolation, nor even an assessment of wishes and feelings. Identifying best interests requires the broad canvas of NZ&#8217;s life, circumstances and needs to be considered in their totality. Alongside this it must also be recognised that a court will never seek to compel or encourage a medical professional to act in a way that he or she considers unethical. The central imperative in medicine is to do good. Here the medical evidence establishes that continued ECMO treatment would achieve no benefit and cause continuing, potentially escalating, harm. I accept that evidence.  </p>

As I have said above, I accept that. Mr Karim argues that an adjournment of 48 to 72 hours to obtain a further opinion as to the futility and prospects of any treatment, along with  a further CT scan to assess any developments would assist the family in coming to terms with NZ&#8217;s situation and, he suggests, this is what NZ herself would have wanted. This cannot be reconciled with NZ&#8217;s medical needs nor will it likely resolve the family&#8217;s religious and ethical dilemma.  </p>

A young family split apart prematurely; their grief is raw and palpable. It is almost beyond human empathy; the pain is so obvious and visible that there is an instinct to seek to recoil from it. As I have set out, the care plan contemplates that NZ and her family will be together at the end. It is structured to avert further pain and its central premise is to promote NZ&#8217;s dignity at the end of her life. The objective here is not to shorten her life, but as Mr H has, in my judgment correctly identified, to avoid the prolongation of her death. NZ will have her husband and family with her at the end. That is a right that many have, of necessity, been denied in the last 12 months. Their loss has underscored the importance of this final contact for those for whom it can be achieved. I should like to say finally, that RZ and MA could not have expressed themselves more forcefully, sincerely or with greater eloquence. They could have done no more for their wife and sister and I hope that brings some peace for them.  </p>
