Over the last 30 years Parliament has moved steadily towards the codification of the Law in relation to children. The <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> provided a new statutory framework in relation to children. One aim of the Children Act was to create a statutory code whereby welfare issues in relation to children would almost exclusively be dealt with through the provisions of that Statute. In relation to private law cases this would be largely through <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> orders and in relation to public law cases via Part 4 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.</p>

However wherever possible following the enactment of the Children Act, orders in respect of a child subject to the jurisdiction of England and Wales were to be dealt with by the making of orders under the Children Act rather than under the court's inherent jurisdiction. In public law cases that principle is reflected in the restriction of the use of the court's inherent jurisdiction imposed by section 100 of the Children Act.</p>

It does this by restricting the use of the inherent jurisdiction to cases of urgency where the child is present in England and Wales (regardless of his or her habitual residence). To my mind, the two critical elements necessary in order to permit the court to exercise its inherent jurisdiction are identified in the subsection by the use of the word "immediate" and the clause "necessary for his protection".</p>

I do not however accept Mr Wilkinson's argument that having once exercised his discretion on the 3rd February 2010, the issue of jurisdiction is now res judicata or that Recorder Setright QC, sitting on 8th March 2010, by making the directions he did was in some way accepting the jurisdiction of the English Courts.</p>

I have no doubt that it would be more convenient for this mother to contest the litigation in England.

The fact remains that the Statute, is unambiguous in stating that, for the twelve months after a removal without the permission of a father with parental responsibility, a child will continue to be habitually resident in the country from where she was removed. The Act is equally clear that this court can only make section 8 orders if the child is habitually resident in England and Wales or is present in England and Wales, and is not habitually resident elsewhere in the United Kingdom.</heading>
