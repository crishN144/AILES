If much of this jurisprudence is, in the nature of things, little more than judicial exegesis on <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65" uk:canonical="1960 (8 &amp; 9 Eliz. 2) c. 65" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Administration of Justice Act 1960</ref> and on the decision of the House of Lords in 2004 in <span style="font-style:italic">In re S (Identification: Restrictions on Publication) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2004/47" uk:canonical="[2004] UKHL 47" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] UKHL 47</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 AC 593" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 AC 593</ref>, the continuing vitality of this branch of judicial endeavour reflects the ever-changing nature of our world: the enormous changes, still only dimly contemplated in 2004, brought about both by the advance of the internet and, in particular, of social media (as to which see <span style="font-style:italic">Re J (Reporting Restriction: Internet: Video) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/2694" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 2694 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 2694 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2014] 1 FLR 523" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] 1 FLR 523</ref>, paras 41-43) and by the significantly changing views, both in the family justice system itself and in society at large, as to what is required of our family justice system.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I make these observations because the present case raises, at least in some of its aspects, novel points and because its focus is on a judgment delivered by Singer J as long ago as October 2002 &#8211; a time when approaches to transparency were very different from what they are today. In this connection I draw attention to two striking changes. In 2002, the general assumption was that only judgments perceived as having some <span style="font-style:italic">legal </span>interest to the profession would be published. Nowadays, there is a wider understanding that, because the general public has an interest in knowing what the family courts are doing, day in and day out, publication of judgments is no longer confined to those of only <span style="font-style:italic">legal </span>interest. In 2002, BAILII published only 8 first-instance judgments in family cases; in 2017, the corresponding figure was 336.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"><span/><marker name="tab"/>In saying this, I recognise that in 2002 many judgments were reported in law reports without being published on BAILII, whereas nowadays almost every judgment which is reported in a law report is first published on BAILII. But the essential point remains.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is another respect in which the world of 2002 was significantly different from our world. With increasing emphasis since the introduction of the Family Procedure Rules 2010, and even more so since the subsequent implementation of the reforms recommended by the Family Justice Review, the guiding principle of the family courts today &#8211; both the Family Division and the Family Court &#8211; is the imperative need for robust case management by an allocated judge who provides judicial continuity. This robust case management is underpinned by the &#8220;overriding objective&#8221; (FPR Part 1), which spells out the court&#8217;s duty (FPR 1.4) to &#8220;further the overriding objective by actively managing cases&#8221; and makes clear that this includes deciding which issues are or are not to be resolved and (read in conjunction with FPR 22.1) gives the court extensive powers to control the evidence which is to be adduced. This robust case management is facilitated, first, by the rigorously enforced principle that what is to be done is confined to what is &#8220;necessary&#8221; to enable the court to decide the case fairly and justly (the test which determines what issues the court will decide, what witnesses, including expert witnesses, will be called and whether or not an adjournment will be permitted) and, secondly, by a deliberately prescriptive Practice Direction (PD27A) which lays down the format, contents and size of the bundle to be used at every hearing. The culture of the family courts in 2002 was very different. It is impossible to know, and it would be both inappropriate and almost certainly fruitless to investigate, to what extent the case that Singer J had to grapple with in 2002 might have benefitted from the tools now available to the family courts.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Singer J had been hearing private law proceedings &#8211; what he described as a &#8220;long drawn out litigation of attrition&#8221; &#8211; between a mother (M) and a father (F) in relation to their little daughter (G) who was then just two years old. As I write, G is still, in law, a child, though she will shortly reach her eighteenth birthday. The proceedings before Singer J were complicated and protracted: the hearing lasted some three weeks and the extempore judgment, delivered over two days, occupies 110 pages of the Official Transcript. The parties before Singer J were all represented by Leading Counsel: M by the late Mrs Sally Bradley QC; F by Mr Peter Jackson QC, as he then was; and G&#8217;s guardian by Mr Paul Storey QC. Although the only issue directly before Singer J for decision related to G &#8211; should she live with M or F and what contact should the non-residential parent have? &#8211; the investigation conducted by Singer J, like his judgment, necessarily, in the unusual and difficult circumstances of the case, ranged much wider. For reasons which will become apparent in due course, I do not propose to go into detail. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The immediate point is that (see further below) the trial bundle before Singer J was, as he put it, &#8220;voluminous&#8221; &#8211; it ran to well over 30 files &#8211; and the case, but for an 89-page chronology prepared by the father&#8217;s team, would, he said, have been &#8220;unmanageable.&#8221; There is another point that needs to be borne in mind. Then, as now, the trial bundle may contain documents, sometimes as in this case many, many documents, which never find their way on to the court file (the court file in this case is of the order of one foot thick and obviously contains only a very small part of the material contained in the trial bundle). Then, as now, the trial bundle is <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>retained by the court, being returned to the parties or destroyed once the proceedings have concluded. The consequence is that the court no longer knows what was or was not included in the trial bundle that Singer J had.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"><span/><marker name="tab"/>At a very late stage during the final hearing, M revealed that she still had in her possession her copy of the trial bundle.

G had another older half-brother, BB, then aged 15 and living with his (BB&#8217;s) father, to whom Singer J also made significant reference in his judgment. Singer J recorded that by the date of the hearing M had &#8220;effectively lost contact&#8221; with BB.</p>

Shortly after delivering this judgment, Singer J heard a separate application by B for contact with G: he decided that there should be twice-yearly supervised contact. Contact broke down in 2005, since when B, despite various attempts on his part, has not seen G.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to the dissemination of his judgment, and so far as material for present purposes, Singer J did four things. First, he accepted undertakings from both M and F not to communicate with the media. Secondly, he made provision for certain limited disclosure of the judgment to B. Thirdly, he reserved to the court (specifically himself) the question of disclosure of the judgment to G. Fourthly, and for reasons which he explained in his judgment but which, for the reasons I have already given, I do not propose to set out in this judgment, Singer J said that &#8220;there might be positive disadvantages in re-opening all these issues in [a] public forum.&#8221;</p>

First, absent an appeal, Singer J&#8217;s judgment and findings of fact are not disturbed by the passage of time. Secondly, the undertaking was expressed as being &#8220;until further order&#8221; and therefore has to be complied with unless and until the court discharges or modifies it. Being &#8220;until further order&#8221; it is <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>in any way affected by G reaching her majority. M asks how she could reasonably be expected to know that, and suggests that she gave the undertaking while &#8220;beaten emotionally and mentally.&#8221; As to that I merely observe that she was, at the time, legally represented and that it is far too late in the day to be raising such matters now.   </p>

By an order I made in October 2016 I discharged the local authority as a party to the proceedings before me. Later, in 2017, M made various applications, one formally issued, others informal, seeking to be released from the undertaking she had given Singer J, her objective being to discuss the case in public with a view to displacing the findings made against her by Singer J.</p>

The care proceedings came to an end without the making of any order. The local authority does not have parental responsibility for William and he is not a ward of court. The only persons with parental responsibility for him are Mr and Mrs Ward. Insofar as the disclosure of information about a child of William&#8217;s age involves an exercise of parental responsibility then it is for Mr and Mrs Ward to exercise that responsibility, not the court or any other public authority. There are no grounds for any interference by the State &#8211; whether the State in the guise of the local authority or the State in the form of the High Court &#8211; with the exercise by Mr and Mrs Ward of their parental responsibility. No one has made any application for a specific issue order. Mr and Mrs Ward have not sought the assistance of the court in the exercise of their parental responsibility: compare <span style="font-style:italic">Re B; X Council v B (No 2)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2008/270" uk:canonical="[2008] EWHC 270 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] EWHC 270 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 1 FLR 1460" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 1 FLR 1460</ref>, at para [17].</p>

(d) <span style="font-style:italic">It was the decision of Singer J which led to some impact on B&#8217;s life </span>and the <span style="font-style:italic">reasons</span> for that decision are contained in a judgment (already disclosed to B) that is detailed and shows <span style="font-style:italic">why </span>Singer J decided as he did. It is illogical to contend that combing through the documents with a view to seeing whether either the experts or the judge was wrong will help B to understand his family life. (e) In any event it is unlikely that the exercise will in fact enable B to investigate the methodology of the experts. (f) Likewise, documents not relied upon Singer J, and which therefore did not affect his decision, cannot have impacted on B&#8217;s life.</p>

On the other hand, there is, in my judgment, considerable force in many of Ms Wilson&#8217;s arguments; arguments which point to the clear conclusion that B should not be afforded access to all the many documents he wishes to read. Of particular significance, as it seems to me, is the fact that, for the reasons articulated by Ms Wilson, B&#8217;s right to explore his own history cannot give him carte blanche to explore the history of every member of his family who was, directly or indirectly, involved in the proceedings before Singer J. They have important privacy and confidentiality rights, equally protected by Article 8, which have to be taken into account, evaluated and, in the final analysis balanced against B&#8217;s rights. Indeed, and for the reasons given by Ms Wilson, F and G have interests which, given their much more central role in the proceedings before Singer J, if anything attract a rather greater degree of protection.</p>

Now to have a proper understanding of that decision, B plainly needs to have access (as he now has) to Singer J&#8217;s judgment, which sets out, by reference to the evidence he had read and heard, the judge&#8217;s reasons for concluding as he did. For the same reason (and as I recognised in my interlocutory order) a proper understanding of Singer J&#8217;s decision and reasoning may require access to some of the centrally important documents referred to in the judgment. But this does mean that B should be entitled to conduct an archaeological excavation through the entirety of the trial bundles so as to be enabled to come to his own conclusions about the quality of the evidence or the reliability of Singer J&#8217;s reasoning and conclusions, especially if, as here, much of the material he seeks to mine relates to very personal and private aspects of the lives and histories of other family members, including their medical records.</p>

I agree with Ms Wilson that it would be wholly disproportionate. The &#8216;ultimate balancing exercise&#8217; which I have to perform therefore, in my judgment, comes down clearly against B&#8217;s more general request. I make clear that this conclusion is in no way dependent upon G being a minor, being equally applicable once she has attained her majority.</p>
