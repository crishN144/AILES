	    <p class="Colloquy" style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt">This is an application by a local authority for permission to apply under inherent jurisdiction for orders in respect of a girl S, born&#160;in September&#160;2006 and therefore now aged nine.  This application comes before me sitting in the urgent applications court and I&#160;am dealing with this judgment late on Friday afternoon at 5.15pm.  It is accordingly a short judgment setting out the reasons for my refusal to make the order sought by the local authority.</span></p>

	    <p class="ContinCol" style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt">This case arises out of difficulties within the family of S, who has a number of older siblings who have been involved with social services in one way or another on a number of occasions over the years.  Some of the older siblings have been the subject of public law proceedings.  The local authority's case in general, with regard to this family, is that S's parents struggle, in particular, to look after older children.  It is as teenagers that the older children have largely come into contact with social services through difficulties that are said to have occurred within the home.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ContinCol" style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt">Recent events, which culminated in these proceedings, stem, in particular, from an allegation made by S's older brother R, who is now aged 13.  He has alleged that he has been assaulted by his father.  I&#160;say at once that his father, who appears in person before me today, strongly denies that allegation and asserts that R has now retracted it.  In any event, on learning of this allegation his school reported the matter to the authorities and R was made the subject of a police protection order last week.  The local authority in due course initiated proceedings under the Children Act, beginning with an application for an emergency protection order in respect of both R and S, which was granted by District Judge Mason on 19th&#160;November.  It then emerged that S and her mother had travelled to Saint Kitts.  It is said by the father that they have gone to that island for a Christmas holiday and will be due back in seven weeks&#8217; time on, or around, 13th&#160;January.  </span></p>

That application was refused.  The learned judge observed that, given that the child is now in Saint Kitts, that there is in force an EPO and a recovery order, and that the police had issued assistance due to the court alert, there was nothing that justified further orders being made that night by the out of hours judge.  He added that, if it was thought that further High Court orders were required, then an application could be made to the urgent applications judge on the following Monday morning.  </span></p>

On that occasion the application was made by the local authority without notice to the other parties for a location order.  On that occasion I&#160;ordered that the father should attend before me on Thursday and give all information within his knowledge, possession or control concerning the whereabouts of the mother and S.  </span></p>

The father attended the application and gave information concerning the whereabouts of the mother and S to the district judge.  The court decided to adjourn the hearing of the application for an interim care order in respect of R so that the father could obtain legal representation.  That application is now listed before another district judge next Thursday, 3rd&#160;December.  </span></p>

Thus the matter came before me late yesterday afternoon on an application, first of all, for an interim care order and secondly, for the orders of inherent jurisdiction.  In view of the late hour I&#160;adjourned the application until today when unfortunately again it has come on last in a busy urgent applications list.</span></p>

They do not invite the court to make an interim care order with regard to S.  Their case, so far as S is concerned, is as set out above, namely the difficulties the parents have when caring for children relates primarily to older teenage children. Thus it is their proposal that there should be an interim care order with regard to R, but only an interim supervision order with regard to S.  </span></p>

The guardian, through her solicitor, does not invite the court to make an interim care order again in respect of S against the wishes of the local authority, whilst pointing out that the local authority has, at some point in these proceedings during the phase of the emergency protection order, had parental responsibility for both children.</span></p>

The learned judge granted the local authority leave to invoke the jurisdiction.  In that case the local authority had parental responsibility for the child by reason of the interim order.  Bodey&#160;J observed that the effect of an order under inherent jurisdiction for the return of the child to this country would not be placing the child within the care of the local authority, thereby falling foul of s.100(2)(a), but rather would be "to supplement the current interim care order and to make it efficacious".  </span></p>

In contrast, in the current case the local authority does not have parental responsibility, nor does it seek an interim care order in respect of S for the reasons spelt out above.  The question arises, therefore, as to whether a local authority can request the High Court, under its inherent jurisdiction, to order the return of a child when it does not have, nor seek, parental responsibility, but merely seeks the return of the child from this jurisdiction for the purposes of pursuing the proceedings.  </span></p>

In other words, there is no other order, suggests Mr.&#160;Lock, which the local authority could apply for under the Children Act which would enable it to achieve its objective.</span></p>

On the other hand, it seems to me that in the circumstances of this case it would be open to the local authority to apply for an interim care order, thereby apply parental responsibility and not remove the child from the care of the parents.  In other words, it is a care order with the children remaining at home.  To that Mr.&#160;Lock responds that that would only be achieved if the Placement of Children with Parents Regulations were satisfied.</span></p>

The mother has, on the evidence before me, taken the child to Saint Kitts for a limited period, a holiday over Christmas, where she is staying with her extended family.  Given the local authority's overall case that it is only in respect of older children that significant concerns arise so as to require the removal of the children from the care of the parents, it is impossible, in my judgment, for the local authority to satisfy me that S is at risk of significant harm at Saint Kitts at present.  </span></p>

I&#160;am not satisfied that the circumstances exist which would justify such a course where the local authority is not seeking an order which would give it parental responsibility.  Even if the power does exist for the court to make such an order, I&#160;am not persuaded that such a power should be exercised on the facts of this case at this stage.  Accordingly, the application by the local authority is refused.  </span></p>

Subject to any further argument I&#160;propose to transfer the application under s.31 in respect of S back to the district judge so that he or she can determine that application alongside the application in respect of R next week.  It may be, in due course, that the circumstances will change and the local authority decides to seek a care order in respect of S.  In those circumstances it may be appropriate, if she is not returned to this country, that the application for leave to invoke inherent jurisdiction should be renewed, but at this stage the application is refused.</span></p>
