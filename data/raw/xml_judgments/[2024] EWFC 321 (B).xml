The Mother is a British National and the Father is Pakistani. They were married in Pakistan and the Father came to the UK in July 2017. They agree that they only lived together for a very short time before separating, before H was born. The Father lived with his brother and his family in Lancashire and the Mother lived independently in Manchester. It is evident from the evidence presented to me that there has been a degree of wider family involvement mediating between the couple after the relationship ended.</span></p>

He has subsequently sought to regularise his status in the UK in reliance on a persisting direct relationship with H which is a ground for leave to remain being granted within the immigration rules. It is agreed that his last leave granted by UKVI was limited leave to remain outside the immigration rules from March 2023 until March 2024, which was granted, despite their decision that he did not fulfil the requirements for leave within the rules, because he was in the process of taking part in these proceedings. As a result, he was granted discretionary leave so that he could conclude these proceedings and demonstrate that he has direct access to H and plays an active role in her life.</span></p>

There is one notable change since the last proceedings. During those proceedings the Mother drew the Court and Cafcass&#8217;s attention to multiple complaints of sexual assaults made by the alleged victims of the Father that she had seen on Facebook. No record of those complaints came up in police checks carried out by Cafcass and Mrs Adams says that her approach to those complaints during those proceedings was that they were unproven allegations that were not corroborated by police checks. </span></p>

The risk arising out of that offending has been the subject of a risk assessment by probation and has factored into Mrs Adams&#8217; risk assessment in these proceedings.</span></p>

Mrs Adams questioned the message that would be sent to H during those sessions given the Father&#8217;s behaviour towards women and his lack of accountability. There is no subsisting relationship with H despite intensive efforts from Cafcass in the previous proceedings and the Father must bear some responsibility for failing to maintain the relationship given his decision to ask for a break in contact, a matter I will return to shortly.</span></p>

The documents show repeated complaints by her to the police about the Father following their separation where he was warned off contacting her. His initial application to the Court was met by allegations of domestic abuse which required statements and a Scott Schedule to be produced, but before they could be considered the Mother had left unannounced for Pakistan taking H with her, a criminal offence, following which she told the Court through her lawyers that she did not intend to return.

Further, arguments that the Father has committed to multiple sets of proceedings only takes matters so far.

He describes the Mother as being prepared to do anything to thwart his arrangements and he fought through proceedings with a guardian to broker an agreement in December 2021. He complains that the Mother then left for Pakistan immediately following that arrangement being agreed. That complaint appears, on its face, to be well-founded- the Mother left for Pakistan on 03 January 2022 taking H with her. She went for three months and did not get the Father&#8217;s permission despite his having parental responsibility for H. Once again, she failed to recognise his PR and committed a criminal offence by taking H out of the UK for more than a month without the Father&#8217;s permission and without the Court&#8217;s permission.</span></p>

He told me that after one or two sessions following the consent order in December 2021, he told Mr O that the contact should stop. Apparently, the weather was bad at the park where the contact was to take place and H was having difficulty with the contact. Instead of persevering and enjoying jumping in puddles, or hiding from the rain together, he gave up and suggested a pause. It is little wonder that the Mother does not believe that he is committed to contact. How could he expect that H would want to form a relationship with him if he was so inconsistent and gave up so easily? How does his decision to give up accord with his evidence that the Mother was so obstructive, and he had to fight for any contact? Mr O&#8217;s condemnation of the Father&#8217;s attitude to contact at that time was compelling- he supported the assertion that the Father was not demonstrating the sort of commitment that a father could be expected to show.</span></p>

Whilst he criticises the Mother&#8217;s decision to go to Pakistan, he had no idea that she was there because he was not pursuing his court ordered contact, having taken a pause. He describes some contact with the Mother whilst she was in Pakistan and says that she told him that he could see H when she returned but he appears to have made no efforts to find out when she was back.

It is notable that all those emails were sent around a two-week period in March 2023. At the same time, he suddenly made contact with Mr O again after months of no contact and asked him about restarting arrangements (on his account) or having documents signed (on Mr O&#8217;s account). At the same time H&#8217;s school received a visit out of the blue from the Father who apparently asked them to write him a letter. The emails he sent were all forwarded to his immigration advisors and at the end of March he received notice of the decision which refused his application under the rules but granted him the year&#8217;s status outside the rules. That letter referred to evidence that he had provided which suggested a contact with H in March 2023 which cannot have taken place on either party&#8217;s account, which he cannot explain.</span></p>

His flurry of activity was to support his immigration application. Once he got his status he spent 5 months during the next year in Pakistan. He told me that this was because his father was unwell, but those trips are inconsistent with his slew of complaints in March 2023 which he would have been unable to make good on should there have been the possibility of contact restarting at that time.</span></p>

I made it clear to him, and I repeat the same in this judgment, that I place no weight on the untested view of an unnamed probation officer whose understanding of the immigration system is unknown and may very well be limited. Mrs Adams made it clear that the Father&#8217;s motivation over his immigration status is not determinative as far as her recommendations are concerned, and her recommendation would remain intact even were I to find that the Father was motivated to form a relationship with his daughter and not at all by his immigration status.</span></p>

There is no effort in those emails or ecards to engage with H. I appreciate that it is difficult to write to a child when you have no knowledge or information as to what they like and who they are, but in order to engage H the Father would have to provide much more substance, perhaps by trying to tell her more about himself and what he likes and seeking similar information in response from her. Again, these seem like the sort of easy-to-write emails that can be attached to immigration or family applications rather than correspondence that seeks to engage an estranged little girl.</span></p>

I accept that recommendation is well-founded and I also accept that long-term supervised contact can only be beneficial in a limited number of cases. Supervised contact should be a stepping stone where a parent is making their way through the cycle of change and could be expected to address their abusive behaviours. This father has not begun that journey despite his offence having taken place in 2019.</span></p>

Throughout the judgment I had identified concerns that the Mother was failing to promote the Father with H and had admonished her from acting in such a way as to disregard the Father&#8217;s parental responsibility. The harm caused by her failures to promote and consult the Father is a factor I had already considered and made reference to in the judgment. It is not such that it tips the balance away from the recommendations of Mrs Adams who had already identified these causes of harm when making her recommendations. The Father is right, however, that these are examples of the Mother failing to meet H&#8217;s emotional needs.</span></p>
