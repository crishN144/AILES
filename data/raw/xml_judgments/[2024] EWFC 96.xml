	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.45in">I have been hearing an application made by the Respondent, XA, to set aside a grant of leave to the Applicant, TY to bring an application for financial provision following an overseas divorce pursuant to Part III of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984</ref>.  I propose to refer to the parties respectively as &#8220;the Husband&#8221; and &#8220;the Wife&#8221; although I recognise they have both been divorced now for several years.  I do so for the sake of convenience only and mean no disrespect to either by so doing. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.45in">The case has a long history.  Indeed, this is the second application to set aside the leave granted by Jenkins DJ on 24 April 2023.  I refused the first application on 4 July 2023.  The Husband sought permission to appeal my decision to the Court of Appeal, which was refused by Moylan LJ on 28 November 2023.  The reason for a second application is that the first application was dealt with on the basis of what was thought to be the correct law at the time, based on the decision of the Supreme Court in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Agbaje v Agbaje</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] 1 AC 628" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] 1 AC 628</ref>, namely that it was necessary to show a compelling reason or knock-out blow to be successful in a set aside application.  I decided that the Husband could not show a compelling reason or knock-out blow, but I gave him permission to reapply if the Supreme Court decided that I had conducted the wrong test by following <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Agbaje</span>.  In <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Potanin v Potanina</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2024/3" uk:canonical="[2024] UKSC 3" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2024">[2024] UKSC 3</ref>, the Supreme Court did, indeed, decide that I had applied the wrong test.  A court, faced with a set-aside application, should decide afresh whether an order granting leave should be made or not.  The onus remained on the party who sought leave to satisfy the court that there was a &#8220;substantial ground&#8221; for the making of an application. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.45in">The Husband therefore reapplied, on 8 February 2024, to set aside.  The application says that there has been a material change in the law as a result of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Potanin</span> and that I should dismiss the Wife&#8217;s application as it has no reasonable prospect of success.  Two particular grounds are given.  The first is that the court in this jurisdiction is not permitted to top-up provision made in Germany under the terms of the EU Maintenance Regulation and/or the Hague Maintenance Convention.  The second is that the Wife&#8217;s factual allegations, that the Notaries who formalised the Austrian Pre-Nuptial Agreement and the German Separation Deed failed in their duties and that the Wife was placed under pressure to agree these terms when she was represented for several months by a prominent German lawyer, are fanciful.   </p>

The Wife says that the parties spent a lot of time in the UK in the latter months of 2013, but the Husband disputes this.  In January 2014, he became the Head of Europe at Company D, with an office in London.  The Wife says that he rented a property near the London Eye and she spent a considerable amount of time there with him.   He disputes this, saying that it was a shared flat and he commuted, such that he was only here midweek.  In May 2014, this ceased and the parties spent time thereafter in Vienna, Berlin and Cyprus.  They were in Germany from 2016 onwards.</p>

It is her case that she was not allowed to see the children; that she was cut-off financially; and pressured into signing a post-nuptial agreement.  The Husband disputes all of this.  </p>

He would pay child periodical payments of &#8364;1,484 per month for the two girls and spousal periodical payments of &#8364;3,000 per month until 2024.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.45in">On 6 March 2023, the Wife made her application in this jurisdiction for leave to bring an application for financial provision following an overseas divorce pursuant to Part III.   It was supported by a statement in support dated 3 March 2023.  At the time, the Wife and children were still living in Germany, but the statement makes the point that this court has jurisdiction based on the habitual residence of the Husband.  The Wife said that the reason for the delay had been due to her significant health issues.  She claimed that the assets of the Husband, at the time of separation, had been between &#163;60 &#8211; 100 million and included a significant number of properties and what she described as the family&#8217;s dream home in the South of France, worth &#8364;4 million.  She said that she had been presented with the Austrian Pre-Nuptial Agreement in a car on the way to see the Notary.  There had been no financial disclosure.  The Husband had told her they could not marry if it was not signed due to the law in Austria, but the Wife says that was a lie.  She says she believes this Agreement would be rescinded in Germany, but she gives no basis for this belief.   She refers to her health difficulties, including depression and chronic pain.  Heavy medication had been prescribed to her and Condition A diagnosed eventually.  She says she was heavily medicated at the point of signing the Separation Deed.  She complained about the quantum of the financial provision she was receiving and the fact she received no capital, other than retaining an inheritance with which she later acquired an interest in a commercial property worth &#8364;450,000 net of the mortgage.  She said there had been no financial disclosure.  She asserts that she only signed to get her children back and the Separation Deed placed her in a position of real hardship.  After signing, she had a panic attack and a subsequent breakdown, leading to her being treated for four months in a psychiatric clinic.   She contrasted her position with that of the Husband, living in London. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.45in">She says that she intended to move to this jurisdiction to facilitate the children&#8217;s relationship with their Father and for her health treatment.   She added that she had the need for a London property, costing &#163;9 million, with a budget of &#163;1 million for renovations; a Paris property costing in the region of &#8364;3 million; and a property in the South of France, at a total cost of approximately &#8364;6 million.  She sought spousal maintenance in the order of &#8364;2.4 million per annum.  I appreciate this was said in the context of believing that the Husband was worth &#163;60 &#8211; 100 million but I have to say that I find these claims entirely unrealistic in the context of the factual matrix in this case.     Turning to the connection to England, she said that the parties had lived in London from 2013 to 2014. She travelled here every five weeks for medical treatment. Both children were conceived here.  She then asserts that the Husband suggested they move here ten days before the divorce was finalised, but he denies this strenuously.  She made the point that the Husband has been here since April/May 2021 and that neither party is German. She ends by saying she could have litigated in Germany, but she had already decided to relocate to London.   </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.45in">The without notice application for leave to apply pursuant to Part III came on before Jenkins DJ on 24 April 2023.  Leading counsel then instructed on behalf of the Wife described it as one of the clearest cases for the grant of leave.  I have to say that I entirely disagree with that description, although that does not mean that leave should not have been granted.  Jenkins DJ gave leave to commence Part III proceedings and directed that it be heard by a High Court Judge.  In his extempore judgment, he referred to the assertion that the Husband was worth between &#163;60 and &#163;100 million.  He made the point that the Wife got &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">a drop in the ocean</span>&#8221; and suggested she might end up on benefits without court intervention.  He relied on the fact that both spouses would both be living  here to say that England and Wales was the appropriate forum, notwithstanding that she could have applied to set aside in Germany.  He considered that a significant order was likely to be made.    </p>

It may have been that she did so because the Husband applied in Germany to appeal the order giving her permission to move here.  I have not heard oral evidence, so cannot make findings of fact but it is certainly arguable that both sides have behaved tactically in many of the decisions they have made.  I fear this may have been to the significant detriment of their children.  Indeed, the Wife said that one of the reasons that she came to England was so that the children would be closer to their Father, but they have not seen him for nearly a year.  Both parties blame the other for this sorry state of affairs, but it is extremely regrettable.  I urge the parties to sort this out as soon as they possibly can so that the girls can have a good relationship with both their parents.   </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.45in">On 23 May 2023, the Husband applied to set aside the grant of leave pursuant to Part III.  He relied on a statement dated 23 May 2023.  He said there were compelling reasons to set aside the grant of leave. He referred to the fact that there had been no or minimal connection with England during the marriage.    He had only moved here two years after the divorce.  He said that the financial arrangements had been dealt with fully and properly in Germany. The Wife had been represented by a top lawyer.  The court approved the Separation Deed, the terms of which, he added, had been subject to extensive negotiations over several months.  The Deed is, he says, entitled to recognition.  He added that the Wife had vastly exaggerated the extent of her medical condition.  He was renting accommodation in London for &#163;18,000 per month.  There had never been any real ties to England.  The Wife had visited doctors here since 2017, but she had only visited him once or twice in his shared flat from January to June 2014.  They did not have holidays here.  They owned no property in England.  He denied suggesting they move here in 2019.  He had only decided to move here in February 2021.  He accused the Wife of coming here solely to be able to reopen the divorce settlement.   In relation to the Pre-Nuptial Agreement in Austria, he said that the Notary, Dr Kaindl, carried out his duties vigorously.  At the time, he said he had no net worth and was earning  around &#8364;9,000 per month net.  The Wife&#8217;s family were wealthier than him.  Turning to the Separation Deed, he said that the Wife was represented by a well-established German divorce lawyer, Dr Kerstin Niethammer-Jurgens.  The Wife was not under pressure.  She signed the Deed on 5 July 2019 before another Notary, Dr Schmid.  He added that the Wife appeared to be lucid and functioning normally.  In any event, her lawyer was present.  The Wife had made no steps to challenge the Deed other than sending one letter.  Her move to London was only first raised in November 2022.  When they separated, he was employed by Company D on a salary of &#8364;170,000 per annum net.  Their spending was about &#8364;30,000 per month, which included three nannies at a cost of &#8364;13,500 to assist the Wife.  He had sold shares to cover the shortfall between income and expenditure.  He estimated his net worth at &#8364;25 million, which was a combination of real estate and stocks, against which he had borrowed.  The Wife had always suffered from poor mental health.  Her Condition A had not stopped her working and living a perfectly normal life. </p>

She made the point that the Husband had to show a knock-out blow to succeed.  Both parties and the children now live in England, such that a review under Part III is justified.   There was nothing keeping her in Berlin.  The court in Germany only reviews a Separation Deed at the time of the divorce if the Deed is challenged.  She has a right to continued maintenance beyond August 2024 in the event of childcare or illness.  The Husband had said that he would agree to the move to England if she did not assert any further maintenance claims.</p>

She has the interest in the commercial property, valued at &#8364;957,600 but subject to a mortgage of (&#8364;551,903).  She calculates the net equity at &#163;248,346.  She puts her debts at (&#163;293,188), the vast majority of which relates to the costs of these proceedings and those in Germany.  She does claim that she has an interest in various chattels but they are all held by the Husband in Germany, which gives rise to a serious enforcement issue.   She persists in claiming capital needs of &#163;15,150,000, albeit calculated slightly differently.    </p>

I do take the view that, in relation to maintenance, this is problematic as there is no maximum CMEC assessment.  Given the Husband&#8217;s lack of income, it seems highly unlikely that there will ever be a maximum assessment. The Wife would therefore have to apply to the Tribunal for a departure direction.  Until she is successful in doing so, the Court does not have jurisdiction in relation to child periodical payments, other than school fees.   </p>

It was in very similar terms to my interim order.  In other words, he said he will continue to pay &#163;7,500 per month towards the Wife and children&#8217;s accommodation costs.  He will also pay &#163;7,000 per month general child maintenance.  He will pay the children&#8217;s school fees.  He offered &#163;100,000 towards the Wife&#8217;s debts.  He recognised the jurisdiction difficulties in relation to child periodical payments.  He accepted that, even if he gave the court jurisdiction in relation to periodical payments, he could apply in twelve months to CMEC, which would then assume jurisdiction.  He proposes to get around this by undertaking to pay the sums.  Mrs Rebecca Carew Pole KC, who appears on behalf of the Wife, is entitled to say that this is, in effect, a take it or leave it offer.

The threshold test is whether the prospective applicant can show a real prospect of success, but, at the same time, the court must continue to guard against the leave or set-aside hearing becoming a proxy for the final trial. </p>

Section 18 deals with the matters to which the court is to have regard in exercising its powers.  Again, this is essentially the same as on a divorce. It does mean that the children of the family are the first consideration of the court.</p>

The purpose of Part III is to alleviate the adverse consequences of no or no adequate provision being made by a foreign court where there are substantial connections with England [71].  Ordinarily, the court will not lightly characterise foreign law, or the order of a foreign court, as unjust [72].  This would equally apply to the terms of a notarised deed.</p>

She says that I should take great care before relying on the Working Paper, particularly as the wording suggested there was not the wording that became law, and the Law Commission Report itself.  She says it would  be quite wrong to do so without considering Hansard and the passage of the legislation through Parliament.  In relation to the wording, she reminds me that the original proposed wording of the Bill in the Working Paper in what became section 16(2) referred to the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">connection of the parties, and of the marriage, with this country</span>&#8230;&#8221;, whereas <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>  refers to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the connection which the parties to the marriage have with England and Wales&#8221;</span>.  In relation to paragraph [47] of the Working Paper, she makes the point that the factual matrix there is materially different to the one here. The parties were not German Nationals; they were not in comparable employment; and, particularly, the Wife and children are in this jurisdiction, not in Germany.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.45in">Finally, in relation to the law, Mr Horton KC relies on the Maintenance Regulation.  He submits that the effect of the transitional arrangements in the EU Withdrawal Agreement Art 67(2)(c) is that, whilst the jurisdictional rules in the Maintenance Regulation ceased to apply after 31 January 2020, the rules relating to the recognition and enforcement of pre-Brexit orders continue to apply.  If the German court had made a maintenance order in 2019 in connection with the divorce, it would have been entitled, he says, to recognition and enforcement here under Art 23 of the Regulation.  By Art 42, the court here is not permitted to review the substance of the foreign order.   Art 48 provides that the same provisions apply to &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">court settlements</span>&#8217; and &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">authentic instruments</span>&#8217;.  If it was to be challenged, it should be challenged in the country where it was concluded (recital 13).  He adds that there is no doubt that the notarised Separation Deed is an &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">authentic instrument</span>&#8217; within this definition.  He adds that the same principles would apply to a post-Brexit German divorce as Art 3(e) of the Hague Maintenance Convention defines a maintenance agreement which is enforceable in another contracting State under Art 30.  He says that there can be no review of the merits of a decision or maintenance arrangement (Art 28).</p>

She submits that, if her client&#8217;s case is correct, it is highly doubtful that the notarised Separation Deed would be enforced in Germany.  If it cannot be enforced there, it cannot be enforced here.  In any event, she does not believe that the German court retains jurisdiction given that neither party is German, nor is either habitually resident there any longer.  At the very least, she submits that expert evidence would be required before disposing of the case on this ground.  Finally, and perhaps most tellingly, she submits that this is certainly not the stuff of either a set-aside application or an initial application for leave.  She argues it is for a final hearing. </p>

The Wife makes a number of significant allegations in relation to the circumstances of both the Pre-Nuptial Agreement and the notarised Separation Deed.  I have not heard oral evidence.  I cannot say that her claims are hopeless or doomed to fail.  In relation to the law, the suggestion that the German court does not retain jurisdiction is pretty fundamental and would need clear evidence from Germany.   </p>

The court would, of course, have had to consider the pre-nuptial agreement in Austria to decide whether or not it should be upheld and, in consequence, sharing excluded.  If the court concluded that the agreement should not be enforced and sharing should not be excluded, the Wife would have had a respectable argument for sharing the wealth equally, as it was all generated during the marriage. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.45in">The court considering an application for leave has to deal with the section 16(2) factors.  The first is &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the connection which the parties to the marriage have with England and  Wales</span>&#8221;.  I accept that it does not say &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">during the marriage</span>&#8221;.  It is therefore entirely legitimate to consider their connection with this jurisdiction as at the date on which the application for leave is considered.  Following <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Potanin</span>, that is, effectively, the present day.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.45in">Nevertheless, it is important to remember that the connection with this jurisdiction during the marriage was, in reality, very limited indeed.  They were not even &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">birds of passage</span>&#8221; as described in my decision in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Aldoukhi v Abdullah</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2021/3086" uk:canonical="[2021] EWHC 3086 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] EWHC 3086 (Fam)</ref>.  At best, they were here for a few months in 2013/2014 whilst the Husband worked in London; both children were conceived here; and the Wife came here for medical treatment after 2017.  I am clear that this, of itself, would not have got close to satisfying the leave test at the time of the breakdown of the marriage.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.45in">The statute, however, does not limit the connection to the duration of the marriage.  It could have done so, but it did not.  The position today is entirely different.  The Husband has been habitually resident here for three years.  The Wife and both children have been habitually resident here for almost a year.  This is likely to remain the position for the foreseeable future.  I do take the view that this is both relevant and important.  </p>

Whilst I accept that their connection with Germany was much greater during the marriage than it was with this jurisdiction, the German connection is now non-existent other than as a historical fact.  Neither party is a German national or a German citizen.  Neither is habitually resident in Germany.  The children do not live in Germany.  The Wife does have a commercial property there but, unless she needs to go there to sort out that property, I can see absolutely no reason why she or the children would even go to that country, except perhaps for a holiday.  The same applies to the Husband and his new family.  There may not even be jurisdiction there any longer, although I appreciate that this is in issue. </p>

It is impossible to say that the award in her favour was anything other than minimal.  She did receive her rent until 2028 and what can only be described as a modest level of maintenance for both herself, until 2024, and the girls.  She got no capital at all, other than retaining an asset that was, in effect, inherited.  The extent of the jurisdiction to extend her rent allowance and the maintenance is unclear.  I entirely accept that there were reasons for this level of provision, largely surrounding the pre-nuptial agreement, but section 16(2) merely requires me to consider what she did receive. </p>

I take the view that she did apply in Germany and received the award as described above, albeit as a result of the Separation Deed.  She did not apply to set aside, but this court must consider whether there would be jurisdiction for such an application to be made now and, if so, whether it would be hopeless.  I can see no point in launching a hopeless application just to tick that box.  I do not, of course, know the answer to either question.</p>

This is an important factor.  It does not assist the Wife at all.  Very nearly four years expired before she brought this application.  The question is whether this factor, along with the lack of connection with this country during the marriage and the existence of the German Separation Deed mean that leave should not be granted. I have decided that these factors are not sufficient for me to set aside leave.  All the other factors point to leave being granted, although I accept some more strongly than others.</p>

I do accept that this court should be very wary of making orders that might be said to encourage, or even reward, what has been described as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">divorce tourism</span>&#8221;.  Nevertheless, I must apply <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> and consider all the circumstances of the case and, in particular, the criteria set out in section 16(2).  I am clear that this does lead to a grant of leave, as the Wife has satisfied me that she meets the test of substantial or solid ground for making the application.  This does not mean that an award will definitely be made.   The Husband can still make all the above points, either in support of a submission that the claim should, ultimately, be dismissed, or that they should restrict the level of provision in fact awarded.  This, however, must be done at a final hearing, not at this stage.</p>

I am very much of the view that this is not a sharing case.  I do not say that because of the separation of property regime established in the pre-nuptial agreement or the terms of the Separation Deed, although the court may well do so eventually.  I have come to that conclusion because of the lack of any significant connection with this jurisdiction during the marriage and the time that has passed since the separation took place.  </p>

I have come to the clear conclusion that this is not an answer to the leave point.  If it was, Part III would be inappropriate or unnecessary in any case in which there were children, which cannot be right.  The court hearing an application under Part III must consider the welfare of the children as its first consideration when considering what orders to make, but it can also consider so much more that simply cannot be considered in a Schedule 1 application.  There is the added complication here that there is no jurisdiction to make a periodical payments order for the children pursuant to Schedule 1, unless a departure direction has been obtained.  </p>

It is this.  If the Husband was to satisfy the court that a claim for maintenance is excluded by the Maintenance Regulation and that &#8220;maintenance&#8221; in this context includes the provision of capital for housing (<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Van den Boogard v Laumen</span> C-220/95), the court should retain the ability to deal with this by a modest sharing award, if it felt it right to do so.  It would be entirely wrong for me to impose a &#8220;non-sharing&#8221; condition on the basis that it is a &#8220;needs&#8221; claim, if the &#8220;needs&#8221; claim is then itself excluded.

If that was to be the case, I would view it as being akin to an appeal where the court grants permission to appeal on the basis that there is a real prospect of success but, when it deals with the appeal, it actually decides that the appeal should not succeed.  </p>
