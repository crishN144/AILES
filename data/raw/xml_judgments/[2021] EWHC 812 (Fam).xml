The order was made in favour of the respondent and was due to take effect by 4 PM on 12 January 2021. On 7 January 2021 HHJ Dancey stayed the order on the basis that the appellant indicated his intention to seek permission to appeal out of time and having seen supporting material from children&#8217;s services concerning the impact of the occupation order on the appellant&#8217;s cohabitees children. The appellant&#8217;s notice was filed on 11 January 2021 and Lieven J further stayed the order. On 2 February 2021 Lieven J granted permission to appeal. In her order she gave her reasons as follows; </p>

Ms Hudson, counsel was instructed on behalf of the respondent. She had filed a response to the grounds and skeleton submitted by the appellant when a litigant in person.

Ms Hudson submitted that a number of assertions made in the appellant&#8217;s case could only be clarified by the obtaining of a transcript. In particular Ms Hudson referred to the appellant&#8217;s contention that the hearing had been procedurally unfair by reason of the </p>

Ms Reed opposed the application on the basis that no request had been made earlier by the respondent, the matters raised were capable of being answered by the respondent herself and there was no respondent&#8217;s notice seeking to rely on other matters. I refused the application for an adjournment on the basis that the matters identified in support of the suggested need for a full transcript did not appear to be sufficiently important in the context of the appeal overall to require the transcript particularly having regard to the overriding objective to determine cases justly and bearing in mind the additional delay that would be caused and the additional court time that would have to be made available for an adjourned hearing. I indicated that were matters to develop in the course of the appeal itself that indicated the transcript bore a greater relevance than appeared at the outset I would if necessary, revisit the issue. </p>

The Recorder concluded that the impact on the children would be no more than the instability which usually accompanies a change of home, that the appellant, his cohabitee and the children would probably be rehoused in broadly similar accommodation to that which they were to be excluded from given they would be in priority need and that the mother would then be appropriately housed and with a platform to potentially make an application for the rehabilitation of her children. The effect of the evidence was to undermine if not entirely to dispel each of those conclusions which were fundamental to the evaluation that the Recorder undertook. </p>

The main documents of significance all clearly postdate the hearing and the appellant statement and emails in support tend to indicate that they were received via his cohabitees social worker in the circumstances.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">setting out why he sought to remain in the property. This seems to have been on the basis that the respondent had filed a statement in support of a non-molestation order, and it was perhaps assumed that this document set out the respondent&#8217;s case in relation to an occupation order also. However, this assumption was not correct. The nonmolestation order statement only dealt with issues of conduct. There was therefore no framework within the legally represented respondent&#8217;s statement to which the appellant could have responded. If the statement in support of the application had been based on the criteria identified in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/33/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 33(6)</ref> and (7) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FLA 1996</ref> this might have alerted the appellant to the need to address those matters. The order provided for the respondent to file a statement further addressing why she sought to return to the property. At the pretrial review on 22 October the order recites that the appellant might wish to familiarise himself with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/33" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 33</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FLA 1996</ref>. However, whilst the order indicated the potential importance of documents relating to the care order in respect of the party&#8217;s five children in care and the availability of the appellant&#8217;s cohabitees former accommodation it did not identify the importance of any documents relevant to the impact on the appellant&#8217;s cohabitees children, or the issues of the appellant&#8217;s ability to be rehoused. It appears that the appellant made some attempt to obtain evidence relating to his cohabitees former accommodation as that forms the content of the social workers email which was received prior to the court hearing and which was put before the Recorder on 17 November. Whilst the recital to the order did direct the appellant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/33" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 33</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1996</ref> for the purposes of representing himself there is nothing in the orders or in the respondent&#8217;s statements which would have focused the appellant&#8217;s preparations on the critical importance of obtaining evidence relevant to the factors contained in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/33/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 33(6)</ref>(a)-(d) or <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/33/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 33(7)</ref>.  It is clear from the judgment that the Recorder identified the very limited evidence that was before him; he referred to the &#8220;paucity&#8221; of evidence and this applied both to the appellant&#8217;s and the respondent&#8217;s evidence. This suggests that neither had sufficient time to fully prepare their cases; for the respondent even with the benefit of legal representation. Whilst I accept that being a litigant in person does not absolve a party from compliance with the rules and the need to approach proceedings with great care and diligence an issue as serious as occupation of one&#8217;s home I also have to recognise that litigants in person are often illequipped to comprehend precisely what the court will need in terms of evidence or submissions. This is so whether or not they suffer from any form of condition which might further impact on their capacity to prepare for court cases of this sort. In such cases it is very often helpful to litigants in person and the court itself for represented parties and the court to draft statements and case management orders in such a way as to draw attention to the critical factors which the court will be considering. In this case (as it transpired) where the court did draw attention to one matter the appellant sought to address it and obtained information which demonstrated that his cohabitees former home would not be available to her or her children to re-occupy. True it is that the appellant could have asked the court for an adjournment, but many individuals might work on the assumption that where a date has been given that is the date on which a decision is taken. An appeal based on fresh evidence is emphatically not an opportunity for the dilatory or lazy to attempt to re-argue their case before a different judge. Ultimately, and particularly given the importance of the issue at the heart of this appeal which is the occupation of a family home and having regard to all the circumstances in the preparations for the hearing that I have set out before I am satisfied that the evidence which now exists could not have been obtained with due diligence by<span style="font-weight:bold"> this</span> appellant for the hearing on 17 November 2020. I therefore will allow the appellant to rely on that evidence.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Having decided to admit the evidence which the appellant seeks to rely it seems to me that aspects of the appellant&#8217;s original grounds of appeal and indeed aspects of Ms Reed&#8217;s amended grounds recede in importance. Ms Reed&#8217;s ground one focused on whether the Recorder correctly applied to the tests set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/33/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 33 (6)</ref> &amp; (7) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1996</ref>. I observe that this was an ex-tempore judgment and thus some care should be taken by appellate courts in being tempted by narrow textual analysis to conclude that the law has wrongly been applied. However I do not for the purposes of the disposal of this appeal I do not need to explore the arguments as to how the Recorder expressed himself in setting out the legal test, how he expressed himself in applying it and evaluating whether or not there was merit in the submission that the test was either wrongly stated or incorrectly applied. Ms Reed is of course right in her skeleton argument to observe that the approach endorsed by the appellate court in Chalmers v Johns was firstly to undertake the balance of harm test set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/33/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 33 (7)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FLA 1996</ref> as the satisfaction of that section might lead to a mandatory order thus rendering the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/33/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 33 (6)</ref> exercise irrelevant. If the balance of harm test did not lead to a mandatory order, then the court would go on to consider the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/33/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 33 (6)</ref> evaluation. </p>

The Recorder concluded that the impact on those children would be limited to the normal instability arising from a loss of accommodation. However, the evidence of the headmaster places the impact at a much more significant level than that having regard to their experiences to date. Given that the decision was, as the Recorder emphasised, a finely balanced one that of itself would have been likely to tilt the balance. </p>

Although it is not explicit, it seems implicit that the Recorder concluded that they would be rehoused in rented accommodation rather than relocated to a different town in bed-and-breakfast accommodation. </p>

However, the letter from the housing association indicates that the respondent would be regarded as under occupying a three bedroom accommodation and this would have consequences in terms of the benefits she would receive in respect of it with the consequent risk of  arrears accruing and the accommodation being lost. Had the Recorder regarded the decision overall as clear this may have been an unimportant element, but where the decision was regarded as very finely balanced even this might have had the potential to tip the balance the other way. </p>

On the material before him many Judges would have reached the same conclusion. Many might have reached an opposite conclusion. Some might have adjourned on the basis that they did not feel the parties had equipped them to take any decision.

Hence the appellate courts allow a wide latitude to 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> instance judges in terms of case management, in terms of their evaluation of competing factors and in their exercise of discretion. However, in cases such as this where the court has concluded that evidence secured after the determination should be admitted the decision has to be based on the new evidential foundation which exists. On the evidential foundation is now before the court it is clear to me that the decision was wrong. I have little doubt that Recorder Willetts would say the same. I will therefore allow the appeal on the basis that the Recorder&#8217;s evaluation of the competing factors has been demonstrated to be wrong by reason of the availability of the fresh evidence.

It seems to me inevitable that the matter must be remitted. It is not the function of the appellate court, save in rare circumstances, to undertake its own evaluation of the totality of the evidence and to make orders. In any event the parties are now some four months on from where they were in November and the evaluation of the evidence base that which exists to date including the fresh evidence and any updating evidence from the parties as to the factors relevant to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/33/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 33 (6)</ref> and 33 (7) exercises will need to be considered. The position in relation to the respondent&#8217;s housing situation and her efforts to secure the return of the care of her children in care will also need to be considered. This might, although need not necessarily, involve rehearing the evidence as to matters of conduct. I see no reason in this case why the matter could not be remitted to the Recorder for further consideration although it seems to me that who deals with the remitted application is a matter for the designated Family Judge based on the availability of judicial resources. I do not consider that there is any basis to exclude the Recorder from the pool of judges to whom the case might be remitted. </p>
