	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Glaser has taken a preliminary point on this appeal that it should be dismissed as having been made out of time. The time allowed for issue of an appeal is five days from judgment (RSC Order 58 Rule 1). In fact the appeal was not brought until 12 days after judgment, namely upon 24 July 2007. I indicated to the parties early at the hearing of the appeal that I proposed to exercise my discretion to hear the appeal out of time, given that the point was only taken at the last moment and in particular was not taken before Coleridge J when the matter was before him on 19 October 2007 and he gave directions for the hearing of the appeal.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties were married on 11 February 2001 after some months of cohabitation and they separated after 4&#189; years in September 2005. When they married, the husband was 64 and the wife 48. It was a second marriage for each of them and there were no children of the marriage.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the time of their marriage, the husband was a Circuit Judge, having previously been a solicitor. The wife was a trainee barrister; she had turned to that profession comparatively late in life, having previously had a successful career as a social worker in the Probation Service. The husband is a retired circuit judge but since his retirement has continued to sit regularly as a deputy circuit judge. The District Judge found that, the husband&#8217;s sittings as a deputy were unlikely to continue for much longer, as he was now 70 years old and he would have to cease at age 72.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following the marriage the parties lived at Bronllys Castle in Breconshire. It was in fact a large farm house rather than a castle and jointly owned by the husband with other members of his family in different parcels. The husband owned and lived in the lower flat. The wife moved there before the marriage and put a great deal of work into decorating and renovating the flat and its garden. She also started in practice in a set of chambers in Wales which did not work out. In January 2002 the parties jointly purchased a property at 1, Laurel Edge, St Albans which became the matrimonial home, albeit the flat in Bronllys Castle was retained. The husband sat regularly as a deputy circuit judge in the Hertfordshire area and the wife joined a set of chambers in St Albans where she has been somewhat more successful. The purchase of 1 Laurel Edge was funded as to &#163;100,000 by the wife, who also contributed &#163;10,000 to the cost of works, and as to &#163;60,000 from the husband, together with a mortgage of &#163;120,000, the husband making the interest only mortgage payments of &#163;6,720 per annum.  It was the sole asset of the marriage held jointly. </p>

		<p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.98in">[NB It seems to me clear that, since it was accepted in the proceedings that the husband would not be selling the flat but would be going to live there as his principal residence, the deduction of CGT resulted in practical terms in an undervalue of the flat in the hands of the husband, the net equity available to him being, in reality &#163;113,000. However that point is not relied on in the appeal so far as the valuation of the parties&#8217; assets is concerned].</p>

However, as an indication, reference to conventional assumptions about the cost of purchase of an annuity gives a figure of &#163;660,000 in respect of an annuity of &#163;40,000 per annum with index linking for a 71 year old (see At a Glance Table 21 (2007-1008 edition)).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The unfortunate position so far as the judicial pension is concerned is that, upon marriage, the husband agreed to forfeit a substantial part (over &#163;40,000) of the lump sum due to him on retirement, in order to provide the wife with a widow&#8217;s pension, partly because the wife felt vulnerable as a result of losing her pension entitlement on her first divorce. Unfortunately, the parties did not consider what the position would be if they divorced, upon which the widow&#8217;s rights would be lost. In the result, the benefit of the widow&#8217;s pension, and of the &#163;40,000 advanced by the husband to acquire it, were lost to both the husband and the wife and could not be recovered once the divorce was made final. There was a suggestion in the course of the proceedings that, if the decree absolute were not pronounced, the parties could remain married in order to retain the widow&#8217;s rights, but the District Judge could not make an order on that basis in the light of the parties&#8217; desire for a clean break.

The Judge noted that the husband did not have cash equivalent transfer values for the pensions which were obviously substantial (see para. 14 above). However, as the judicial pension was not the product of a pension fund, and could not be made the subject of a pension sharing order, its relevance simply lay in its assurance to the husband of a guaranteed RPI linked annual income stream until his death.</p>

In addition, he made provision that during the next three years, which he put as the period within which the wife might find a smaller property and achieve self-reliance, the husband should make periodical payments sufficient to cover the current mortgage at the rate of &#163;20,000 in the first year, &#163;15,000 in the second year and &#163;10,000 in the third year.

The situation was one where fairness dictated a lump sum contribution of capital from the husband towards such provision, particularly in the light of his own (secure) pension provision, out of which the Judge made no provision for the wife. It is argued for the wife that close examination of the judgment reveals errors both in the methodology and figures underlying the Judge&#8217;s view that he was making fair or sufficient provision for the wife. Upon that basis it is necessary to look closely at the methodology of the judgment in applying the section 25 criteria.</p>

I see no reason why some of her pension pot should not be contained in her property, so she will be able to choose the time and location to trade down and make her own decision as to the balance between housing and future provision.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The thrust of Mr Firth&#8217;s argument for the wife on this appeal is as follows. First of all he takes the point that the Judge failed for the purposes of calculating the wife&#8217;s present and future needs, to consider adequately or at all the impact of the 1 Laurel Edge mortgage and other debts on the wife&#8217;s ability (a) to rehouse at the level it was reasonable for her to expect or (b) to make any meaningful provision for her pension needs which the Judge expressly recognised. Having found that the wife needed significantly more than the sum of &#163;260,000 suggested by the husband for her housing needs, but less than the &#163;420,000 taken as the value of 1 Laurel Edge, the Judge failed to give any proper consideration to the fact that, (putting the wife&#8217;s reasonable housing needs at anything over &#163;280,000 plus costs of purchase) she would need <span style="font-style:italic">all the net proceeds of sale and more</span> (i.e. a sum to be financed by way of mortgage), leaving nothing for investment in her pension. Mr Firth points out that, having accepted the absence of scope for the wife to make the contribution to her own pension on her present income and having assessed the likely increase in her future earning power in modest terms, the District Judge nowhere identified what the order he was making was intended to produce for the wife. On this score, all he said was that the wife could &#8220;make her own decision as to the balance between housing and future [pension] provision.&#8221;</p>

Thus, submits Mr Firth, the net effect of the order as to housing, pension and income in retirement is plainly unfair and reflects a failure by the Judge properly to consider <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 25 (2)</ref> (b) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> (&#8220;the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future&#8221;) or to apply <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.25</ref> (A) (2) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> by making a periodical payments order &#8220;sufficient to enable the party in whose favour the order is made to adjust without undue hardship to the termination of his or her financial dependence on the other party.&#8221; </p>

In this respect, realisation of the husband&#8217;s interest in the Hatfield Road flats would provide the wherewithal for him to satisfy either a lump sum order (if necessary allowing time for the realisation of value) although that interest could be subject of an order for transfer to the wife. Mr Firth also points out that the husband owns the Coach House flat at Bronllys Castle mortgage free, the value of which is just over &#163;200,000 but which yields only a modest rent to the husband of &#163;3,245.</p>

By way of long-stop, (see para. 24 of the judgment quoted at paragraph 33 above) part of her &#8220;pension pot&#8221; was to be regarded as contained in 1 Laurel Edge, in relation to which she could and should time her disposal and make her own decision as to how far she traded down to release capital towards her pension provision should she see fit.</p>

She contends that, on the basis of the &#163;150,000 mortgage she required to make the purchase, her overall asset position deteriorated rather than improved, as compared with that calculated by the District Judge. In order to make good that assertion, the figures she sets out involve to some extent reliance upon matters of detail, not least an &#163;18,000 credit card liability said to have been ignored in error by the District Judge but not relied on within the grounds of appeal.</p>

I do not consider that the subsequent developments now brought to my attention should affect the arguments raised before me on the hearing of the appeal. In particular, I have no reason to suppose that the price of properties in the St Albans area did not rise (and no doubt have recently fallen) proportionately across the board since the hearing before the District Judge, at which he was obliged to proceed on the best figures available at the time in a situation where the parties&#8217; assets, such as they were, were almost entirely in property, where the future career prospects of the wife were speculative and the fortunes of the parties essentially diminished rather than enhanced as a result of a relatively short marriage. Not only was the District Judge obliged to adopt a broad brush basis to the wife&#8217;s future prospects, but the appeal before me has been argued upon an &#8220;order of things&#8221; basis, by which I mean that the nub of the appellant&#8217;s argument is simply that, on the broad approach which the District Judge himself adopted, fairness required that the husband &#8220;kick start&#8221; the wife&#8217;s pension provision for the future by ordering a capital sum which, in her financial position and at the age of over 50, she was in no position to provide herself and for which the level of her future earnings would be unlikely to enable her to make up to lost ground.</p>

In my view, her choice in that regard following the hearing below should not be treated as relevant in assessing the adequacy of the District Judge&#8217;s decision, when considering the overall level or value of the pension provision to be made in addition to the capital represented by the equity in 1 Laurel Edge.</p>

He was dealing with a short and childless marriage which had not proved financially beneficial to either of the parties, save for an increase in value in 1 Laurel Edge to which both parties had contributed more or less equally and in relation to which the Judge decided it would be fair to award the entire equity to the wife, protected from the liability to make mortgage payments for three years while she took steps to establish and expand her career, and timing her necessary &#8220;downsizing&#8221; to whatever moment she judged most advantageous. In this respect, he considered that the amount the wife would need to rehouse herself was a sum significantly more than &#163;260,000, but he failed to consider or at any rate specify, what figure would be appropriate on the information before him. In that respect, it seems to me he was in error for the purposes of the exercise to be conducted which he had identified as the necessity to provide a sufficient sum to rehouse the wife <span style="font-style:italic">as well as</span> making provision for her pension additional to the small amount available to her from previous employment: see paragraphs 30 and 31 above.</p>

For that purpose the focus had to be upon their minimal future needs rather than observing and applying the distinction, urged on behalf of the husband and accorded considerable weight by the Judge, between the matrimonial property or &#8220;acquest&#8221; and what each of the parties brought to the marriage by way of pre-acquired property.

In this respect he quantified her housing on the basis of a valuation &#8220;significantly more than &#163;260,000,&#8221; the value suggested by the husband. For this purpose, in the absence of a finding by the Judge, it seems to me appropriate to take as a minimum the figure of &#163;310,000 (i.e. an uplift of 20% on the figure put forward by the husband. Given an equity of &#163;287,000 in 1 Laurel Edge, that would leave a further &#163;23,000 to be found out of the wife&#8217;s own assets which would have necessitated a sale of 2 Dane Court in order to realise its net equity of &#163;43,000, leaving the wife with a net sum of some &#163;20,000 for deployment in pension provision if she thought fit.</p>

Given that the District Judge found that, after three years, the wife should have reached the position where she could support herself in a reduced but sufficient lifestyle but, by clear implication not till then, the question is therefore whether he could or should, as Mr Glaser submits, be treated as having made sufficient pension provision by means of the three year periodical; payments order. I do not consider that he can. Mr Glaser has urged that the sums ordered by way of periodical maintenance over three years should be treated as in part maintenance and in part capital redistribution i.e. a short period of  high level maintenance to deal with both capital and income. It seems to me that in principle he is right in that respect. However, again, the figures are not broken down in any way so one cannot see what &#8220;split&#8221; if any the Judge was envisaging. Again, if one tries to put numbers on the exercise, it seems clear to me that adequate provision was not made and, in order to be fair to the wife, this situation should be rectified.</p>

The annual rate of &#163;20,000 for the first year, which the husband&#8217;s net income was going to continue at the rate of &#163;82,000 &#8211; odd) would have to cover a continuing mortgage payment on 1 Laurel Edge of &#163;6,700 &#8211; odd, the balance of &#163;12,300 being insufficient to meet the gap between the wife&#8217;s net earnings and her then current (uncriticised) needs. Thereafter, the second and third year payments of &#163;15,000 and &#163;10,000 respectively were said to be the amount which the wife required to be &#8220;sufficient to enable her to sustain an appropriate lifestyle while she builds her earnings&#8221; after which there was to be a clean break. Assuming, as the Judge did, no more than a gradual build-up of the wife&#8217;s practice before self sufficiency could be achieved, I can see little scope for her to make her own pension contributions other than by a much more severe cut in her cloth than the Judge appeared to think appropriate or fair. </p>

Viewed as a capital provision, that seems to me inadequate. In the circumstances of this case, it seems to me that it was impracticable to provide the wife with a pension even approaching her eventual needs, given the joint asset situation as between the parties. However, it seems to me that a fair order, based on the Judge&#8217;s overall approach (with which I do not in general find fault), would have been for the husband to provide &#163;50,000 by way of a kick-start to the wife&#8217;s future pension provision. I note that the effect of such an order would have been to provide the wife with 41% of the joint assets, to be contrasted with the figure of 37% awarded by the Judge. In the circumstances of this case I consider that such proportion is necessary in order to achieve overall fairness to the wife in accordance with the Judge&#8217;s intentions. In the light of the restricted resources available and the modest future income prospects of the wife, I do not regard it as an order which grants to the wife a meal ticket for life; nor do I regard it as unfair to the husband who has available significantly more valuable capital assets than the wife</p>
