However, after the hearing the father&#8217;s position seems to have changed. Ms Khalique&#8217;s order records at para 9:</p>

The mother clarified that she is now, in fact, living in rented accommodation in Dera Ismail Khan at a confidential address. The mother sought to retain a final hearing in this matter in light of the unknown timescales for receipt of the child&#8217;s passport, father&#8217;s fluctuating position, and his confirmation to the court that he intends to obtain legal advice. This hearing may, however, be vacated by consent in writing.&#8221;</p>

The father arrived late and handed in a second witness statement from himself together with exhibits, He also submitted a number of supporting statements.  Time was given to the Mother to review that material and in the afternoon the Mother made an application for the case to be adjourned.  Counsel for the Mother said that there were gaps in the evidence in relation to welfare and that given the father&#8217;s position it would not be possible to determine this case on the basis of submissions as had been contemplated in the order on the return date.   The mother would need time to respond to the Father&#8217;s evidence.</p>

I raised two particular issues:  one was whether the court currently had a sufficient evidential basis to determine the welfare issues and the second was to maintain judicial continuity if possible.   I also encouraged the father to contact the duty lawyer on Child Abduction Lawyers Association for legal advice, which he duly did. </p>

Counsel for the Mother submitted that it would be unnecessary for the court to conduct a find finding inquiry into the allegations of physical and sexual abuse that the Mother had made against the Father.  On behalf of the Mother, it was also submitted that if the Father had been unable to obtain legal advice by the time of the next hearing, then he should be required to submit his proposed questions to the court in advance.

For the purposes of her report, she carried out a number of inquiries.  She spoke to the allocated social worker for T after the Mother had made a referral to them on 27 September 2023. The allocated social worker had completed a child and family assessment, and she was going to advise no further action. However, the allocated social worker said that whilst she had no concerns about the care the Father was providing, she was worried about the potential of exposure to domestic abuse.  That concern arose from the history of the Father in relation to his first wife and his two children. </span></p>

The proceedings did not lead to Section 7 reports. There was considerable involvement from [the local authority] and the family were known to MARAC. However, there were proceedings in 2011 and a Section 7 report was prepared which concluded the risk of harm to FM and the children was high following a fact-finding hearing. The report, I understand recommended no direct contact between CJ and his sons. This resulted in a Section 91(14) being ordered until U was 16 years old.&#8221;</span></p>

Ms Demery explained that she asked U and the Father whether she could speak to FM, and it was agreed that U would relay that request to his Mother as he was the conduit of communication between his Father and FM.

I asked whether that submission went too far, given the absence of any expert evidence proving that the signature was not, as claimed, that of the Mother.  In response Ms Gray suggested that she put her argument on the basis that the court should put little weight on the consent form.  She referred to the fact that although the Father had referred to it in his first statement and said that he had exhibited it to that statement, in fact it had not been exhibited.  The form in the bundle was provided by the Mother having received a copy from one of the Father&#8217;s cousins as it was being circulated in his family group.

She had been prevented from travelling to Islamabad in July 2023 even though she had wanted to travel.  The reasons given why she could not travel were spurious.  T only had a small bag with him which was wholly inconsistent with a trip to the UK.  Immediately on arrival the Father had blocked the Mother from contact and in the witness box for the first time put forward the assertion that that was in fact with the Mother&#8217;s agreement.   Once she knew that T had been taken to the UK, the Mother had promptly acted in seeking the help of agencies in the UK, including the NCA and the NSPCC.   She had instigated proceedings in Pakistan and then, once she had been advised that she needed to issue proceedings in England, she did so.  The application to the Pakistan court which I referred earlier did not demonstrate that the Mother had agreed to T coming to the UK but only that she might have been aware of that as a potential risk. </p>

He had also developed a bond with FM.  However, it was notable that the Father had previously been absent from T&#8217;s life for long periods.  Pakistan was his country of birth and the place where his identity needs could best meet as a member of the Sia sect.  Up until his removal in July 2023 T had never left Pakistan and never visited England.  He was habitually resident in Pakistan and had extensive family in Pakistan both on his father&#8217;s side as well as on his Mother&#8217;s. </p>

The Mother has no passport and no relatives in the UK.  It was unclear whether she would be able to obtain a visa. There were huge difficulties in her being able to come to the UK.  The reality would be that she would be dependent on the indirect contact by video which Ms Demery had described as being problematic.  The Mother would be entirely reliant on the Father to facilitate contact and the court was fully entitled to conclude that the Father was actively hostile to the Mother.   He was highly critical of the mother and had made gratuitously offensive remarks about her in his statements and his oral evidence.  He had blocked the Mother for over a year before he had taken T to the UK.  That was itself a form of abusive behaviour. In his evidence he had displayed a complete lack of empathy and understanding of how T may have felt being taken to the UK and denied contact with his Mother. Whilst in some respects he had developed a nurturing relationship with T, the Father&#8217;s pronounced hostility would mean he would not promote in any way a relationship with the Mother.</p>

That supported his view that the Mother lived in a family compound with his brother.  He said that the Mother was lying under oath about the consent form.  He said that he would put himself on the guillotine if the Mother was correct and that she had not signed the consent form in the bundle.  He pointed out that the Mother&#8217;s lawyers had not commissioned any expert evidence proving that the signature on the consent from was not hers.

She had not understood the position with FM. He did not live with her and his contact with her he said was suspended.   He said that there was an expiry date for everything, and the court should not take into account what had happened in the past between him and FM.  Having been denied bail and detained before trial, he was eventually acquitted.  FM&#8217;s evidence had been used to prosecute him, but he had been acquitted.

Our own society is a multi-cultural one.

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The document in the bundle contains all of this information and on its face was signed by both parents.  No evidence was served by the Mother supporting her assertion that the signature was not hers.  She said that she did sign a consent form but not one which refers to living arrangements.  In my judgment, on the balance of probabilities, the Mother did sign the consent form in the bundle.  It seems to me to be unlikely that she would have signed a form that was not one that met the requirements of the Visa application.  That the Mother signed this form is consistent with her first statement where she said that the plan was for her to apply for a visa once a British passport had been issued to T.  </p>

In my judgment the evidence is compelling that whilst the Mother may have suspected that the Father might take T without her knowledge, she had not agreed that he should take him in July.  I accept her evidence that she believed that he was being taken to Islamabad.  That is demonstrated by the small bag that was packed for him.  The Father&#8217;s explanation &#8211; that it was because it was very cold in England - is unconvincing given that T arrived in England in the summer.  The photo adduced by the father dated 22 July shows T at the airport without any shoes.  Moreover, the Father&#8217;s actions in then blocking the Mother strongly indicates that what he had done was without the Mother&#8217;s consent.  </p>

That was an explanation given for the first time in the witness box and was not referred to in either of his very detailed witness statements.  Equally unconvincing was the contradictory explanation given for the first time in closing submissions that he might have blocked the Mother by accident.  The rejection of her request that she travels to Islamabad in July 2023 also supports a conclusion that the Father was intending to take T without his Mother&#8217;s consent.  She had been able to travel to Islamabad in March 2023 and the Father&#8217;s explanation that he did not want her travel in July 2023 because it would be uncomfortable is unconvincing, particularly when judged in the context of his other actions.</p>

As Ms Gray pointed out, the fact that the Mother may have had indications that there was a risk that the Father might act unilaterally and take T to the UK does not mean that she consented to such a step.  In fact, the application makes clear that it was something that she feared.  </p>

However, I reject such a reading as being unlikely. English is not the Mother&#8217;s first language, and the email is focused on having been blocked from contact and then receiving a call from the Father in which she was told that he was going to divorce her and keep T. </p>

The fact that I have not accepted the Mother&#8217;s evidence in relation to the consent form does not undermine the confidence with which I make that finding for the reasons I have given. </p>

The Father has been highly critical of the Mother&#8217;s parenting, suggesting that she is obsessed by social media and neglectful.

T can only have a meaningful relationship with both parents if he is returned to Pakistan.  It is unrealistic to suppose that the Mother will be able to come to the UK.  I can have no confidence given the findings that I have made that the Father would take T to visit the Mother during the holidays.  By contrast the Father is able to travel freely to Pakistan and has indeed spent significant time in Pakistan.  He has extensive family there.
