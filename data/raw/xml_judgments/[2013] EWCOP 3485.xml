There were concerns about her non-attendance at school, issues of domestic violence and the fact that SY was staying out at night at the homes of older males which resulted in SY and her siblings being placed on the At Risk Register. She was subsequently made the subject of a care order in 2007 which ceased to have effect upon SY attaining her majority in December 2011.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">SY, sadly, has a history of disrupted placements. Her foster placement broke down in June 2011 and she moved to supported accommodation. In August 2011 she moved to live in semi-independent accommodation, namely W. As a result, however, of the risk of sexual exploitation she moved in October 2011 to supported lodgings. In June 2012 she moved to her current placement.</p>

The authority only became aware of this relationship in October 2011. The police became involved in around November of that year after SY alleged to her social worker and care workers that she was being sexually abused and subject to sexual offences by other males. </p>

A strategy meeting held on 22 November 2011 concluded that SY lacked capacity to identify that she was being abused or exploited.</p>

Notwithstanding this advice, on 10 June 2012 TK and SY entered into a purported Islamic marriage ceremony at his home.</p>

His application to continue his studies was refused and his appeal was dismissed on the basis of a tribunal finding that he had submitted two forged documents and had attempted to deceive the immigration authorities. His rights of appeal were exhausted in June 2011. It is in this context that he began a relationship with SY in August 2011. </p>

The following day an associate of TK attended the placement and attempted to gain entry for the purpose of seeking SY&#8217;s signature on a document allegedly prepared to assist TK with his asylum claim. In light of the risks to SY of harm and exploitation, an urgent authorisation was issued and then a standard authorisation to deprive her of her liberty at the placement was granted.</p>

His relationship with SY lay at the heart of the case he sought to mount. The tribunal judge found that &#8220;The relationship, if there is one, does not have the necessary qualities of commitment, depth and intimacy which would be necessary to demonstrate family life for the purposes of article 8&#8230;&#8221;. He later observed that &#8220;viewed objectively her best interests are likely to be served by there being no further interference by [TK] and his friends with the care arrangements which social services have put in place&#8221;. He was found not to have given a truthful account in his evidence and not to be a credible witness.</p>

He maintained some telephone contact with SY up until her mobile telephone was broken in March 2013. Her social worker reports that SY has not shown any distress at her loss of contact with TK and has not made any significant mention of him in her monthly review meetings.</p>

That had seemingly been inserted into the pleading by amendment and as an afterthought so as to try to bring Mr Leigh's case into S55 (1) (c), as being 'a declaration that the marriage did not subsist on a date so specified in the application'. I am clear that the making of such a declaration would have been wholly impermissible as being a device to get around S58 (5) (which outlaws any declaration that a marriage was at its inception void) and I would therefore have dismissed that prayer had it stood alone. There remains Mr Mostyn's application for a declaration that the Cape Town ceremony did not effect a marriage at all&#8230;.It goes without saying that, if appropriately worded, the mere dismissal of Miss Hudson's petition for divorce and alternatively for nullity would inform any reasonably knowledgeable interested party that there was not a marriage between herself and Mr Leigh. There would indeed be nothing to prevent a specific recital to that effect. That would not be entirely satisfactory, however, since it would not theoretically bind third parties and problems might arise if either party wanted to marry here or abroad, or otherwise needed to demonstrate his or her status. A declaration, if permissible, would be in the public interest of creating certainty and would be beneficial and convenient for both parties. In my judgment, the making of such a declaration is not outlawed by S58 (5) if and for so long as it is made to declare that there never was a marriage, as distinct from being a declaration (which is not permitted) that a given marriage was void at its inception. When the facts dictate the latter (which, as found here, they do not) then the only route to resolution is nullity. Nor do I find persuasive Mr Le Gryce's argument about the former practice of the ecclesiastical courts. For so long as the High Court has an inherent jurisdiction, as it does, and has the authority of the RSC to make free-standing Declarations in appropriate circumstances, then such jurisdiction needs within reason to be flexible and to move with the times. I cannot accept that it is stuck in the mid-19</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:#000000">th</span><span class="apple-converted-space" style="color:#000000">&#160;</span><span style="color:#000000">century. Were it so, then countless orders must have been made (for example in the management of life-support systems) without jurisdiction. Accordingly I propose to make a Declaration that the Cape Town ceremony of 23.1.04 did not create the status of marriage as between Miss Hudson and Mr Leigh.&#8221;</span></p>
