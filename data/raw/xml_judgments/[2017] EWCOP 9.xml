The initial application was framed rather differently (see [36] below) but I determine the application by reference to this refined version proposed by TH&#8217;s counsel at the outset of the hearing.  </p>

As earlier indicated, he has a profound learning disability, and functions intellectually at the developmental level of a 1-3 year old. He also has atypical autism (i.e. his level of mental retardation makes it difficult to elucidate a full house of autistic symptoms).  He has the appearance of microcephaly, he has a neurodevelopmental disorder, hemiparesis, a weakness on the right side of his body, myopia, a convergent squint, an intermittent loss of balance and a mood disorder. He is doubly incontinent.  He has familiar routines, but is reported not to stick to or depend on routines; he nonetheless likes predictability. He has a short attention span.   He is greatly loved by his family, and is popular with his carers.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">IH spent the first 35 years of his life in a Punjabi speaking home within a Muslim community in West Yorkshire.  His parents are of the Sunni denomination of Islam, and are described in the court papers as &#8216;devout&#8217;. When IH was living at home, he participated in, to the extent he was able, and was certainly exposed to the routine religious practices and observances of the family; the expert evidence of Dr. Carpenter (which I accept) is that he would have had no real appreciation of the religious significance of these rituals even if he enjoyed the regularity with which they were performed, and appreciated an increasing familiarity with them.  The family engage in daily prayers, they fast during Ramadan, they celebrate Eid, all activities associated with the Five Pillars of Islam.  IH has never been expected to fast during Ramadan; some while ago, TH stopped taking IH to the mosque for prayers or other events as his behaviour there was occasionally disruptive to others.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Until August 2013, IH resided in the family home, cared for primarily by his father.  Inevitably, TH and the family at times struggled to cope with IH&#8217;s behaviours; in 2008, he had two in-patient admissions under <span style="font-style:italic">section 2</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">section 3 </span>of the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref></span>.  Increasing levels of support were offered to the family (including the provision of daily day-care) to relieve some of their burden.  TH personally shaved IH&#8217;s pubic and axillary hair for all the years in which IH was living at home and for one year beyond (i.e. until 2014).  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In mid-August 2013, IH moved to reside in supported housing provided by the Local Authority; this is not a culturally-aligned home, and his carers are not Muslim (though, in fact, his key social worker is).  In 2014 proceedings were issued in the Court of Protection to resolve a dispute between the family and the authorities about the optimal care and residence arrangements for IH.  Within those proceedings, there was no controversy about IH&#8217;s lack of capacity to conduct proceedings, or make the key decisions about his residence and/or contact.  The proceedings were ultimately resolved in the following year (June 2015) by orders made in the Court of Protection by consent providing for his residence in the home with a care package provided by the local authority and care provider (the placement and care package being funded by the CCG), for the associated authorisation for the deprivation of his liberty, and contact with his family. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">IH is not able to care for himself, and is assessed to require 2:1 support, 24 hours per day (one sleeping, one awake member of staff at night).  He is dependent on his carers for all aspects of his care.  His facial hair/beard is shaved with the use of an electric razor, which he tolerates.  He is an engaging man, and generally enjoys the company of, and is enjoyed by, his family who are regular visitors; he visits his family home three times per week. IH regularly becomes agitated.  Episodes of agitation can be provoked (sometimes &#8220;dramatically&#8221; and &#8220;without warning&#8221; per Mr. Scott, a learning disability nurse and assistant manager of the supported living accommodation where IH lives) by particular situations, and they can be unprovoked; he sometimes wakes in an agitated mood.  He has a generalised diminished awareness of everyday risks and dangers.  He is dependent on support from his carers for all aspects of his care including his personal care, meal preparation, and accessing the community. Mr. Scott gave evidence about the regularity of these occasions; I was left with the strong impression that they are regular, (sometimes several times per day, often associated with staff change-overs or family visits, sometimes very few in a day), of varying degrees of severity and intensity.  There have been days when IH&#8217;s &#8220;elevated behaviours&#8221; have lasted 12-13 hours.  When aroused, IH has a tendency to kick, bite, grab his carers, punch and/or spit.  Mr. Scott described how on one occasion he suffered broken skin to his leg (even through trousers) when IH kicked him.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">TH is anxious that his adult son should adhere as fully as possible to the tenets of the Islamic faith, and follow to the extent that this is possible religious observance and custom. TH and DH would expect IH to celebrate Eid with his family, and generally to eat Halal food, but they recognise that IH should not be expected to fast during Ramadan, given that IH would not understand the withholding of food and liquid during daylight hours.   TH initially deposed to the fact that &#8220;the removal of underarm and pubic hair is <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">a very essential</span> part of&#8221; (emphasis added) being brought up in the Muslim faith; he added that it was &#8220;compulsory&#8221;.

He nonetheless considers that it is IH&#8217;s &#8220;right&#8221; and that IH would have performed this on himself had he had capacity to do so.  I found TH (and his daughter who also attended court and also briefly addressed me), to be entirely focused on the best interests of IH; TH is well-motivated and understandably concerned, as a devout Muslim, to ensure that IH is enabled to live his life as closely to the Five Pillars of Islam as achievable and practicable.</p>

However, I consider that the social worker has significantly misunderstood (reflected by the words underlined) IH&#8217;s capacity to understand and reflect the concepts associated with religion.  IH has <span style="font-style:italic">no</span> understanding of the concept of Islam, and I find that he has <span style="font-style:italic">no</span> capacity positively to feel &#8216;proud&#8217; of his religious heritage; nor is he able actively to &#8216;associate with&#8217; an identity or culture, although he is undoubtedly associated by his family with that identity or culture. </p>

While recognising the religious significance of the hair-trimming procedure for a person with capacity, it is argued that as IH does not have capacity, there is no religious obligation or significance for IH in the procedure, and he is absolved by the tenets of the Islamic faith from any expectation of compliance.  There is on the other hand a risk to IH in attempting the trimming of the hair that he or others will be harmed in the process.</p>

Therefore it would be wrong to create a situation in which observance of Islamic custom would, or would be likely to, cause harm to the person (i.e. IH) or his carers;  if there is a risk of harm, then this principle would absolve even the capacitated person from performing an obligatory requirement.</p>

At a best interests meeting on 9 September 2016, TH advanced the proposition that there was a religious &#8220;duty&#8221; to remove or shave IH&#8217;s pubic and axillary hair.  In the same manner, his early written evidence (see [14]) referred to the &#8220;very essential&#8221; and &#8220;compulsory&#8221; nature of the activity, a view pronounced apparently on the authority of an Imam. This indeed is how Roderic Wood J characterised the issue, in passing, in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">A Local Authority v ED &amp; others</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2013/3069" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCOP 3069" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCOP 3069</ref>, in which he referred (at [12]) to a &#8220;duty&#8221; to remove the pubic hair of a Muslim woman (albeit recognising the exemption for the incapacitous).  Dr. Ali&#8217;s evidence, on which he was not challenged, was to different effect.  </p>

IH does not need to acquire this state of ritual cleanliness in order to derive spiritual benefit as he already occupies an elevated status by virtue of his incapacity.  Moreover, I am satisfied that IH himself derives no religious &#8216;benefit&#8217; by having the procedure undertaken, as he would not understand its religious significance.   It is of no consequence to me, in the consideration of these facts, that the carers may be blessed in the eyes of Islam in undertaking a &#8216;praiseworthy&#8217; activity by trimming the hair; their interests are not my concern. </p>

I was advised that TH does so, as do IH&#8217;s brothers (aged 33 and 35), and they have done so throughout their adult lives.  It would have been entirely consistent with the religious and cultural norm within his home and community.  IH would have been influenced, I am sure, by the fact that it would also have been a minor sin not to do so.  However, this factor carries little weight in my overall reckoning given that in progressive Islamic religious teaching, as an incapacitous person IH is exempt from observing the Islam rituals because he is already on a heightened state of spirituality.</p>

I note that TH heads a family where Islamic religious observances are maintained; the practice of pubic and axillary hair shaving was performed by TH for many years at home without apparent problem.  I also note that TH does <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> take an absolute view of religious observance for IH, recognising that in some important respects (even those enshrined in the Five Pillars of Islam) it is impractical for IH to follow the faith where the disadvantages of observance of religious ritual outweigh the advantages.  Thus, TH recognises that IH will not attend at Mosque, or say daily prayers (&#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">salah</span>&#8217;), or fast during the daylight hours of Ramadan (&#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">sawm</span>&#8217;<span style="font-family:robotoregular;font-size:10.5pt;color:#333333">)</span>.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The care plan has been considered during the hearing.  I do not propose to rehearse it in detail here.  When his father undertook the procedure, he used a safety razor and shaved the skin; it is now proposed that an electric shaver be used for trimming the hair.  It is felt that the vibrations would be unlikely to cause sexual arousal (per Mr Yates &#8211; clinical nurse specialist in psychosexual medicine), or that trimming (as opposed to shaving) would cause skin irritation, minor cuts or abrasions, or infection (Dr Pollock, consultant dermatologist). It is said that the trimming would only be carried out if IH was in co-operative mood; there is no suggestion that any restraint would be imposed in order to carry out the procedure.  Intimate personal hygiene needs of incapacitated adults are routinely met by their carers, and these actions are provided for in <span style="font-style:italic">section 5</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref></span> and para.6.5 of the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>: Code of Practice</span>.  In most respects the care plan seemed to me to reflect a person-centred approach.  In one respect, I am concerned; namely the proposal that the procedure would require the possible intervention of up to three people, two of whom would be positioned with IH in the relatively small bathroom, where it is planned to take place following IH&#8217;s bath.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This highlights the risk to IH and others through the process of trimming the pubic and axillary hair.  It is difficult to predict how IH will respond to the trimming procedure; he does not enjoy lifting his arms, and is resistant to deodorant spray.  The social worker advised me that &#8220;IH will not always comply with personal care tasks due to his autistic behaviours&#8221;.  He does not like to be in crowded situations.  His propensity to aggression &#8211; provoked and unprovoked &#8211; is already described.  While the hair trimming procedure was performed apparently successfully in the past, this was now three or more years ago, and was then undertaken by his father, not a carer.  I am concerned that IH would find the bathroom <span style="font-style:italic">over</span>crowded, claustrophobic, and anxiety-inducing.  If he finds this stressful, he may well become aggressive; his aggression may develop suddenly and dramatically.  This is Mr. Scott&#8217;s particular concern, and the principal reason for his view that it would not be in IH&#8217;s best interests to perform it.</p>

The fact is that by reason of his disability IH is absolved of the expectation of performing this recommended procedure, and there is no other clear benefit to him.  The trimming of the pubic and axillary hair would serve no other purpose.  I am anxious that IH should be spared additional stresses in his life, and wish to protect him and the staff from the risk of harm &#8211; an approach which itself has the endorsement of Islamic teaching (see [29](x) above).</p>
