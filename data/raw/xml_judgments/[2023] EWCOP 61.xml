That took place at an in-person hearing, although for reasons that were not entirely satisfactory, Dr Rippon attended only by way of video link.</span></p>

For this he was made the subject of a Sexual Harm Prevention Order. This prohibits Peter from being in the same premises as a child without supervision. Peter was then made subject to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 20</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, in that he was accommodated by Local Authority A. He was placed and resided in a residential and educational setting. He then moved to his current supported living setting, which I will refer to as Placement 1.</span></p>

She is also a vulnerable person, and she has a social worker from Local Authority B. They are never on their own, and their contact with each other is supervised for her protection. They do however, cuddle and hold hands, with, it seems, possibly a sneaky kiss on one occasion. The relationship would, under normal circumstances, probably be a sexual one. Certainly, Peter wishes to have a sexual relationship with Jenny.</span></p>

They are concerned about Jenny&#8217;s safety in light of Peter&#8217;s risk profile. One of the issues they asked this court to determine was whether I would authorise them to disclose Peter&#8217;s history to Local Authority B, in the form of an agreed script. I took the view that it was a matter for LA A to make that decision under their safeguarding duties, and that this court would only do so if it was in Peter&#8217;s best interests and that would presuppose that Peter lacked the capacity to make that decision for himself. This issue appeared to have been resolved at the time of the hearing because Peter informed Local Authority A that he had told Jenny about his past. There appears still to be some doubt about whether that is correct, however, I am now quite sure that Jenny and her social workers know about Peter&#8217;s history.</span></p>

It was the product of a review of Peter&#8217;s medical records as well as a Psychological Assessment by Dr O, a Chartered and Registered Consultant Forensic Psychologist from earlier in 2021. Dr O&#8217;s report is important. It is the product of an assessment in which Peter fully and perhaps even enthusiastically engaged. It concluded that Peter is in the extremely low range of global cognitive ability, and verbal comprehension, visual spatial, and processing speed. He is at a low adaptive level, which means he &#8220;displays fewer adaptive behaviours and skills necessary to take care of himself when compared to others of his age&#8221;. His socialisation skills are equally low. Furthermore, his receptive language had very low adaptive levels, but his expressive language was his &#8220;personal strength&#8221;.</span></p>

In particular, it was noted [5.10]: &#8220;he becomes fixated on objects or parts of objects, can harm himself, engages in compulsive behaviour, becomes so fixated on a topic that it annoys others, can threaten to hurt others, can be tricked or coerced into doing something that could cause harm, can become fixated on a person in a way that is unwanted and engages in unwanted sexual behaviour&#8221;.</span></p>

It is my opinion that his low scores in terms of both his IQ and adaptive functioning and indicative of mild learning disability. I note that he has an existing diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) for which he receives pharmacological treatment, He  has also undergone an assessment for Autistic Spectrum Condition (ASD), yet did not fully satisfy diagnostic criteria&#8221;.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">It was recorded that Peter has been and remains motivated and engages in his own care planning and with staff, teachers and therapists in education. He has also benefitted &#8220;from the increased structure, supervision, routines and stability within his current home and educational setting&#8221;. Dr O further states [7.5]: &#8220;[Peter] is actively engaged in therapeutic work with placement psychologists, teachers and care staff, to address his identified individual needs in respect of his historical experiences of abuse, his risks and presenting behaviours of concern, and to increase his resiliency for the future. However, it is my opinion that due to his individual learning needs and presenting difficulties, it is likely that it will take [Peter] much longer to acquire the knowledge and new stills and strategies needed to function within the community&#8221;. It seems to me this is important because in order for Peter to understand his needs he must understand how his learning disability impacts on how his needs are to be met as well as the limitations on his ability to engage with others in a conventional, or &#8220;normal&#8221; way.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Dr M&#8217;s reports and assessments record other observations. His support worker told Mr M that Peter is &#8220;very friendly and extremely manipulative&#8221;. He was said to be &#8220;sexually inappropriate towards other boys&#8221;. Furthermore, Peter was said to insert his penis into objects, such as his mattress, teddy bear, water bottles and clothing, in which he drills holes and &#8220;pleasures himself to orgasm&#8221;. Worryingly, there are reports that he has masturbated whilst talking with or watching other boys. He misinterprets the behaviours of others. If a woman smiles at him, he believes she wants to have sex with him. This is concerning because in another part of the assessment he is asked what he would do if someone asked him for sex, and he replied that he would have sex with them. Certainly, he appeared &#8220;extremely preoccupied with sex&#8221;. This was confirmed when Peter told Dr M that if he had unlimited access to the internet (which he does </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Garamond">not</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> have) he would watch pornography all the time. He becomes aroused by seeing women on TV and he has &#8220;thoughts of doing the things that he sees watching pornography&#8221;.  He has no control over his urge to masturbate and has modified his clothes by cutting holes in his pockets to make masturbation easier.</span></p>

Peter &#8220;recognises the thoughts as his own thoughts and that they are irrational. He spends a lot of time preoccupied with the thoughts.&#8221;. Dr M includes in his report a table of the various types of paraphilia. In that table, Peter expresses interest in women in their 20s, but there are reports he will &#8220;look&#8221; at girls of 6. He is also confused about his sexuality. There is also some history of him being aroused by guinea pigs and horses. Dr M considers Peter to be extremely vulnerable to all forms of sexual exploitation.  He also poses a very high risk of committing harmful sexual acts towards others.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Dr Rippon produced two reports and answered a series of questions. I will focus for present purposes on the issue of sex. She interviewed Peter face to face twice. They discussed the issues that related to the areas of decision making Dr Rippon has to explore. This included the critically important issue of sexual relations, including whether he understood that his proposed sexual partner had the right to refuse sex, and for that right to be respected by him whatever he wanted to do. There was quite an involved conversation about his previous sexual behaviour and his criminal conduct and whether and what he would want Jenny to know. The discussion was focused on Jenny primarily and whether or not she would wish to have sexual intercourse with Peter. He seemed clear that Jenny would have the right to say no, and he would respect that. When Dr Rippon asked Peter whether it would be possible to have sex with a person who was unconscious, he replied &#8220;No. They have to be able to say yes&#8221;. He was also aware of the age below which one could not have sex with a person. They also discussed marriage as a partnership.</span></p>

She also considered him to present with executive functioning difficulties.  This is a term used &#8220;for a range of cognitive, emotional and behavioural difficulties and include impairments with planning and organisation, flexible thinking, monitoring performance, multi taking, solving unusual problems, self-awareness, learning rules, social behaviour, making decisions, motivation, initiating appropriate behaviour, inhibiting inappropriate behaviour, controlling of emotions and concentration and processing information&#8221;. She also considered a diagnosis of OCD as being one that could not be ruled out and should be kept under review, very much for the same reason Dr M felt that way.</span></p>

In her Addendum report, following questions Dr Rippon revisited this issue. She was asked by the local authority to focus on victim empathy and the extent to which his executive functioning difficulties impacted on his ability to estimate the risks of his behaviour.

In that case, the Judge outlined a set of points as to what was the information relevant for the decision. The issue in this case concerns the last of those points. It seems clear that Peter is able to understand the first seven: which are about the type of property, the difference between visiting and living in a place, the area in which it is, nearness to family friends, activities available, whether he would have to pay for the place himself. Dr Rippon accepts Peter can understand all those. The contentious issue concerns care. Does Peter understand that care is an important aspect of the place he would have to live in? Or, put another way, that Peter knows he has to reside in a place where care is available, and that would rule out places where that care was not available, whether because of unsuitability or because no commissioned service would be available there.</span></p>

The Local Authority refers to Peter&#8217;s consistently expressed view that he does not consider himself to be a risk and that he does not require the level of support he has from the staff at Placement 1. This, they submit, means that he does not understand an essential feature of the residence he has to live in, namely the need for that level of support and supervision. For the Official Solicitor, this is not part of the relevant information in Peter&#8217;s case. In his written submissions, Mr Lewis says that the Local Authority&#8217;s case brings into the mix another placement that Peter has to consider, viz. one without the proper level of support, and that simply is not an option at the present time.

If the option was between Placement Q (similar to Placement 1) and Placement R (just an ordinary flat with Jenny, but without any adequate supervision) the issues of residence and care would be closely related and the Court may well conclude that he lacks the capacity to make that decision.</span></p>

I am not satisfied that the evidence in this case displaces the presumption that Peter has the capacity to manage his relatively straightforward financial affairs.  The argument deployed by the Local Authority against this I cannot accept. Ms France-Hayhurst states that if the Court were to find that Peter had capacity to make decisions about those parts of his property and affairs that do not concern his appointee it would create an irrational precedent. I do not agree. I look at the issue this way. If Peter did not have an appointee, his property and affairs decision making would become more complex for him. I doubt he would then have capacity to deal with the more complex part of his property and affairs. He would then need a deputy or, as it happens, an appointee to enable him to have capacity of the parts of his financial affairs he can manage.</span></p>

That impulsivity equally applies to strangers as it does to Jenny, it seems to me. That is because Peter, whilst recognising that he is liable to be sexually disinhibited, is unable to do anything about it. That is the essence of the risk that makes him lack capacity when deciding whether to have contact with the world in general. I am unable to see how that situation is any different when it comes to contact with Jenny. Since Peter lacks capacity to make decisions about his contact with people in general because of his inability to understand the risks he poses to others, and his inability, therefore, to mitigate those risks, I am persuaded that he lacks the capacity to make decisions about contact with his mother and Jenny.</span></p>

It is important to preface what I say on this issue with the following explanation of why this issue is different from most of the others I have considered. For historical reasons, sex and marriage are decisions that the law dictates cannot be made on behalf of a person unable to make the decision for himself. If Peter lacks capacity to consent to sexual relations, no one, this Court included can make a best interests decision on his behalf. He is simply unable to have sex. The Local Authority will have to use their best efforts to ensure that he does not have sex. The same is true of marriage. This is because consent is simply a basic prerequisite for both sex and marriage, and substitute consent is seen as repugnant.</span></p>

The focus must be on the personal ability of the individual concerned to make the (indeed, any) particular decision and the processes followed by him in arriving at the decision. The focus must be on the actual decision that has to be made, and that involves an assessment of unique circumstances of the person concerned. By focusing on the individual circumstances of the person concerned, the prescriptive approach taken by the earlier case law has to be approached with considerable concern (see Lord Stephens' judgment).</span></p>

Dr Rippon went through the classic tests with him. He understands what the physical act of sexual relations consists in. He understands that where there is sexual intercourse between a man and a woman there is a risk that the woman could become pregnant without adequate protection. He also understands that sexually transmitted diseases exist and can be spread from the infected partner to the other. This too can be ameliorated by the use of condoms. Peter also understands that consent is necessary on both sides. He need not have sex if he does not wish to. Equally, neither should his partner. Here Dr Rippon has vacillated. As Mr Lewis points out in his written case, she started to focus on Peter&#8217;s lack of what she calls &#8220;insight into his ability to control his behaviour and stop himself from engaging in behaviour he knows is wrong&#8221;. In her oral evidence on questioning from Mr Lewis and me, Dr Rippon focused on situations Peter may find himself in where he may find it difficult to stop himself because of his sexual urges. This has caused some difficulty for the court. Clearly, urges are, by their very nature, difficult to control, and it would be setting the bar too high if capacity to consent to sexual relations were to be ruled out because a person was unable to control an urge (for instance) to carry on with the sexual act. Having said that, Peter is a sexual offender who is unable to control his urges to engage in very harmful and criminal sexual behaviour, as I have already found.</span></p>

I would go further. A person can have the capacity to engage in sexual relations, understanding that his partner may withdraw her consent at any moment, and that with that he must stop the sexual act. If, however, when that withdrawal of consent happens the person is unable to overcome his urges, that is nothing to do with capacity to consent to sexual relations. </span></p>
