After Z&#8217;s birth G felt unable to consent to a parental order, due to differences between the parties as to the level of contact she would have with Z. Subsequently, an order was made in August 2021 for a parental order at the same time as a consent child arrangements order, providing for G to have contact with Z every six weeks. </p>

Late service of research papers to Dr Willemsen on the eve of him giving evidence delayed the start of his evidence. Such practice is to be deprecated. His reports had all been filed by 14 November 2023. It meant he had to return to complete his evidence on the second day, requiring him to re-schedule his other commitments. The court is very grateful that Dr Willemsen was able to make those arrangements. In future it may assist to have a deadline direction for all updating documents, including any research papers, to be sent to any expert in good time before the hearing commences. </p>

I have applied for a stepparent adoption order so that the idea of me being [Z&#8217;s] &#8216;stepparent&#8217; is dispelled in place of his reality that he has two loving parents, both of whom are his fathers and both of whom should be legally recognised&#8217;.</span> He considers central to the adoption application is Z&#8217;s identity, which X regards himself as a significant part of a family unit with same sex parents. As a consequence, X believes Z needs to have both his parents recognised as such in law as this will give him <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;the same stability and security that is enjoyed by other children in same sex families&#8217;</span>.

It goes beyond the day to day care of Z, it would ensure his birth certificate and his legal relationship reflects Z&#8217;s reality. As regards G, X and Y describe how they have compiled a photo album, have books about surrogacy and explain to Z in age appropriate terms that G carried and gave birth to Z. As regards ongoing contact with G they set out indirect contact until Z requests otherwise as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;anything more than indirect identity contact before such time would put [Z] in the way of emotional harm due to the risk of him being caught in conflict&#8217;.</span></p>

It will be for [Z] to determine the extent of the relationship he has with [G] as he grows older but, for now, it is for us to build a foundation of understanding within [Z] that [G] is a relevant person in his life&#8217;.</span> They consider the Local Authority report details <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;extensively with the bond that exists between [X] and [Z] as father and son and recognises the benefits to [Z] in cementing the reality of this relationship in law by the making of an adoption order. This sentiment is echoed in the Guardian&#8217;s report&#8217;.</span> They take issue with Dr Willemsen&#8217;s view that an adoption order would not affect Z directly. They consider it would make X Z&#8217;s &#8216;Daddy&#8217; in the fullest sense of the word, legal recognition of his family unit will bring about a sense of stability and pride in him being the child of two fathers in an LGBT family. They note that Dr Willemsen observes that the making of an adoption order would ease their anxiety and stress, which can benefit Z in the short and long term. They state X <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;is unconditionally committed to [Z] for life and is [Z&#8217;s] psychological and emotional father and parent. It therefore seems unfathomable to us that [Z] would not want his &#8216;Daddy&#8217; recognised in law and equally that he would not be adversely affected in the future when he becomes aware that this is not the case&#8217;.</span> The statement describes their level of insight, how it has evolved, how the situation has impacted on them and they do fully appreciate and acknowledge G developed a bond and love for Z during the pregnancy. They are not fearful of a relationship forming between G and Z but remain concerned about the views expressed by G about surrogacy and how if Z was exposed to those it would be harmful for Z, observing G only deleted her social media posts after they filed their statement in August detailing them.</p>

X and Y have made a number of unfounded allegations towards her, which they seek to use to justify cutting her out of Z&#8217;s life. G states she is upset about any suggestion that she may be homophobic. She finds the allegation deeply upsetting and asks, rhetorically, why would she have agreed to be a surrogate for a same sex couple if that was her view. She has described the circumstances of the tweets and online material posted by her, as she said in her oral evidence she did not have many people to speak to at the time and has apologised for the impact of those comments on X and Y.  G&#8217;s fear is the increased acrimony brought about by these proceedings and the way she has been portrayed by X and Y is harmful to Z, emphasising the importance of Z being able to maintain an independent relationship with her. If he is not able to do that, G fears Z will find it increasingly difficult to reach out to her, and will view surrogacy in a negative way.</p>

G agreed what they proposed as she would see it may be helpful for Z and she wanted to see him. When she arrived at the home on 28 August 2021 G states they made it clear that they would not let the contact take place that they had agreed to, with Z and G having time alone together. G states she had been happy to have the recording in the order about flexibility, as she considered that would mean such matters as working around Z&#8217;s naps/feeding times, rather than a complete change to both the length and nature of Z&#8217;s contact with G. According to G, she felt X and Y became increasingly hostile to her, she was very worried they would stop contact altogether and so went along with their requests to only have joint visits, although she could not understand the extent of the concerns they expressed in their emails in September 2021. G felt X and Y were extending the emails about contact arrangements to seeking clarification about G&#8217;s role in Z&#8217;s life. G said she felt she had little alternative but to agree to their conditions, as she feared contact sessions being cancelled. As a consequence, the contacts in September, October and November did not take place in accordance with the August 2021 order.</p>

She emphasised her view that a contact order is required, whether or not an adoption order is made. She supports the recommendations made by Dr Willemsen about restoring the contact ordered on 11 August 2021 stating <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;This is the only order that reflects [Z&#8217;s] reality, that he lives with his fathers and spends time with me. It is his reality that I am his birth mother, who carried him and wants to play a role in his life. I would never have agreed to be a traditional surrogate in circumstances where I was not going to have any meaningful involvement in the child&#8217;s life&#8217;.</span> She states that an important part of her decision to have a child for X and Y was because of their close connections with her sister and niece and what she understood to be the common intention that any child born would always be connected to her and would know her and her family as he grew up. She questions the acceptance of the social worker and Guardian that X and Y have changed, or now have more insight, bearing in mind her experience of what happened at the time the parental order was made and what she considers were barriers and obstacles to contact taking place in accordance with the order. There was a repetition of this behaviour in  discussions for the contact with Z in the presence of Dr Willemsen. She refutes X and Y&#8217;s suggestion to the Guardian that they had no option but to agree the August 2021 order. G does not accept the recommendations of the social worker and the Guardian. She re-iterates she supports Z remaining in the care of X and Y and wishes to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;play a role in his life through ongoing contact which takes place in a way that supports [Z] having a relationship with me. [X and Y] have not allowed this to happen to date. Accordingly, I believe that [Z&#8217;s] welfare requires the court to make orders which ensure an ongoing relationship between him and I in the way that has been recommended by Dr Willemsen. This will not happen if there is an adoption order, whether or not there is also a contact order&#8217;.</span> Like X and Y she would welcome engaging in work to help restore their relationship.</p>

X and Y began to feel anxious during the pregnancy of possibly losing what they considered was their child. As he states <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;There was no possibility to talk these feelings through (of [G] loving the baby and [X and Y] possibly losing the baby) because to do so felt frightening for all three of them. [G], in my view, could acknowledge her feelings, and certainly now she can although I think [X and Y] have hardly acknowledged the loving feelings [G] developed during the pregnancy. They did mention that they thought they might lose the baby. I think that [G] having affectionate feelings for [Z], apart from the actual role she may play in [Z&#8217;s] life, feels threatening to them to the point that they have strongly held to the surrogacy agreement and the narrative of [G] being a &#8216;surrogate&#8217; because in that narrative there are no, or hardly any feelings from the surrogate for the baby. In the agreement&#8230;the risks of such feelings are not acknowledged perhaps with the proviso that counselling can be accessed if necessary&#8217;.</span></p>

She was in touch with those feelings and her feelings of loss turned into anger, of feeling used and questioning the surrogacy process which Dr Willemsen considered neither party had prepared themselves well for. Dr Willemsen views her responses (such as the tweets) as a way of working through the very difficult feelings she was confronted with, which could not be worked through with X and Y and she had to bear some responsibility for. She considered she could help X and Y have a baby without fully taking on board any feelings she may have.

There is a concern that they could take matters in their own hands, become their own authority, and decide what is good for [Z] without being able to appreciate authority (the court) and experience (the assessment) from others&#8217;. </span> In the end Z was seen with G in the presence of Y, Dr Willemsen notes there was hardly an acknowledgment from Y towards G.</p>

As regards the suggestion by X and Y that it will be confusing for Z to have contact with G, Dr Willemsen&#8217;s view is that it might be that X and Y have difficulties <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;accepting the reality of [Z&#8217;s] conception and what sense [Z] may make of it as he grows up.

It seems to me a healthy option to have him see her, because there will be an openness about the conception and reality which will not come to haunt him as he becomes older.

This reality includes his fathers and [G] who gave birth to him. This may be complex, in terms of relationships, but there will be every opportunity for [Z], as he grows up, to make sense of his conception, and have some knowledge and experience of the biological connection with his birth mother&#8217;.</span> Adding in his oral evidence <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;&#8230;that [level of contact] is not a loss for the family, the fathers are his family [refers to videos with ducks] &#8230;I do not see [the August 2021 contact] as a threat to [X and Y]&#8217;. </span>Contact proposed by the other parties is more aimed towards Z&#8217;s knowledge but not a relationship with G. Although he stated his views do not differ whether there is an adoption order or not, save to observe that the original parental order required G&#8217;s consent, with the adoption order G&#8217;s consent can be dispensed with and he raises the concern that psychologically such an order <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;could be experienced as the father&#8217;s getting from [G] what [G] did not want to give. This may result in a further strain in the relationship, and a further complex dynamic for [Z] to get his head round as he gets older and tries to understand his history&#8217;.</span> In his oral evidence Dr Willemsen took into account X&#8217;s view that an adoption order would secure X&#8217;s position and may be easier for X and Y but he also needs to consider the background and his own experience in managing the contact he wanted to observe between G and Z. In response to Ms Bazley about X and Y wishing to remain in control he said <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;This is the danger &#8211; when feel out of control they will rein in&#8217;</span> which he agreed had implications if there was an adoption order.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In Dr Willemsen&#8217;s addendum report dated 14 November 2023 he further analyses the issues in the context of whether he should attend court to hear the evidence of the lay parties before he gave evidence. In that analysis he considers the position of each of the lay parties from Z&#8217;s perspective; as he sets out <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;Family life is central, not as seen from the perspective of the three adults, but from the child&#8217;s perspective. The fathers, that is, [Y] claimed they are a &#8216;motherless&#8217; family. The court may wish to consider the significance of this statement. Of course, from a concrete perspective this statement is correct, and there is, in my view, every encouragement to give the fathers for the life they wish to lead. &#8216;Motherlessness&#8217;, however, does not exist. The child was born from two people, biologically, and from three people, psychologically&#8230;The mother certainly played a part, biologically and psychologically, in the conception of the child. One of the implications of not considering what family life is, is revealed in the professionals&#8217; reports. There appears to be an assumption made about family, for example when the social worker considers that contact should only be at a certain level because of a &#8216;right to family life&#8217;, without defining what family is and what family life involves for the child, now and in the future&#8217;.</span> He also analyses what is said about identity, whether knowledge is enough for identity formation so that in time the child can himself determine what, if any, contact he would wish to have. He continues <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;Little thought is given to identity being a dynamic process. Identity is relational by its very nature. In other words: &#8216;I am who I am through the experience of the relationships I have with other people.&#8217; &#8216;Knowing&#8217; is closer to letter box contact which is not considered fit for purpose for many children&#8217;.</span> It is his view that the suggestion of the fathers being present during any contact <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;has considerable consequences for the quality of the child&#8217;s identity development&#8217;</span>. He considers the anxiety about the child&#8217;s separation from the fathers lies mostly not with the child, but with the fathers.</p>

Due to the history she considers Z requires a defined contact order to ensure his best interests are promoted. She recommends a discharge of August 2021 order, a step parent adoption order in favour of X that dispenses with G&#8217;s consent and an order for Z to see G twice a year and indirect contact twice a year.</p>

This was in the context of a number of decisions that concerned agency adoptions. He set out the historical context starting at para. [38]. At [42] McFarlane LJ went on to consider the European Court of Human Rights (&#8216;ECtHR&#8217;) cases, in particular <span style="font-style:italic">S&#246;derb&#228;ck v Sweden</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 1 FLR 250" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 1 FLR 250</ref> (&#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">S&#246;derb&#228;ck</span>&#8217;). <span style="font-style:italic">S&#246;derb&#228;ck </span>was a case where the parents had never cohabited and the father&#8217;s contact with the child had been very limited. As McFarlane LJ recorded at para. [42], the ECtHR held that Article 8 was engaged, but that an adoption order was not disproportionate in the light of the purpose of the adoption which was to consolidate and formalise the child&#8217;s family ties in the light of the father&#8217;s limited contact with her. At [44] McFarlane LJ went on to quote from that part of the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">S&#246;derb&#228;ck</span> which explained the distinction between cases involving the permanent placement of a child outside the family with a view to adoption and adoption by a stepparent as follows: </p>

While it is true that the adoption in the present case, like the contested measures in the Johansen case, had the legal effect of totally depriving the applicant of family life with his daughter, the context differs significantly. It does not concern the severance of links between a mother and a child taken into public care but, rather, of links between a natural father and a child who had been in the care of her mother since she was born. Nor does it concern a parent who had had custody of the child or who in any other capacity had assumed the care of the child.&#8221; </span></p>

He also identified cases in between these two extremes as being cases such as the present case where a step-parent adoption is actively opposed by a noncaring parent who has played no active role in the life of the child for some years, in contrast to an opposing parent who remains fully involved in the life of the child.</p>

For the child, and for the child's welfare throughout his life, there will be a qualitative difference between adoption by strangers, with no continuing contact or legal relationship with any member of the birth family, on the one hand, and an adoption order which simply reflects in legal terms the reality in which the child's family life and relationships have been conducted for some significant time. In ECHR terms, no adoption order will be justified in terms of its interference with family life rights unless it is 'necessary' and 'proportionate', but in assessing those factors the degree to which there is an interference will be relevant. In short, in the present case, the loss to A, and the loss to her father, of his legal status as her father who holds parental responsibility for her, interferes with their respective family life rights to a relatively modest degree.&#8221; </span></p>

She submits </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">&#8216;they worry that if [G] has contact and she cannot let go of the need to be seen as [Z&#8217;s] mother, this will send confusing and potentially harmful message to him that his fathers are not enough and his family with them is incomplete or inadequate. These are issues that vex the applicants. They always wanted for [Z] to have a relaxed natural and loving bond with [G] in which he would fully embrace his own surrogacy journey and celebrate with her the unique and special role she played in his creation to enable his fathers to raise him together as their son&#8217;.</span></p>

In that context he considered that G was in touch with her feelings about this, whereas X and Y were not. He considered G had done a lot of <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;soul searching&#8217;</span> about this, trying to understand and give meaning to her feelings and shown doubt, dilemma and struggled with difficult feelings about who she is in Z&#8217;s life. Dr Willemsen considered X and Y mainly focused on G not keeping to the surrogacy agreement, that she was undermining them in challenging the parental order and not agreeing to the step parent adoption. Dr Willemsen considers that lack of insight by X and Y has in their minds turned G into someone whose aim is to attack their family and have held to this narrative without challenging the way they managed their anxieties. Ms Bazley submits there is support for this analysis in X and Y&#8217;s first statement where they deal with G&#8217;s struggle with her feelings, that she had not told them about stating &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">Had she done so, things may have been different. Instead she chose to damage our relationship and trust by excluding us and making us feel that somehow our actions were our fault.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Bazley submits, when compared to Dr Willemsen the court should consider the conclusions of Ms Harvey and Ms Pulbere with caution. Whilst Ms Harvey has experience of step-parent adoptions, they have all been by consent and she has not dealt with a case with a surrogacy background. She accepted in her evidence that her main focus was to assess the suitability of the step-parent adopter. Her reasoning for supporting an adoption order do not, Ms Bazley submits, engage with the complexities of the situation, for example the background to the case, the position of the parties and Z&#8217;s particular needs. Her acceptance of X and Y&#8217;s reflection on professional advice lacks the detailed understanding of Dr Willemsen&#8217;s concerns about X and Y&#8217;s position when he sought to arrange contact and fails to properly consider the background to this case, particularly in the light of Dr Willemsen&#8217;s view that X and Y will only allow contact on their terms, as he had experienced.  Ms Bazley submits the strong and forceful resistance of X and Y in allowing Z to be observed by Dr Willemsen is <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;highly relevant to their mindset and how they would deal with contact in the future&#8217;</span>. Ms Pulbere&#8217;s failure in her written and oral evidence to assess X and Y&#8217;s current position regarding contact against the background, most recently set out in their statement in August 2023 and the way they dealt with Dr Willemsen&#8217;s contact arrangements also undermines her evidence and conclusions.<span style="font-style:italic"/>In her oral evidence her view regarding adoption appears to be as Z has been with and the intention is he remains with his fathers <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;adoption is the appropriate way of ensuring that he has that family life&#8217;.</span></p>

The focus of X and Y&#8217;s case being on their anger and upset without being able to properly consider G&#8217;s feelings of grief.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Bazley submits the August 2021 order was as a result of extensive discussions between the parties. She relies in particular on the Parental Order Report filed in June 2021 when X and Y informed her that they would be &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">happy for [G] to see [Z] every 4 &#8211; 6 weeks&#8217;</span>; the Memorandum of Understanding dated 19 July 2021 (noting the mediation sessions took place in February and twice in July) which sets out the contact agreed that largely reflected the August 2021 order; correspondence between G and X and Y&#8217;s then solicitor between 19 July 2021 and 11 August 2021. X and Y&#8217;s case that they were under pressure is not reflected in the way that it now appears the order was reached regarding the level of contact. Their position now about that time leaves real concerns that they did not, in reality, intend to comply with it. Their evidence was they had no choice, as without the contact order there would be no parental order.  Ms Bazley relies on the striking similarity with the situation X and Y are in now and the court can have little confidence that their approach now would, in reality, be any different. They breached that order within a few days, emailing on 27 August 2021 stating that they consider it would be best if they spent all the day together due to Z suffering from separation anxiety. It is notable, Ms Bazley submits, that none of the reasons given were new in the sense that they were not known at the time of the August 2021 order. This continued with G feeling increasingly unable to question the arrangement as she feared she may not see Z. In reality none of the visits that took place complied with the August order and the arrangements were dictated by X and Y. Inevitably things became more difficult in November and December due to the increasing tensions. This culminated on 7 January 2022 with X and Y emailing to say they do not consider the August 2021 order is in Z&#8217;s best interests and offering no further dates <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;due to prior commitments&#8217;</span>. As they note, when they write unilaterally suspending contact on 9 February 2022, they did not <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;believe that the relationship and role you are trying to force upon [Z] is in his best interests&#8230;&#8217;</span> They continue <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;as [Z&#8217;s] parents we have to put his needs first&#8217;</span> and they stopped all contact<span style="font-style:italic">.</span> G&#8217;s solicitor responded objecting to that course, there was no response until 11pm on Friday evening, 11 February 2022. Ms Bazley submits that response gave G no opportunity to speak to her solicitor so remained unclear whether contact was taking place or not. It was, she submits, in those circumstances that she attended for contact on 13 February 2022. G accepts she covertly recorded the exchanges, she said because no-one believed how X and Y behaved towards her. Ms Bazley submits it is revealing that until X and Y were made aware of the recording they sought to place the responsibility on G for what took place, for example referring to her berating them and denying they were <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;hostile or abusive&#8217; </span> to G.<span style="font-style:italic"/> Ms Bazley submits these exchanges provides compelling evidence as to their true feelings towards G.</p>

In the correspondence leading up to the August 2021 order there was no mention of any change in the position, or at the hearing itself. In those circumstances no prohibited steps order was sought by G. From correspondence seen during this hearing it appears they placed their property on the market at the end of August 2021, a matter of weeks after the hearing. They did not provide G with their new address, assuming she would find out from her sister when G said her sister had not been given the address. It was this background that resulted in the prohibited steps order being made on 11 March 2022. X and Y complain about control G is seeking to exercise without considering the impact of their behaviour on G and the contact.</p>

Importantly, G has not challenged that Z should remain in X and Y&#8217;s care but she wants Z to know her as a woman who brought him into the world, with whom he has a biological connection and who has an important role to play now and going forward. Ms Bazley submits the evidence demonstrates G&#8217;s conflict was not seeking to play a maternal role to Z the conflict was focussed on what her relinquishment of that status as Z&#8217;s mother would mean for Z, now and in the future. She rejects any suggestion this displays prejudice to families that do not have a mother. G is Z&#8217;s biological mother and considers Z&#8217;s interests are best met by the continuing role she seeks. The very much reduced contact offered by X and Y, supported by Ms Harvey and Ms Pulbere, poses real risks to Z. In the context of the repeated comments in X and Y&#8217;s evidence about how they see G it is perhaps understandable that G tried to process her surrogacy journey in the way she did online. She was feeling isolated and trying to make sense of how she felt, which appeared very different from what was being portrayed by others. Much of her online activity related to periods when X and Y behaved in a way that undermined her position or were related to the difficulties in X and Y complying with the August 2021 order or when X and Y filed their statements making comments such as there being no vacancy for a mother.</p>

She recognises now that when she signed the surrogacy agreement she was still quite na&#239;ve. Even though her feelings developed for Z during the pregnancy she remained clear she always intended to give Z to X and Y. When she seeks to explain this in the December 2020 letter X and Y drew back, seeming unable to put themselves in G&#8217;s shoes bearing in mind her circumstances leading up to that letter being in lockdown, experiencing these difficult proceedings and then receiving the letter relating to the parental order. The extensive and hostile way G was cross examined indicated that X and Y still have limited insight into G&#8217;s pregnancy and its consequences for G. By contrast, G&#8217;s reflections on the tweets focused on Z, what the position G was in would mean for him. She sought what she understood had been agreed in the first place: a relationship with the child she helped to create. In her evidence, Ms Bazley submits, G showed insight about being sensitive from the experiences with her son, B. She is fully aware of the need to be supportive to help Z to continue to feel secure in his family.</p>

She refers to Z <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;having a right to family life with no ongoing proceedings&#8230;the only possible outcome to secure [Z&#8217;s] future is through adoption&#8230;Since [Z] has been born, he has been [Z&#8217;s] father and it is important this is now recognised by law as it is in reality for [Z]. I believe this is important as it also provides a narrative for [Z] as he gets older, otherwise he may be confused why one of his father&#8217;s, who he views as his father does not have the same parental responsibility as his other father&#8217;.</span> Ms Harvey continues G doesn&#8217;t consent <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;because she wishes to see [Z] and play a role in his life which promotes his identity however she does not wish to parent him, therefore it is in my view that she does not need parental responsibility. [X] however wishes to parent him on a daily basis and make decision jointly with [Y] as his father, An adoption order will therefore achieve this&#8217;.</span> In her oral evidence she stated an adoption order is important as Z&#8217;s future will be secured with X and Y <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;It is a life long commitment, a message you are here for now and the rest of your life. Any other type of order would mean returning to Court. Further litigation and [Z] suffers&#8230;his long term identity needs will be secure with [X] as his step parent &#8211; that is the only order that gives the status of a father.

The need for caution, proper preparation, support and understanding before entering into a surrogacy arrangement is clearly advisable for very good reasons. As this case demonstrates, it can be difficult to foresee how each of the adults will feel at each stage and the benefit of recognising what may happen in advance and to have a support system in place to manage that is, in my view, essential. The consequences of the arrangement all the parties are entering into are lifelong and the need for more than a superficial understanding of what lays ahead is obvious. There was, in my judgment, only limited preparation in this case. Whilst there was a link between X and Y and G through G&#8217;s sister and they met up on number of occasions to get to know each other, it seems clear none of the difficult questions that the court is having to deal with today were addressed, or even considered or discussed.</p>

That, in my judgment, is looking at the issue through a very narrow lens and does not absolve them from considering independently whether that support should have been in place, if that was their view. With the benefit of hindsight, it perhaps provides an early indication for the difficulties that then took place. With the benefit of hindsight there may already have been a pressure to get on with it; possibly caused by the breakdown with X and Y and their previous surrogate, G&#8217;s knowledge of that and wanting to avoid any further delay.</p>

I accept G&#8217;s evidence that this did not enter her mind and that this has remained the position since, namely that she has never disputed the fact that Z should remain in the full time care of X and Y.

The delay in handing over Z and the reasons G wanted that. Understanding the reasons why these changes caused further anxiety for X and Y is relevant, as is G&#8217;s position that it was important to her to be in a position to physically hand Z to them. The silent turmoil each of the adults encountered, bearing in mind the respective fears, conflicts and feelings of guilt, must have been very difficult for them all and, at the time, unknown to each other.</p>

By contrast, G was clearly finding it increasingly difficult to manage her feelings, in particular her feelings of loss, the differing dynamics between the adults and what she saw as the lack of understanding of her position by X and Y. The arrival of the letter from the court about the parental order application on Christmas Eve 2020 brought home in a tangible way the next stage of the process. Although no-one&#8217;s fault, it was very unfortunate timing.  X and Y have struggled to recognise that.

The letter conveyed her perceptions at the time in the difficult circumstances where she was spending extended periods of time on her own. X and Y have described their devastation on receiving it and became focused on what was wrong in the letter. Whilst that is understandable as an immediate reaction, it is perhaps less so as time has gone on, suggesting they have shown limited acknowledgment or understanding of how this reflected G&#8217;s feelings at the time and to demonstrate any understanding from her perspective.</p>

When that did not prove helpful the parental order application continued through the court process. In their meetings with the parental order reporter X and Y are recorded as agreeing contact every 4 &#8211; 6 weeks. That report came through in June 2021 and there followed two periods of mediation resulting in the mediation Memorandum dated 19 July 2021. That document is clear about what was agreed between the parties; G to have contact with Z every six weeks with alternate contacts to be joint outings (with sometime for G to be alone with Z) and then full day visits from 10 am to 5pm with G picking up and returning Z from his home. Arrangements were also agreed about G seeing Z at the time of his birthday. The Memorandum also records X and Y had &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">no such plans in the offing&#8217;</span> to move.  All during this period X and Y had legal advice. The correspondence between X and Y&#8217;s then solicitor and G in the weeks leading up to the August 2021 hearing was produced during this hearing. It makes clear that it was the intention of the parties that there would be a child arrangements order in favour of G, that the court would be invited to make both a parental order and a child arrangements order and a draft order was circulated by X and Y&#8217;s then solicitor prior to the hearing.</p>

They had suggested them many weeks previously, they were in large part agreed during mediation and were followed up in a detailed way in the correspondence from their then solicitor. The August 2021 order represented a level of contact X and Y had said over an extended period of time they were happy with and the order was detailed, specific and had a schedule of dates attached to it over the next 6 months. Unlike G, X and Y had legal advice throughout this period and were represented at the August 2021 hearing. To characterise the contact arrangements as X and Y having no choice but to agree ignores the evidence and timeline leading up to the hearing and I reject that characterisation. When taken together with what happened after the August 2021 order it provides, in my judgment, some foundation to G&#8217;s evidence that X and Y did not have any real intention of complying with the contact order that had been agreed in circumstances where they had secured a parental order.</p>

The order made clear in one of the recitals that G did not seek to parent Z, and records she looks to be a presence in Z&#8217;s life and X and Y agree that it is important for Z to know G.  G&#8217;s repeated requests for the order to be complied with went unheeded by X and Y. In the light of these unilateral changes, which G had very little voice in, the contact that did take place became increasingly difficult and tense. X and Y&#8217;s evidence was that the changes were &#8216;agreed&#8217; with G, but I am satisfied for G there was no real choice, she had to go along with them due to her fear that she may not see Z at all.</p>

I accept G&#8217;s evidence that by the time of the contact visit in November 2021 X and Y hardly acknowledged her and the argument that took place in front of Z in December 2021 resulted in G stating they had taken a baby away from his mother after X and Y had said she was not wanted in their family.</p>

By 9 February 2022 X and Y unilaterally stopped contact, that was not accepted on behalf of G and the response back from X and Y&#8217;s then solicitor came in after business hours on the Friday before the next contact. The covert recording of what took place when G attended for contact on 13 February 2022 is revealing in a number of respects. I reject the suggestion on behalf of X and Y that G attended deliberately to provoke them and prefer her account of doing it to try and get some independent evidence of the way X and Y behaved towards her. She was not aware of the latest email response on behalf of X and Y. Although G could be described as being persistent in requesting contact on the door step, it did not justify the response by X and then Y, in the presence of Z. What was said has rightly been described as &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">horrendous&#8217;</span>. The way it is downplayed in X and Y&#8217;s subsequent evidence is revealing. Their denial that they behaved in the way described by G rings hollow in the light of the recording and transcript, supporting G&#8217;s concern of how differently X and Y behave towards her than they are willing to accept. Even making all due allowance for what was clearly a difficult situation, X and Y&#8217;s reaction was wholly disproportionate and needs to be very carefully considered in the light of all the evidence. The message they gave was that they were not going to comply with the court order.</p>

It is his view that contact at the level suggested by Ms Harvey and Ms Pulbere will not meet Z&#8217;s identity needs. He also considers that, due to the history, X and Y have not really started to come to terms with the situation and there is a risk that they have not fully taken on board the welfare need Z has to not just know about G and the role she played in his background, but also to have a continuing relationship with her, a lived relationship with his biological mother, to secure his identity needs. Dr Willemsen remains concerned about X and Y&#8217;s understanding of the importance of Z&#8217;s relationship with G and their ability to properly reflect on expert assessment. This conclusion is, in part, informed by his direct experience of trying to arrange the contact between G and Z as part of his assessment.</p>

I also accept his evidence that such contact should not be in the presence of X and Y. Whilst I understand the position of Ms Harvey and Ms Pulbere about the importance for Z to see the adults together supporting such contact that carries with it the risks for Z of the tensions that have been there previously. The recent meeting observed by Dr Willemsen demonstrates, to the credit of both X and Y, that Z has a knowledge of G.  There is in my view work that needs to be undertaken by the parties before they can have meaningful joint contact that is likely to benefit Z. The observation of contact by Dr Willemsen makes clear that Z has a knowledge of G, is clearly relaxed in her company and they were able to engage easily. Although the regular indirect contact will have helped, X and Y had prepared him for that visit and going forward will be able to support such contact in the same way.</p>

I consider that direct contact on four occasions a year, to include any birthday or Christmas contact, strikes the right welfare balance between meeting Z&#8217;s welfare needs to have lived experience of G, be able to effectively maintain that relationship and not to interfere too much in the day to day life of X, Y and Z. In addition, there should be two periods of indirect contact, with updating information about Z to be provided to G in advance of any direct contact. The indirect contact Z has become used to and it has obvious benefits. The direct contact should initially be for three hours and build up over a year to a day between 10 and 5, the dates should be agreed for at least the next twelve months, with a regime for agreeing them going forward after that.</p>

I am satisfied that the intention of the parties around the time of the surrogacy agreement was that G would have a continuing role in Z&#8217;s life, although they did not discuss the detail. Since his birth G has had some direct contact. The indirect contact since March 2022, together with the other material X and Y describe they have compiled, has enabled Z to retain a knowledge of G, which meant the direct contact observed by Dr Willemsen in August 2023 between Z and G went relatively well and Z has said he wants to see G again. I have already recognised the part X and Y will have played in enabling Z to have that ready knowledge of G. G has parental responsibility for Z albeit that she has not actively exercised it and agrees that it should be severely restricted in the context that she does not dispute that Z should remain living with X and Y, Z is thriving in their care and they are in a strong settled relationship. X, to his credit, has made it clear that whether the adoption order is granted or not, it will not affect his unconditional commitment and love for Z. </p>

However, I accept the submissions of Ms Bazley when the timing of the tweets are analysed they more often than not relate to a period of real difficulties between the parties and should be seen in the context of G trying to understand and work through the way she was feeling at that time and her recognition of the impact of what she did on X and Y. Dr Willemsen was clear in his analysis, which I accept, that this was part of the process whereby G was working through the conflicts and difficult feelings she had at the time. It is of note that neither Ms Harvey nor Ms Pulbere address these online comments in their reports as being a relevant welfare consideration now.

That history does not bode well. Coupled with the events on 13 February 2022 and what was said by X and Y and the way it was said, the difficulties about the arrangements for contact between Z and G in the presence of Dr Willemsen give rise to very real concerns about whether X and Y have really accepted professional advice, other than to the extent they think it meets Z&#8217;s welfare needs. I consider when the spotlight of the court is turned away there are real risks that they will not comply with orders of the court due to their inability to properly recognise and understand the welfare need for Z to have a meaningful continuing relationship with G and why. I consider that risk is likely to be higher if there is an adoption order, as it is likely to be viewed by them as a way of further securing their legal relationship with Z at the expense of Z&#8217;s welfare due to the obstacles they are likely to put in the way of that meaningful relationship between Z and G being maintained and supported. </p>

I fully take into account how X and Y, understandably, feel distressed at what has happened. Events have not followed the course set out in the surrogacy agreement. They feel strongly they should have equal legal parental status for Z. I largely accept Dr Willemsen&#8217;s evidence that X and Y need to begin to work through what has happened, which is likely to be difficult and painful for them. I agree with Dr Willemsen that G has worked through some of the difficult feelings she had. The December 2020 letter, although deeply distressing for X and Y to receive, demonstrates the extent of the difficulties she was having to manage on her own during Covid restrictions.</p>

X would acquire parental responsibility which he would share with Y and in a very limited way with G. In reality X and Y would be able to exercise joint parental responsibility for Z in every material aspect of his life.  G would remain Z&#8217;s legal mother and has agreed that her parental responsibility should be curtailed to the extent that she suggested during the hearing. In effect not exercising it other than to be notified in the event that X and Y plan to live permanently out of the jurisdiction or for periods longer than six weeks if it interfered with any contact and Z requires life-saving medical treatment.

I recognise and weigh in the balance that this order lacks the permanence of an adoption order but need to consider that in the particular circumstances of this case. As Dr Willemsen observed an adoption order is unlikely to make much difference to Z and introduces another complex dynamic for Z to understand. The child arrangements order arguably more accurately reflects Z&#8217;s reality.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Z is clearly thriving in X and Y&#8217;s care. That is not in issue and G has never suggested Z should not live with them, for Z that security is there. Z has seen G recently and has expressed the wish to see her again. Z&#8217;s identity needs are likely to be better secured with a child arrangements order for the following reasons. It will better reflect Z&#8217;s circumstances now and ensure his relationship with G is secured, whilst maintaining his current home with X and Y. I recognise that this decision will cause X and Y considerable distress. By making the application they have sought to replicate the parental order they could not secure. I accept X&#8217;s evidence that whatever the outcome it will make no difference to X&#8217;s commitment to Z and the evidence is Z is thriving in their care. I have carefully weighed in the balance what X and Y have said about the benefits of this order as a same sex couple and the wider security such an order would give them and Z, but I have had to balance that with what I consider to be Z&#8217;s wider long terms needs to have an effective meaningful relationship with G and not introduce a further complicating dynamic for Z. Whilst events have not turned out as originally planned under the surrogacy arrangement, from Z&#8217;s perspective that is his reality and the sooner he understands that in a meaningful way will better secure his lifelong welfare needs. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">His family life under Art 8 encompasses securing his identity rights which include being cared for by X and Y and having contact with G. I consider for the reasons outlined above, that there is a higher risk of the contact order not being complied with if it is made in connection with an adoption order as until X and Y fully take on board what has taken place and the need for Z to have contact with G in the way I have determined above, there is a real risk they will seek to continue to undermine it, which is detrimental to Z&#8217;s welfare.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So when balancing all the considerations, in particular those in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1(4)</ref>, I have reached the conclusion that Z&#8217;s welfare in the circumstances of this case do not require me to dispense with G&#8217;s consent, bearing in mind the background to this particular case and the continuing need for G to be recognised as a living part of Z&#8217;s life, as an important part of his lifelong identity needs. I consider the risks of him ceasing to be a member of the original family, in the sense that his legal relationship with G is extinguished puts that important welfare need at risk. The need to secure Z&#8217;s legal relationship with X can be met by the court making a child arrangements order confirming Z will live with X. This will secure his welfare needs in the widest sense that apply in this case. Whilst this is not the order X seeks he has remained clear his commitment to caring for Z is unchanged. There will be a contact order in the way outlined above and an order restricting G&#8217;s parental responsibility in the way outlined by Ms Bazley in the document she circulated limiting it to G being notified in the event of Z receiving life-saving medical treatment, Z moving home, permanently leaving the jurisdiction or for a period of six weeks if it interferes with G&#8217;s contact. <span style="font-style:italic">Re A <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2023/689" uk:canonical="[2023] EWCA Civ 689" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2023">[2023] EWCA Civ 689</ref></span> approves the use of a prohibited steps order prohibiting a parent from taking any steps in the exercise of their parental responsibility.

The application is founded on the length of time these proceedings have been going on, which perhaps reflects the complexities in this case. I do consider making such an order is required in this case as Z&#8217;s welfare needs require it. It will send out a clear message that any further applications are likely to be inimical to Z&#8217;s welfare and that the focus of the parties now must be to comply with the order and take the steps necessary to seek to rebuild their relationship. The order will be made for a period of 3 years, by which time Z will be settled in school and the contact outlined above will be in an established routine.</p>

This is now the opportunity for each of them to demonstrate to Z that they can work together and each play their part to ensure that is achieved.</p>
