	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This judgment concerns an application for an order under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1996</ref> (&#8220;FLA&#8221;), commonly known as a Non-Molestation Order. There is nothing unusual about this particular case, and such applications rarely come before a High Court Judge. However, there has been no published judgment on such an application for some years, and I felt it would be helpful to set out the basic principles that apply to such applications and orders. I do this in part because there has been a significant growth in the number of such applications during the Pandemic, and in many parts of the country that increased number has not fallen back to pre-Pandemic levels. A large proportion of the applications are made without notice (ex parte) and it may be useful for practitioners to be reminded of the very strict criteria for the making of such orders ex parte.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Applicant made a without notice application to the Court for a Non-Molestation Order on 8 November 2022. In that application she filed a statement setting out her case, as I summarise below.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Applicant and the Respondent started a relationship in October 2021 and the relationship ended by WhatsApp message on 16 September 2022. The parties had a professional relationship through a networking group. She recounts that the relationship became problematic and there were a number of arguments, but she expressly says that the Respondent was not verbally (or physically) abusive to her. She felt that he was controlling towards her, frequently phoning and monitoring where she was. He became increasingly demanding of her in terms of answering his calls and being available. She also says that the Respondent was controlling of her by buying her extravagant presents and then accusing her of being ungrateful. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In June 2022 the Applicant became aware that there were a number of complaints about the Respondent in the networking group, around his behaviour to women. He said these allegations were false, but the Applicant became more suspicious and fearful of him. The allegations were about narcissistic behaviour and attitudes.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The relationship was plainly going downhill with the Respondent texting her 20-30 times a day. There was an incident in August when they went away together and there was an argument over whether the Respondent was flirting with a waitress.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I recount these details because it can be seen that this is a fairly typical account of a failing relationship, and much of the Applicant&#8217;s account is open to different perceptions of what was happening between the parties. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, from September the Applicant started to work in the Respondent&#8217;s business part time because she needed the money.  She felt that the Respondent then became even more demanding. On 16 September she sent him a text ending the relationship and saying she would pursue &#8220;formal action if he contacted [her]&#8221;. She blocked the Respondent after sending the message. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Respondent did continue to communicate with her by ringing her phone &#8220;on a few occasions&#8221;. He then emailed her, and she says he threatened her career if she told people about his behaviour. I have read the email of 18 September and it is rather sad, but in my view is in no sense controlling or threatening. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There was then a financial dispute within the context of the business relationship and the Respondent sent the Applicant an email about her phone contract.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">14 October was the last contact from the Respondent to the Applicant in an email where he threatened to take her to the Small Claims Court if she did not pay the money that she owed him. She then received a letter from the Small Claims Court saying that he had brought proceedings for &#163;1750 relating to the phone contract. She then counter-claimed for wages owed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 8 November the Applicant made a without notice application for a Non-Molestation Order saying the matter was urgent because the Respondent&#8217;s &#8220;behaviour is very unpredictable &#8230;.&#8221; and that if it was on notice the Respondent might try to dissuade her from making the application. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is important that these principles are applied properly, and orders are not simply granted by default. In particular, it is important for all concerned to note that a without notice application should only be made in exceptional circumstances where there is a risk of significant harm.  If a without notice application is made, then the statement in support must expressly deal with why the case is exceptional and what the significant risk alleged is. There can be no doubt that far too many such applications are made where there is no reasonable basis to grant the application without notice. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the present case the District Judge was entirely correct not to grant the order on the without notice application. I appreciate that the Applicant was a litigant in person, and not conversant with the law. However, there was simply no basis for making a without notice order. Such an order is only appropriate where there is significant risk of immediate harm. In circumstances where there had been no contact from the Respondent for at least 3 weeks before the application was made, a without notice order would have been wholly inappropriate on facts such as this. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Further, in my judgement, there was no proper basis for any order to be made. There is no definition of molestation, and plainly the impact of particular conduct can be very different on different individuals. There does not have to be a threat of violence, and electronic communications can amount to harassment and cause alarm. However, the conduct has to be sufficient to justify the intervention of the court. Orders should not be granted where the evidence suggests that there is some upset at the end of a relationship, and little or nothing to suggest the conduct complained of would amount to &#8220;molestation&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The law is clear that there does not have to be a positive intent to molest. However, that does not mean that the test is a wholly subjective one whereby the Applicant simply has to feel distress. Such subjective distress does not alone justify the making of an order. The conduct has to be of a nature or degree that justifies the intervention of the court. </p>
