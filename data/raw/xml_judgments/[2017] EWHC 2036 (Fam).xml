At that time, X, as I shall continue to refer to her, was only a few days short of her 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday and was detained, pursuant to a Detention and Training Order imposed by the Youth Court, in a secure unit which I shall continue to refer to as ZX.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">In these circumstances the court is placed in very considerable difficulty. The need for a final care order is overwhelming. It is imperative in X&#8217;s interests (a) that the local authority has parental responsibility and (b) that X can enjoy, now and, after she leaves care, in accordance with the &#8216;leaving care&#8217; legislation, all the benefits which will accrue to her if there is a care order. But there is at present no realistic care plan available for me to approve, other than (see below) a plan of action which it is hoped will lead to the formulation of a proper care plan. Yet my ability to make a care order, given X&#8217;s age, will be gone in a matter of days. What am I to do?</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;There are increasing concerns about [X]&#8217;s mental state &#8230; For much of the time [X] is actively expressing a wish to die and taking every measure available to harm herself.</p>

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8230; there was no evidence to support a diagnosis of moderate to severe depression or a presentation with a mood related psychotic illness. [X] appeared to be in a &#8220;fugue&#8221; or trance like state during periods of restraint but she appears to be listening to conversations and able to choose to make requests &#8230; even at times where she does not appear to be responding to staff requests.</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8230; In my opinion, even if [X]&#8217;s current high level of emotional dysregulation is related to her underlying diagnosis of Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (EUPD) and ADHD &#8230; there are sufficient grounds for a period of further assessment under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act &#8230;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">In trying to find a diagnostic label to best fit with her current presentation when there are long periods where she is either seriously attempting self-harm, with a view to committing suicide, or in a fugue, I think the most helpful diagnostic label would be that of a Reactive Adjustment Disorder (ICD10 F43.2).  [X]&#8217;s trance-like behaviour is linked to her frustration, agitation and profound disappointment that her only wish is to return home to her mother &#8230; cannot be fulfilled and she is hopeless as to her future.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Using this diagnostic framework, one could hypothesise that her current pattern of extreme behaviour is a mal-adaptive coping mechanism arising out of great distress, which provides a possible way forward in terms of psychotherapeutic support and gradual adaptation to a revised future. However, in order to help [X] adapt she needs to be in a setting that cannot only support her but gradually challenge her unhelpful cognitive beliefs and provide her with more adaptive coping strategies.&#8221;</p>

This is a child who is subject to a care order and who is accordingly owed support by the local authority pursuant to its duties to her as a looked after child. This is also a child who has significant mental health and emotional issues, which make her behaviours both dangerous and uncontrollable. More than this, she is highly vulnerable. Despite all of these factors, she has been placed in a situation where weeks and months have gone by with there being no placement available for her countrywide &#8230; The provisions for placement of children and adolescents requiring assessment and treatment for mental health issues within a restrictive, clinical environment is worryingly inadequate. One has to question what would have happened in this case had [X] not received a criminal sentence? Given the level of her behaviours, where would she have been placed?

However, we urge the Government to prioritise investment in crisis care services for children and young people and urge NHS England, clinical commissioning groups and social services to ensure that adequate emergency care pathways are in place as a matter of urgency.&#8221;</p>

I understand from them that there are, across the country, six low secure units at which X could in theory be placed &#8211; if any of them had an available bed. Absent an unexpected early discharge, however, none has an available bed for several months. I emphasise that neither of these committed public servants is to be criticised for the present state of affairs. They can only do their best, as they are doing, having regard to the resources made available to them. They are not responsible for the provision of those resources &#8211; that is the responsibility of others. </p>

Ms Gregg, as I have said, makes no criticism of the local authority&#8217;s endeavours. Nor, in the circumstances, does she criticise the local authority for, quite properly, seeking to formulate a contingency placement for when X leaves ZX. But she rightly describes the prospect of such a community placement, even one with wrap around medical care, as greatly concerning. I agree. In the event, and in my judgment quite rightly, by the end of the hearing on 1 August 2017 this was not an option being promoted by anyone, even on a contingency basis. Given the &#8220;Specification for Care&#8221; set out in the Annex to this judgment, such a placement would simply not be feasible, quite apart from the fact that it would not meet X&#8217;s needs. </p>

Of course, this is all driven by the imperative need to preserve X&#8217;s life, but how is this treatment compatible with her humanity, her dignity, let alone with her welfare? It is no criticism whatever of the devoted staff at ZX, who are doing their very best for X in what they recognise is not the right kind of placement for her, but I am bound to question whether these conditions, particularly when imposed upon a profoundly damaged and vulnerable young woman, can really be thought to meet the requirements imposed upon us by Article 3 of the European Convention &#8211; which, without qualification, prohibits subjecting anyone to &#8220;inhuman or degrading treatment&#8221; &#8211; let alone the more demanding obligation under Article 8 to &#8220;respect&#8221; X&#8217;s &#8220;private and family life.&#8221; And, lest it be thought that I have overlooked the point, given the by now well documented and repeated attempts by X to take her own life, the State&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">positive </span>obligations under Article 2 of the Convention are plainly engaged: see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Rabone and another v Pennine Care NHS Trust (Inquest and others intervening)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2012/2" uk:canonical="[2012] UKSC 2" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] UKSC 2</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2012] 2 AC 72" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] 2 AC 72</ref>.

We are, even in these times of austerity, one of the richest countries in the world. Our children and young people are our future. X is part of our future. It is a disgrace to any country with pretensions to civilisation, compassion and, dare one say it, basic human decency, that a judge in 2017 should be faced with the problems thrown up by this case and should have to express himself in such terms.</p>

The honest answer to this question should make us all feel ashamed. For my own part, acutely conscious of my powerlessness &#8211; of my inability to do more for X &#8211; I feel shame and embarrassment; shame, as a human being, as a citizen and as an agent of the State, embarrassment as President of the Family Division, and, as such, Head of Family Justice, that I can do no more for X. </p>
