	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Where, as in this grave and difficult case, a dispute arises between parents and treating doctors regarding the proper course of treatment for a seriously ill child, the court may grant a declaration declaring that treatment in accordance with the recommendation of the child&#8217;s doctors can take place, on the grounds that it is in the child's best interests (see Re B (A Minor)(Wardship: Medical Treatment) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1982) 3 FLR 117" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1982">(1982) 3 FLR 117</ref>).  The jurisdiction of the court to make such an order arises where a child lacks the capacity to make the decision for him or herself, in the context of a disagreement between those with parental responsibility for the child and those treating the child (An NHS Trust v MB <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2006/507" uk:canonical="[2006] EWHC 507 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWHC 507 (Fam)</ref>).

The solemn task with which this court is charged is that of determining whether it is in Isaiah&#8217;s best interests for the life sustaining treatment from which he currently benefits to continue.  The discontinuance of such treatment will, on the evidence before the court, lead to Isaiah&#8217;s death. </p>

The First Respondent is the mother of Isaiah, Ms Takesha Thomas (hereafter &#8216;the mother&#8217;). She is represented by Mr Ian Wise QC and Mr Bruno Quintavalle.  The Second Respondent is the father of Isaiah, Mr Lanre Haastrup (hereafter &#8216;the father&#8217;).  He appears before the court in person, as he has done throughout these proceedings.  He has presented his case in a forthright manner, but with concision and courtesy to the court in what must be, for him, extremely difficult circumstances.  Isaiah is a party to these proceedings and his interests are represented by his Children&#8217;s Guardian.  Ms Shabana Jaffar appears on behalf of Isaiah. </p>

Having heard the mother&#8217;s application for an adjournment, supported by the father but opposed by Trust and the Children&#8217;s Guardian, I granted a short adjournment of seven days to permit the mother&#8217;s new legal team time to consider the papers, take instructions from the mother and prepare this matter for final hearing.

It would appear that Dr L (who, as I have noted, is described in Mr Foster&#8217;s statement as a specialist in paediatric haematology and oncology) attended King&#8217;s College Hospital with a colleague on 20 January 2018 in the company of the father and performed an examination of Isaiah.  The Trust contend that the doctor and her colleague did not identify themselves as doctors, claimed to be friends of the parents and, in that way, gained access to Isaiah in intensive care.  When I asked him about this matter, the father told the court that he had been contacted on 20 January 2018 by a &#8220;supporter&#8221; (by which he appeared to mean a member of the public sympathetic to the parents&#8217; situation), which supporter told him that there were two doctors &#8220;in town&#8221; who would be able to help.  The father attended the hospital with these doctors, one of whom was Dr L.  He asserts that the doctors did identify themselves to medical staff.  Upon the visit and examination being discovered, the Trust sought to establish whether Dr L and her colleague have a GMC registration with a licence to practice.  It appears they do not.   The Trust thereafter contacted the General Medical Council who advised the Trust to refer the matter to the Police in circumstances where an offence under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/54" uk:canonical="1983 c. 54" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Medical Act 1983</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/54/section/49" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 49</ref> may have been committed.

Isiah was found to be in the mother&#8217;s abdominal cavity by reason of that rupture.  At birth Isaiah presented as floppy, with no heartbeat audible, no respiratory effort and no response to stimulation.  Isaiah required resuscitation by way of ventilation and cardiac compressions.  Resuscitation secured a heartbeat at 2 minutes and 50 seconds.  Test revealed that Isaiah had sustained a prolonged hypoxic insult and, in view of this, therapeutic cooling of Isaiah was attempted to prevent further damage to his brain.  With respect to the birth of Isaiah, Professor Whitelaw observes as follows (emphasis in the original): </p>

For the father in particular, it is clear that the resultant breakdown in trust has led to a situation where what for the doctors is a clear medical consensus based on careful and thorough scientific assessment, is for the father the product of what he considers to be, to quote him, &#8220;cronyism and nepotism&#8221;.   Whilst I make no comment on the views on standards of care expressed in the following passage from Dr Habibi&#8217;s report, Dr Habibi perceptively summarises the position as follows: </p>

Isaiah&#8217;s state of profound neuro-disability is the result of alleged substandard care received at the time of birth, which has understandably has (sic) left his parents devastated at the loss of what should have been a joyous occasion, the birth of their son Isaiah.  They feel absolutely let down by the healthcare system, are understandably critical of the standard of care received at the time of birth and have good reason to be angry.  In some respects, the parents&#8217; feelings can best be understood in terms of a state of suspended grieving over a period of 9 months.  Intensive care personnel can also find it very challenging caring for patients left with profound neurodisability when there is no prospect of improvement.  The day to day routine of intensive care can become an intense emotional burden when faced with what appears to be a hopeless situation.  The stage is then set for misunderstandings in communication between staff and parents, which can result in an erosion in trust and breakdown in relationships.&#8221; </p>

An electroencephalogram (hereafter &#8216;EEG&#8217;) and a Cerebral Function Monitor (hereafter &#8216;CFM&#8217;) showed electrical seizures on a supressed background.

Clinical examination by Dr H that day revealed no spontaneous movement, no reaction to pressure on the sternum, no gag reflex on deep suction of the pharynx.  In light of the EEG report of electrical seizures, levetiracetam was increased on 21/2/17.  The following days, 22/2/17 and 23/2/17, status epilepticus was noted on the continuous aEEG (CFM).  This term means continuous seizure activity with insignificant pause between seizure activity for over 30 minutes.  While occasional brief seizures are probably not harmful themselves, status epilepticus is believed to cause brain injury in its own right and is therefore important to treat.  The rate of the midazolam infusion was increased and the dose of levetiracetam was increased. </p>

The mother and father consider that Isaiah&#8217;s change in presentation was the consequence of an episode of diarrhoea that resulted in Isaiah not absorbing sedative medication.  The father contends that prior to this point, the parents had come to reconcile themselves to palliative care and this was plainly an extremely important moment for the parents, standing as it did, in their perception, in contrast to the prognosis provided up to that point.  Indeed, within the foregoing context, I am satisfied that this development, and the parents&#8217; explanation for it, is at the root of their current view that Isaiah will continue to make progress and that Isaiah&#8217;s levels of consciousness are not the exclusive result of his brain injury but are down to medication he is being administered.   </p>

He was extremely acidotic at delivery, and was gravely ill with multi-organ failure in the first 24 hours.  Unfortunately, in this setting whilst other organs can recover quickly, brain injury is often permanent and severe, Isaiah had the most severe clinical stage of hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (Samat Stage 3) initially.  He had a pattern of severely abnormal brain electrical activity (burst suppression) which did not improve in the first 24-48 hours.  These are all associated with very poor neurological prognosis.  He had refractory seizures that were ultimately controlled only with three anticonvulsants (though they have since improved).  His magnetic resonance imaging shows evidence of very widespread restricted diffusion &#8211; this is a pattern seen with cytoxic cell oedma &#8211; indicating brain cells that are swollen and in the process of dying.  His neurological examination at 6 weeks of age is extremely abnormal with markedly abnormal tone and reflexes. </p>

Furthermore, his conscious state remains profoundly depressed and he remains ventilator dependent without any significant improvement.

The combination of severe basal ganglia and cortical injury, with his ongoing severely abnormal conscious state lead me to believe that he will, in addition have profound cognitive impairment.

However, taking into account the wishes of his parents, Dr S expressed the opinion that further reduction in both Levetiracetam and Baclofen, with a view to trying to potentially stop them altogether over the space of 2 weeks, would be clinically reasonable, providing Isaiah does not manifestly show significantly increasing discomfort from abnormal tone or movements and he does not develop electromagnetically proven seizures. </p>

This was also the experience of Professor Whitelaw and Dr Habibi during their respective examinations of Isaiah.  In oral evidence, Dr Habibi confirmed that, as a result of his permanently deranged basal functions, Isaiah demonstrated no useful respiratory drive that could be life sustaining and a complete absence of airway protective reflexes, giving rise to a high risk of infection even in an intensive care setting.  Dr Habibi considered these findings consistent with the findings of the MRI scans, amounting to a physiological and anatomical correlation.   Dr Habibi was &#8220;certain&#8221; Isaiah will never be able to breath on his own.  When Professor Whitelaw carried out his examination, Isaiah&#8217;s blood oxygen saturation fell below 80% after four minutes of being removed from the ventilator, due to inadequate breathing, and he had to be re-ventilated.  </p>

The MR images give the best prediction of later outcome but continuous EEG over the first few days, and neurological examination in the newborn period are also predictive.  In Isaiah&#8217;s case, it was possible to say at about 10 days of age that, if he survived, he would have severe quadriplegia.  What has emerged since then is that (a) despite good nutrition and good supportive care including physiotherapy, he has made no significant neurological or developmental improvement in 9 months, (b) his MRI at 10 weeks showed massive loss of brain tissue and (c) his brain is not able to sustain breathing without mechanical help.  The brain injury on his second MRI is even more severe than any of the 200 surviving infants our team has followed in Bristol.  Huge and important areas of brain have been lost and are not going to regenerate.  Isaiah&#8217;s condition is not going to significantly improve.&#8221; </p>

Within this context, Professor Whitelaw opines that this medication is not depressing Isaiah&#8217;s breathing or his level of consciousness.  Professor Whitelaw makes clear his view that it is the damage to Isaiah&#8217;s brain and not his medication that is causing his breathing difficulties and his markedly reduced level of consciousness.   Professor Whitelaw reiterated these views during his oral evidence, and his evidence concurs with the written and oral evidence of the treating clinicians. With respect to the parents&#8217; contentions regarding the level of response and interaction Isaiah exhibits, Professor Whitelaw states that he carefully examined all videos and photographs sent by the mother and could not identify any alertness, purposeful response or communication.  The court has also had the benefit of seeing the videos provided by the parents. </p>

A reduction in Levetiracetam would, in Professor Whitelaw&#8217;s view, risk a life-threatening status epilepticus, potentially resulting in further damage to his already severely damaged brain.  Professor Whitelaw further dismisses the proposition that Levetiracetam is the cause of seizure activity, pointing out that appropriate attempts were made to wean Isaiah off Levetiracetam but that he got worse, exhibiting a break through seizure. With respect to Baclofen, Professor Whitelaw considers that Isaiah requires an increased dose. He further posits that ceasing Baclofen would make breathing even more difficult for Isaiah as his ongoing dystonia would make it harder for his breathing muscles to function. </p>

At the time of his birth he suffered severe hypoxic ischaemic brain damage, which has left him with profound neurological disability, such that he has significantly diminished consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale 56) and severely diminished respiratory drive, meaning that he will never become independent of assisted ventilation for life support.  He has suffered severe global, cortical, white mater and deep brain structure damage that is the cause of his sever spastic and dysfunctional muscle tone, leading to frequent dystonic spasms.  These are known to be very painful as evidence in other patients with cerebral palsy but have intact cognition/awareness.  The damage to the brainstem structures is permanent and is in the location for the neural control centres for swallowing, airway protective reflexes and respiratory drive, which in Isaiah&#8217;s case is seriously deranged, such that he does not have any airway protective reflexes such as gag or cough response and cannot coordinate swallowing and breathing without the risk of lifethreatening lung aspiration.&#8221; </p>

Indeed, Dr Habibi states that in 25 years of intensive care practice he has not seen patients unable to breathe because of normal/therapeutic levels of anticonvulsants and muscle relaxants and that, even in overdose, the drugs in question would not have this effect. </p>

In her statement, the mother goes as far as asserting that when Isaiah shows signs of responsiveness his medication is increased.  Neither parent is able to accept the consensus medical view that, in the doses being given, the drugs being used to treat Isaiah would not lower his levels of consciousness and that, even if they made him drowsy, drug induced drowsiness is qualitatively and quantitatively different to the depressed consciousness caused by his severe brain injury. </p>

In contrast to the medical evidence I have set out earlier in this judgment, the mother contends that Isaiah is more responsive than described by his treating team, which responses the parents believe evidence an ability to derive pleasure from his life.   In her statement the mother contends that Isaiah responds to her voice, opening his eyes when she says, &#8220;Isaiah it&#8217;s Mummy&#8221;, and to the voices of his father and siblings, will lift his eyebrows and will open his eyes if there is talking nearby.  Professor Whitelaw observed Isaiah half opening his eyes when the mother played music, although noted his eyes did not move.  The mother also contends that Isaiah will shift to his right side if laid down on his left side, will turn his head and make small changes of position such as drawing up his legs and will kick and stretch out when he does not like something.  The mother has kept a detailed diary, extracts of which are exhibited to her statement. In her oral evidence the mother outlined further matters that she contends indicate Isaiah is responsive, including that Isaiah&#8217;s heart rate increases in response to pain and that Isaiah cries.  The mother reports, as do the medical witnesses, that Isaiah appears to be more relaxed when being bathed and the parents told the Children&#8217;s Guardian that they believe Isaiah is comforted by having a bath and by having his foot tickled. In answer to a question put by the father, the mother said, &#8220;I can only see subtle things for now but that is what I go by&#8221; and that &#8220;I do respect the doctors&#8217; opinion, I am not saying they are completely wrong but I want them to take into account my views and what I have seen&#8221;. </p>

In addition to the matters recounted in the foregoing paragraph, the mother told the court that Isaiah responds positively when she cuddles him, that he has a favourite toy to which he responds by pushing out his legs, that he reacts to the touch of a soft ball on his feet, face and arms and responds to cartoons played on the mother&#8217;s phone.

Specifically, the Children&#8217;s Guardian observed no response when P played the toy on its loudest setting next to each ear and no reactions when saw him having his nappy changed and being suctioned.  The Children&#8217;s Guardian did however note that the mother was able to move Isaiah&#8217;s arms and legs with ease and without noticeable resistance when he was bathed. In his interactions with the parents, and his observations of their care of Isaiah, the Children&#8217;s Guardian was clear that the mother and father demonstrated themselves to be caring parents who have acquired a high sense of confidence in meeting Isaiah&#8217;s needs, concluding that &#8220;The level of diligence was heart-warming to observe&#8221;. </p>

I cannot of course do so with Isaiah and must rely on the evidence and my observations.  Isaiah was born into a loving and caring family.  Ms Thomas and Mr Haastrup are devoted to Isaiah and he has a special place in their family.  Mr Haastrup has stated to me, &#8220;It is the care you give Isaiah that gives him quality of life&#8230;I can come here for the next five years.  Coming here every day is not a burden.&#8221;  I have no doubt as to how loved and cherished Isaiah is by his parents, and that they would do an exceptional job maintaining his care in the community.  However, for Isaiah to remain in an irreversible condition with no prospect of any developmental change, as seen over the last ten months, I do not consider it in his best interests to prolong the current situation. </p>

For all the information available to me, I do not see how it can be in Isaiah&#8217;s best interests to have to endure the life that he currently leads absent any quality and plagued only with the burden of the procedures that keep him alive.  I have been left profoundly struck by a comment that Dr G made during my interview, &#8216;Isaiah is not suffering because he is not capable of suffering.&#8217;  Given Isaiah has suffered such a severe brain injury, tragically, he lives a life lacking any purposeful existence.&#8221; </p>

It is important, here as elsewhere, that due account of parental views wishes and preferences is taken and due regard given to the acute clinical situation in the context of the child&#8217;s overall situation. Although it is possible to distinguish these different groups of decisions to limit LSTs that are based on quality-of-life considerations, in practice combinations may be present. For example, a child or infant in intensive care may have sustained such significant brain injury that future life may provide little benefit, while both intensive treatment and future life are likely to cause the child substantial pain and distress.&#8221; </p>

There is no Part 25 application before the court seeking permission to file further expert evidence.  However, Mr Wise argues that the court requires further expert evidence (a) on what forms of sensory support Isaiah will benefit from, (b) on the &#8220;practicality&#8221; of Isaiah having a trachaeostomy as a necessary pre-cursor to care at home, (c) on Isaiah&#8217;s level of responsiveness, Mr Wise conceding that this would come from the same medical specialties that the court has heard evidence from at this hearing, and (d) on the feasibility of a &#8220;home care package&#8221;.  Mr Wise submitted that the reason that this evidence was needed was to ensure the issues before the court are &#8220;properly explored&#8221;.  I am not persuaded by this submission.

More fundamentally, for reasons I will come to, the evidence in this case makes plain that Isaiah will not benefit from sensory support.  With respect to the &#8220;practicality&#8221; of a trachaeostomy, in principle, the practicality of a trachaeostomy is not in dispute.  What is in dispute is the far more fundamental question of whether continued artificial ventilation is in Isaiah&#8217;s best interests and on that question the court has the necessary evidence.   With respect to Isaiah&#8217;s level of responsiveness, the court already has a plethora of evidence on which to reach its conclusion from Isaiah&#8217;s treating clinicians, the independent experts and, importantly, from the parents.  This evidence is quite sufficient for the court to come to a properly informed conclusion as to Isaiah&#8217;s level of responsiveness, if any, without the need for further experts in the same specialisms to be instructed.  As to the need for further evidence on the feasibility of a &#8220;home care package&#8221;, once again, in principle, that it is possible to make provision for the ventilation of Isiah at home is not in dispute (albeit it would require the unprecedented step of replicating Level 2 ICU care in the community).  Rather, once again, what is in issue is the fundamental issue of whether it is in Isaiah best interests to continue to receive such treatment at all.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Further, and within this context, although it would appear that Professor Doctor M has expertise in paediatrics and paediatric intensive care, the court already has independent expert evidence from a specialist paediatric intensivist, in addition to the paediatric intensivists responsible for Isaiah&#8217;s care.  With respect to Dr L, she is described as a paediatric haematologist and oncologist.  Isaiah does not have any form of blood disorder or cancer, but rather labours under the effects of a catastrophic neurological insult.  As such, it is plain that her of specialism does not assist in this case.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that it is not necessary for the court to have expert evidence from either Professor Doctor M or Dr L in order to resolve these proceedings justly.  With respect to allegations that Dr L misled fellow professionals at King&#8217;s College Hospital in order to gain access to Isaiah, that she carried out a medical examination of Isaiah in breach the applicable law in this jurisdiction and that she may have committed a criminal offence under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/54" uk:canonical="1983 c. 54" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Medical Act 1983</ref>, I make no further comment about those allegations in circumstances where that matter is with the Police.  However, as a matter of general principle, it goes without saying that to arrange for, and facilitate clandestine examinations of children who are the subject to proceedings is entirely inappropriate.  Any examination of a child who is subject to proceedings with a view to securing further expert evidence should take place only in accordance with the law and procedural rules governing such examinations. </p>

In making his submissions in support of another adjournment, Mr Wise argued that it was necessary for the court in this case to have additional expert evidence from foreign experts.   Specifically, Mr Wise contended that, given both the gravity of the issues in this case and its potential outcome, and where, as Mr Wise put it, there may be different &#8220;cultural&#8221; approaches to these issues in other countries, this court would be greatly assisted by evidence of the approach taken to these difficult issues in other jurisdictions.

The Guidelines for the Instruction of Medical Experts from Overseas in Family Cases 2011 acknowledge that evidence from the former may, depending on the facts of the case, be of assistance to the court.  By contrast, an attempt to adduce evidence from the latter in a case of this nature is to be deprecated.   Professor Doctor M spends a portion of his report dealing with the impact of Germany&#8217;s history on the manner that these cases are said by him to be approached in that jurisdiction.  It would be extremely unfortunate if the standard response to applications of this nature was to become one of scouring the world for medical experts who simply take the view that the medical, moral or ethical approach to these issues in their jurisdiction, or in their own practice is preferable to the medical, moral or ethical approach in this jurisdiction.  This is particularly so where parents in the situation these parents find themselves in are understandably desperate to grasp any apparent life raft in the storm that is engulfing them.   </p>

Whilst he is noted to demonstrate some respiratory effort, this is intermittent and is not adequate to sustain his life with ventilator support.  Regular attempts have been made to wean Isaiah off ventilator support but on all occasions, this has been unsuccessful.   He is unable to maintain adequate gas exchange and normal vital signs in absence of pressure assisted breaths.  Isaiah&#8217;s catastrophic brain injury has also resulted in him having none of the reflexes that ordinarily protect the airway by way of a gag or a cough.  In consequence, Isaiah requires, and will continue to require, regular suction for pooled secretions in his oropharynx. He is, and will always be, unable to feed himself and will require nutrition by way of a feeding tube. </p>

It has become very difficult to straighten his legs or to flex his arms at the elbows despite use of medication.  Isaiah is currently classified at level V of the Gross Motor Function Classification System, which is a five-level system.   Children at Level V are severely limited in gross motor function.  Isaiah continues to demonstrate very little spontaneous movement.  He has a predisposition toward seizures and potentially fatal status epilepticus.  </p>

The parents believe firmly that Isaiah responds to them and demonstrates and emotional connection to them in the manner I have described.  It is important to note that there have been, at least in the initial phases of Isaiah&#8217;s treatment, some areas of agreement between the evidence of the parents with respect to Isaiah&#8217;s reactions, in particular in relation to his response to sound earlier in the course of his treatment and, more uniformly during the course of his treatment, to being bathed.   </p>

That this the position is in my judgment further demonstrated in the videos that the parents have provided to the court and which I have considered carefully.  In those videos can be seen the effect generated by the coincidence of what are the repeated, purposeless movements described in the medical evidence and the parents&#8217; loving verbal interaction with Isaiah.  In those videos it is, unhappily, easy to see how the optimism of parents, whose desperate wish is for Isaiah to survive and improve, leads them to believe that Isaiah is responding to what they are saying when, in fact, what is seen is a simple conjunction between the voices the parents and the purposeless movements consequent on Isaiah&#8217;s catastrophic brain injury.    </p>

However, it is in my judgment important to note that the medical consensus is that, if Isaiah is aware, he has an extremely low level of conscious awareness and that, within this context, there is an absence of objective evidence that he feels pain or pleasure and real difficulty in interpreting Isaiah&#8217;s limited movements, stiffening and apparent relaxation as a conscious response, given his extremely low level of consciousness and the level in the nervous system from which such movements originate.   </p>

However, the nature and extent of his brain injury, as demonstrated by his physiological presentation and corroborated anatomically by the MRI scans, is at the extreme upper end of the spectrum of severity.  Further, for the reasons I have set out, over an extended period of time there has been no objective evidence of conscious awareness in the form of meaningful responses by Isaiah or definitive evidence that he experiences pain or pleasure.  In the circumstances, and within the foregoing context, on the totality of the evidence before the court I am satisfied that Isaiah has a profoundly depressed level of consciousness and, if he is aware, he is more likely than not only to be minimally so.    </p>

The parents have produced no cogent evidence to make good their case that Isaiah&#8217;s current presentation is being driven by his medication rather than his catastrophic global brain injury.  By contrast, there is a complete unanimity amongst the treating clinician&#8217;s and the independent experts that Isaiah&#8217;s medication is not the cause of his inability to breath on his own, or of his profoundly low levels of consciousness, supported by a clear correlation between the physiological and anatomical evidence in this case.

Isaiah would require a permanent feeding tube to be surgically fitted and possibly more extensive surgery to prevent reflux common in children who are chronically tube fed.

The court must ask itself what Isaiah&#8217;s attitude to treatment is or would be likely to be.  This is not an easy task in relation to a child who has had, within the context of his age and his profound brain injury, no opportunity to form, or to express any point of view in respect his treatment or its impact on his quality of life.    In seeking to ask myself what Isaiah&#8217;s attitude to treatment would be, I have born in mind that a person may wish to continue to receive treatment notwithstanding the presence of profound disability.  I have also born in mind that a child&#8217;s attitude is often influenced by the views, beliefs and guidance of his or her parents.  However, Isaiah&#8217;s likely attitude to treatment must also be evaluated against the fact that the prospect facing him is one of continued life sustaining treatment that will do not more than sustain him in, at best, a state of profoundly depressed consciousness in which, if he is aware, he is more likely than not only to be minimally so, with no prospect of improvement or recovery and the prospect of repeated chest infections, deformity scoliosis and hip dislocation.  Within this context, in discharging the difficult task of asking myself what Isaiah&#8217;s attitude to continued life sustaining treatment would be likely to be, I am satisfied that Isaiah&#8217;s point of view would be that treatment that is capable of achieving only that which I have outlined would be very unlikely to be acceptable to him, particularly if he is feeling pain. </p>

Indeed, having heard her give evidence, I am in no doubt that the mother is correct in her self-assessment that, subject to training, she could provide Isaiah with dedicated care and, were it to be in Isaiah&#8217;s best interests to be cared for at home, that with highly specialist support the mother is more than up to that task.  Were Isaiah to remain on life support in hospital, it is clear that he would remain visited and loved by his mother, two brothers and extended family.  Within this context, I remind myself once again of the assessment of the Children&#8217;s Guardian that: </p>

Mr Haastrup stated to me &#8216;It is the care you give Isaiah that gives him the quality of life&#8230;I can come here for the next five years.  Coming here every day is not a burden.&#8217;  I have no doubt as to how loved and cherished Isaiah is by his parents and that they would do an exceptional job in maintaining his care in the community.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Finally, I have paid very careful regard to the views of Isaiah&#8217;s mother and father.   Their firm and unwavering belief that it is in Isaiah&#8217;s best interests for life sustaining treatment to be continued shone through in their respective cases before the court.  Neither could have done more to seek to persuade the court of their case in this regard.  I have also considered carefully the mother&#8217;s evidence regarding her strong religious beliefs with respect to the proper arbiter of decisions regarding life and death.   The mother believes firmly that in Isaiah&#8217;s life the world hears the still small voice of God, and that only God may decide whether Isaiah lives or dies.  Her beliefs, shared by the father, should be, and are accorded respect by the court. </p>

Very sadly however, there are in this case profoundly weighty factors on the other side of the balance sheet. </p>

That it is not recognises that life cannot be, and indeed should not be preserved at all costs in the face of its natural conclusion.  Isaiah&#8217;s life is sustained mechanically and without mechanical ventilation he will die.  The burden on Isaiah of that irreversible position is a grave one.   If kept alive he will continue to suffer from profound cognitive impairment, extremely severe global motor disability with spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy.  That situation will not change.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Within this context, Isaiah is not now, nor will he ever be able to engage in any meaningful interaction with the world around him.  He will not be able to see or move independently and will have, at best, markedly reduced hearing with no objective evidence that he is able to make sense of anything he might hear.  There is no wider objective evidence of his being aware of the environment or events surrounding him and no objective evidence that he is able to respond to external stimuli so as to take comfort or enjoyment from the world around him.  This means he is, and will remain unable to derive pleasure from interaction with his parents and family and that he lacks the capacity to develop an emotional attachment to them.  Tragically, Isaiah&#8217;s profound and irreversible brain injury means that now, and in the future, he will not be able to enjoy any the fundamental benefits that life brings, including but not limited to the experiences of love, human connection to family and friends, development of a sense of identity and belonging and learning about and exploring the world.   By contrast, to continue to be subject to life sustaining treatment will confine Isaiah to being kept alive for his entire life in an ICU, his life is sustained by machines in a world he cannot meaningfully perceive or connect with.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In addition to these matters, the maintenance of permanent, invasive life sustaining treatment will expose Isaiah to both the possibility of fatal infections and to the consequences of the evolution of his dystonia and muscle spasticity.  With respect to the former, to continue life sustaining treatment would, on the evidence before the court, result in Isaiah being at high risk of infection as the result of mechanical ventilation due to increased risk of aspirating food, drink, oral secretions, foreign bodies and gastric contents. With respect to the latter, as he grows, he will therefore be at risk of deformations and permanent contractures, which may develop to hip dislocation, and scoliosis as a result of his dystonia and muscle spasticity.  He will continue to suffer bladder and bowel incontinence and will continue to be tube fed.  He will never feed orally.  Once again, if Isaiah feels pain, to continue life sustaining treatment for Isaiah will be to continue to expose him to that pain. </p>

Within this context, a comparison must be drawn between the course advocated by Isaiah&#8217;s treating doctors, of being allowed to die peacefully with appropriate palliation if, as is inevitable, that is the natural course that Isaiah condition follows, and the course advocated by Isaiah&#8217;s parents, of a continuation of invasive treatment that will lead only to life being sustained without hope of recovery, with little or no quality of life and with the prospect of infection and increasing physical contortion.   </p>

Examples include children in Persistent Vegetative State (PVS), Minimally Conscious State, or those with such severe cognitive impairment that they lack demonstrable or recorded awareness of themselves or their surroundings and have no meaningful interaction with them, as determined by rigorous and prolonged observations. Even in the absence of demonstrable pain or suffering, continuation of LST may not be in their best interests because it cannot provide overall benefit to them.&#8221; </p>

It should certainly not be disregarded or lightly set aside. But the role of the court is to exercise an independent and objective judgment.  If that judgment is in accord with that of the devoted and responsible parent, well and good.  If it is not, then it is the duty of the court, after giving due weight to the view of the devoted and responsible parent, to give effect to its own judgment. That is what it is there for.  Its judgment may of course be wrong. So may that of the parent. But once the jurisdiction of the court is invoked its clear duty is to reach and express the best judgment it can." </p>
