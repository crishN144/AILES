	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The appellant, hereafter referred to as Ms Jay, was born a male, has been married three times and has seven children. For many years, however, Ms Jay has been uncomfortable in the male gender and for the last few years has lived as a woman. She has made a series of applications for formal recognition of her change of gender under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/7" uk:canonical="2004 c. 7" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Gender Recognition Act 2004</ref> (&#8220;GRA&#8221;). All of the applications have been refused by the Gender Recognition Panel. She has now filed a notice of appeal against the third refusal. This reserved judgment sets out my decision on the appeal.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Jay has had a number of problems in her life, and has been convicted of a number of criminal offences as a result of which she has spent several years in prison. This judgment does not deal with any of those matters. In addition, the court is of course aware of the wider public debate about gender recognition. That debate is not directly relevant to this appeal which focuses specifically on the panel&#8217;s decision in this case. </p>

The claim in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Goodwin</span> was brought by a transsexual who had been permitted under domestic law to change her name but was unable to change a number of official government records which listed her as male, and as a result she continued to be treated as male for purposes of social security, national insurance, pensions and retirement age. Her claim that this failure to amend her official records constituted a violation of her rights under articles 8 and 12 of ECHR was upheld unanimously by the European Court. At paragraph 77 to 78 of the judgment, the Court stated:</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.21in">&#8230; serious interference with private life can arise when the state of domestic law conflicts with an important aspect of personal identity. The stress and alienation arising from a discordance between the position in society assumed by a post-operative transsexual and the status imposed by law which refuses to recognise the change of gender cannot, in the Court&#8217;s view, be regarded as a minor inconvenience arising from a formality. A conflict between social reality and law arises which places the transsexual in an anomalous position, in which he or she may experience feelings of vulnerability, humiliation and anxiety.</p>

		  <num>78.</num>
		  <content>
		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.21in">In this case, as in many others, the applicant&#8217;s gender re-assignment was carried out by the National Health Service, which recognises the condition of gender dysphoria and provides, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>, re-assignment by surgery, with a view to achieving as one of its principal purposes as close an assimilation as possible to the gender in which the transsexual perceives that he or she properly belongs. The Court is struck by the fact that nonetheless the gender re-assignment which is lawfully provided is not met with full recognition in law, which might be regarded as the final and culminating step in the long and difficult process of transformation which the transsexual has undergone. The coherence of the administrative and legal practices within the domestic system must be regarded as an important factor in the assessment carried out under article 8 of the Convention. Where a State has authorised the treatment and surgery alleviating the condition of a transsexual, financed or assisted in financing the operations and indeed permits the artificial insemination of a woman living with a female to male transsexual, it appears illogical to refuse to recognise the legal implications of the result to which the treatment leads.&#8221;</p>

In the case of s.2(a) [sic &#8211; presumably s.2(1)(a)], the panel must therefore examine the medical evidence provided in order to determine whether it is satisfied that the applicant has or has had the diagnosis of gender dysphoria. In order to do so, the panel requires more than a simple statement that such a diagnosis was made. The medical practitioner practising in the field who supplies the report should include details of the process followed and evidence considered over a period of time to make the diagnosis in the applicant&#8217;s case. Nor is it sufficient to use the broad phrase &#8216;gender reassignment surgery&#8217; without indicating what surgery has been carried out. Nor should relevant treatments be omitted, such as hormone therapy. These requirements are particularly pertinent in assisting the panel to be satisfied not only that the applicant has or has had gender dysphoria but also has lived in the acquired gender for at least two years and intends to live in that gender until death.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In passing, I observe that these provisions need some clarification in the light of recent changes. This appeal is, so far as I am aware, the first to be brought under s.8 of the GRA since the changes in appeal procedure introduced in October 2016, under which most private family law appeals from circuit judges are heard in the Family Division of the High Court rather than by the Court of Appeal. As part of those changes, there is now a Family Division Appeals Office (FDAO) and a judge in charge of appeals. At the same time, for various reasons, the PRFD is now a much-diminished entity. It retains only a handful of responsibilities and its judicial and administrative resources have been severely reduced. Nearly all of the family cases which were previously dealt with in the PRFD are now heard in the Central Family Court (albeit in the same building, First Avenue House in High Holborn). In this case, the appeal notice was filed at the PRFD but immediately referred to the FDAO and managed by the staff in that office and by myself as judge in charge of appeals. In future, it seems sensible for all appeals to be managed in this way. As pointed out in para 5.27 of PD30A, FPR rule 5.4(1) provides that, where both the family court and the High Court have jurisdiction to deal with the matter, the proceedings relating to that matter must be started in the family court. Rule 5.4(2)(c) adds, however, that this does not apply where the court otherwise directs. I therefore propose that all such appeals should be referred to the Family Division judge in charge of appeals as soon as possible after they are filed.</p>

She harmed herself on a number of occasions and, in January 2013, she had attempted to hang herself. In March 2014, she was placed on suicide watch. In June 2014, she filed a claim in the Central London County Court against the company that runs the prison and the Ministry of Justice seeking damages for negligence and/or breaches of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref> and/or the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Equality Act 2010</ref> following two sexual assaults in prison. In the same month, against a background of other incidents of self-harm, she made an incision into one of her testicles with the intention of removing it. A psychologist&#8217;s report in September 2014 reported that the main trigger to her risk-taking was her perceived lack of progress in relation to her gender reassignment process, together with feelings of helplessness and being out of control as well as confusion over her identity. The psychologist reported that Ms Jay&#8217;s emotionally unstable personality traits had contributed to a breakdown in relationships as well as emotional and behavioural impulsivity. Ms Jay found it hard to manage stress and relied on maladaptive coping mechanisms such as self-harming.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 22 May 2014, Ms Jay filed her first application to the Gender Recognition Panel, using the prescribed form. In the application, she identified 12 November 2008 as being the date from which she could provide evidence that she had lived full time in her acquired gender. She enclosed the statutory declaration executed in 2012, a copy of her second decree absolute, and a number of other documents. She did not, however, enclose any medical reports as required under s.3(1). In an accompanying letter, she explained that she had not been able to get anyone to help her, that the prison doctors had told her they were not qualified to prepare the reports and that she had been refused permission to go outside to a gender clinic.  On 20 June 2014, a member of the panel&#8217;s administrative team acknowledged receipt of the application, stating that &#8220;you may wish to provide the further evidence listed below before we submit your application to the panel&#8221;. The further evidence identified included the two medical reports required under s.3(1) and other suggested documentary evidence dated within two years of the application. In addition, it was pointed out that the statutory declaration submitted by Ms Jay was incomplete in several respects. In response, Ms Jay sent a further letter to the panel, received 7 August 2014, in which she asserted that she was enclosing a report from Dr James Barrett from the London Gender Clinic. </p>

The July 2014 report was prepared at the request of solicitors acting for Ms Jay in her claim for damages following assaults in prison. Dr Barrett was asked to consider and discuss the nature of Ms Jay&#8217;s psychiatric problems, the nature and extent of the problems prior to the assaults, and the extent to which her current problems were the result of pre-existing vulnerabilities or of those assaults. He was also asked the extent to which her transgender status added to any injury caused by the assaults.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the report, Dr Barrett stated that amongst his various appointments he was lead clinician at the West London Mental Health NHS Trust Gender Identity Clinic, and reported that during his career he had seen at least 5000 people with disorders of gender identity. He noted that Ms Jay had a history of extensive contacts with psychiatric services from her late teens, characterised by deliberate self-harm, and by her attracting a very wide range of diagnoses, usually including one or more of the disorders of personality and some form of mood disorder and very rarely a diagnosis of any form of psychosis. Dr Barrett set out at some length Ms Jay&#8217;s personal and relationship history and her gender development. He noted from her medical records that there seems to have been no mention of any gender identity disturbance in her psychiatric history until very recently. In the prison medical records, there was a note that she had referred to having been in contact with the clinic run by Dr Barrett, and other clinics in Birmingham and Nottingham. He noted that his clinic had never had any contact with her so far as he knew and cast doubt upon her other assertions as to contacts with other clinics. Having considered her personality problems, Dr Barrett went on to say:</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;Separately, and recently, she reports gender identity problems. Her history, if taken at face value, is reasonably consistent with this diagnosis but the difficulty is that other aspects of that history are rather directly at odds with the documentary records leading me to have doubts about the veracity of her whole history &#8211; which would include a reasonably consistent history of gender identity problems. This aspect might be made clearer if a source other than [Ms Jay] could be interviewed &#8230;. If collateral collaboration is elicited I would reach an additional diagnosis of some sort of gender identity disorder. Whether the intensity of gender dysphoria caused by that disorder is great enough to merit or require a change of gender role might be explored in the setting of a gender identity clinic; it might be sufficiently intense in a prison but not so outside one and in civilian life, for example. If collateral corroboration is not convincingly elicited I would have grave doubts and wonder whether [Ms Jay]&#8217;s somewhat dependent personality had caused her to unwisely latch onto a change of gender role as a seemingly universal solution to both why her life had gone wrong and how it might be rectified.&#8221; </p>

On the following day, she signed a further statutory declaration under the GRA asserting that she had lived full time as a female for six years since she transitioned in December 2008. The declaration was witnessed by a solicitor. Section 5a of the declaration form, which reads &#8220;I have not previously been in a marriage or civil partnership&#8221; was not deleted. In section 5b, Ms Jay wrote &#8220;I hereby declare that my former marriage was dissolved on 18.11.2009&#8221;. In the course of 2015, a number of utility bills and other official documents were issued to Ms Jay in her female name, including a passport and driving licence. On 11 June 2015, her GP wrote a letter headed &#8220;To Whom It May Concern&#8221; stating that Ms Jay was a new patient at the surgery, that the full medical records had not yet been received, but adding:</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;In my opinion, [Ms Jay] fulfils the criteria for gender dysphoria, i.e. a person has an overpowering wish to live as a member of the gender group opposite to their anatomical sex and seeks to alter their bodily appearance and genitalia. Gender dysphoria is the distress associated with the experience of one&#8217;s personal gender identity being inconsistent with the phenotype or the gender role typically associated with that phenotype. Those with gender dysphoria have a strong conviction of belonging to the sex opposite to that which they were assigned, usually starting before puberty. I note that in [Ms Jay]&#8217;s case, she gave an account of having these beliefs and convictions since an early age but struggled to express this due to a fear of shame and ridicule by others. It appears [Ms Jay] was greatly distressed by her predicament and on various occasions [sic] and this resulted in displayed episodes of low mood and also self-harm attempts. I note that [Ms Jay] has expressed openly her desire to become female, following the death of her father in January 2012. [Ms Jay] has also changed her name and passport and has also sought help in terms of becoming female from a gender dysphoria clinic in Nottingham and subsequently on a private basis from a specialists [sic] with expertise in gender dysphoria.</p>

She has poor ability to cope with feelings of frustration and this led to considerable distress leading to utilising maladaptive coping strategies such as self-harm and suicidal attempts. [Ms Jay]&#8217;s gender dysphoria has complicated her presentation. She continues to be considerably distressed as a result of her gender dysphoria and feels very uncomfortable being male. [Ms Jay] is extremely conflicted in her mind as a result of gender dysphoria and this has complicated her presentation including escalating her risks. [Ms Jay] is also distressed there has been lack of progress in terms of treatment of gender dysphoria.

This letter was notably more detailed than the report sent to the panel. It summarised Ms Jay&#8217;s background, education, employment history, relationships, social support, and medical psychiatric and counselling history. It set out in some detail her gender history, noting that she has a long history of cross-gender ideation, giving examples of her behaviour as a child and young person, noting the steps she has taken towards a physical gender change since her mid-teens, and observing that, &#8220;practically speaking, M has transitioned to the female social gender role full-time&#8221;. In her letter to the GP, Dr Pasterski recorded this impression:</p>

The panel noted that two previous applications have been refused and also referred to the report from Dr Barrett who had, it was said, declined to give a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. The panel also noted that the documents produced by Ms Jay related primarily to 2014 and 2015 and said it would be helpful to see more recent documents such as utility bills. The panel observed from Dr Pasterski&#8217;s report that Ms Jay had changed GP. She was therefore asked to clarify the reason for the change, and to provide an updated report from her current GP as to treatment, given that the report from her previous GP was made over a year previously.</p>

The doctor needed to know those circumstances to decide whether the findings of her report &#8230; were sound and she stood by them.

It appears that the panel made a decision by reference to whether or not Ms Jay had complied with earlier directions, rather than by a proper consideration and application of the statutory criteria. Moreover, and in any event, by the time of the panel&#8217;s refusal decision on 8 August 2017, Ms Jay had materially complied with the panel&#8217;s directions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second ground of appeal is that, in reaching its decision, the panel had regard to irrelevant and/or incorrect factors. Ms McCann identified three particular such factors. First, the panel relied on its conclusion that Dr Pasterski was &#8220;not aware of significant features&#8221; about Ms Jay&#8217;s circumstances and recent background, leading it to doubt the reliability of the medical evidence. The features identified by the panel as being matters of which the doctor was unaware were, in particular, the fact that Ms Jay had been in prison and the periods of her employment. In fact, Dr Pasterski was aware of both of those matters. Secondly, the panel relied on its conclusion that Dr Barrett had declined to give a diagnosis of gender dysphoria in an earlier report provided to the panel in relation to the first application. It is contended on behalf of the appellant that the panel ought not to have relied on this report, given that it dated back to July 2014, over three years prior to the decision in August 2017, and furthermore that Dr Barrett had not been instructed for the purposes of an application for a gender recognition certificate, nor indeed to consider a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, but rather in respect of a potential claim for damages. Thirdly, the panel had wrongly asserted in giving its reasons for refusing the application that since its directions of 17 November 2016, the only written communication from Ms Jay had been a letter dated 6 April 2017.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The third ground of appeal is that the process which Ms Jay has been required to adhere to by the panel from the date of her first application in May 2014 to its final decision on 8 August 2017 has violated Ms Jay&#8217;s right to respect for private life under article 8 of ECHR and/or has interfered with such right in a discriminatory manner by reference to her status as a prisoner, contrary to article 14.</p>

He suggested that, given the concession on behalf of the appellant that there had been material rather than full compliance with the panel&#8217;s directions, this court might be nervous about granting a certificate itself without allowing the panel, or another panel, to reconsider the application. At that point, therefore, it seemed that the Secretary of State&#8217;s role at the hearing would be limited. In the event, however, Mr McGurk did make some submissions as to the merits as the hearing proceeded and in addition, at my request, addressed at some length in further written submissions a supplemental point which arose in the course of the hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms McCann submitted that the evidential requirements in s.3 are ancillary to the statutory criteria in s.2. The evidence required must be probative of, and assist with the determination of, the application for a gender recognition certificate under s.2(1). In other words, the evidence must help with the questions of whether the applicant (a) has gender dysphoria, (b) has lived in the acquired gender throughout the period two years ending with the date of the application, (c) intends to continue to live in the acquired gender until death, and (d) otherwise complies with the evidential requirements under s.3. Any directions made by the panel in relation to such evidential requirements must not be elevated to a status which tends either to (a) sideline or undermine the statutory criteria for determining whether the applicant is entitled to a certificate, and/or (b) frustrate the process by which the applicant seeks to secure legal recognition for their &#8220;acquired&#8221; gender. Ms McCann acknowledged that s.3(6)(c), which obliges the applicant to include &#8220;any other information or evidence which the panel which is to determine the application may require&#8221;, is drafted in broad terms, but she submitted that, given that the purpose of the GRA was to address the finding of the European Court in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Goodwin,</span> it should be interpreted restrictively as meaning information which the panel requires to facilitate the application. She added that the terms of the President&#8217;s Guidance No.1 are consistent with such an interpretation. </p>

In its refusal decision of 8 August 2017, the panel asserted (without giving full explanation) that the statutory criteria for granting a certificate had not been met, and then stated that Ms Jay had been advised that her application &#8220;would be refused&#8221; if the earlier directions were not complied with. In addition, the panel wrongly asserted that Ms Jay had only sent one further written communication after the directions of 17 November.</p>

In directions 2 and 3, the panel had asked for the dates of her detention in prison, her employment history and her present residential address. Ms Jay had supplied that information in her undated letter sent in response to the directions issued on 16 February 2017. In direction 4, the panel had wanted to be satisfied that Dr Pasterski had been made aware of Ms Jay&#8217;s detention in prison. Ms Jay had subsequently confirmed in writing that the doctor had been given those details. Ms Jay had also provided copies of up-to-date utility bills and a brief report from Dr Thornhill giving details of her treatment, as required by directions 5 and 6. The only direction which Ms Jay had not complied with was direction 1, which required her to provide a letter from Dr Pasterski indicating what documents she saw for the purposes of her assessment. In her response to the directions, Ms Jay had stated that she was unable to afford another letter from the doctor, who was in any event in the United States until January 2017. In its directions dated 16 February 2017, the panel had stated that it was presumed that Dr Pasterski had now returned and could be contacted by Ms Jay. The panel did not address the question as to cost, nor did it consider whether the substantial compliance by Ms Jay with the other directions obviated the need for a further letter from Dr Pasterski.</p>

Its overemphasis on the issue of compliance with directions frustrated the statutory process by which the applicant was entitled to secure legal recognition of her acquired gender. In particular, the panel had evidence from four medical practitioners supporting the diagnosis of gender dysphoria &#8211; Dr Pasterski, Dr King, Dr Thornhill and Prof Nimmagadda &#8211; but failed to explain why they concluded that evidence was insufficient to satisfy the statutory criteria. </p>

By way of example, she draws attention to the deed poll executed in December 2013, a legal aid certificate granted in May 2014, correspondence from HMRC dated the same month, prisoner account statements, court documents, correspondence from the probation service, utility bills, her passport, driving licence, her cheque-book, and other miscellaneous correspondence. With regard to the third criterion in s.2(1)(c), the panel was provided with the statutory declaration executed in September 2016 which complied fully with its requirements. In addition, the panel was aware of Ms Jay&#8217;s treatment and therapy history and also her attempts at surgery, summarising Dr King&#8217;s report, which were plainly consistent with an irreversible wish to eradicate the features of her old gender. Ms McCann submitted that the panel failed to stand back to consider whether in all the circumstances the statutory criteria under s.2(1) were satisfied.</p>

Ms McCann submits that the panel failed to set out in its decision or its reasons what precisely it considered those &#8220;significant features&#8221; to be, nor how they might be relevant to whether or not the report was reliable. Ms McCann inferred from earlier directions that the material issue for the panel about the report was whether or not Dr Pasterski was aware of Ms Jay&#8217;s detention in prison, and her current and past employment history. But the panel failed to record that Ms Jay had subsequently confirmed that she had told Dr Pasterski about the period she had been in prison, as set out in her handwritten responses to the directions. Furthermore, although there is no reference to Ms Jay&#8217;s employment history in Dr Pasterski&#8217;s report addressed to the panel, it is considered in her letter addressed to M&#8217;s GP Dr Thornhill dated the same day which was also supplied to the panel. </p>

First, his report was prepared in July 2014 in connection with an earlier application and, by the time of the panel&#8217;s decision on the third application, it was plainly stale. Secondly, his report was not obtained for the purpose of a diagnosis of gender dysphoria but, rather, for the potential claim for psychiatric injury following assaults in prison. Thirdly, Ms McCann submits that Dr Barrett did not in fact decline to make a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. He was not requested to make such a diagnosis. Furthermore, a close analysis of his report (as illustrated by the passage quoted above) shows that, in fact, he made a conditional diagnosis of gender dysphoria, contingent on &#8220;collateral corroboration&#8221;. Ms McCann submitted that the doubts identified by Dr Barrett in his report three years prior to the August 2017 refusal decision had been dispelled by the subsequent evidence of other clinicians who reached a clear diagnosis of gender dysphoria, as result of which Ms Jay has received extensive clinical treatment.</p>

It covers the physical and psychological integrity of a person. It can sometimes embrace aspects of an individual&#8217;s physical and social identity. Elements such as, for example, gender identification, name and sexual orientation and sexual life fall within the personal sphere protected by article 8. Article 8 also protects the right to personal development and the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world. Likewise, the Court has held that though no previous case has established as such any right to self-determination as being contained in article 8, the notion of personal autonomy is an important principle underlying the interpretation of its guarantees. Moreover, the very essence of the Convention being respect for human dignity and human freedom, protection is given to the right of transsexuals to personal development and to physical and moral security.</p>

Applied to the myriad instances recognised in the article 8 jurisprudence, this presumption means that, subject to the qualifications I shall shortly describe, an individual&#8217;s personal autonomy makes him &#8211; should make him &#8211; master of all those facts about his own identity, such as his name, health, sexuality, ethnicity, his own image, of which the cases speak; and also of the &#8216;zone of interaction&#8217; (the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Von Hannover</span> case 40 EHRR 1, para 50) between himself and others.

We therefore need to preserve it even in little cases. At the same time it is important that this core right protected by article 8, however protean, should not be read so widely that its claims become unreal and unreasonable. For this purpose I think there are three safeguards, or qualifications. First, the alleged threat or assault to the individual&#8217;s personal autonomy must (if article 8 is to be engaged) attain &#8216;a certain level of seriousness&#8217;. Secondly, the touchstone for article 8(1)&#8217;s engagement is whether the claimant enjoys on the facts a &#8216;reasonable expectation of privacy&#8217; (in any of the senses of privacy accepted in the cases). Absent such an expectation, there is no relevant interference with personal autonomy. Thirdly, the breadth of article 8(1) may in many instances be greatly curtailed by the scope of the justifications available to the state pursuant to article 8(2)&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

Ms McCann submitted that the documents filed by Ms Jay in the course of her three applications demonstrate that she was finding it extremely difficult to comply with the directions, in large part because she was detained in prison. Furthermore, the panel&#8217;s emphasis on the need for compliance with its directions meant that the process by which Ms Jay sought legal recognition for her acquired gender has been frustrated. The administrative and judicial regime for conferring legal recognition was made especially difficult for her, as a result of her detention in prison. It follows that she was discriminated against, on the grounds of her status as a prisoner, in her enjoyment of her article 8 rights.

Secondly, it is submitted that the measures taken by the panel, and in particular, excessive emphasis on the panel&#8217;s directions, and the overreliance on Dr Barratt&#8217;s &#8220;stale&#8221; medical report, were manifestly more than necessary to accomplish its legitimate objective. As set out above, it is Ms McCann&#8217;s central submission that the statutory regime is permissive, rather than restrictive. In this context, Ms McCann submitted that, before dismissing Ms Jay&#8217;s third application in circumstances where it apparently had concerns about her credibility, the panel ought to have considered whether holding a hearing under Schedule 1 paragraph 6 of the GRA was necessary in order to determine the application.  Thirdly, it is argued on behalf of Ms Jay that the process adopted by the panel and its refusal decision did not strike a fair balance between her rights under article 8 to recognition in law of her acquired gender and the interests of the community. Given that she was in detention for much of the period during which her application was under consideration, and as a result, as she made clear to the panel on a number of occasions, had difficulty in complying with the requirements imposed under s.3 and in particular the additional requirements imposed by the panel under s.3(6)(c), it is contended that the panel should have recognised that its obligations under article 14 to consider whether unlike  cases need to be treated differently should have led to a more flexible approach and its adherence to an inflexible approach had the effect that Ms Jay&#8217;s ability to enjoy her right to respect private life was curtailed in a discriminatory way because of her status as a prisoner.</p>

By way of general submissions, he emphasised that all four of the criteria under s.2(1) have to be satisfied before a certificate can be issued; that the purpose of s.3(6)(c) is to enable the panel to obtain further information to assist in deciding whether the criteria in s.2(1)(a) to (c) are satisfied; that it is for the panel to decide what information it requires; and that the panel is a specialist body including a registered medical practitioner and thus fully equipped to evaluate the evidence requirements. On the specific facts of this case, he informed the court that the Secretary of State does not accept that the reports of Dr King and Dr Thornhill provided any effective support to Dr Pasterski; that the panel was fully entitled to require to see the full report of Prof Nimmagadda before considering his diagnosis of gender dysphoria; and that the panel was entitled to conclude that Dr Pasterski did not address the concerns raised by Dr Barratt. He further contended that the panel was entitled to take into account its concerns about the evidence supplied by Ms Jay, including that documents had been altered and that she had failed to identify the information supplied to Dr Pasterski.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the course of Mr McGurk&#8217;s submissions, a further issue arose relating to the subsequent report prepared by Dr Cosmulescu of the Porterbrook Clinic. This issue was distilled into the following question: is the power vested in this court by s.8(3)(a) of the GRA sufficient to enable it to allow an appeal and issue a certificate in circumstances where the court concludes (a) either there has been an error of law in that the panel required additional evidence unnecessarily under s.3(6)(c) and/or the panel was wrong in concluding that the appellant had not supplied that information; and (b) it is not possible for the court to say, on the basis of the evidence before the panel, that the s.2(1)(a) to (c) criteria were satisfied; but (c) the court is satisfied that subsequent evidence established that those criteria are satisfied? To address this question, counsel were directed to file supplemental written submissions which were in due course provided by Mr McGurk on 11 July and by Ms McCann on 23 July, although not in fact received by this court until 2 August.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his submissions, Mr McGurk asserted that the third part of the question raised an important point of principle not previously determined, namely whether the appellate court, when allowing an appeal from a panel, can take into account evidence, in particular medical evidence, that was only acquired after the panel reached its decision, in order to determine whether the criteria under s.2(1) are satisfied and that a certificate should be issued under s.8(3)(a). The right of an applicant for a certificate to appeal a panel&#8217;s decision refusing the application is conferred under s.8. This is a statutory right of appeal so that the scope of the jurisdiction conferred on the appellate court is determined exclusively by the statute conferring the right. An appeal can only be made on a point of law (including a finding of fact that was so erroneous that no reasonable panel could have reached that decision) but does not otherwise confer a right on an applicant to challenge findings of fact made by the panel. It would only be if the right of appeal conferred was a full merits appeal that the applicant could ask the court to consider the matter afresh and on all the facts. For this court to exercise a full <span style="font-style:italic">de novo</span> merits-based jurisdiction on all the facts would be unilaterally to broaden the scope of the appeal jurisdiction beyond that which Parliament intended.</p>

If the error of law made by the panel is one where it cannot be said that, but for that error, a certificate would inevitably have been issued, Mr McGurk submits that this court must, when allowing the appeal, refer the matter back to the same or another panel for reconsideration as provided for by s.8(3)(b). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr McGurk submits that the circumstances in which new evidence can be adduced at the appellate stage, either under the Civil Procedure Rules or the Family Procedure Rules, are limited to those established in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Ladd v Marshall</span> [1954] I WLR 1489, namely where (i) such evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at trial; (ii) the evidence in question would probably have had an important influence on the outcome of the case, and (iii) the evidence is apparently credible. Mr McGurk submits that the difficulty facing Ms Jay is her ability to satisfy the first condition. Although the Porterbrook report was not available in August 2017, Ms Jay was given the opportunity to provide something akin to that evidence, namely the supplemental letter from Dr Pasterski. He submits that, if she was not prepared to produce such a letter, it is difficult for her now to contend that the new evidence satisfies the first <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Ladd v Marshall</span> condition. Furthermore, it is submitted on behalf of the Secretary of State that there are two other matters that constrain the application of <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Ladd v Marshall</span> in the present appeal. First, the court&#8217;s jurisdiction is constrained by virtue of the fact that it is only dealing with an appeal on a point of law. Secondly, and in the Secretary of State&#8217;s opinion more fundamentally, it is submitted that the terms of s.8(4) have very considerable bearing on the proper approach to after-acquired evidence. Under that subsection, the applicant is constrained from making a further application for a certificate until six months after the date on which the previous application was rejected. It is submitted that this provision encapsulates a distinction between this case and &#8220;ordinary appeals&#8221; from decisions of a lower court which are, subject to appeal, final. In this case, the doctrine of <span style="font-style:italic">res judicata</span> does not apply so that it was open to Ms Jay to have filed a fresh application at any point after 8 February 2018 and in doing so could have relied upon the new Porterbrook evidence. It is submitted that the scheme of the GRA envisages that new evidence will be considered on a fresh application by the panel, particularly so where evidence raises medical issues or otherwise engages the panel&#8217;s expertise as a specialist panel best suited to determine whether the evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant has gender dysphoria.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In summary, the Secretary of State contends that, in cases that satisfy conditions (a) and (b) within the supplemental question posed, the court should either dismiss the appeal (because the error of law was immaterial) or if, notwithstanding that the error of law was not material to the outcome, the court considers that the error affords it remedial jurisdiction within s.8, the court should nevertheless not have regard to the new evidence in order to determine whether the criteria under s.2(1) are satisfied such as to justify the grant of certificate. In cases such as the present appeal where the new evidence is medical evidence which bears on the reasons why the panel was not previously satisfied that the criteria were met, the only appropriate remedy is for the court to remit the matter to a newly constituted panel pursuant to s.8(3)(b).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In reply, Ms McCann accepts that an appeal under s.8 does not confer a full merits-based jurisdiction, but contends that, on the question of disposal, the court&#8217;s powers are not as circumscribed as suggested on behalf of the Secretary of State. She submits that his submissions wrongly conflate the merits issue and the disposal issue. If the Court concludes that the panel&#8217;s refusal to grant the certificate was obviously wrong, the court can and should consider the evidence, including any new evidence which meets the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Ladd v Marshall</span> criteria and/or which it is otherwise in the interests of justice to have regard to (including where this is reasonably necessary to safeguard the appellant&#8217;s fundamental rights and freedoms), and issue the certificate itself. She reminds the court that its jurisdiction under s.8 is, at its very core, concerned with the question of whether the panel has lawfully refused an individual their right to legal recognition of their gender identity. She therefore submits that this court&#8217;s disposal jurisdiction must necessarily recognise that it has its own duty (as a public body) to safeguard a person&#8217;s rights under ECHR.  Moreover, she submits that this court should be slow to remit the matter back to the panel for reconsideration and should not be timorous in deciding itself to issue a certificate, because any further delay in granting a certificate, where the statutory criteria under s.2(1) are satisfied, constitute a continuing and severe interference with the individual&#8217;s rights under article 8.</p>

The letters from the Porterbrook Clinic were only sent on 11 May 2018 so could not, with reasonable diligence, have been obtained at the time of the panel&#8217;s determination of her application for a certificate. At that point, she was still awaiting her appointment. The evidence from the clinic would plainly have had an important influence on the panel&#8217;s determination because it more than demonstrates that Ms Jay satisfies the statutory criteria under s.2(1).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms McCann further submits that the terms of s.8 specifically empower this court, when disposing of an appeal, to step into the panel&#8217;s shoes and issue a certificate. She contends it is patently wrong for the Secretary of State to assert that the GRA reserves to the panel the task of considering whether the conditions in s.2(1) are satisfied. Such a narrow construction would be contrary to the obligation on the court under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.3</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref> to read and give effect to legislation in a way which is compatible with Convention rights, since it would oblige this court to disregard compelling evidence which satisfy the statutory criteria and remit the matter to the panel for reconsideration. To take this course would only serve to obstruct and delay the process of conferring legal recognition on an individual&#8217;s gender identity, which is neither in the interests of justice, nor compatible with article 8. Ms McCann takes issue with the point emphasised by Mr McGurk as to the specialist nature of the panel. As pointed out by the Court of Session in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">HW v The Gender Recognition Panel </span>[2008] CSIH 26, the panel is not tasked with deciding whether it would have diagnosed an individual with gender dysphoria but with reviewing whether the diagnosis given by the clinician was soundly based. Ms McCann submits that it follows that the medical member of the panel is there to ensure that the meaning and import of sometimes complex medical terminology and analysis is properly understood, not to decide the question of diagnosis afresh. She accepts that, if this court considers that it does not understand the evidence of the Porterbrook Clinic so that it cannot be satisfied that the diagnosis of gender dysphoria is soundly-based, the matter would have to be remitted. She contends, however, that the evidence from the clinic is clear and unassailable so that this court can and ought to have regard to it when allowing this appeal and therefore proceed to issue the certificate.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have considerable sympathy for the panel faced with the task of assessing this case which was by no means straightforward. The process of assessing Ms Jay&#8217;s application was hampered by the fact that she was representing herself, plainly struggled at times to understand the panel&#8217;s concerns, and on many occasions expressed herself in confusing and intemperate terms. These are problems which many courts and tribunals face when dealing with litigants in person and this court fully understands the difficulties which the panel faced.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Nevertheless, I have reached the clear conclusion that there is considerable force in Ms McCann&#8217;s first two grounds of appeal. I agree with Ms McCann&#8217;s central submission that the GRA is a statue designed to facilitate gender recognition, that the statutory regime is permissive rather than restrictive, and that the evidential requirements are ancillary to the statutory criteria and any directions made by the panel must not be elevated to a status which sideline or undermine the statutory criteria or frustrate the process. I agree with her submission that the panel became overly focused on Ms Jay&#8217;s failure to comply fully with its directions issued on 17 November 2016 and, when it came to conduct its final analysis on 8 August 2017, failed to stand back and consider all the material that Ms Jay had provided in order to determine whether the statutory criteria under s.2(1) were satisfied. It is correct that Ms Jay failed to comply with the first direction of 17 November 2016 in that she did not provide a letter from Dr Pasterski indicating what documents she saw for the purposes of her assessment. But Ms Jay did comply with the other directions given by the panel. When it came to consider its decision on 8 August, the panel was under a duty to have regard to all the evidence and assess whether, notwithstanding Ms Jay&#8217;s failure to comply with the first direction, the statutory criteria were satisfied. I accept Ms McCann&#8217;s submission that the panel did not consider whether the substantial compliance by Ms Jay with the other directions obviated the need for a further letter from Dr Pasterski. It is possible that the panel was unaware that Ms Jay had indeed complied with the rest of the directions given on 17 November. The fact that the panel wrongly asserted in its reasons for refusing the application that only one written communication had been received from Ms Jay since the directions were given on 17 November 2016 indicates that the panel was either unaware of, or overlooked, the two other communications provided by Ms Jay which included information submitted in response to those directions. I have some sympathy with the panel on this issue because on at least two occasions the written communications from Ms Jay consisted of returned copies of documents from the panel on which Ms Jay had written comments, sometimes using intemperate language. Nonetheless, the information provided by Ms Jay in those documents was plainly material to her application and ought to have been considered by the panel.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The two reports provided by Dr Pasterski, taken together, provided a considerable amount of detail about Ms Jay and a full explanation about the basis of the diagnosis of gender dysphoria. I note that this was considerably more information than could have been accommodated on the relevant page on the pro forma application as suggested in paragraph 6 of the President&#8217;s Guidance No.1. Notwithstanding this, the panel was not satisfied that the reports were sufficient to establish the statutory criteria. They asserted that the doctor &#8220;appeared not to be aware of significant features about Ms Jay&#8217;s circumstances and recent background.&#8221; I accept Ms McCann&#8217;s submission that the panel failed to set out in its decision or its reasons what precisely it considered those &#8220;significant features&#8221; to be, nor how they might be relevant to whether or not the report was reliable. It is true that Dr Pasterski did not refer to the fact that Ms Jay had been in prison. So far as I can see, this is the only significant feature of Ms Jay&#8217;s circumstances and recent background not referred to in Dr Pasterski&#8217;s report. The panel asserted in its reasons that Dr Pasterski &#8220;needed to know those circumstances to decide whether the findings of her report were sound and she stood by them&#8221;. But the panel did not ask Dr Pasterski directly to confirm whether she knew about the details of Ms Jay&#8217;s imprisonment. Instead, in its directions of 17 November, the panel asked Ms Jay to confirm that she had told Dr Pasterski of the periods when she had been in prison. Ms Jay subsequently replied confirming that she had given this information. The panel did not check this point with Dr Pasterski, but instead concluded that she &#8220;appeared not to be aware&#8221; of it, notwithstanding Ms Jay&#8217;s assertion that she was. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The panel evidently held some concerns as to whether Ms Jay&#8217;s accounts were truthful, witness the reference to &#8220;Ms Jay having something to hide&#8221; and to the possibility of drawing adverse inferences from her failure to comply with directions. Given that the purpose of the GRA is to facilitate recognition, however, and the evident difficulties that Ms Jay was having complying with directions, in part as a result of her status as a prisoner, it seems to me that the panel ought not to have refused her application without directing a hearing at which Ms Jay could have been given the opportunity to address the panel&#8217;s concerns and the possible inconsistencies or shortcomings in her evidence. As set out above, Schedule 1 paragraph 6(5) provides that &#8220;the panel must determine an application without a hearing unless the panel considers that a hearing is necessary&#8221;. It follows, however, that a panel must always consider whether or not a hearing is necessary, in particular where issues of credibility may be relevant to its decision. There is nothing to suggest the panel considered the possibility of convening a hearing in this case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In reaching its decision, the panel plainly attached significant weight to Dr Barrett&#8217;s report from July 2014. In doing so, it is unclear whether the panel took into account the fact that the report was over three years old, that it had not been prepared for an application for a gender recognition certificate but for other litigation, and that Ms Jay had asserted that it contained inaccuracies. Moreover, so far as I am aware, the panel gave no indication that it would be taking Dr Barrett&#8217;s 2014 report into account in determining Ms Jay&#8217;s third application until it referred to the report in its reasons for refusing the application on 8 August 2017. If the panel had been intending to take that report into account, it should have alerted Ms Jay before doing so and given her an opportunity to address the issues arising from the report in information or evidence filed in connection with her application. If the panel was going to draw on Dr Barrett&#8217;s 2014 report to question the reliability of Dr Pasterski&#8217;s 2016 report, it should have drawn his report specifically to Dr Pasterski&#8217;s attention and asked for her comments.</p>

In the circumstances, I concluded it is unnecessary to proceed to consider the third ground of appeal based on the alleged breach of articles 8 and 14 of ECHR. This issue was not fully argued by the Secretary of State and in this extremely sensitive area it seems to me to be unwise, as well as unnecessary, for this court to embark on a lengthy analysis of the alleged breaches of human rights. I have set out Ms McCann&#8217;s submissions on this issue at some length so that her argument is recorded, which may be of some assistance should the matter arise in a subsequent case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In doing so, I first address the question whether I should admit at this stage the subsequent reports produced by Dr Cosmulescu of the Porterbrook Clinic. Applying the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Ladd v Marshall</span> criteria, it seems to me that the reports are plainly admissible. At the time of the refusal decision in August 2017, the reports did not exist. As Dr Thornhill noted in her report dated November 2016, Ms Jay had been referred to the Porterbrook Clinic and was awaiting a review appointment. She was not seen by the clinic for many months, long after the refusal decision. I reject Mr McGurk&#8217;s submission that Ms Jay had the opportunity to provide something akin to that evidence, namely the supplemental letter from Dr Pasterski requested by the panel and that, if she was not prepared to produce such a letter, it is difficult for her now to contend that the new evidence satisfies the first <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Ladd v Marshall</span> condition. The supplemental information from Dr Pasterski requested by the panel was completely different from the report which is now produced by the Porterbrook Clinic. I also reject Mr McGurk&#8217;s submission that the application of the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Ladd v Marshall</span> criteria is constrained by the fact that under s.8 the appeal is confined to a point of law. I agree with Ms McCann&#8217;s submission that this conflates the merits issue with the disposal issue. As for his third objection &#8211; that the scheme of the GRA envisages a further application to the panel &#8211; it would of course be open to M to apply to the panel for a fourth time. But in my judgement, to conclude that this court is therefore constrained from taking fresh medical evidence into account in determining whether to grant a certificate would be to impose an unduly restrictive limit on the powers of the court on appeal. The purpose of the GRA is to provide a means of facilitating gender recognition. It would be wholly inappropriate to impose unnecessary procedural hurdles which would risk extending the period in which Ms Jay is compelled, in the words of the European Court in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Goodwin</span>, to &#8220;live in an intermediate zone in not quite one gender or the other&#8221;. Under s.2(1), the panel must grant the application for certificate if satisfied that the statutory criteria are met. There is no residual discretion. In my judgement, any court hearing an appeal from a panel&#8217;s decision is under the same obligation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having considered all the evidence put before the panel, and the report as now provided by the Porterbrook Clinic, I am satisfied that Ms Jay has gender dysphoria, has lived in her acquired gender throughout the period of two years ending with the date on which the third application was made, and intends to continue to live in the acquired gender until death. So far as the first criterion is concerned, I do not consider that the fact that I am sitting alone without assistance from medical member of the panel prevents me from concluding, based on all the evidence, that Ms Jay has gender dysphoria. This court is well used to assessing medical evidence. The reports provided by Dr Pasterski and Dr Cosmulescu of the Porterbrook Clinic, taken together, provide much more detail than anticipated by the President&#8217;s Guidance No.1 and amply demonstrate that the first criterion in s.2(1)(a) is satisfied. The various documents listed by Ms McCann in her submissions, together with the other information provided by Ms Jay, are plainly sufficient to establish that she has lived in the acquired gender for two years prior to her application. The medical reports, including the latest reports of Dr Cosmulescu, establish that she intends to continue to live in the acquired gender for the rest of her life. Insofar as Ms Jay failed to comply with one of the requirements imposed by the panel in the directions given on 17 November 2016, I conclude that that requirement is rendered otiose by the report now produced by the Porterbrook Clinic. </p>
