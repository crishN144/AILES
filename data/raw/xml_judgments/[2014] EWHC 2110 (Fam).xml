This case is a bad, but by no means unique, example of what has come to be known as the stranded spouse.  A very young wife was lawfully brought to the United Kingdom, where she was dependent upon her husband and his family, and where she gave birth to a child who has major disabilities.  Her husband made little effort to secure for her the immigration status to which she was entitled and when the marriage got into difficulties, she was then sent out of the country with no right to re-enter.  The result is that she and her child have been separated for the past three years, a situation that is a wholesale breach of their right to respect for their family life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The only way in which this breach can be remedied is by the mother regaining the ability to enter this country.  The nature of the child&#8217;s condition means that while his mother remains abroad there is no opportunity for any meaningful relationship between them.  </span></p>

He has very severe learning and communication disabilities.  His parents are both of Pakistani origin.  The father was born in England while the mother came here in June 2002 after an arranged marriage that was celebrated in Pakistan in 2000 when she was around 15 years old.  The parents are first cousins, the mother&#8217;s mother being the sister of the father's father.</span></p>

The father and S remained in the family home with the father&#8217;s mother, his father having died in May 2013 and his brother and family having moved abroad.  Since the mother's departure, the father has been the main carer for S, who attends a special school.</span></p>

There were a number of indicators that should have alerted the court to the fact that it was not getting the whole story.  A residence order was, unusually, being made in relation to a child whose parents were living under the same roof, with no clarity about what was to happen next.  The order was made after the most perfunctory consideration of the child's best interests, or his mother's rights.  As a minimum, somebody should have had a face-to-face meeting with this mother ahead of an order that had important consequences for a particularly disadvantaged child.  Instead, the father&#8217;s already dominant position was further enhanced, enabling him to move on to the next stage in his plan.</span></p>

Left alone for a few moments, he says that he told her that she could go to Pakistan if that is what she wanted, and that she said that she thought that she would.  Such a conversation may have taken place, but it does not significantly support the father's case or undermine the mother's.  </span></p>

What is clear to me, however, is that the remarriage has nothing to do with the circumstances of the mother's departure or of her wish to return and resume her relationship with her son.  The mother&#8217;s case at this hearing gave no support to her "husband" coming to this country: on the contrary, what she said would amount to a solid basis for the refusal of any such application.</span></p>
