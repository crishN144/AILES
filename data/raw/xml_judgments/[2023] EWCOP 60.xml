This means that her recent decision making is likely to be of poorer quality than it was previously.&#8221;</span></p>

The quality of that specific opposition has not diminished since the matter was last before me. It was most recently expressed to Ms Sutton KC and to Mr Edwards, her instructing solicitor from the Official Solicitor&#8217;s department, at a Teams meeting held on 15 May 2023.</span></p>

However, putting that logical objection aside, under this head I do record that Beatrice is a Christian and would subscribe to the Christian tenet that self-destruction is sinful. </span></p>

Beatrice has expressed a wish to have a dignified death, which I take to be to have no more moral significance other than that she wishes her ending to be as comfortable and as pain free as possible. </span></p>

The history clearly shows that various treatment options have been attempted to no avail over a prolonged period of time.

The issue is, in any event, largely, if not entirely, academic as the clinicians within the Applicant Trust would not be prepared to implement forced feeding even if I were to declare that to be in Beatrice&#8217;s best interests; and I cannot order them to administer it. </span></p>

The views of Beatrice&#8217;s treating clinicians, Dr H and Dr C in particular, and the views of the independent expert, Dr Glover, the consultant psychiatrist, is that further active treatment against Beatrice&#8217;s will would not be in her best interests and, I repeat, they would not, in any event, be prepared to administer forced feeding. </span></p>

In my judgment, notwithstanding that I have to make the decision on Beatrice&#8217;s behalf, she being incapacitated, I am quite sure on the facts of this case that I should respect her very strong wish that she should not be forcibly fed. </span></p>
