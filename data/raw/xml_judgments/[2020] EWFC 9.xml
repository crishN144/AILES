That judgment is reported at <a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2019/3434.html" style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#0563C1">https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2019/3434.html</a><a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2019/3434.html">.</a> In that judgment I recorded that very substantial monthly payments which had previously been received by the husband from companies of which he was the sole shareholder had come to an end.

Although he has never asserted that the termination is permanent, his case has always been that he is not a man who is poor, but he is a man who is presently subjected to cashflow difficulties. However, Lieven J plainly assumed that these abundant sums would either continue to be paid or soon revived, but on the husband's case that did not eventuate with the result that he claims to have been unable to have paid the full amount due under the orders.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The husband&#8217;s stance was given to me from the witness box on that occasion. He repeatedly asserted that he was not a man of poverty but rather a man suffering liquidity and cash flow problems during a period of transition in his business activities. Before me on this final hearing his stance has been the same. In his oral evidence he stated that he thought he needed two to three years to revive his fortunes and to repay his debts. In his final written submissions, he stated: </p>

However, it must be alert to ensure that the order can be honoured.  H must be allowed to focus his attentions of reviving his business fortunes for the benefit of his family and not be impeded by further enforcement proceedings or other litigation pressure.  H&#8217;s case is that he hopes to realise returns on his investments if he is allowed to concentrate his efforts constructively.  However, there are no further funds available now.  The last three years have been characterized by H calling in what debts he could, borrowing to the maximum, charging everything he owns to the full extent of his ability.  There is no more leeway presently.  The parties must both endure a period of economy before H&#8217;s fortunes hopefully revive.  Any order of the court must allow for this too.&#8221;   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The clear view I have formed is that the husband is exceedingly astute commercially who is presently forging a change of direction in his business activities. A snapshot at the present time would not be a realistic way of looking at his resources. Nor would such a snapshot pay proper regard to the statutory mandate of having regard not merely to his existing resources but also to resources that he is likely to have in the foreseeable future. It is noteworthy that notwithstanding that he proclaims that he is at his economic nadir he has not disposed of any of the building blocks of his commercial empire. True, he has borrowed quite substantially in recent times from his father in order to navigate the transitional rocks and eddies. But everything has been left intact, presumably because he is confident that they will ultimately come to fruition in the foreseeable future. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">It is therefore unrealistic to approach this case on a snapshot basis. The schedule of assets attached to the husband&#8217;s final position statement proclaimed that his net worth at that point, but excluding his trust interests, was minus &#163;50 million. This is to be compared to an <span style="font-style:italic">Imerman</span> document dating from 2010 obtained by the wife, and disclosed by her in accordance with proper procedures, which stated that his fortune, including his trust assets (he drew no distinction between his personal and trust assets in that document), amounted to US$185 million. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The wife rightly makes her claims by reference to the needs principle alone. There is no marital acquest in view of the present downturn, and so the sharing principle is not engaged. Her claim is conventionally framed in the context of the standard of living enjoyed by the parties during their marriage and the likely upturn in the husband&#8217;s fortunes. The husband, too, argues that the claim should be dealt by reference to need alone although his position is that the wife should receive minimal amounts. Neither party argues that the claim should be adjourned to be revived in the future. This would be an intellectually pure way of dealing with the situation with which I am presented. However, Miss Stone QC rightly points up the practical and legal difficulties faced by any claimant who has such a solution foisted on her. So far as I am aware there is no reported case of a claimant successfully later reviving capital claims that were adjourned at the final hearing. </p>

I will make an award to the wife of capital sums to meet her needs although I will give the husband time to pay them and he will explicitly be granted liberty to apply for an extension of time should his fortunes not revive as forecasted. The onus of proof to justify an extension will be squarely upon him, however. </p>

They started dating and in 2005 they began to live together in an apartment owned by the husband in Moscow. They became engaged in 2007. They planned to marry in South Africa in August 2008 at a vineyard owned by the husband there. However, shortly before the ceremony the relationship foundered, and the wedding was cancelled. However, they were soon reconciled and were married in Moscow on 16 December 2008. On 8 April 2009 they signed a Russian post-nuptial agreement which provided for separation of property. The existence of this agreement is an additional reason for confining the wife&#8217;s claim to needs alone. </p>

This was the well-established time threshold for avoiding taxation of global, as opposed to domestic, income. However, the Swedish tax authority has nonetheless sought to treat the husband as having been tax resident in Sweden during that period and has levied an enormous tax impost on him as a result. This the husband is seeking to appeal. I will have more to say about this below. </p>

Unfortunately, the marriage was blighted by the husband&#8217;s serial infidelity and abuse of cocaine and alcohol. The wife issued a divorce petition on 24 November 2016 and commenced her claim for financial remedies on the same day. On 21 December 2016 the parties physically separated, and although they discussed reconciliation they never cohabited again. Although the husband initially defended the divorce proceedings on the ground that the parties were not habitually resident here, that defence was withdrawn, and I pronounced Decree Nisi on 30 January 2020. </p>

Orders were made by Cohen J and Roberts J in March 2018, however, adjourning the claim on the basis that the parties were, as mentioned above, exploring a reconciliation. Throughout this period the husband was amply supporting the wife and was not asserting that his business was in decline and heading for the doldrums. That only happened when it became clear to him that the reconciliation was not going to take place. His 2017 Form E stated that he had personal and business assets of &#163;23m, trust assets of &#163;22m, and liabilities of &#163;32m, of which the main item was Swedish tax of &#163;11m. It asserted a current income need for himself of just under &#163;1m annually.  </p>

For example, between May and December 2018 he spent nearly $189,000 on himself on his Amex card alone. In August 2018 the husband was able to borrow without difficulty $336,000 from the grandchildren&#8217;s trust. In November 2018 Z Co (to which I refer below) borrowed $4.7m from the husband&#8217;s father, again without difficulty. On 29 November 2018 the husband lent $300,000 to an individual, unsecured, in order to curry political favours in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This is now said to be irrecoverable. The picture that emerges is that money was readily available and readily dispersed for pleasure and other speculative reasons. </p>

A valuation prepared in December 2018 by Mazars, the top accountancy firm, appraised the value of 100% of the DRC venture as $53.77m and the husband&#8217;s 50.61% interest in at $27.2m. The figure of $53.77 million was calculated by taking the area of the land available at 1,685,000 m&#178; and multiplying it by the value per square metre of $44.75 giving $74.66 million. From this figure various liabilities were subtracted to give $53.77 million. These liabilities included a loan from Y Ltd in the sum of $13 million. That should be disregarded when looking at the hard reality. Plainly, although the land is yet to be developed there is enormous latent value available to the husband, if not now, then within the foreseeable future. </p>

The project is known as &#8220;PP&#8221;. The South African subsidiary owes &#163;5.6 million to a commercial bank &#8211; Nedbank. I was told by the husband in his evidence that the development of the land has been impeded by the difficulty in obtaining vacant possession from squatters. In a rider to his witness statement the husband stated that the bank had applied for liquidation of PP. However, the liquidation had been postponed under a settlement agreement made in September on terms that monthly interest payments were made. The husband said that these have not been paid and so the liquidation will be resumed. But in the witness box the husband accepted that other legal strategies were being adopted including seeking protection from creditors under the South African equivalent of Chapter 11. It was clear to me that the liquidation was far from certain and that the husband&#8217;s personal guarantee of the bank loan was unlikely to be called upon. I decline to attribute a hard liability to the husband in this respect, but I do not attribute any value to this aspect of the development. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;The liability arises from an assessment of H&#8217;s worldwide income between 2010 and 2014 (when H had been advised, wrongly as it transpired, that he would only be taxed in Sweden on his Swedish income and on wealth remitted to Sweden).  The impact of this decision was that the Swedish tax authorities applied an anti-avoidance rule which treated the income of all of the companies beneficially owned by H (including those in the trusts) as being H&#8217;s income.  That income comprised principally interest on inter-company loans within the structure which, in reality was never paid and represented a money-goround in any event. The tax debt is the subject of aggressive enforcement proceedings by the relevant authority in Sweden, which has already seized real property, and the benefit of a loan of US$6 million advanced by H to X Ltd.  It cannot be ruled out that the Swedish tax authorities will seek to make H bankrupt.  The Swedish tax debt cannot be ignored and, were H to have liquid resources with which to meet the debt, he must repay it, in priority to meeting W&#8217;s claims, as would be the case for a debt owed to HMRC.&#8221; </p>

If that appeal were unsuccessful, he could petition the Swedish Supreme Court and that would take an equivalent period to be determined. So, enforcement of this debt is a long way off. Even if the worst came to the worst and he were to fail on his appeal the Swedish authorities may well struggle to enforce this debt in this country or other common law countries having regard to the well-recognised rule against foreign revenue enforcement (see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Holman v Johnson </span>(1775) 1 Cowp 341 and <span style="font-style:italic">Government of India v Taylor</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1955] AC 491" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1955">[1955] AC 491</ref>, HL). The husband produced a memorandum from an English lawyer explaining that the debt would be mutually enforceable under Council Directive 2010/24/EU. However, as matters stand, that directive will cease to have effect in this country on the expiry of the Brexit withdrawal transition period on 31 December 2020. It is completely unknown what alternative arrangements, if any, will be put in place prior to that date. Therefore, the husband may well be in a strong position, were he to lose his appeals, to negotiate an acceptable settlement with the Swedish tax authorities. I therefore categorically reject the suggestion that this debt, which has speculative and conjectural aspects to it, is to be treated as a hard debt immediately payable.  </p>

However, in her open offer she sought a sum of &#163;3.75 million for capitalised maintenance which translates to an annual income, using the Duxbury algorithm, of &#163;140,000. That is a reasonable figure for her needs for each of the next two years. A reasonable rental figure for the next two years is &#163;6,000 per month. This equates to &#163;72,000 annually. Thus, the wife has reasonable needs amounting to &#163;212,000 annually. From this I subtract the Moscow rental yield mentioned above and reasonable earnings of &#163;20,000 per annum net. This is, in my opinion, the minimum earning capacity to attribute to a woman of the age of the wife with her skills and attributes. This leaves an annual requirement of &#163;151,240. The husband should pay two years of this requirement upfront in view of his shocking delinquency in relation to the interim order. That gives rise to an immediate need of &#163;302,480. To that I add &#163;395,252 being the wife&#8217;s net indebtedness (mainly costs), all of which in my opinion has been reasonably incurred. I subtract the sum of &#163;50,000 which is held in an account and which was intended to cover, inter alia, the wife&#8217;s rental costs between December and the final hearing. That sum will be immediately released to the wife. This gives rise to a figure of &#163;647,732, which will be the first instalment of the lump sum which I order. It will be payable by 2 March 2020. I have no doubt that this relatively modest sum is readily available to the husband having regard to the findings about his resources I have made above. </p>

In my judgment, having regard to the evidence before me, a reasonable sum for him to pay at that time for the wife&#8217;s housing is &#163;3.5 million all in. Given the relatively young age of the wife and the medium length of the marriage it is not reasonable for there to be a full Duxbury award. Rather, it should be on a stepped basis with the need falling by 50% at age 60. The Duxbury sum needed for a woman aged nearly 42 of &#163;140,000 per annum falling by 50% at age 60 is &#163;2.7 million. I add these two sums together and subtract the value of the Moscow properties, which it would be reasonable to liquidate at that point. This leads to a net figure for the wife&#8217;s needs of &#163;5.181 million. That will constitute the second instalment of the lump sum and will be payable on 2 March 2022. The law allows the husband to apply to extend the payment date of the second instalment (or even to seek to vary its quantum in highly exceptional circumstances) but he must understand that he would need to adduce very clear evidence that payment of that sum on that date was an impossibility. </p>
