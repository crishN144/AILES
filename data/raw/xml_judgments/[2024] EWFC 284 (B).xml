However, in my judgment the CIR encompasses a broad child focused analysis the contents of which allow the court to properly address each element of the welfare checklist when reaching a conclusion.  In the majority of cases before the Pathfinder court it is the only welfare report that the court will have.  The investigative nature of the Pathfinder approach and the move to focus on the child&#8217;s voice and experience does not undermine the content of the report or make it less useful. One of the aims of Pathfinder is greater upfront investigation and information provided through a CIR and the template for the report has been constructed to ensure the child is at the centre of decision making.  It achieves that aim. I reject the submission made on behalf of father that the parties cannot expect the degree of analysis from a CIR that would be available via a s7 report. In my judgment it is not open to me to conclude either that it should be given less weight nor that the content of the CIR makes this case distinguishable from those authorities that were concerned with s7 reports.</span></p>

Father&#8217;s counsel makes the point that the court&#8217;s attention was not drawn to relevant authorities relating to internal relocation.  It is a point well made.  Decision hearings are the same as any other hearing and it was incumbent on the legal representatives to assist the court as they would in any other hearing, by drawing attention to relevant authorities.  That is even more so in circumstances where the matter is being heard by lay justices.    The absence of any consideration of the impact on mother and thereby the children is a deficit in the reasons which also leads me to conclude that the grounds set out at 2A(d) and 2B a) and (b) are made out.</span></p>

It is a paper exercise undertaken when the Court has the CIR and any risk assessment in respect of domestic abuse that has been prepared.  The parties have no input into the GK2 hearing.  Their positions are protected by virtue of FPR 2010 4.3 which allows them to apply within 7 days to vary any order or case management direction so made.

Consideration of those questions lead me to conclude they were not matters of clarification with some of them being properly characterised as cross examination.  The letter was only disclosed to the mother&#8217;s solicitors after it was sent, and they therefore had no input into it.  Importantly, neither did the court.  Permission was not sought either to ask the questions nor to file and reply upon the response which was only served on mother&#8217;s legal team on the morning of the decision hearing.</span></p>

The GK2 order makes clear that it is only the documents ordered by the court than can be filed without further permission being granted.  The approach taken by father&#8217;s solicitors took no account of that order and had the potential to undermine the process and the timetable.  In the absence of a court order there was no obligation on the Cafcass officer to respond and if she chose to, no obligation to respond in advance of the decision hearing.  There was also the potential for unfairness in circumstances where mother&#8217;s solicitors were excluded from that process.</span></p>

It also allows the court to keep a watchful eye on the timetable and to ensure the procedure adopted is fair to all parties.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.65in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">The problem solving approach will be familiar to many as mirroring that adopted in the well established FDAC courts.  That approach will be at the forefront of the court&#8217;s mind in dealing with private law applications under the pilot.  Where cases are allocated to the adjudication track and listed for a determination hearing, the expectation is that the parties will engage the problem solving approach and avoid an adversarial approach to the litigation that sadly became all too familiar under CAP.   Judge led conciliation is a significant feature of the adjudication track and the problem solving approach.  It is not like the conciliation that takes place at a FHDRA.  It is informed by significant assessments by Cafcass Cymru and the IDVA service where domestic abuse is a feature of the case.  Those assessments allow the court to take an evidence based approach to problem solving and helping the parties to reach agreement.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.65in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">That judge led conciliation is recorded as an essential component of the decision hearing in the GK2 order and is ordered to take place before submissions or evidence is heard in the anticipation that settlement is possible.  There may be scepticism about this approach by those faced with seemingly intransigent parties.  However experience in the early pilot areas establishes that it is effective on refocusing the parties on the children and their welfare and also what is achievable within the life of the proceedings.  It is also worth noting that by virtue of FPR 2010 Rule 1.4(g) it has for quite some time, been part of the court&#8217;s duty to help the parties settle the whole or part of the case.</span></p>

Indeed it was not mentioned by the court or either party.  The hearing moved straight to submissions.  That should not have happened and must not happen in the future.  It deprived the parties of an opportunity to be assisted to reach agreement and forced the court to make a decision about an exercise of parental responsibility that should, if at all possible, have been left to the parents.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.65in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">If the court did not of its own initiative take the opportunity to conciliate then the parties should have drawn the court&#8217;s attention to the order and invited them to undertake judge led conciliation.  That omission in itself suggests the parties were not engaged with the problem solving approach but were focused on the advancement of their own case.  They bypassed an important step in the process consequently.</span></p>

However, that is a significant case management decision in a Pathfinder case and in my judgment should be taken only after hearing submissions from the parties.  It will not be enough to submit that the parties are not likely to agree.  If the decision is taken, it should be clearly recorded on the face of the order so that the case management decision can be understood.</span></p>

It is my clear view that if the problem solving approach had been adopted it was perfectly possible with compromise on both sides to find a middle ground that met the children&#8217;s needs.  It is a matter of great regret to this court that the issues have now widened, the litigation has been enlarged and the court asked to decide a &#8220;live with&#8221; application.  That will mean delay and greater anxiety for the parents, and particularly the children, quite the opposite of what the Pathfinder model aims to achieve.</span></p>
