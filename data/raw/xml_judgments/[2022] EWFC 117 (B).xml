The eldest is his half-sibling and was placed with a relative at a young age, the next 3 were placed with a paternal aunt when they were toddlers, 2 of whom she went on to care for through their minority.  The youngest 3 were the subject of care proceedings which concluded before me in 2020 with final care orders and their placement in long term foster care.  M creditably conceded those final orders in 2020, given the children&#8217;s enhanced needs and her own vulnerabilities and capabilities to meet those needs.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">M is a 39 year old woman with a complex and painful background.  Her own childhood was repeatedly traumatic and her experiences included sexual and emotional abuse, chronic neglect, instability and exposure to volatile and unsupportive relationships.  She has experienced ongoing trauma from dysfunctional intimate relationships and the losses of her children.  She has a mild learning disability that was diagnosed in 2001 and has a diagnosis of moderate Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder.  This was first diagnosed in 2013 and was confirmed again by consultant psychiatrist Dr McDermott in 2018 in the context of the previous proceedings and most recently in her updating report in these proceedings.  She has experienced typical difficulties associated with this diagnosis including difficulty in reflective functioning, poor self-esteem, patterns of poor relationships and instability, difficulties trusting others, difficulties controlling and modulating her emotional responses under stress, impulsivity, mood fluctuation, suicidal feelings and self-harm.  She regularly misused cannabis.  She has made significant progress since the conclusion of the 2020 proceedings which is discussed further below.</p>

He has had little involvement in these proceedings but has been advised and represented.  His relationship with M was unstable, volatile and violent.  Although his position has varied slightly through the proceedings, and he has expressed reservations about M&#8217;s abilities as X gets older, he supports X remaining with M under a Supervision Order.  He is concerned that the LA should follow through with its support for M and X.   He has never met X due to his prison sentence and does not seek any contact with X.  He acknowledges that if his position were to change there would need to be a risk assessment.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">F has not yet told his current partner about X.   It is likely that she will be upset and angry as X was conceived during his ongoing relationship with her, during the previous proceedings.  Both X&#8217;s parents concede that they succumbed unwisely to meeting up and had a one-night stand.  They have not otherwise resumed their previous relationship.  Other family members and mutual acquaintances are aware of X&#8217;s existence and parentage.  F&#8217;s partner&#8217;s ignorance of X is an issue that will need to be addressed and carefully handled.  Initially, F refuted paternity but it was established by DNA paternity testing in August 2021.  This led to a significant delay in the proceedings which had been listed for a final hearing in September 2021.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">At that point, the LA&#8217;s case and care plan for adoption were based on the recent outcome of the previous proceedings and the negative conclusions of the various reports from those proceedings, and the negative assessment from the London Infant and Family Team (LIFT) multi-disciplinary assessment in June 2021.  Their report was a central part of the evidence and was inevitably highly influential in determining the LA&#8217;s care plan.  In brief, their overall conclusion was: M was too damaged and dysfunctional due to her traumatic experiences and EUPD to be able to meet X&#8217;s needs within his timescales; she lacked attunement and an ability to reflect, and was unable to acknowledge her role in her older children&#8217;s experiences; she required therapy to address her emotional regulation, insight, low self-esteem and problem-solving skills; X should be removed from her care.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Given that the plan at that time was for adoption, it then became necessary to investigate whether paternal family members could provide appropriate alternative care.  The paternal aunt who had cared for two of X&#8217;s older siblings was the subject of a Special Guardianship assessment which concluded in January 2022 with a positive recommendation.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The extension of time due to the clarification of X&#8217;s paternity and the Special Guardianship assessment also meant that an updating report could be obtained from Dr McDermott in November 2021, and that M had an extended opportunity to parent X and work with professionals.  To a very significant extent, by the time of the relisted final hearing in late January 2022, her behaviour, coping skills, presentation and care of X refuted many of the conclusions set out in those earlier reports.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the relisted hearing in January 2022, the LA&#8217;s care plan had been modified to supporting a Special Guardianship Order to X&#8217;s paternal aunt.  This was resisted by M, and the Children's Guardian wished to hear from the expert witnesses before reaching her conclusions given that their conclusions differed markedly from her own perceptions of M&#8217;s improved capabilities.  The court heard from key expert witnesses and, in particular, three witnesses from LIFT.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">A number of difficulties and concerns had been raised following the filing of their report, including what appeared to be: failures to consider any changes M had shown; failure to provide notes of meetings and observations; refusal for key witnesses to attend; and concerns as to their methods and approach.  Unfortunately, such major concerns emerged during the course of their oral evidence at the hearing, that the parties provided a joint statement to the court criticising the LIFT assessment, and the LA specifically confirmed that it did not feel able to rely upon it.  These matters will be discussed in more detail later in this judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Inevitably, this led to further consideration of the way ahead in these already delayed proceedings and how to address gaps in the evidence as a result of both the problems with the LIFT assessment and M&#8217;s evident improvements.  Ultimately the parties agreed on and the court approved a <span class="PageNumber">Marschak Interaction Method (</span>MIM) assessment of attachment patterns due to the concerns existing as to M&#8217;s abilities in relation to mentalisation and attunement and therapeutic needs.  This in turn led to further clarification of the recommendations from the MIM assessment author, the development of a transition plan (including a further move of M and X from the residential unit to another parent and baby foster placement as a bridging placement), the execution of that transition plan and the development of a final care plan.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">During the course of these proceedings and to date, it has been noticeable to this court and to the Children's Guardian and the IRO that M has presented very differently than she used to, and in particular in contrast with her behaviour during the previous proceedings.  She has particularly impressed the Children's Guardian, who had also represented the younger children in those proceedings, with the progress and improvements she has shown.  Previously, M presented both in court and to professionals involved in those proceedings as trying hard to please but also chaotic, anxious, outspoken, defensive, confused, refusing or unable to acknowledge serious concerns, lurching from crisis to crisis, and emotionally unstable.  This has emphatically and obviously not been the case in these proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">She has largely worked well and co-operatively in difficult circumstances with the social work team and in less than ideal placements.  She has satisfied the professional parties in this case that she has proper insight into the previous concerns and has been described by the social worker as honest and open and understanding of her own role in that history.  She has remained free of destabilising or abusive relationships since before the conclusion of the last proceedings. Although she has ongoing vulnerabilities and weaknesses, and requires ongoing support and therapy, it has become clear to the professionals that M has not simply matured and turned a corner, but has made significant meaningful and consistent changes, and has shown herself to be a determined, child-focussed mother in whose care X has thrived.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Initially M was placed in a parent and baby foster placement.  This was not a suitable cultural match, and due to the inevitable delays and length of these proceedings it lasted for far longer than is usual for such placements until February 2022 when M and X moved to a largely independent annexe of a residential unit.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Over time it emerged that the foster carer was not supportive nor co-operative with a number of issues, including for example: X&#8217;s needs for access to the garden, modest rearrangement of the rooms and furnishings within the home, outdoor activities and facilitating M&#8217;s and X&#8217;s access to the community, prevented M from joining Christmas celebrations, and showed an apparent refusal to adapt and alter in response to requests from the professionals, to the extent that the social work team and the Children's Guardian both considered that her role was actively unhelpful and difficult to manage within already challenging care proceedings. Notwithstanding these difficulties, including the foster carer imposing an unplanned visit of her male partner from abroad, M remained co-operative and appropriate despite her own vulnerabilities within that difficult and inappropriately managed placement which in the end lasted for over a year.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Again, notwithstanding the upheaval and the presence of vulnerable and challenging families at the residential unit to which she moved in February 2022, M managed herself extremely well and was observed to co-operate well with staff and residents and to be meeting her own and X&#8217;s needs admirably.  A transition plan home was implemented in May 2022, which also involved a further change of placement to a bridging foster placement.  Since mid-July M and X have been living at home full-time.  This was also a disruptive and challenging process, but was again managed well by M.  </p>

She has engaged extremely well with the Family Support Worker who provides weekly visits and direct work with M at home.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Overall, she was cautious about M&#8217;s ability to access and make use of appropriate therapy that would be required to address her underlying personality disorder issues, largely due to concerns about waiting lists and referral times. She found M to be distressed (&#8216;anxiously dysregulated&#8217;) and to the extent of being unable to think about or discuss several concerning matters during this updating assessment, but did conclude that if M engaged in and completed a course of appropriate therapy, she would more likely than not be able to benefit in terms of her reflective functioning and consequently her parenting.  She considered this reflective functioning, or mentalisation, to be a key aspect of M&#8217;s capabilities in the context of her diagnosis and her history of personal and parenting difficulties.  She deferred to others on the question of whether M could cope with parenting alongside undertaking therapy.  However, when considering her more negative opinions of M, she had also placed a good deal of reliance on key negative observations and conclusions set out in the LIFT assessment.  For reasons that are discussed below, this reliance resulted in those aspects of Dr McDermott&#8217;s report unfortunately and inevitably being of less help and value than they might otherwise have been.   </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Some of the progress noted by Dr McDermott included weekly sessions undertaken by M over a 4 month period in late 2020 with her allocated care co-ordinator from the multi-disciplinary ADAPT mental health team, supervised by a clinical psychologist.  This was stabilisation work focussing on managing emotions in preparation for further regular psychological therapies.  She was considered to have been committed, attending all appointments, fully compliant with intensive work and to have made positive changes in managing her condition.  Unfortunately, progression of this work was interrupted by her move from that Health Trust area when she was placed with X in the parent and baby placement at the start of these proceedings.  This engagement and progress were considered to be particularly positive factors by Dr McDermott.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">This approach has continued during these proceedings with her compliance and engagement with the MIM assessment which followed from the attempted final hearing in January 2022.  That process observed a good bond between X and M but also made recommendations as to Theraplay work for M and X, and Schema therapy for M to mitigate risks associated with her vulnerabilities and to assist the attachment process and M&#8217;s attunement, with which work she has also fully and positively engaged.  M has worked closely and positively with her mental health advocate and GP for a re-referral to ADAPT and for a review of her medications as necessary.</p>

She has completely given up using cannabis and has stuck rigorously to using her medication.  She has attributed much of her improvement to these steps.  She has shown some ongoing trust and sensitivity issues in these proceedings, particularly relating to the social worker contacting a neighbouring local authority and her GP in relation to her mental health issues.  However, this sensitivity has been limited to those issues.  She has, on a few occasions when under particular stress, been witnessed by the social worker to show a degree of unhelpful anxiety and defensiveness with a loss of perspective.  However, she has been able to seek and accept support from her mental health advocate and from other professionals in breaking down problems into manageable issues, and she has attended appointments and sought and taken up help and advice.  </p>

However, significant further work is required to enable M to consistently manage her emotions, which would be essential in order for her to provide sensitive, attuned care to X.  M would be required to engage in a suitable evidence based therapy for 12-18 months to manage her emotionally unstable personality disorder.

It is LIFT&#8217;s opinion that if X were returned to the care of M, there is a high risk that patterns of unsafe care, emotional harm and neglectful parenting would occur, with a high likelihood of negative consequences for X&#8217;s social and emotional development and wellbeing.

Firstly, there was significant resistance to any witness other than Dr Lamb attending court.  Secondly, notes of assessment sessions and meetings and other source material were not provided as directed, and it was also suggested that such items were not necessary or were adequately available in the lengthy report and would be hard to obtain from NSPCC files; whereas it turned out that some 2000 pages and video footage of the still face exercises undertaken during the assessment were available and proved to be highly relevant.</p>

There did in fact, and I find, appear to be numerous examples of M acknowledging her role in the historic concerns as well as putting forward her own views.

This procedure at LIFT involved a period of &#8216;normal&#8217; interaction between the adult and X, but without touching X, followed by turning away and then turning back to X with a &#8216;still non-expressive face&#8217; for a fixed period of time (&#8216;separation&#8217;), before the carer then resumed normal interaction (&#8216;reunion&#8217;), albeit still without being permitted to touch X.

It was asserted, by contrast, that X did not have this type of relationship with M, but that M showed emotional discomfort, was unable to comfort X until she was permitted to pick him up and hold him, and &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">that X&#8217;s emotional distress acts as a trigger for M, leading to her own emotional dysregulation&#8230; at times of stress M is likely to have difficulty in meeting X&#8217;s emotional needs</span>&#8217;.</p>

This was undoubtedly sub-optimal in increasing her levels of anxiety and stress and does not appear to accord with good practice when working with parents with learning difficulty.  It was claimed by Ms Watts that an advocate did not need to be present because it was M&#8217;s emotional interaction with X that was being observed and on the basis that it was a straightforward process.  This betrayed Ms Watts&#8217; lack of experience, knowledge and understanding of how to work with such parents.</p>

Notably, X was rapidly comforted and settled down on being physically held and reassured by M after this exercise.  She was criticised for being unable to soothe him by words alone.  It remains unclear to me why touch was excluded here and M expected to interact with X solely with words.  This discriminates in favour of carers who are more adept at or more often use verbal expression with their child, and it may have serious and discriminatory implications for carers whose methods of interacting with their child may understandably include more physical interaction.</p>

The refusal to acknowledge or explore adequately the progression or improvement in M&#8217;s behaviour and presentation meant that this highly relevant information was not properly considered either within their report or by Dr Lamb in her oral evidence.

Its methodology was inadequate to the complexity and issues of this case.  Its approach was narrow and appeared prejudiced by the history rather than open to the developments.  It is not Ms Watts&#8217; nor Dr Heap&#8217;s fault, but Ms Watts should never have been given this particularly complex task.  It should have been far more of a true multi-disciplinary exercise, with far greater care taken over proper planning, observation, analysis, recording and supervision, and where adequately experienced and trained individuals properly shared the task of carefully obtaining and interrogating the assessment data.</p>

It is clear she relied on what she was being told by Ms Watts or that Ms Watts had written in her drafted sections of the report, and to some significant extent simply adopted it.  Dr Lamb never met M as part of the assessment.  The documentation of the supervision and team meetings do not reveal any adequate analysis or interrogation of the raw observations made by Ms Watts and did not demonstrate any adequate exercise that would address the concerns relating to her role in the assessment.  I do not see how inadequately documented arms-length supervision, particularly where the interviewing social worker was inexperienced and lacked adequate specialist training and in the absence of detailed notes, could do so.</p>

I note that M has been doing her very best to work hard in meeting the expectations of professionals, and to meet X&#8217;s needs and develop her own abilities to enable her to continue meeting those needs, and to seek appropriate help and support along the way.  It will be important that she continues to make the right choices, attend all the appointments, seek out and accept any further help and avoid falling back into old patterns.  Importantly, she has shown during the recent course of these proceedings this summer that she can undertake therapeutic work alongside maintaining good enough care for X.   She has shown she can work well with her advocate, her family support worker, her mental health professional, her GP, her therapist and the social worker.</p>

The social worker has identified that M has been appropriately open and accepting of advice.  This will require careful management and support, with the assistance available under the Supervision Order, to help M prioritise X&#8217;s care and her own mental well-being and capabilities.</p>

I am satisfied that the care plan is appropriate and helpful.  It provides for a wide range of advice, assistance and befriending of this family.  M and X will be supported by a family support worker, Schema therapy and Theraplay work, as has been advised by the experts.  Contact with siblings is appropriately included as and will require sensitive management.  Contact with F is proposed at twice yearly once risk assessed, albeit he is not currently wishing to have contact. This will all be kept under regular review.   I have been impressed at the social work team&#8217;s ability to adapt and look afresh at each stage of this difficult case and I am confident that they will do their best to continue to support X and to support M in caring for him.   </p>

However, he will undoubtedly benefit from being brought up by his own mother so long as she can maintain the progress and engagement she has shown in these proceedings.  The effect of granting the Supervision Order with this plan will be to provide X with support to remain well and safely cared for by his M, and to minimise the identified risks.  It provides a statutory and social work framework for that advice, support and assistance, from which X and M have already begun to benefit, alongside ongoing monitoring and review.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.31in">I have considered other orders, and in particular a Special Guardianship Order with his paternal aunt, a care order or making no order.  The Special Guardianship assessment was positive, but no party is advocating that this is now the right course for X.   He currently has no active relationship with his paternal aunt, and there are historic tensions between her and M and between her and some of X&#8217;s older siblings whom she cared for.  I note that it would prevent X being brought up in foster care and would permit family links to be maintained, albeit not without friction and difficulty.  His attachments would be disrupted and would have to be refocussed on an unknown family member.  A care order would grant the LA parental responsibility, but with X living at home and where M is currently co-operative and welcoming of social work support and input.  There would be considerable local authority input, albeit that is already anticipated under the Supervision Order, but with the added tension of shared parental responsibility and higher intervention under statutory frameworks that run beyond that which is considered necessary.  Neither of these orders appear to be better suited to meeting X&#8217;s needs than the agreed plan.  The former would not meet X&#8217;s emotional needs, and the latter represents too heavy and unjustified an intervention in the current circumstances.</p>

It would be harmful to X not to grant the Supervision Order that underpins the important provisions set out in the plan, and it is clearly in his interests to do so and appropriate to put as much as possible in place to support M&#8217;s care of him.  This will also enable M to be assisted in dealing with any challenges to her progress, and with the additional complications that might arise in the wider family and when F is released. A period of 12 months is the longest period that can be granted at this stage and is clearly appropriate in the circumstances of this family.</p>
