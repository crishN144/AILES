Or said she did.  She told staff in the Accident &amp; Emergency Department she was taken to that she wanted to kill herself.  In its barest essentials, this is what has triggered the application before the court today: that the High Court should set aside its own summary return order made pursuant to the Hague Convention 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.</p>

On 8 March the father's solicitors informed the mother's solicitors that the mirror order in South Africa that the court had directed had now been obtained.  At that point, ST&#8217;s solicitors - this was a month after the February judgment - first stated an intention to set aside the judgment of the court.   It is argued on the mother&#8217;s behalf that this event, and her mental health state after it, constitute a fundamental change of circumstances.  This is particularly so when combined with further information from her brother in South Africa that she cannot live with him there because of an irretrievable breakdown in their relationship.  </p>

But then ST took matters into her own hands.  She wrongfully retained him, as this court has found.  That said, she vigorously contested the return of her child to South Africa and mounted various &#8220;defences&#8221; to the father&#8217;s Hague application.  Those exceptions were under Article 13(1)(b).  First, that CC would be exposed to the grave risk of psychological harm should he be returned to South Africa because of his mother&#8217;s mental health condition.  Second, that consequently he would be placed in an intolerable situation.  She failed to prove either exception and the court ordered his return forthwith in accordance with the purpose and objects of the Hague Convention.  That was on 8 February.  Later that evening, she left CC at home with his grandmother and went for a walk on her own.  What happened thereafter is at the crux of this application.</p>

She reports two previous overdoses in 2003 and 2013, that she took with the intention of ending her life.  She has a five-year-old son who lives with her and her mother.

However, I proceed on the basis that she did consume her prescribed medication in excessive amount.  It is this action by her that is said to indicate her psychological instability and therefore, if returned to South Africa, the reason she would expose her son to the grave risk of psychological harm.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Stepping back, the court is asked to reverse what it has previously decided.  It is not because what was decided was legally or procedurally wrong.  Equally, this is not judicial review-type scrutiny.  The available power is triggered by one thing: the facts have changed.  But not every factual change is sufficient.  It must be fundamental.  I will come to what I understand that to mean shortly, but it involves in itself a finding of fact.  The reason is that it is preferrable as a matter of principle for the court which made the original findings of fact, and which determined the return order, to decide itself if the facts have changed sufficiently to require a reassessment of its own substantive decision.

He stated that the mother had been diagnosed as suffering from an episode of acute stress reaction and a background of mixed anxiety depressive disorder.  The aforementioned state could impair the patient's day-to-day functioning.  The cause of such mental health conditions cannot be identified clearly and are considered a combination of biological, psychological and environmental factors.  The mother was offered support, ISS offering home-based treatment 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Mother's anti-depressant medication was increased to 200 mg per day.  It was recorded in the clinical notes that her son, CC, is identified as a strong protective factor, and that can potentially help reduce the suicidal tendencies of ST.    The mother received the support of her family when experiencing mental health difficulties, and the overall the family is identified as a stabilising factor for her mental health.  The prognosis and recovery cannot be predicted accurately and engaging with mental health services and being adherent to professional advice and recommendations can potentially reduce the risks of further deterioration in her mental health and support the recovery process.  </p>

Indeed, anyone in her situation would struggle with their mental health because of the ramifications.  Most of us, he said, will experience an adjustment disorder at some point in life.  It is, he says, very common and he told the court that 75 per cent of people between the ages of 15 and 25 experience it.  The stress we are seeing in the mother and the anxiety is what he would see, he says, in most individual who either did or did not have her particular psychological factors if placed in her situation.  Therefore, her reaction is less manifestation of her underlying psychological structure and more a reflection of her predicament in these proceedings. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Adjustment disorders are linked to adverse life events or disappointments, and of course life is full of disappointments.  But these are reactions to what he called abnormal life events, not catastrophic life events that can cause the much more serious condition of post-traumatic stress disorder.  By comparison to that, he regarded this as mild.  Her taking of medication in February was not, he concluded, her trying to end her life.  It was, instead, her expressing distress.  He said he reached that conclusion because people who actually do want to kill themselves and are in fact suicidal do not call for help.  Here, it is worthy of note, that there has been, after the previous court hearing, a number of telephone calls to Dr Fragos to get him to change what was noted on the original and contemporaneous medical records that it was the mother who called the ambulance.  It is not the function of this court to reach findings of fact about everything, but the court must take into account the prevailing circumstances in order to reach a decision about whether or not there has been a fundamental change in circumstances.  I make it plain that I do not consider that the subsequent special pleadings that there should be a change to the contemporaneous records are persuasive.  It strikes me that they are self-serving and the court prefers to proceed on the basis of the contemporaneous records.  They are far more likely to be true.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">What Dr Chahl said was this:  "People who seek help are not hoping to die but hoping somebody intervenes."  Indeed, if somebody seeks help it is a critical factor in assessing the level of future risk, and the risk is lower if somebody has sought help because it is in the hope that somebody will step in to assist them.  Therefore, he assesses the risk that ST presents of self-harm and suicide as mild to moderate. But he does not think that the consumption of the medication on 8 February was in fact a suicide attempt.  He stated that by taking the medication she had "upped the ante".  He could not say whether that was a conscious or unconscious attempt to escalate.  It might have been a conscious attempt, but he concluded that it could be "an act of avoidance of what she was due to face" which is the court order that her son must return to South Africa.  It was, he thought, "demonstrating distress" because her wish is not to return to South Africa.  There have been no other subsequent attempts by ST to harm herself, or indeed to attempt suicide.  I accept Dr Chahl's evidence that this was not an attempted suicide. </p>

The current stressor is the legal proceedings for her son to return to South Africa.  He cannot "truly" comment whether she is or would be emotionally available to her son.  During the course of his testimony, he did make some comments about it, but he clarified the position that this is not his expertise and it would need a dedicated expert parenting assessment in order to reach those conclusions.  He said explicitly that such assessments are outside and beyond his expertise.  He said that if there were a return to South Africa, in the short-term the risk that she would present would go up.  That is because it would be against her wishes, but risk would start to decline after the return. </p>

It is a testament to the balance of Dr Chahl that he sounded a note of caution about this.  He says these forms are useful for directing and signposting patients to appropriate support.  They are essentially a box-ticking exercise. There is no narrative, but it does say that the son is a protective factor.  CC&#8217;s presence reduces the risk that she would hurt herself or try to kill herself. Nobody has suggested that ST is a risk to CC and, as Dr Chahl says, knowing the diligence of the medical services in the county in which ST resides, if there was a risk to CC they would have referred him to social services. They have not done so.  So it is not being suggested that currently she is presenting a risk to her son or indeed has done.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The court asked the doctor some questions.  He said that an adjustment disorder tends to be mild compared to severe mental health disorders.  Most people fully recover without any treatment.  These people go on to live normal lives.  Mostly they are treated by GPs and in this case, ST could be treated in South Africa by a GP.  Once the stressor of legal proceedings is lifted, the condition should not have a long-term consequence for her mental health and prognosis.  Her vulnerability factors are not significant in her presentation and situation.  A significant number of people will present as she has to this kind of stress about having to return against her will to another country.  The risk of self-harm to her if she returns to South Africa remains in the mild to moderate range.  He said that he had come across her type of behaviour before.  That is behaviour "upping the ante" as he put it.  These are deliberate acts to achieve an outcome.  Somebody who talks, for example, to clinicians about self-harm and suicide to get admitted to hospital.  Somebody with a personality disorder who does not want to be discharged from hospital may do the same and talk about hurting themselves or committing suicide.  He said:  "I cannot say she is doing it deliberately, but we cannot ignore the timeline.  This may have played a part and this why we are having this hearing today."  That is on 14 April.  She has chosen to act in a particular way.  Either this was a deliberate act to achieve a strategic outcome or it was a compulsive one or it was a combination of the two.  This could be, he judged, an avoidant act.  At some point she has to take responsibility.  She has full mental capacity.  This taking of medication does not sound to him like an attempted suicide.  </p>

Her solicitors had made a C2 application on 29 April of this year to adduce the material that I have spoken about.  There was an amended report from Dr Fragos.  There were pages of WhatsApp material and messages and records.  There was the patient print-out record from 21 March 2021 to 28 April 2022.  The most significant point about it and the point that is relied upon in Mr Jarman's position statement is the GP notes revealed that on 26 April the mother was subject to "a fast-track referral for suspected breast cancer".  In his careful position statement Mr Jarman relies upon nothing else in the new material aside from that.  Ms Ramsahoye, shortly before the court delivered its judgment, made not so much a complaint but a reasonable observation that she had not had an opportunity to address this material in her position statement.  But parties agreed that the most important feature was this particular referral for investigation of suspected breast cancer. </p>

But notwithstanding that frustration on behalf of the father, I have to consider as accurately as I can the situation that his CC is likely to face on return to South Africa if the court persists with that order.

I do not accept the criticism of Dr Chahl by the mother that his evidence is undermined by his not having seen her for the purposes of his addendum report.  He was not asked to do so.  The mother's legal team could have made that request; they did not.  Indeed, they previously approached him in an authorised fashion to ask him further questions.  That was the subject of considerable criticism by Ms Ramsahoye earlier in proceedings.  Nevertheless, it demonstrates that ST's legal team are not reticent in seeking to approach Dr Chahl.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In his February report, Dr Chahl concluded that there will be "a slight worsening" in ST&#8217;s overall mental state on return to South Africa.  It is submitted on her behalf that she has had an "acute stress reaction" to the 8 February judgment.  This assertion is supported by the report of Dr Fragos and the medical documents he has referred to.  But one must be clear.  What is an acute stress reaction?  As Dr Chahl stated, it is closely related and akin to an adjustment disorder.  That diagnosis has not changed.  What has changed is that ST is unhappy, perhaps deeply unhappy, with the judgment of the court.  She did not want to go back to South Africa.  She has been tearful, exhausted and has had flat mood and presentation. She states that she has no appetite and poor sleep.  The latter are, of course, self-reports, but on the assumption they are true, the court has carefully assessed the consequences.  She reports she wanted to end her life when she took the medication on 8 February.   Dr Chahl doubts this was the case.  She called for medical assistance when she felt unwell from the medication.  She has sought to deny it.  Dr Chahl confirms that such seeking help is unlikely to be the act of somebody who genuinely wishes to end her life.  I prefer Dr Chahl's evidence.  It is supported by the fact that the mother has not taken another "overdose", if overdose it was on 8 February.  These were anxiety medications, as Dr Chahl points out, not much more dangerous drugs like, for example, common paracetamol, an overdose of which can easily lead to very serious consequences rapidly.  She has reported she might repeat her self-destructive acts.  She has not.  She reported to clinicians she might try to end her life another way.  She has not.  She has reported that she has thought of cutting her wrists.  She has not.  It appears that there is no evidence of subsequent self-harm in this way or indeed any other way whatsoever.  This is an important context.  </p>

Sometimes her mood is elevated and much better, such as on 27 February when she was found in a bright mood on the phone to services.  On 1 March she appeared "warm and welcoming" and had good eye contact.  Some of this is exactly as would be expected by Dr Chahl's diagnosis.   This pattern may continue in South Africa, but her overall mental state is likely to improve.  Adjustment orders are about adjusting to a life situation and find it hard to do so.  As Dr Chahl said, for the purposes of the previous judgment, the best thing that can happen &#8220;is time&#8221;.  The thrust of his evidence is that in time after her return she will adjust.  As he previously stated, time to adjust is the best expedient.  He believed the improvement would occur over a period of approximately 3-6 months, although he could not be precise.  </p>

There is no independent evidence to confirm that if she goes back to South Africa, she is likely to be unavailable to her son emotionally.  Indeed, her son is a protective factor reducing the risk to her.  There is no suggestion that she would be returned to South Africa without him, despite what she might have conveyed to professionals in this country. The question is whether or not he must go back to South Africa for the purposes of the Hague Convention application, the court having made a regular judgment about it.  Nobody is suggesting that should she wish to go back to South Africa that she would not be living with her son.  Equally, it is not correct that she will only have accommodation for 3 months.  The father has offered accommodation for 12 months. </p>

It will, in any event, according to Dr Chahl, remain within the moderate range. The doctor concluded that she did not try to kill herself in February.  She has not attempted other acts of self-harm subsequently. He assessed that the risk of "misadventure" is low. </p>

This is a referral for investigation.  There is no suggestion that mother could not receive appropriate investigation or treatment in South Africa, and this is not something the court should speculate about.  In any event, the package of protective measures that QR has put in front of the court should be repeated.  An extended duration of extra maintenance for 12 months; a car for six months; health insurance and a health care professional to provide therapeutic support.  Previous authority makes it clear that when the court is assessing these important issues, it is vital to have an understanding of the steps that can mitigate the risks that have been identified.  QR has put a very substantial package of protective measures in front of the court and given undertakings that these will be there to support ST and therefore, indirectly, reduce the risk to his son.  Dr Chahl's opinion is that ST&#8217;s anxiety and depression symptoms could be managed by a GP in South Africa.  This is not a severe nor enduring mental health history, as he put it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I therefore draw the strands together.  I start with the new evidence.  I do not consider that it materially changes the picture in respect of ST.  She has not been diagnosed with cancer.  She has been referred for investigation.  That is very different.  I proceed on the basis that it may increase her level of stress, but absent any confirmation I do not consider that it makes a significant difference to any of the assessments about her psychological state.  That said, I accept Mr Jarman's submission that the court now has "a much broader and more detailed picture of the mother's mental health".  She did experience an acute stress reaction to the court's return order judgment of 8 February. Her prescription medication has been doubled.  Her mood is generally flat, but not always so.  She has reported suicidal ideations at times to clinicians, but I accept the evidence of Dr Chahl that the 8 February incident was not a suicide attempt.  If mother returns to South Africa with her son, her distress will increase in the immediate short-term.  That is because she just does not want this to happen, but I also accept the evidence of Dr Chahl that the distress and anxiety will decline as she adjusts to life back in South Africa where she has lived most of her life, and CC also has lived most of his life. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">What the court concludes is this:  ST is going to have accommodation for 12 months provided by QR, should she want it.  She could, I am perfectly satisfied, live with her brother again should she want it.  She has options.  Thereafter, I am perfectly satisfied that she will be able to return to life in South Africa.  Her psychological position has not materially changed since the court handed down its judgment of 8 February.  I accept the careful evidence of an eminent psychiatrist, Dr Chahl.  It is significant that immediately after taking an excess of antidepressant medication she called for medical assistance.  It is significant she has not attempted to seriously harm herself in any other way.  However, regrettably, what she hopes is that what she has done is sufficient to set aside the court's previous judgment.  I do not find, therefore, that there has been a change in her medical health and psychological position. I am satisfied that this has been instead a carefully veiled exercise in trying to reopen and reargue this case.   That is emphatically not any criticism of Mr Jarman who has performed his professional duties impeccably, but I am quite satisfied that the mother is determined to frustrate the return order of the court.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">Time is unquestionably of the essence in child abduction cases. This is to prevent the harm of retention away from the child&#8217;s habitual residence.  Indeed, judicial authorities have a duty to act with due expedition: see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CACA 1985</ref>, Schedule 1, Art 11.  Nevertheless, the court must balance expedition with fair hearing rights and due process.  Therefore, on 15 November, the court granted the application to adjourn proceedings for an assessment of Ms ST&#8217;s mental health.  In the first instance, the hearing was adjourned to 19 November.  On that date, Ms ST made a successful Part 25 application for a psychiatric expert.  Permission was granted to instruct consultant psychiatrist Dr Chahl.  His report was filed with the court on 18 January 2022. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">On 28 January 2022, the mother&#8217;s solicitors sent the doctor a list of eleven further questions.  They also provided him with evidence.  First, there was a standalone JPEG image entitled &#8220;One page of medical records received on 21 January 2021&#8221;.  Second, a letter to Dr Chahl setting out a list of the mother&#8217;s current mediation and a screenshot from her doctor&#8217;s portal.  Third, there was a Word document with the list of the medication.  There was not any confirmation of who prepared this list.  Last, there was a patient summary record.  None of this was done either with the permission of the court or notice to the other party, let alone with the other party&#8217;s consent.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">Dr Chahl is a single joint expert.  On behalf of Mr QR, serious criticism is made of this unilateral approach to Dr Chahl.  It was said to be an attempt to persuade him to change his conclusion rather than the seeking of clarification.  In any event, Dr Chahl provided his answers in a letter dated 1 February 2022.  Nothing that was sent to him caused him to change his diagnosis or prognosis. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">The matter was relisted for a final hearing and two days were set aside.  The case came on for hearing on Monday 7 February 2022.  On that day the court received submissions from counsel.  Without objection, the hearing was conducted using the MS Teams remote video platform.  That of course enabled Mr QR to join from South Africa.  Remote hearings do have several undoubted advantages.  That said, there was no conceivable curtailment of the Art 6 ECHR rights of parties, since by agreement no oral evidence was to be called.  The second day was 8 February, when the court indicated it would hand down its judgment.  That is today.  </p>
