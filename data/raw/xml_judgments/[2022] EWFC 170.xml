Moreover, all of the parties are agreed that if it were possible, the best order for K would be by way of a care order, and that that would meet her welfare interests (which, of course, is the paramount factor which the Court must take into account).  </span></p>

I am told that the matter was raised before HHJ Bedford, who identified the issue of whether the threshold might be met in relation to the risk of future harm, and who listed the matter for a hearing before himself.  Unfortunately, he has not been able to sit today.  The matter has been listed before myself for an issues resolution hearing/early final hearing, but also to deal with this crucial issue of threshold.</span></p>

In accordance with that position, the Local&#160;Authority has advanced an alternative case; that is, that the Court should make K a Ward&#160;of&#160;Court, and there was a formal application from the Local&#160;Authority to that effect.  Nevertheless, the position of all of the advocates was that if the Court does not agree with their interpretation of the law as applied to the facts in this case, then that would not be something with which they would take significant issue; indeed they (and particularly the children&#8217;s guardian) would welcome the orders which the Court could then make.</span></p>

I have three highly experienced counsel before me, who all agree on the approach which the Court should take.  In those circumstances, it is with some caution that I have reached the conclusion that their interpretation of the legal position in this case is not correct, and I have concluded that threshold is indeed met in this case.  That is despite the skilful submissions made by all of the advocates - in particular by Ms Troy, on behalf of the Local&#160;Authority, who took the lead.  </span></p>

They are tragic.  K&#8217;s father died when she was two.  Throughout the whole of her life, she was cared for by her mother.  There is nothing in the documentation to suggest that the mother&#8217;s parenting was poor, or that K suffered from harm in the mother&#8217;s care.  Further, no party suggests that there was anything in the history which would or could cross the threshold for making public law orders.  </span></p>

She has been left with minimal abilities; she requires 24/7 care; she has very limited cognition and understanding; and she lacks capacity to litigate or make any decisions about her own welfare.  It is agreed that she lacks capacity and is not able to make any decisions about her child&#8217;s welfare, and cannot exercise any parental responsibility for her on a practical basis.  In those circumstances, all decision-making is made by others and she has no input into it.  Further, it is agreed that she does not have capacity to provide agreement under section&#160;20 for K to stay in Local&#160;Authority accommodation.  </span></p>

It is set out in the position statement filed by Ms Hancock on behalf of the mother.  It is an interim threshold.  I understand why it has remained an interim threshold, given the position of all the parties, but it is clearly not appropriate for final orders.  Ms Troy, on behalf of the Local&#160;Authority, agreed with me today that it could be reduced to a single short paragraph -  that is, that the mother suffered a sudden and catastrophic brain haemorrhage on 17&#160;November&#160;2021, that she is not able to provide any care at all for her daughter, that she is not able to make any decisions on her behalf or exercise her parental responsibility for her.  Also, that there are no other persons available who would provide that care.</span></p>

That of course is a different position, but it illustrates, in my judgment, that there may be a number of ways in which parents may not be able to exercise care which it is &#8220;reasonable for a parent to give&#8221; in the future (or ways which would present a risk of significant harm to a child), even if they had not failed to do so in the past.  </span></p>

When she learned of that (and of the fact that she was not going to be able to care properly for her children), she made a number of appropriate and correct decisions.  It is quite clear, as Mr Justice Keehan set out, that she exercised her parental responsibility in the best possible way.  In those circumstances, it is not at all surprising that he reached the view that the fact the mother was terminally ill did not deprive her of the right as a parent to make decisions about the children&#8217;s welfare, where they should live, and to make decisions about with whom they live in the future.  Nor is it surprising that he reached the conclusion that the state, in the person of the Local&#160;Authority, should not be entitled to interfere with the mother&#8217;s or the children&#8217;s right to respect for family life.  In short, while the mother was not able to provide physical care, she was able to make proper decisions and appropriate decisions, and exercise her parental responsibility for the children, as do many parents with disabilities up and down the land.</span></p>

The second of them is misconceived: for there is no requisite mental element to accompany the actions or inactions which have caused, or are likely to cause, significant harm to the child.  Section 31(2)(b)(i) requires only that the harm or likelihood of harm should be &#8216;attributable&#8217; to the care given or likely to be given to the child not being what it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give to him.  Such is a requirement only of causation as between the care and the harm.  The provision was prefigured in the White Paper, Cm 62, cited above, also at para 60</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8221;.</span></p>

Family practitioners are well used to the fact that in the family courts, we often see parents who are not blameworthy.  The fact that they are not able to provide safe and adequate care may be for a variety of reasons but should not of itself reflect blame on their part.  Rather, s31 recognises that in some cases where the children&#8217;s needs are not going to be met by a parent, then the state may need to intervene to ensure that those needs are met.  </span></p>

I have already noted that there may well be situations where a parent is disabled and unable to provide day to day care for a child, but is able to exercise parental responsibility and make decisions, and that in those cases, threshold will often not be crossed, such as in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">LCC v AB</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">.  There will also be cases where the other family members are able to step in, and where it would be clearly inappropriate for the Local Authority to take public law steps.  There are also likely to be cases where other provision can be made which will look after the child&#8217;s safety (for instance, pursuant to the duties of a local authority under section&#160;20) which would obviate the need for an application to the court.  </span></p>

Of course, that mirrors the judgment of Lord Wilson, which I set out a moment ago, which advises the Court to concentrate on the wording of the Act.

The fact of the matter is that if there was no intervention and an order was not made, this is a child who would not have the care from a parent which it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give.  The reason for that is that the mother just cannot provide it, through no fault of her own.  Equally, in my judgment it is highly likely that as a result of her mother&#8217;s incapacity (and, hence, her inability to provide the care which it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give), K would be likely to suffer significant harm in the future if an order were not made.  Indeed, no party submitted that she would not be at risk of significant harm in these circumstances.</span></p>

Nevertheless, I do accept the submissions of the parties that most of the cases which have been before the Court involve children who are beyond parental control in that their behaviour is of concern in some way (whatever the cause of this), and not purely because of the inability of a parent to care for them.  If it were otherwise, there would be a risk of conflating the two limbs of section&#160;31.  Those are separate tests, and I accept the submissions made to the court that while the cause of the child being beyond parental control may not need to be established, it should be established that the child is presenting in some way which is &#8220;beyond control&#8221;.  What would qualify for this would be for another court on another day.  However, in this case, there is no suggestion that the child is presenting in that way.  If I had had to decide the matter (and recognising the limitations of the court not having heard arguments to the contrary), I would have accepted the submissions of the parties in relation to the second limb.  </span></p>

This is a young person who has been through a torrid, difficult, and traumatic time.  She has her own significant difficulties.  Unfortunately, for various reasons, her family are not able to provide the support that she needs, and she needs the intervention of the Local&#160;Authority.  The best place for her, as agreed by everyone, is in a foster placement.  In my judgment, it is vital that the Local&#160;Authority share parental responsibility so that there is in fact someone who is able to exercise parental responsibility, and so that K can be looked after appropriately.</span></p>
