	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">On 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2010 I gave permission to the local authority to withdraw care proceedings in relation to a child A born on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2009. With the consent of all parties, I reserved my reasons indicating that I intended to adjourn their delivery into open court since it appeared to me that it was in the public interest that the reasons should be given in public. It remains, of course, the case that no reporting is permitted which may reasonably have the effect of identifying this child or his family. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">A was born on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2009. From birth he has suffered from a very severe neurodevelopmental and neuromuscular disorder resulting in both complex and demanding care needs. The disorder has never been satisfactorily diagnosed. His care needs have been met essentially by his parents, assisted within the extended family and supplemented by substantial medical and other professional input. The evidence yields testimony to the skill and commitment of A&#8217;s parents to his care. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">These proceedings came about as a result of a scan in January 2010 which, it is now accepted, demonstrated fractures of the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> ribs on the right side, the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> rib on the left side and (very unusually) bilateral acromial fractures. Since no explanation was forthcoming for these injuries, the working diagnosis was that they were inflicted and care proceedings were instituted. A has, however, remained with his parents without any statutory order in place, for some time with 24 hour supervision which more recently has been significantly reduced. The preponderance of the medical evidence places the happening of those fractures between 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2009 and 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2010 though Dr. Calder would allow them to be a week or so older. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">No explanation has ever been forthcoming for these fractures. The distinguished paediatrician Professor David was jointly instructed to provide an overview of the evidence. His view was that A had no underlying bone weakness or osteopaenia or rather that there was a real but only very small possibility of such. He could see &#8220;no plausible alternative&#8221; to a conclusion that the rib fractures were caused by an episode (or episodes) of squeezing of the chest. The same mechanism is postulated for the acromial fractures. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_5">
	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In the end all parties accepted (or did not contest) that these fractures must have been caused by a squeezing of the chest in the course of the care of this child. Of course, no-one sought to suggest otherwise than that the infliction of these injuries amounted to significant harm. There were, however, two major qualifications in Professor David&#8217;s report which are highly relevant to these proceedings for, during part of the relevant time frame, A was an in-patient in hospital. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Both qualifications flow from the well documented evidence that A was generally &#8220;massively irritable and hugely difficult to handle&#8221;. He needed to be swaddled to be fed or to pass a nasogastric tube so it was inevitable that greater than normal force would often be required in his care. The first qualification is that given his condition, the pain and discomfort attributable to a fracture would have been masked by his general irritability. Hence only the actual perpetrator of the injury would have any reason to suspect that the child had been injured. Any other carer would have no basis for suspecting any of the fractures found in this case. The second qualification appears in Paragraphs 153-161 of Professor David&#8217;s report. </p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0in">were caused other than by actual carers and that in reality meant the parents or hospital staff. It was a matter, said Professor David, that only the court could resolve. These two qualifications self-evidently present obstacles to proof in this case. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">It should also be added that the commitment of these parents to A is unquestioned and that the general standard and effect of the care given by them is admirable. In those circumstances, as alternative sources of care are considered, one can well understand the local authority&#8217;s feelings of ambivalence about these proceedings. In truth no-one sought (or could) suggest a viable alternative to care by his parents which would promote the welfare of this child. That was reinforced by the steady reduction in the supervision of their care and the recognition that such supervision was indeed not required. Accordingly it came as no surprise that the local authority should have made the application that in fact they did. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>

This was a case in which care was shared between the parents and a childminder; the child concerned suffered injury but it was not possible to decide by whom it was actually inflicted. The difficulties, the solution and the potential unfairness of that solution are set out in the speech of Lord Nicholls between p.589C and p.590F. They are accurately summarised in the headnote as follows - </p>

The court had to be satisfied that harm suffered by the child was attributable to &#8216;the care given to the child&#8217;. That phrase referred primarily to the care given by a parent or parents or other primary carers, but where care was shared the phrase was apt to embrace the care given by any of the carers. This interpretation was necessary to allow the court to intervene to protect a child who was clearly at risk, even though it was not possible to identify the source of the risk. It by no means followed that because the threshold conditions had been satisfied, the court would go on to make a care order, and when considering cases of this type, judges would keep firmly in mind, in the exercise of their discretionary powers, that the parents had not been shown to be responsible for the child&#8217;s injuries. The steps taken so far in this case had been those reasonably necessary to pursue the legitimate aim of protecting the child from further injury, which was an exception to the guarantee for respect for family life contained within the Convention.&#8221; </p>

The evidence clearly establishes that, had they not caused them, there was no basis at all for any allegation of failure to protect. It seems to me that the proper approach here is simply to apply the principles in R<span style="font-size:9.5pt">E </span>B<span style="font-size:9.5pt"/>[2008] (supra) and say that since it cannot be proved that these parents inflicted these injuries themselves, then the case must in future be managed on the basis that they did not do so. </p>

This is not a case where it can be shown that the injuries were caused whilst not in the care of their parents, in which case the threshold criteria could not be established. In this case, whether in hospital or, more particularly, at home, these parents were intimately concerned with the care of this child. It follows in my judgment that this case must come within the ambit of cases contemplated in the L<span style="font-size:9.5pt">ANCASHIRE</span> case (supra) with full recognition of the apparent unfairness to parents acknowledged by Lord Nicholls therein. I accordingly conclude that had this matter been tried out it was highly probable that the local authority would have established the threshold criteria as required by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 31(2)</ref>.

Equally he will remain within the purview of the medical authorities. Moreover his status and needs are not likely in these respects to change much over the next year or so. He needs the care of his parents and he will, without any order of the court, remain subject to professional oversight. The parents, notwithstanding the stresses of these proceedings, have shown themselves well able to work with professionals both from medical and social care. </p>

It is also in point to remember (as Lord Hoffman observed) that, no findings having been made, this case must now be managed on the basis that these parents do not present a risk to this child based on anything that may have happened in the past. </p>

It is important that the court&#8217;s conclusion that the threshold may have been crossed is not understood as implying criticism of the parents. Such a finding will of course usually do so but it is not inevitable having regard to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 31(2)</ref> as understood in the Lancashire case. It is not intended to do so here. On the contrary, the parents&#8217; fortitude in the face of the disabilities of their first child and the pressures of the proceedings and the scrutiny to which they have (properly) been subjected can only excite admiration. The same must be said of their ability to cooperate during his very difficult period. Moreover, I gave permission to withdraw not only because of the prospective outcome but because (insofar as the evidence went) I am entirely satisfied that it is in the interests of A that he is brought up by his parents without the compulsive intervention or supervision of the State. </p>
