The wife has been, for many years now, a mother and home-maker, having previously enjoyed a successful career.  The husband has enjoyed success as a company director; latterly, he was a CEO of a company which, four months ago, went into liquidation.  His sizeable income (at one time &#163;250,000 p.a.) dried up more or less overnight; he is now in receipt of job seeker&#8217;s allowance.

The proposed purchasers are keen to exchange and complete by the middle of next month. The husband is equally keen, apparently supported by the selling agents, and he wishes to accept the offer.  The wife opposes the sale at this stage, and at that price.  She now considers that the property should be retained for the next 18 months or more, while Q completes her education at the local school; she attaches importance to continuity for Q in being able to remain in the family home while she completes her A level exams.  She also considers that if the property sells at &#163;785,000 this will represent a sale at a significant undervalue. She proposes that until resolution of the financial remedy proceedings, she will take responsibility for the mortgage repayments on the property. This proposal was set out in a letter to the husband&#8217;s solicitors dated 16 October 2017.</p>

The wife&#8217;s solicitors had written into the court unsuccessfully seeking to vacate the hearing, as she could not, herself, be present; the hearing was not vacated, and no further application to adjourn was made.  </p>

The judgment was concise, reflecting the essential arguments of the parties and the judge&#8217;s reasoning.  The judge concluded that there was &#8220;good reason&#8221; why it is &#8220;desirable&#8221; to sell the property.  He specifically relied, in reaching his decision, on the fact that: (a) the parties had agreed some time ago that the property should be sold, (b) a sale would help to stem the significant outgoings, and go some way to preserve the family&#8217;s depleted funds, they having experienced a &#8220;dramatic downturn&#8221; in their fortunes by reason of the husband&#8217;s recent unemployment, (c) the property needed to be sold at some point, and the current offer &#8220;is the best that is likely to be received in the current and foreseeable climate&#8221;, and that (d) there were suitable alternative properties available for the parties to rent or purchase.  Following the judgment, he amplified his reasoning, referring also to the fact that the wife&#8217;s offer to pay the mortgage instalments for the time being was not of great benefit overall, as the expenditure would further diminish the parties&#8217; joint assets.</p>

Materially, he expanded his grounds in writing to this court to assert that the judge failed to recognise that the <span style="font-style:italic">FPR 2010</span> did not give him jurisdiction to terminate the wife&#8217;s rights of occupation of The Homestead.  Specifically, he argued, that an application under <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/33" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 33</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FLA 1996</ref></span> should have been made to determine the occupation rights of the wife, which could not be brought to an end by <span style="font-style:italic">rule 20.2(1)(c)(v)</span>; no such application had been made to the court below, and no consideration of this point was given by the judge.</p>

So, either way, the court fell into error in making the order sought by the husband.  Further and finally, he submitted that if an inferred or deemed application under the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FLA 1996</ref></span> could not &#8216;terminate&#8217; the wife&#8217;s rights of occupation (following a <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/33/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 33(6)</ref></span> &#8216;exercise&#8217; per Mostyn in <span style="font-style:italic">BR v VT</span>), he questioned how a procedural rule could achieve that end.</p>

Mostyn J saw no need for a specific application, on the basis that the court would make a &#8220;supplemental order&#8221; ([4]) to the order for sale, and the point was not apparently taken in <span style="font-style:italic">BR v VT</span> that there should have been an application before the court.

It is only then that the question arises as to whether the discretion to order the sale should be exercised. Of course, the existence of good reasons for an early sale is, itself, a strong factor in favour of making such an order, but there may be other factors which may need to be put in the balance on both sides. Additionally, even if, in principle, the court was minded to make the order, the mechanics of sale might themselves raise prejudice to the other party's position such as to make it inappropriate to make the order. In the end, the court must look at all the factors in the round and make its decision&#8221;.</p>

It is in principle much more desirable that an issue, as here, about sale of the home should be resolved within an application for ancillary relief. For there the court will undertake a holistic examination of all aspects of the parties' finances, needs, contributions etc; will devise the fairest set of arrangements for the future housing and finances of each of them; and, to that end, will provide for the transfer of capital, as well perhaps as for payment of future income, from one to the other. By an order under TOLATA, on the other hand, the court lays down only one piece of the jigsaw, namely that the home be sold, without its being able to survey the whole picture by laying down the others. So at this threshold stage of the inquiry into an application under TOLATA between spouses the court will, in particular, have regard to the question whether, within a time-frame tolerable in all the circumstances, the parties will become able to apply for ancillary relief. Furthermore if, at first sight, there appears to the court to be any measurable chance that, on an application for ancillary relief made within that time-frame, the respondent to the application for an order for sale under TOLATA will be able to preserve her or his occupation of the home by securing an outright transfer of ownership of it or a variation of the trust, it is hard to conceive that an order for sale would reflect a proper exercise of discretion&#8221;.</p>
