In summary, it is said that the mother suffers complex PTSD; she struggles to regulate her emotions and can present as violent and aggressive to others. Dr Vandenabeele indicates that the mother would present a risk to any child in her care and, for example, in times of stress, would be unable to prioritise the needs of a child.  Dr Mosher opined that the mother&#8217;s mistrust of professionals is such that she would struggle to engage openly and honestly with them and that the identified issues require further intensive work; nonetheless he offered some hope in his conclusion (which I reproduce in full, given its significance to the overall picture):</span></p>

She clearly has her issues, and it is evident that workers are going to need to expect ongoing conflict and frustration.  However, [the mother] has the intellect, the broad insight, and sufficient psychological stability overall to make changes and to be a good enough mother. It is clear that things like environmental stability will be necessary, as will effective engagement with workers. If these things are maintained, the ability to implement and sustain improvement is, in my view, there.  Mia&#8217;s timeframe is limited given his age, but I have optimism that the mother can change.

However, any application in the future may well be met by the argument that it is too late to change his forename and it would be too confusing to C to do so.

I also recognise that the names may provide C with an &#8220;important sense of 'belonging' which will be invaluable throughout his &#8230; life&#8221; (also at [40]).   The names &#8216;Mia Adonis&#8217; are among &#8220;the only lasting gift [he has] from her&#8221; (</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Re C</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> at [41]).  I further respect the fact that in this country parents have a significant freedom of choice in naming their children, and their choices may flow from any number of influences. There are few prescriptions imposed on this exercise by law, unlike for instance in I</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#222526;background-color:#FFFFFF">celand, where I understand that the registrar will only accept forenames chosen from a pre-agreed list [National Register of Persons] which is issued by the government.  Generally and rightly, authorities &#8211; and specifically the court &#8211; will only intervene when (as I have mentioned above) parents are thinking of choosing or have chosen names which go &#8220;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">beyond the unusual, bizarre, extreme or plain foolish&#8221; (</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Re C</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> at [105])</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#222526;background-color:#FFFFFF">.  </span></p>

However, the professionals do not support her wish to care for him, and she has effectively abandoned any aspiration in that regard; she wishes now to withdraw from the care proceedings, and effectively therefore from the important decision-making about his future care even though she is opposed to her son&#8217;s placement with his paternal grandmother and father.  The fact that she does not want to know the outcome of the name-change application suggests that she may be envisaging no, or no meaningful, relationship with him by contact either in the future.</span></p>
