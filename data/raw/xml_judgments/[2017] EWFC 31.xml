Little is known of the relationship between Ms A and Mr B; they do not currently reside together though they maintain contact.  They appear to have ended their intimate relationship some months before the birth of the twins.   The Local Authority have had cause to assess Ms A as a parent in the past, and she is demonstrably a good mother to her older child.  Ms A has indicated that she could not financially, or emotionally, cope with the care of one or more additional children.</p>

He maintains that he was, indeed, unaware of the birth of the twins until he was contacted by the Local Authority early in February 2017.  While he says that he had known that the mother had become pregnant in 2016, he had believed that the mother&#8217;s pregnancy had been terminated.  He no longer lives locally to the mother.  He has confirmed that he is not able or willing to care for the twins, because of his age and circumstances, and although he was initially opposed to the plan that they be placed for adoption, he has since indicated (having apparently discussed the matter with the mother) that he considers that this is the best outcome for the infants. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother concealed her pregnancy until only two weeks before the birth; she first contacted ante-natal medical professionals at her GP surgery when she was approximately 38+ weeks gestation.  In the days which followed, her engagement with midwifery and social care services was intermittent, though she attended punctually for the pre-planned delivery by caesarean section on the appointed day.  She made it known from the first contact with medical professionals that she wished for her baby/ies (initially she did not realise she was expecting twins), to be adopted.  Immediately following their birth, she requested for them to be placed in foster care, and signed the forms consenting to their accommodation under <span style="font-style:italic">section 20</span> of the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref></span>.  She later named the twins, and registered their birth in early December 2016, but has not seen them since the day of their birth.  She has largely avoided contact with professionals since the birth; on those occasions when she has been contacted, she has remained resolute that she wishes the twins to be adopted.  </p>

The mother has a sister with older children; the mother&#8217;s parents are reasonably believed to be in their mid-late 60s (possibly older).   It is not entirely clear to me whether Ms A&#8217;s parents are aware of the birth of the twins or not.  The social work evidence is inconsistent on this point, and it was not clarified satisfactorily at the hearing. The problem lies to some extent in the fact that the mother has not co-operated with invitations to discuss the situation and has not provided any addresses or contact details of the extended family members. </p>

I accept that position in general terms, but would urge local authorities in situations such as this not to delay in issuing proceedings, particularly where &#8211; as here &#8211; the children are not placed in an &#8216;Early Permanence Foster Placement&#8217;.

Given the low levels of engagement of the parents with professionals, I wished to satisfy myself that all appropriate steps had been taken to notify them that this was indeed the final hearing.  There has been periodic exchange of e-mail and other correspondence, which reassures me that the parents were kept abreast of the progress of the litigation.  I am satisfied that on 3 May 2017, the solicitor for the Local Authority sent to the parents a letter confirming that the Agency Decision Maker had ratified the plan for adoption, and containing the date of this hearing as the final hearing, urging them to obtain legal advice; the mother confirmed that the parents had indeed received the letter.  Other correspondence has confirmed the nature of the evidence before the court, and the decisions which need to be made.</p>

The fact that the parents have taken this decision is an important consideration when determining whether the interference is necessary and proportionate. It follows, therefore, that approval of adoption in such cases does not depend on the local authority or court reaching the conclusion that nothing else will do. Instead, they must approach the case by applying <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref> as set out above, making sure that they give paramount consideration to the child's welfare throughout his or her life and allocating such weight as they consider appropriate to the comprehensive list of factors in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1(4)</ref> In such cases, the local authority and the court must consider the parents' wishes that their child be adopted in the context of all of those factors, including the child's background, the likely effect on the child of having ceased to be a member of the original family and the ability and willingness of any of the child's relatives to meet the child's needs&#8221;.</p>
