	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in">The court is concerned with an application for a declaration of parentage pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/55" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 55</ref>A of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref> (&#8216;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FLA 1986</ref>&#8217;) in respect of the child, C. There is currently a child-arrangements order in place regulating the time he spends with the applicant (&#8216;M&#8217;) and first respondent (&#8216;W&#8217;). That order gives W parental responsibility.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in">C was conceived following IVF treatment at the Life Centre at Newcastle (&#8216;the Clinic&#8217;) with donor sperm. The transfer of embryos to M took place after the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008</ref> (&#8216;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref>&#8217;) came into effect at a time when M and W were in a same sex relationship and had been receiving treatment from the clinic for a number of years. M and W subsequently separated. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in">The issue has arisen as a result of an administrative error made by the Clinic at the time the family were treated. There is no evidence that M or W signed the prescribed HFEA forms (Forms WP and PP) but there is an Internal Consent form signed in March 2008 which may constitute the requisite notice to comply with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/43" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss43</ref> and 44 <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref>. The question is therefore whether the court can make a declaration that W is the legal parent of C on the basis of a form signed by M and W before the changes introduced under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref> which made it legally possible for W to be the parent of C from birth.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in">W and the Clinic are neutral in relation to the application, it is supported by the Children&#8217;s Guardian, on behalf of C, and although the Secretary of State for Health (&#8216;SSH&#8217;) left any factual matters to the court his position was that the requirement for consent in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/44" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 44</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref> did not require a consent form from a same-sex partner to have been signed after the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref> came into force. The SSH is an intervener, the Clinic participated in the proceedings and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (&#8216;HFEA&#8217;) were given notice of the application but did not seek to intervene or participate in the proceedings.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in">Issues concerning C&#8217;s legal parentage have arisen several times since M and W&#8217;s separation. M made an application for a maintenance assessment which was closed following W questioning whether she was a parent. An application for a child arrangements order concluded with an order for C to spent time with W, parental responsibility was granted on the basis that W was not a legal parent. Following this M made a further application to the CMS for a maintenance assessment in the light of the parental responsibility order, an assessment was made which W appealed. The Child Support Appeal First Tier tribunal has now adjourned the appeal pending determination of this application.</p>

In addition, there has been extensive disclosure of the medical records.  The Clinic have accepted that this is a case in which administrative error by them in relation to the non-completion and/or retention of up to date parenthood consent forms has arisen which has caused the uncertainty over legal parenthood regarding C. To their credit the Clinic accepted responsibility at an early stage, have funded M&#8217;s and W&#8217;s legal costs and Ms Gartland, on behalf of the Clinic, repeated at this hearing its sincere apologies for this situation, for which it accepts full responsibility.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Ms Allman tackles the issue as to whether the consent given in March 2008 is in any way invalidated by asserting the fact that at the time of giving it, it could not have been effective to achieve parentage for W in the following way. She relies upon what Munby P said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A and Others</span> at paragraph [60] in support of her submission that this court should be cautioned against finding that the consents given in this case are not capable of meeting the requirements of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/44" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 44</ref> by reason of some factor which has not been spelt out by Parliament.

An integral part of that identity can include who that person&#8217;s parents are. On one view this is more important for the child, as the status of individuals in relation to them will not only have an impact on their identity but may also be relevant in determining any obligations or rights that an individual and the child may have in relation to each other. This application for a declaration needs to be viewed in that important context.</p>

I suspect he is far more aware of the difficulties than either [M] or [W] would like to believe. I can see that the issue of legal parentage has continued to surface throughout the litigation after [M] and [W] separated and indeed in the maintenance case which is yet to conclude. [W] has made it clear through her representations that she is not C&#8217;s legal parents. It seems to me essential to resolve that particular uncertainty. Like any other child C needs the security of a lifelong legal relationship with both parents. Although it will not in itself resolve any future disputes, it will remove one obstacle to future resolution.&#8217;</span></p>

There is no issue that the written consents signed by M and W in March 2008 do this, save in one respect where it states that W agrees to being treated as the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;legal father&#8217;</span> of any resulting child. No issue is taken on the jurisdiction of this court to correct any erroneous wording by way of rectification, which would entail reading the consent to read <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;parent&#8217; </span>rather than<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8217;father&#8217;</span>. Having considered the evidence it is obvious on the face of the document that was a mistake, as earlier in that part of the form <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;husband&#8217;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"/>had been deleted and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;partner&#8217; </span>left in, and further down <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;Male&#8217;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"/>was crossed out and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;Female&#8217;</span> put in manuscript in its place.

There is no reference to timing, other than requiring them to be in writing and signed before the treatment took place. The legislation puts the emphasis on the written consent, which is ultimately determinative. The undisputed evidence in this case is that such consents were in place prior to the treatment taking place, they were in writing and signed. The provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/43" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss 43</ref> and 44 required no more. These sections do not prescribe a specific form or an earliest date, apart from the requirement for them to be in place before treatment took place. The wording of the Internal Consent forms in this case is not significantly different from that which was approved by Munby P in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A and Others </span>at paragraphs [30] and [31] and in <span style="font-style:italic">Re AL [2018] EWHC 1300 </span>at paragraph [11].
