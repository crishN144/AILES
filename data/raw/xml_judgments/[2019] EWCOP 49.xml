	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">On 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2019 I heard an application on behalf of Richard Bagguley, the Property and Affairs Deputy (The Deputy) for E, seeking authority for buccal cell samples to be taken from E for the purposes of DNA testing. The objective is to establish whether or not E is the father of each or any of three individuals D, P and A who are all adults. E is seventy-six years of age suffering from end stage severe dementia.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The application, presented by Ms Wood of counsel, was founded largely on the judgment of Sir Nicolas Wall (P) in <span style="font-weight:bold">LG v DK <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2011/2453" uk:canonical="[2011] EWCOP 2453" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] EWHC 2453 (COP)</ref></span>. It is clear from the judgment that the submissions in that case were advanced within very limited parameters and focused, somewhat counter intuitively, on the reach and applicability of the Family Law Act 1969 in the Court of Protection and more generally. Baker LJ also considered a similar application in <span style="font-weight:bold">DCC v NLH <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2019/9" uk:canonical="[2019] EWCOP 9" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] EWCOP 9</ref></span>. There the Court authorised the taking of bodily samples from an incapacitous adult to undertake DNA paternity testing. The question of jurisdiction was assumed but not addressed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">On 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2019, I was concerned that the facts of the case had not been identified with the basic degree of precision required to take informed decisions. In particular, I was not satisfied that the situation was so urgent that representation of E by the Official Solicitor (OS) could be dispensed with. Nor was I confident that the case law, as it stood, had addressed the question of jurisdiction with sufficient breadth.  </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I gave a short ex tempore judgment on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2019, one of the objectives of which was to identify the issues and to summarise the available information. I invited Ms Sarah Castle, the Official Solicitor, to consider the transcript of my ex tempore judgment, with a view to enlisting her assistance on both the welfare issues and the jurisdictional framework. Both she and I were unclear as to how urgent the need for the decision was and accordingly, both of us have acted on the basis that time was pressing. Hence, the case returned to me four days later, on my direction. In fact, as more material has become available it is clear that E&#8217;s life expectancy is greater than first understood. The OS instructed leading counsel, Mr David Rees QC, who has very quickly been able to produce a helpful and erudite summary of the applicable law. Mr Rees&#8217;s submissions reveal my hesitation in respect of the reach of the Family Law Act 1969 to have been well founded. Ms Wood, who again appears on behalf of the Applicant, accepts and adopts Mr Rees&#8217;s analysis of the law. She is, in my judgement, correct to do so. </p>

I am satisfied, on compelling evidence, that E lacks either the capacity to respond to this application or, more broadly, to participate in litigation.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">It perhaps requires to be mentioned that the MCA had only been in force for four years by 2011. The caselaw and the underpinning philosophy of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/46" uk:canonical="1969 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> had both to evolve and to be better understood. Argument before Sir Nicholas Wall did not anticipate the flexibility and scope of the MCA. In the cases that followed, the Courts have re-emphasised, with greater clarity, the importance and ambit of the Court&#8217;s declaratory jurisdiction under Sec 15 <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> but also its more extensive decisionmaking powers, conferred by Sec 16 MCA.

There is one other aspect of the &#8220;best interests&#8221; test that I must consider. In deciding what provision should be made in a will to be executed on P&#8217;s behalf and which, ex hypothesi, will only have effect after he is dead, what are P&#8217;s best interests? Mr Boyle stressed the principle of adult autonomy; and said that P&#8217;s best interests would be served simply by giving effect to his wishes. That is, I think, part of the overall picture, and an important one at that. But what will live on after P&#8217;s death is his memory; and for many people it is in their best interests that they be remembered with affection by their family and as having done &#8220;the right thing&#8221; by their will. In my judgment the decision-maker is entitled to take into account, in assessing what is in P&#8217;s best interests, how he will be remembered after his death.&#8217; </span></p>

But the weight to be given to it will depend upon the circumstances under which it was prepared; and if it were clearly to be demonstrated that it was made at a time when the protected person lacked capacity, no weight at all should be accorded to it. Moreover, Parliament has rejected the &#8220;substituted judgment&#8221; test in favour of the objective test as to what would be in the protected person&#8217;s best interests. Given the importance attached by the court to the protected person being remembered for having done the &#8220;right thing&#8221; by his will, it is open to the court, in an appropriate case, to decide that the &#8220;right thing&#8221; to do, in the protected person&#8217;s best interests, is to order the execution of a statutory will, rather than to leave him to be remembered for having bequeathed a contentious probate dispute to his relatives and the beneficiaries named in a disputed will. I therefore hold that the Court of Protection should not refrain, as a matter of principle, from directing the execution of a statutory will in any case where the validity of an earlier will is in dispute. However, the existence and nature of the dispute, and the ability of the Court of Protection to investigate the issues which underlie it, are clearly relevant factors to be taken into account when deciding whether, overall, it is in the protected person&#8217;s best interests to order the execution of a statutory</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">will</span>.

Mr Rees submits that the advantage of adopting this approach is that any decision made by the Court, on E&#8217;s behalf, pursuant to Sec 16 <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>, should be capable of taking effect as &#8216;qualifying consent&#8217; for the purposes of para 2, Schedule 4, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/30" uk:canonical="2004 c. 30" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Tissue Act 2004</ref> (HTA) or as &#8216;appropriate consent&#8217; for the purposes of Sec 1 HTA.

I had made the too ready assumption that the HTA could only have any application here in the event of E&#8217;s death but I am persuaded that an order pursuant to Sec 16 MCA, can here, be both immediate and anticipatory in its impact.  Mr Rees has envisaged a factual scenario in which a court may make a Sec 16 order which cannot be implemented because P has died in the intervening period. Whilst that may be unlikely here, for reasons I shall address below, it will be a very real possibility in some of the cases this court hears. Thus, it is useful to address it in principle. </p>

The construction that Mr Rees has advanced and with which I agree, does not strain the language of either legal framework in any way. Its consequence is to promote E&#8217;s autonomy and, more widely, to equate the rights and best interests of the incapacitous, in these circumstances, with those of the capacitous. As such, I note that this construction complies entirely with the interpretive obligations embodied in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref>. </p>

Whilst I am very conscious of the burdens placed upon Deputies, I do consider that some rudimentary facts ought to and could have been established prior to the first hearing. The situation was helpfully remedied in Mr Bagguley&#8217;s statement of 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2019. He contacted the nursing home, spoke to one of the nursing care assistants who told him that whilst there had been some deterioration in E&#8217;s condition, since Mr Bagguley&#8217;s last visit in June 2018, it was not dramatic. He is cared for in a special facility in the lower ground of a Nursing Home. It is reported as spacious and open with natural light. E has &#8216;minimal interaction&#8217;. All his care is anticipated and he requires full assistance from his carers. E is incontinent and has a diet of pur&#233;ed food only.

Accordingly, I consider that re-testing E is most likely to determine the question conclusively. The consideration arises therefore, as to whether it is in E&#8217;s best interests for the tests to be conducted. No individual feature of the evidence strikes me as determinative here but there are a number of key considerations which weigh heavily.  </p>

Firstly, as E commissioned the tests, he can reasonably be taken to have wanted to know whether he was the father of these children. Secondly, given the terms in which the conclusions of that test are set out, E is likely to have considered that the matter had been conclusively answered and that it established that each of the three children were his. As far as I am aware the .1 % alternative, canvassed in the report, is predicated on a hypothesis only. From this I am entitled to draw what I consider to be a compelling inference i.e. that E himself would, if he were in a position to do so, want the tests to be undertaken. There is nothing at all in the history, as provided to me, which identifies or even hints at any factor that might have led E to change his approach. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">There are frequently challenges for Deputies in achieving an accurate history of a protected person&#8217;s background. The primary and obvious obstacle is that the incapacitous are, often and inevitably, unable to provide a reliable narrative. There are one or two indicators within the papers that E may not always have lived an irreproachable life but the investigations by the Deputy reveal that when his partner died he, without any hesitation, took on the responsibility for his fourteen-year-old daughter. It is clear that he had affection for her and that they spent happy times together with the ponies that he bought for her. Whilst he may well have been a man who could be irresponsible at times, it is clear that he <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;did the right thing&#8217;</span> to protect his daughter when her mother died. I use that phrase because it resonates with Lewison J&#8217;s use of language in <span style="font-weight:bold">Re P (Supra)</span>. E has shown that, at least in extremis, he was able to act responsibly and maturely. It seems reasonable to me to infer that he would wish to do so in these circumstances. </p>

I do however see this as a further perspective on those matters that I have sought to analyse at paragraph 33 above. I consider that E would have wished to protect the basic human rights, protected by Article 8, of each of these adults to know of their paternity if this is possible. I infer this from the pattern of his actions that I have isolated in the summary above.  </p>

Had the facts been as presented, it would have created a challenge in securing representation for E. This same dilemma can occur when an urgent application e.g. relating to urgent medical procedure, is made to the out of hours emergency judge. In those circumstances there may not be time to contact the Official Solicitor. Certainly, she will not have the opportunity to conduct independent investigations. Thus, she will not be able to contribute to the decision anything that is not already available to a judge. Nonetheless, the experience, the unique professional obligations to P and the accumulated welfare and legal knowledge of the Official Solicitor may provide an important contribution even where the OS has no greater, possibly even a lesser factual knowledge of the available evidence. The problem has not arisen here, nor do I think I should go further than to say that in situations which are a true emergency it will have to be a matter of judicial discretion as to whether it is necessary or whether time is available to contact the Official Solicitor. It is quite impossible to be prescriptive.  </p>

This is to be regarded as a professional obligation on all the professionals involved but most particularly on the lawyers who bring the application. To this I would add the obvious and related point, an application which becomes urgent in consequence of professional delay in decision making is, equally, a professional failure which always militates against the interests of the protected person. An urgent hearing puts everybody concerned under very great pressure. Where such hearings are capable of being listed in circumstances which enable the parties to be appropriately represented and permit all involved the opportunity to consider and reflect upon the issues, they must be. This I emphasise is a facet of the Article 6 Rights of all involved but most particularly P&#8217;s rights. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">There is no absolute requirement that P should be joined as a party in every case. Indeed, the imposition of such a requirement would be unworkable. It is a fact, for example, that P will not be made a party in the vast majority of Property and Affairs applications. Even where the Court is considering a deprivation of liberty it may not be possible to join P as a party where a crisis situation has developed. This is notwithstanding the obiter dicta comments in <span style="font-weight:bold">Re: X (Court of Protection Practice) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2015/599" uk:canonical="[2015] EWCA Civ 599" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWCA Civ 599</ref>.</span> In an emergency the judge will have to evaluate the proportionality of the arrangements in the context of the crisis and, if an order is made, it is likely to be tightly time limited with an expeditious return to Court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Court of Protection Rules 2017 rule 1.2 and Practice Direction 1A place a duty on the Court to consider the participation of P and as to whether or not to join P as a party to the proceedings. In doing so the Court is directed to have regard to a number of matters including the nature and extent of the information before the Court; the issues raised by the case; whether a matter is contentious; and whether P has been notified. Where P is joined as a party, the joinder will only have effect once a litigation friend has been appointed (r1.2(4)).  Where the Official Solicitor is appointed to act as litigation friend for P it is her usual practice to ensure that her criteria for accepting appointment are met and that arrangements are in place to meet her costs before she will act.  </p>
