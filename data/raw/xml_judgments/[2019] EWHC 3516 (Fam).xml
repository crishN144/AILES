By this time AB was already in a state of cardio-respiratory arrest and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation was ongoing; a dose of adrenalin was given and an i-Gel supraglottic breathing device was placed.  At 19:23 a pulse was noted with return of spontaneous circulation.  The total estimated downtime was a minimum of thirty-one minutes, but that means in ordinary language that the brain was without oxygen for at least thirty-one minutes.   </p>

Nevertheless, it is clear to me what these parents are seeking to establish and it is important that I understand (which I do) and set out briefly the reasons for their objections to the course that I have had said has to be taken.  </p>

Part of that belief is that it is not right for man to kill another man or for woman to kill another woman.  Of course that is one of the basic tenets of all of the major religions of this world and indeed of humanism as well.  I hope that I can explain that in this case this is not a question of anybody killing AB.  If it were, there is no way that a Judge of this court could begin to sanction it; that is obvious.   </p>

Therefore, she is already, in effect, dead and I will come to deal with the medical evidence shortly.  I do urge the parents as they reflect on this in the days, weeks and months and years to come and as they begin their grieving process to understand that my decision on the recommendation and on the application of this hospital trust is not about killing; it is about removing a ventilator which is artificially sustaining a heart.   </p>

It is for this reason that patients with such activity can no longer benefit from supportive treatment and legal certification of their death is appropriate. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1.92in;margin-right:0.07in;text-indent:-1in"><span/><marker name="tab"/>The current position in law is that there is no statutory definition of death in the United Kingdom.  Subsequent to the proposal of the 'brain death criteria' by the Conference of Medical Royal Colleges in 1976,3,4 the courts in England and Northern Ireland have adopted these criteria as part of the law for the diagnosis of death.  There is no reason to believe that courts in other parts of the United Kingdom would not follow this approach. </p>

The difference between patients in vegetative state and patients who are declared dead by virtue of irreversible cessation of brain stem function is that the latter cannot continue to breathe unaided without respiratory support and other life sustaining interventions.  The Code of Practice provides: </p>

The first is that, as Dr E has identified, it would be beyond anyone&#8217;s worst nightmares to witness the complete rotting (which is what it would be) of what is effectively already a dead body with the parents witnessing the gradual collapse and shut down of the internal organs.  Dr E is certain, and I accept his judgement, that this would occur.  Whether it would be hours or days or more he cannot know and nobody can know, but this would surely happen.   </p>
