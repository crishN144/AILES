That is a point of significance because both parties urged on me the analysis of the law set out by Recorder Allen  KC in <span style="font-style:italic">RA v KS </span>[2023] EWFC 102(B), to the effect that the Wife&#8217;s Home Rights cannot be terminated pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/33/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 33(3)</ref>(e) if she has a beneficial interest.

GT identify themselves as acting for a company known as AB Limited, which they assert own the yacht legally and beneficially. GT, while making clear that they neither accept service of the Wife&#8217;s application or jurisdiction of this court, set out that they do not consider that the Married Woman&#8217;s Property Act 1882 can have any application here because any question of ownership is not between the Husband and the Wife but between the Wife and them.</p>

It is wealth made through businesses in his native country. I have been shown summary pages of the report of the Single Joint Expert directed to report as to the value of those business interests. That tells me that in 2007 (a date posited for cohabitation of the parties) the Husband&#8217;s business interests were worth over &#163;565 million. It is his case that his financial position has been ravaged by war. That is supported by the SJE who report that taking into account cross-indemnities the business interests are now worth minus &#163;32 million.</p>

It carries that load here for the Wife and children. There can be no question however that they will be rehoused inadequately if I allow the Husband to sell it. The Husband has proposed that he pays rent at &#163;25,000 a month (a reduction on his original suggestion of &#163;35,000 a month). I can set that rental figure as I consider appropriate &#8211; and I will consider the figure further, and provision of a deposit, below. The Husband is in rented accommodation already. I do not consider it appropriate for me to attach anything more than minimal weight to the fact that the Wife was prepared to move into rented accommodation in advance of her own Family Law Act application. That was, she said, because of the Husband&#8217;s behaviour. It does not mean she is happy to leave the matrimonial home.</p>

The Husband&#8217;s resources are very much in issue but he is continuing to conduct himself as a man with very substantial resources. I do not consider that bankruptcy is round the corner, but there is very real force in his argument that his affairs are not what they were. The war will have had an effect. The SJE report underlines his argument that his financial position is much worse than it was. The fact that he was only able to renew his mortgage for one year in 2023 and that he indicated at that time that he was planning to sell the yacht to repay the mortgage does indicate that the bank are nervous about the mortgage.</p>

Indeed, shortly before the hearing the Husband was provided with a pack to enable him to make an application for an extension, and a valuer attended at the property the day after the hearing on behalf of the bank.</p>

A letter was sent out by email on the 21 March 2024, with no more than a reminder of the mortgage term. After some exchange of emails at the end of March, the bank chased for information for a renewal at the end of April 2024, and that was not answered till the 23 May 2024. (I do note that the correspondence makes enquiries about the sale of the yacht and the home.)</p>

He has been in a clinic suffering from depression. And by pointing out that managing his business during the war has taken a lot of his time. I consider this a weak response. I consider that the Husband has not been that worried about seeking the extension for the same reason set out above. The bank will provide a short extension to enable him to sell the property &#8211; if they take the view it should be sold.</p>

He says that the Husband would be criticised either way on this point: if he adopted the figures of the SJE then he would be accused of self-sabotaging his application. He makes the point that his representation won&#8217;t be simply accepted by the bank and reminds me that last year the Husband only got a one year extension. I can see force in this response but it does make clear to me that I must treat the representation of the Husband&#8217;s net worth by the SJE with caution.</p>

The Wife and children should remain in occupation until completion of the sale or if agreed a prior move to rental accommodation. Her Family Home rights can therefore continue for now, but will, subject to the provision of alternative rental accommodation, terminate on the completion of a sale.</p>

That may need to be paid in periods longer than one month. The deposit will be whatever is required. The Wife seeks for household bills in addition to her maintenance &#163;25,000 pm on the basis that those bills are currently met for her in the matrimonial home and &#163;53,000 pm for staff on the basis that these are currently provided for her in the matrimonial home. The Husband does not advance any alternative figures. It is Mr Molyneux&#8217;s case that if the matter does not settle at FDR, then he will need to bring an application to vary interim maintenance and that will be the time to consider these figures, and indeed the rent. I am not prepared to leave matters on that basis, although I will of course consider variation were any application brought. I direct therefore that the Wife should receive the extra &#163;25,000 to her MPS to cover bills. In relation to staff I direct that the Husband should continue to provide the Wife with the use of staff in her new property as he has in the old one. It does not need to be identical staffing and I expect the parties to be able to agree that. These amounts can be funded in due course from the escrow account</p>
