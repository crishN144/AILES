She has been my friend for all of that time, and for a time, my son was married to her daughter, [TA]. Even though their marriage ended in divorce, [KA] has remained my friend, as has [TA]. The last time I spoke to [KA] before she made her LPA in January 2021, was December 2020. The last time I spoke to her before she made her health and welfare LPA, was March 2021. Regarding discussions I had with her about the LPAs, I just asked her if she was happy about it, and she was. I spoke to her about it on the phone, and I expect her partner was in the room with her during the conversation. I do not feel [KA] was under any pressure to make the LPAs as she sounded cheerful and was in good spirits. She sounded like her normal, usual self. [KA] did not express any particular wishes to me about who she wanted to be her attorneys. She did not express any wishes about how her attorneys should act. [KA]&#8217;s daughter [TA] has always been a wonderful, caring daughter to her mum They have always had a loving, close relationship. Sue has always acted in her mum&#8217;s best interests. I find it shocking that [TA]&#8217;s care for her mum is being questioned, as she has only ever been an amazing daughter to [KA]. I am currently having treatment for stage 4 lung cancer, which I was only diagnosed with very recently. I would appreciate it if I am only contacted about this matter if absolutely necessary.&#8221;</span></p>

They are partial quotes, but there is no inconsistent content in the full note, KA saying the same thing on a number of occasions:</p>

He&#8217;s an accountant and he&#8217;s the eldest.&#8221; I explained to the donor she had made an LPA and named [TA] as the only person who could manage her money for her. The donor said, &#8220;I want all three to agree on decisions.&#8221; I asked her if she could explain why she might only have named [TA] on her LPA and the donor said she could not remember or offer any reason for doing so&#8230;. I reiterated to the donor that her daughter was the only person who had the authority to make decisions about her money and selling her house as she was the only person named on her LPA. I asked the donor if she was happy for [TA] to have this sole responsibility. The donor said, &#8220;I&#8217;d like the three of them, decisions should be made together, I&#8217;ve always said that&#8230; The donor was also unable to give any explanation for why she only named her daughter on her LPA despite telling me she had always said she wanted all three of her children to be able to make decisions together&#8230;. The donor consistently told me she believed her sons were also able to make decisions and could act on her behalf in the same way as her daughter.&#8221;</span></p>

I start with section 2 (e) of schedule 1. The certificate provider is required to provide an opinion, not just to witness a signature, and it is an opinion that : i) the donor understands the purpose of the instrument and the scope of the authority conferred under it, ii) no fraud or undue pressure is being used to induce the donor to create a LPA, and iii) there is nothing else which would prevent a LPA from being created by the instrument.</span></p>

This opinion is one of the requirements for the creation of an LPA, and what is required is the provision of an opinion, not merely the witnessing of a signature.</span></p>

That is the very point that they are certifying, or certifying against to put it another way.

There is a presumption in the MCA in favour of the donor having capacity. The Judge&#8217;s approach is that even though the donor has capacity the LPA is still invalid because the certificate provider failed to undertake sufficient checks. This would set a troubling precedent and undermine the presumption of capacity.</p>

The Judge made no error in her approach. The certificate is fundamental to the formal validity of the LPA, and the requirements as to the opinion are not limited to the issue of capacity.

Such a result would be absurd and would undermine the important protections set out in Schedule 1. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Paragraph 1(2)(e) requires the provision of a certificate, but it also requires that certificate to have particular content. The content is that the certificate provider has an opinion as to three specific matters. Therefore, on a pure black letter law approach, a valid certificate must be based on an opinion as to those three matters. If the evidence showed that the certificate provider did not have such an opinion because, for example, they had not spoken to the donor, then there would not be a valid opinion.</p>

The mere provision of a certificate in the right form cannot be sufficient on its own. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not accept Ms Collinson&#8217;s submission that the Court can only look at the existence of the certificate and no more. For the certificate to meet the requirement of the MCA it must be a certificate as to the matters in paragraph 2(1)(e). This follows from the terms of s.22, which allows the Court to determine whether any of the requirements for the creation of the LPA have been met. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is then necessary to consider the statutory context and the mischief being addressed. The certificate is an important part of the procedure to ensure that a valid LPA has been entered into. The nature of the scheme is that validity turns not merely on the provision of certain documents, but that those documents themselves provide reassurance on a number of key matters. The whole purpose of the MCA is to make provision for the protection of those who have lost mental capacity, or who may do so, as we all may, in the future. The latter issue is dealt with, inter alia, through the making of Lasting Powers of Attorney. Those documents are of the utmost importance in the making of future decisions for people who subsequently lose capacity. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Paragraph 2(1)(e) does not merely concern whether the donor has capacity. It is also there to provide some safeguards that the donor understands the instrument, is not subject to fraud or undue pressure and there are no other barriers to the LPA. Plainly these matters go beyond capacity. The donor might have capacity, but not actually have read the LPA and therefore not understand its purpose or scope. This would not later be grounds to set aside on the basis of lack of capacity, but is an important safeguard in the process. </p>

Although the power to set aside exists in s.22, in practice that power rests on someone raising the issue of validity after the making of the LPA. In many cases such an issue will not be raised, perhaps because there is no other person concerned and the OPG is not aware of the circumstances. Therefore the power in s.22 does not mean that a purposive and careful approach should not be taken to the safeguards in paragraph 2(1)(e).</p>
