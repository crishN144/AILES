The application is necessary because the Brazilian adoption order is not an overseas adoption order as specified in the Adoption Designation of Overseas Adoptions Order 1973, Regulation 3.  Therefore, Mrs. Z's adoption is not an adoption as defined in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/66" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.66</ref> of the Adoption &amp; Children Act 2002 (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref>).   A Brazilian adoption would be such an adoption as defined in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/66" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.66</ref> if this court were to recognise the adoption.

Mrs. Z is a Brazilian citizen who has retained her Brazilian domicile.   Mr. Z is a British citizen born and domiciled in England.

At all times following their marriage the applicants' principal family home was in England.  I have been informed that that has been their home since about the end of 1998.   They also had an apartment in Rio de Janeiro, which served as a Brazilian holiday home during the early years of their marriage and, from May 2007, as a secondary home.   Following the Brazilian placement and adoption of the children Mrs. Z resided there with the children.   </span></p>

Her treatment left her infertile.  In consideration of what steps they would take to be able to have children the applicants agreed to adopt a child. As Mrs. Z wished to share the same cultural ties with their child, they made inquiries in relation to adopting in Brazil.   The position there is that you can make applications to adopt in different Brazilian states and you are approved as adopters by that particular state.   On 29</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> January, 2007 the P District Court issued its certification that Mrs. Z was qualified to adopt a child in that state's jurisdiction.   </span></p>

The relevant judgment records that the identity of A's father is unknown and that at the time of the adoption proceedings B's birth father had died.  They were placed in care in May 2007, as a result of the high level of concerns in relation to the birth mother's care for them.   The papers paint a graphic description in relation to their plight.  They were placed in an orphanage at about that time.  Soon thereafter, as a result of Mrs. Z's approval as an adopter, they were placed with her.  That was on 21</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">st</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> June, 2007.  At the time of their placement with Mrs. Z their birth mother's family rights were suspended owing to her neglect of the children.   The District Court formally placed the children with Mrs. Z under a provisional custody order.  At that time A was then aged four and a half and B was one.   The parents have been living effectively as a family since that date although, for various different reasons, they have had to live between two jurisdictions - between Brazil and this country.  </span></p>

There was a home study report, termed a "psychological report", which went into some considerable detail.  In Brazil they require the children to have lived with the adoptive parent for up to twelve months before an adoption order can be made.  The Brazilian adoption is a full adoption  as here, extinguishing the parental responsibility and rights of the children's birth parents and irrevocably transferring the same to Mrs. Z.  The P District Court's judgment records that on the adoption of the children "irrevocably and definitely become the adopter's legitimate children" and that the children's best interests "must be above any other interest when their destinies are being discussed".   </span></p>

But, by further order made in May 2011 Mr. Z's name was deleted from the adoption order and the children's adoption birth certificates were re-issued just showing Mrs. Z as their sole parent.  It is understood this rectification was to comply with Brazilian law under which  Mr. Z, as a foreign national, was ineligible to adopt the children.   The rectification judgment appears to recognise that the rectification was necessary to enable the order to be recognised in this country and to comply with the Hague Convention.</span></p>

But, their entry clearance was refused.  They lodged an appeal, but on advice chose not to pursue that appeal.  The entry clearance officer accepted that the children were genuinely adopted.   But, it was refused because the immigration rules require either that the adoption is recognised in the United Kingdom or that it is a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">de facto</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> adoption as defined in the rules; that is, that the adoptive parent, or parents, have assumed parental responsibility for the child applicants and have lived abroad with the children for eighteen months prior to the child's entry to the United Kingdom.  The entry clearance officer noted that Mr. Z had not lived in Brazil with the children for the required eighteen month term.   They were placed in an impossible situation in trying to regularise their family life in the way they had intended.  By following all the appropriate procedures they were then faced with a hurdle which, at that stage, appeared difficult to overcome.  </span></p>

Mr. Z has, at all times, shared the care and parenting of the children but he could not live full-time in Brazil because his business - which was the family's main financial support - required his presence in the United Kingdom to be able to run that business.       Mr. Z visited Brazil three or four times a year, and maintained regular contact, including daily Skype sessions with the children, internet and telephone contact.   At all times he has fully maintained the family, both financially and otherwise.   As Miss Cronin sets out in her position statement, this family separation has not been by choice, but by necessity.  I agree on the evidence I have seen.  It is clear from the papers I have seen that separation has been very difficult for all the parties and, to some extent, detrimental to the children.  But, Mr. and Mrs. Z have done all they can to be able to maintain the normality and their relationships in the difficult situation they found themselves in.  That is perhaps most vividly seen - as          Mrs. Z recalls - when they were advised about the current application and that children could apply for settled status in the United Kingdom after they had arrived in June of last year.  She recalls she "felt almost faint with relief"; which perhaps is an understatement in the context of the difficulties which they have had to face since 2008.</span></p>

The question was whether the applicant had been habitually resident in the twelve months preceding the divorce application.  In that case Thorpe LJ concluded that there was just sufficient foundation for jurisdiction where Mrs. Ikimi had spent less than half of the necessary twelve months in the United Kingdom (I think it was about 44 percent in that case).   She had moved between her home in this country and the home in Nigeria.   I do not propose to set out in detail various passages which I have been referred to in that case. For the purposes of this judgment I would read in, in particular, para. 35 of the judgment of Thorpe LJ where he determined that the test which was applied by Coleridge J at first instance - that habitual residence is a state of affairs which exists regardless of the precise time spent in the particular country - has been too relaxed.  He said it was important that there is an ingredient of bodily presence.   However, he did say:  </span></p>

Of course the consequence of liberality may be forum-shopping. But that feature, particularly undesirable in matrimonial proceedings, can be controlled by the power to stay ...  The danger of stated tests is that they are soon exposed by the arrival of a challenge in the form of a set of facts unforeseen by the architect of the test. No field is more vulnerable to such challenges than the field of family law. But I would find it hard to envisage that any petitioner could rely on this statutory provision unless he or she had spent an appreciable part of the relevant year within this jurisdiction".</span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">My reasons for reaching that conclusion can be summarised as follows:  Firstly, whilst in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Ikimi </span><span style="font-size:14pt">it was said that the wife's 44 percent residence just satisfied the test that has to be looked at, in my judgment, in the circumstances of that case where here movements were wholly voluntary.  She had the freedom to move between the two homes and had decided to make her London home the more important of the two homes.   In this case Mrs. Z was not choosing her home to be in Rio, but was, in effect, stranded there as she understood her children could not be permitted entry to the United Kingdom for settlement as had been intended.  Her intention, following the adoption in Brazil in 2008, had been to resume living in the family home with her husband and children.  That has remained her position.  She has in fact only spent just under 25 percent of her time physically here in the relevant period namely, from September 2011 to September 2012. I am told that she came here with the children for a period of about nine to ten days in March 2012 and was here from 25</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> June 2012 to 13</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> September 2012, which was obviously when she issued her application.   Prior to that, she had visited this jurisdiction with the children on two or three times a year for holiday periods.  So, even though her percentage physical time is considerably less than in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Ikimi</span><span style="font-size:14pt">, the significant difference in this case is the fact that she did not have the voluntary freedom of movement that Mrs. Ikimi had to be able to move between the two homes.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Secondly, the evidence demonstrates the family home was established a considerable period of time prior to Mrs. Z being in Rio.  I am told that it was purchased in about 1998 and the parties have lived there through the majority of their marriage.  It was, and remained, their principal and chosen family home during the relevant period.  Mr. Z remained here.  He ran the business here which financed the family.  It remained, in my judgment, the focus of their family life.</span></p>

As Lord Scarman said, "Temporary or occasional absences of long or short duration".  In considering the context of the absences in this case, although long, they were of an involuntary nature.  I am also inclined to take into account the daily contact that was maintained between the family through the internet, telephone and Skype contact.   Despite being separated, that contact helped maintain Mrs. Z's connection with the residence here.   Obviously this consideration must be considered on a fact-specific basis.  But, in this case it was a significant part of the continued connection and residence here.  In this case it supports Mrs. Z's contention that despite her physical absence during the relevant period, the family home here remained the focus.</span></p>

She had indefinite leave to remain but did not want to be, understandably, separated from her children.   I accept that her recognition application was made relatively promptly.   It would have been open to her to wait further time to enhance the quantum of time her physical presence had been in this jurisdiction.  But, she was anxious, to her credit, that the immigration authorities were aware of the application as soon as they had received that advice that such an application could be made sooner rather than later, as the children had come here on a visitor's visa which carries with it the clear implication that they were coming for a short-term period only.</span></p>

Mrs. Z, as I have said, is Brazilian-born.  She has retained her Brazilian nationality.  The importance of her attachment to Brazilian personal law is clear.  They were married in Brazil and Mrs. Z has explained that she wanted to adopt Brazilian children so that she could have a cultural link with them.  She has maintained a property in Brazil and Mr. Z has cemented their future ties there through his Brazilian import business.   The applicants intend to maintain strong future links to Brazil so that their children retain their Brazilian culture and heritage.  Mrs. Z clearly had a domicile of origin in Brazil. That has been described as being "tenacious". The court would need powerful evidence to indicate that that has been given up. There is no evidence in this case that suggests that that had been given up by Mrs. Z.</span></p>
