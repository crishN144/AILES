He was born in England.  He comes from a military family and himself has had a 23-year career as an officer in the Armed Forces, the last eight of which were spent in the Australian Defence Force (&#8220;ADF&#8221;).  The father&#8217;s parents (&#8220;the grandparents&#8221;) live in north west England.  The father had previously been married and has a child living in England from that marriage.</span></p>

W was born in 2007 in England.  In the same year, the father left the British Army after a career that included several tours of overseas duty.  In July 2008, the family emigrated to Australia to allow the father to take up a commission in the ADF.  The family home in England was let and has remained such.  The parents settled in a rental property in Australia.  By 2009, at all events, there were difficulties in the marriage and the father left home for some months.  But in 2010, A was born.  In December of that year, the family returned to the UK for a visit over Christmas, that being the last time such a visit was made before the summer of 2015.  In 2012, T was born.</span></p>

By April 2013, he had become unable to work and, in practice, he spent the last three years of his service on sick leave on full pay, before finally being discharged in August 2015.  I will return to the father&#8217;s medical circumstances later.</span></p>

Between January 2014 and May 2014 there was a separation, with the father leaving the family home and seeing not much of the children over that period.  By November 2014, the father&#8217;s health had become extremely poor, with at least one episode of self-harming behaviour.  In that month and into December, the grandparents again came out to offer support over a period of a month or so.  During 2014, the mother herself was suffering from reactive depressive difficulties as a result of all these circumstances.  But the evidence is clear that, after a year or so, those had dispelled, and certainly the mother&#8217;s health difficulties are secondary to those of the father and are not to be compared with them.</span></p>

There is a strong sense of commitment to the armed services and to service values.  This is a family that lives by the rules.  There is an unspoken expectation of mutual support, plain dealing and honourable behaviour.  The fact that a family that has been so close is now sitting on opposite sides of a courtroom is a source of great regret, no doubt first and foremost to the family itself.</span></p>

I have seen, but not read, his medical records which run to over 1,000 pages.  In October 2014, his treating psychiatrist in Australia diagnosed him to have severe chronic post-traumatic stress disorder associated with major depression and alcohol dependence.  There is some discussion that really does not very much matter as to the persistence of the alcohol dependence.  But the diagnosis as a whole remains valid and is clearly a huge burden to the father and to all other family members.</span></p>

It was around February that the idea that the family might come to England arose.  The grandparents, at the request of the parents and with the full knowledge and approval of the mother, took extensive steps to make this possible.  I mention perhaps the most significant steps, although there were others, facilitating the process.  They purchased at their own expense a suitable family home about a mile away from their own home, completing that purchase on 1</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">st</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> June 2015 after surrendering an income bond for that purpose.  They investigated school and nursery placements to ensure that they were as good as possible.  They offered advice on nationality issues because the children&#8217;s papers (or at least the younger two children&#8217;s papers) were not fully in order.  It was between February and June a very substantial planning exercise.</span></p>

As I indicated during the course of the hearing, that was an order that should never have been applied for without notice to the mother and should not have been granted by the court.  The mother was in Australia and there was not the remotest possibility that she would be in a position to remove the children.  If she was given notice of the father&#8217;s intentions, she could at the very least, bearing in mind that she was hammering at his door electronically-speaking, have been informed of what was intended and expressed her point of view.  It is, I am afraid, unconscionable that no effort was made on the part of the father or his advisers to put the mother in a position to contribute at the outset of those proceedings.  Instead the mother first learnt of what had happened when she received from the father&#8217;s solicitors by email a copy of the divorce petition and of the without notice order that had been made.  This, it is germane to note, was the first time that the father or anybody on his behalf had ever said to the mother that the children were not returning.</span></p>

He did not accept the mother&#8217;s case that the father was, as a result of his health, unable to look after the children based upon the information that the mother had been able to provide at that stage, being but a fraction of the information now available.

Having had a somewhat fuller opportunity to survey the whole picture, I am afraid that neither party comes out of the process with much credit in the matter of the making of without notice applications.

The areas on which oral evidence might have assisted me turned out to be minimal or non-existent.  There is a wealth of information and contemporary documentation, in all running to over 500 pages, quite apart from the medical records.  The mother has been in England for the week before the hearing, a time she has spent with the children.  So we now arrive at the point where all the main family members are here in London, with homes in Australia and in England remaining in full effect.</span></p>

The father has put forward a defence of consent, a defence of acquiescence and a defence that a return would place the children effectively in an intolerable situation (Article 13(b)).  That last assertion is not pursued to a decision and has been withdrawn, and rightly so.  The evidence in this case comes nowhere near the kind that would lead to the court considering that the 13(b) defence might be established.  So far as acquiescence is concerned, it is very much a second line of defence to the father&#8217;s main case which is that the children came over here because the parents had agreed that they would come and live here permanently - the real issue is consent.</span></p>

So there is no doubt that the children physically came into England with the mother&#8217;s consent.  Indeed she brought them here herself and fully participated, before and after their arrival, in the arrangements that were being made for them.  The question is whether the father has established an agreement that this was to be a permanent relocation as opposed to a period of recuperation and stabilisation.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I turn, as briefly as I may, to the law.  The first thing to say is that these proceedings have the object of deciding which court should determine the children&#8217;s future if the parents cannot agree it.  It is not the function of this court to make those welfare decisions.  There is also a fundamental principle that decisions of this kind are best made by the courts of the state in which the children are habitually resident and not by the courts of the state where they happen to be.  A further underpinning principle is that the law encourages parents to agree arrangements for children and will seek to uphold those arrangements wherever they are made.  Thus, under the Convention, the applicant must establish that the children are habitually resident in the country to which their return is sought.  In this case, the mother says that the children have remained habitually resident in Australia and have been wrongfully retained in England.  In such a case, the court would be obliged to order the children&#8217;s return forthwith unless (a) the father establishes one of the limited range of available defences; and (b) if he were to succeed in that, the court declined to exercise its discretion to order a return nonetheless.  As I have said, the focus of the argument is on the question of consent.  The father&#8217;s defence is that &#8220;the mother consented to the children moving to live in England permanently&#8221;.</span></p>

I particularly attend to communications between the parents themselves: what they said to each and what they did not say.  Communications from the grandparents are also of assistance but they are in a somewhat different category.  This is because the grandparents, who have acted with such conspicuous commitment, understandably have their own views about what is best for their son and daughter-in-law and grandchildren and their view must be seen in that context.  I also draw a distinction in respect of communications between the parents and the ADF.  Those have to be seen in the context of each parent&#8217;s employment situation: the father as a respected retired officer and pensioner with a lifetime of service; the mother as a relatively junior officer seeking to establish herself and to maintain her credibility with her superior officers while at the same time dealing with the extraordinary difficulties faced by the family.  In the circumstances that the family found itself in, when communicating with the ADF it is only natural that the parents presented their situation in a way that maximised their chances of short-term indulgences and kept their long-term options open.  </span></p>

It is not suggested otherwise.  In particular, there is no chance whatever that the family considered the children living with the father in England while their mother lived in Australia for anything other than the shortest term possible.  I also discount, given the values in this family, any possibility that the mother would go absent without leave.  If she was going to obtain LWP it would have to be with her superiors&#8217; approval and for her to leave the Army could only have happened by agreement.  That is a reflection of the family&#8217;s values, quite apart from the financial consequences that would result from the mother leaving in any unauthorised way.</span></p>

The family was, as I have said, in crisis, the future was uncertain and there was an immediate need for respite.  This was achieved with the help of the grandparents to the very highest level.  They own a number of properties and bought this further property as being most convenient for the family to reside in, the arrangement strictly being that the family would rent it.  They could, of course, have merely rented on the open market.  However, the purchase of property was very much in harmony with the grandparents&#8217; natural wishes for the family, and, of course, whichever parent&#8217;s account is correct, the purchase carried with it the possibility of a permanent solution in England.</span></p>

I sent you an email to find out where you stood and clarify intent and your reply made the situation no clearer.

Regardless, I felt to push this line was not in their best interest as the fall-out from us fighting and very probably a complete breakdown in our communication, caring for each other, support to each other and focusing on being parents even if we are not together would carry massive impact.  In short, could we leave your return date until after Thursday next week so I can have some daddy time with our children, please?  I would appreciate it.&#8221;</span></p>

So frankly we are somewhat confused by what appears to be a complete turnaround in position.  At the conclusion of the talk we had when you were over here, you confirmed that you were very happy with the way the children had settled down at home and at their schools, and it was agreed that the children should remain here.  You would, once you had settled back into a routine over there, progress the process to be discharged from the ADF and join them back in the UK.&#8221;</span></p>

This was something that he says sprung from the advice of his psychologist that he should not engage in discussion with the mother.  I do not accept that at all.  The father, however much stress he was under, was perfectly capable of communicating, and indeed it would probably have been less stressful for him to communicate truthfully than disingenuously.</span></p>

However, for reasons that I will explain in a little more detail below, I do regard the events of February 2016, like those in January 2015, as being of assistance when coming to analyse the issues between the parties.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.38in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">These children have throughout remained habitually resident in Australia.  They were not habitually resident in England when these proceedings were issued.  They have grown up in Australia and it is their home.  They have not become integrated into life in England in such a way as to change that.  Although the very best arrangements have been made for their care and education since last July, their presence here was not, as I find, intended to be a definitive or permanent relocation.  In the light of the basis upon which they came, the repeated uncertainty in the parents&#8217; relationship and the extremely significant absence of their mother from their daily lives, their presence here has had a provisional quality.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.38in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">As to that, I find against the father&#8217;s case that he and the mother agreed on a permanent move to the UK.  While there are features of the evidence to which the father can point that are consistent with such an agreement, they are not distinctive indicators and are certainly not clear and unequivocal.  I find the mother&#8217;s communications in June and July 2015 to be an indication of an openly-expressed state of time, of which the father was well aware, and not to be in the nature of &#8220;a wobble&#8221;.  A feature that, to my mind, strongly supports my overall conclusion are the reactions of the father and of the mother to the difficulties that arose in December 2015 and again in February 2016.  When the mother said that the children should come back, the father in the first place agreed and in the latter case avoided the issue in a way that is accepted to have been out of character.  This is a family with a very high regard for plain dealing.  Had there been a &#8220;plan for permanency&#8221;, I have no doubt that, somewhere amidst the mass of material, there will be a reference by the father to the mother having reneged on that agreement.  Certainly in February 2016, had the father believed that he had had such a commitment, he would inevitably have said so.  I do not accept that his failure to do so arose from incapacity or from what Mrs Simpson-Martin has referred to as &#8220;irrationality&#8221;.  He did not give the obvious response because it would not have been true.  In contrast, the mother&#8217;s actions have throughout been spontaneous and consistent with a conviction that there was no agreement of the kind for which the father now contends. What we have here is a dog that barked and another that significantly remained silent.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.38in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">My assessment of the evidence is that the children came to England as part of an exercise to shore up this family.  The period that was acceptable to the mother and at least tacitly accepted by the father was a school year, give or take, and so to the end of 2016 provided things went to plan, with the family remaining together and the mother being successful in obtaining a year of LWP.  Failing that, it was clearly within the parents&#8217; contemplation that the children would return sooner to Australia.  I accept from all the surrounding circumstances that matters might have moved to the point where the family may have decided to remain in England permanently or indefinitely.  The infrastructure allowing for that to happen was well in place.  But that is not what happened.  The mother&#8217;s return in January was not, I find, in order to get out of the Army come what may.  It would have been necessary for her to have been discharged for that outcome to be possible.  I entirely accept that the grandparents saw the arrangements as being capable of being permanent or indefinite in accordance with their own honest feelings about what would be for the best.  However, I am not able to convert the wishes and actions of even such excellent grandparents into an agreement between the parents that did not exist, or into a conclusion that these children&#8217;s provisional presence in England amounted to habitual residence here in March 2016.</span></p>

In my view, the situation in 2016 was essentially the same as it had been in the previous year.</span></p>

I will hear from the parties, after they have had some opportunity to digest this decision, as to when and how that is to be achieved.  I appreciate that whichever party was going to be unsuccessful in this matter was bound to be deeply unhappy.  That is the nature of disputes of this kind, particularly across continents.  But I express the court&#8217;s expectation that the adults will do everything they can to support the children in the future, as they have done in the past.  Indeed, from what I know of their qualities, I am confident that this will be so.</span></p>
