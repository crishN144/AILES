Kwame had his 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday last month but rather than standing on the brink of adulthood and looking to the future, his tragedy, and the tragedy for all who love him, is that he is, instead, the subject of an application for declarations made by the applicant Trust in relation to withdrawal of life sustaining treatment.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It would be all too easy to lose sight of who Kwame really is, because the young man who is the subject of this application has been in many ways diminished. His mother was clear that she wanted me to know about him as a &#8216;person&#8217; not just as a &#8216;patient&#8217;. From the statement she prepared for these proceedings, a little more emerges of Kwame, the person. His father told me that, in the picture she gave of him, Kwame&#8217;s mother captured it &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">perfectly</span>&#8217;. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Before May 2021 Kwame was very sporty and athletic. He was particularly good at basketball. He was on the school basketball team and was very dedicated to it. Being so tall for his age helped him with that. Kwame&#8217;s appearance mattered a lot to him, and his mother described how before going out he would take ages in the shower and then moisturising and then finally in very carefully combing his afro over and over in the same spot to make sure it looked just right.  His popularity with his peers is reflected in the fact that at his recent birthday his friends turned up at Kwame&#8217;s bedside with cards to spend it with him. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">He is a very much-loved member of a large and close-knit family. He has an older sibling and 2 younger ones and is a responsible boy feeling his role as the oldest boy in the family keenly. He tried to set a good example. He has always been close to his younger siblings and they in turn look up to him and respect him. He joined in the family passion for film and cinema and still more the family interest in food. He comes from a family of good cooks and had recently started to learn to cook. His bright and inquisitive mind led him to be interested in and express thoughtful analytical views about social issues, prominently amongst them Black Lives Matter. His mother says he has always been a quiet boy and a deep thinker. She says he is just like his father.  At this hearing his father, with a broad smile on a day when smiles were few, said to me that she was exactly right. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In May 2021, Kwame was found unresponsive at his home after what it seems was an attempt to take his own life.  Despite efforts made by those who found him and by emergency services he remained unresponsive. He suffered a hypoxic cardiac arrest and for at least 28 minutes had no recordable heart rate. He was intubated at the scene and taken by air ambulance to hospital. Following admission, he was transferred to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) where, intubated and ventilated he has been treated ever since.  He has remained there for the last 20 months. I will consider later in this judgment the investigations and procedures carried out during that time.   The medical staff and clinicians looking after him have done so with a dedication and kindness which I have been told his family has very much appreciated. It is however sadly the case that all of that care; all of the expertise; all of the hope that it might be otherwise, cannot alter the reality that the clinical evidence before me is that there is no hope of a recovery or even of improvement.  </p>

Kwame&#8217;s Mother does not oppose the declarations sought by the Trust though she cannot bring herself positively to agree. Kwame&#8217;s father does not agree. He would wish Kwame to be given some more time to recover and makes the point that no one can know now what might be possible by way of new treatments becoming available or medical developments in say a year&#8217;s time.  If, however, the court comes to a different view he is willing to accept the decision made. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The Trust has been represented by Ms Morris KC, the Guardian appointed to act for Kwame, by Ms Stanley. Kwame&#8217;s mother has had the benefit of representation by Leading Counsel both at this hearing and at the hearing listed in December 2022, today by Ms Butler-Cole KC.  Kwame&#8217;s father had initially indicated that he did not wish to engage further in any discussion or have any involvement in the application. When the application came before me on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2022 attempts had been made to serve him with notice of the application at an address but there was lack of certainty that the material had reached him or that I could be confident that he knew of it. Given the seriousness of the issues to be considered, I directed that further efforts should be made to engage with Kwame&#8217;s father before considering whether in these circumstances I should deem him to have notice. I have been enormously grateful to the Guardian for her proactive and sensitive approach in making contact with the Father.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The Guardian successfully made contact with the Father by telephone and WhatsApp speaking to him on 15th December 2022, 22nd December 2022 and 4th January 2023 (he having indicated that he felt more comfortable speaking by phone than in person).  During these conversations he confirmed that he had received documents that had been left for him at the address where service had been attempted and that he had read all the documents served up to and including the time of his second conversation with the Guardian on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2022. There is a considerable amount of detail set out in the position statement of the Guardian as to the communication between the Guardian and the father which it is not necessary for me to rehearse here, but for which efforts I express my thanks to Ms Cull-Fitzpatrick. It is sufficient to say that the Guardian&#8217;s efforts resulted in the Father providing an email address which was subsequently used to serve updating statements on 4th January from the Trust and the Guardian&#8217;s report on 5th January 2023. Whilst there was in the run up to this hearing some doubt as to whether Kwame&#8217;s father had accessed all of the more recent documents sent to him by secure means he told the Guardian that he would attend this hearing and he did so. He confirmed to me that he had received all of the documents and that he had also been provided with a hard copy of them at court.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It was known that the Father intended to represent himself at the hearing and he came accompanied by a friend for support.  He told me sadly and frankly that he did not want to be here. There had been a suggestion within the papers that Kwame&#8217;s father did not wish in any event to instruct a solicitor or to ask for time to find representation and I asked him about this. He agreed that this was so but added also that the reality was that even if he wanted to the cost would be prohibitive. As it was, he expressed his position with a quiet dignity and was able to convey to me those questions he would wish to ask of the medical witnesses. Since it was his preference that I asked the questions for him rather than he asked them himself I did so. I observe in passing however that it is dispiriting that the vagaries of the funding provisions are such that this quiet dignified father facing the worst experience imaginable should not have been able to be represented had he wanted it.  </p>

They are that i) The judge must decide what is in the best interests of the child. ii) In making that decision the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration. iii) The judge must look at the question from the assumed point of view of the child. iv) There is a strong presumption in favour of a course of action that will be likely to preserve life, but that presumption is not irrebuttable. v) The term "<span style="font-style:italic">best interests</span>" encompasses medical, emotional and all other welfare issues. vi) The court must consider the views of the doctors and parents. vii) Each case will turn on its own facts. viii) The court must conduct a balancing exercise in which all relevant factors are weighed.

It is important to stress that the reference is to the views and opinions of the parents. Their own wishes, however understandable in human terms, are wholly irrelevant to consideration of the objective best interests of the child save to the extent in any given case that they may illuminate the quality and value to the child of the child/parent relationship.</span>&#8221;  They are words however that serve to remind with emphasis, a Court making this sort of decision that the child&#8217;s welfare is paramount. I found echoes of this aspect in the Mother&#8217;s statement of evidence in this case when she set out how she had tried in her own thinking about the decision to be made for Kwame to disentangle what she would want for herself from what would be the best thing for him. </p>

Kwame&#8217;s father has in this respect been able to speak in discussions of Kwame&#8217;s response to seeing when he was a much younger child an older relative incapacitated and bedbound following a stroke which had seemed to him then to be a prospect which Kwame had thought of with some equanimity as contentedly lying in bed living a life. So it is that the Father thinks perhaps Kwame might take the same view of his own position now.  I have to factor into the fact that Kwame&#8217;s age and understanding when he expressed those views was very different. It is hard to see how the older Kwame, the sportsman, the sociable young man who had become so particular about his appearance would be likely to be so content. In his conversations with the Guardian during her helpful and sensitively conducted investigations, the Father recognised this.

The fact that she has been born into a devout religious family in which children are brought up to follow the tenets of their faith is plainly a highly relevant characteristic of hers. Under s.1(3)(d), the court is required to have regard to the fact that Alta is from a devout Hasidic family which has very clear beliefs and practices by which they lead their lives and that, if she had sufficient understanding, she too would very probably choose to follow the tenets of the family religion. I agree with Mr Simblet that this is a central part of her identity &#8211; of &#8220;who she is&#8221;. It is unquestionably an important factor to be taken into consideration.

Kwame has been in the PICU for a long time now - more than 18 months. Through all that time his mother has visited him every week, on average twice a week sometimes only once if her other family obligations are pressing, often more if she can manage it.  She has reached a position where though she does not feel the decision is one for her &#8211; and she is right about that it is for me &#8211; she does not oppose the application. She accepts the unified view of the doctors looking after him and those who have given second opinions that there is no prospect of improvement or recovery.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">She explained that it took her a while to reach that point and one of the things that has made it so hard for her to do so is that in some ways Kwame looks well. Most of the time he looks comfortable, calm and relaxed. He is warm when she touches him. He seems to have facial expressions - sometimes tired, sometimes relaxed. He yawns, stretches, opens and closes his eyes just like any other teenage boy might. It has taken her a while to trust what the doctors tell her, that these are reflex and involuntary actions, but she does trust them. Since he has been so long in hospital he has grown and his body matured. That again is hard to square with there being no room for hope of improvement but square it she has.   With conspicuous grace she says in her statement, and again through counsel, that she realises that the reason he looks so well is because the doctors and nurses have looked after him so well and she thanks them. Ultimately the point she has reached is that since Kwame first went into hospital, she has been adamant that she didn&#8217;t want him to suffer.  She feels now that were she to oppose the application to extubate him it would be something she would be doing more for her comfort and not for him. In some ways she has come to speak for Kwame&#8217;s wider family.  She has talked to his younger siblings who are understandably too young even perhaps to know what to think, still less form a clear view but his older sister has talked to her mother a lot. His sister has said she doesn&#8217;t think her brother would want to live as he is now.  </p>

From his discussions with the Guardian, I know that over Christmas he visited the hospital several times but could not bring himself to go in to see his son. That vignette tells me more than many words might about the pain of his situation. What he said to me in court was that he did not want anyone to think it was that he couldn&#8217;t be bothered. He hadn&#8217;t wanted to continue discussions at the hospital about what should happen because it felt to him like a pressure to agree that no more could be done.

Although the medical evidence is that he will be at risk of infections which might ultimately overwhelm him as they become resistant to treatment, weighed against that is that he might not. He might, says the Father just go on as he has been or at least not get very much worse. It can&#8217;t be taken for granted that he will deteriorate. The reason that matters from the Father&#8217;s perspective is twofold: first that contrary to the medical opinion, he might improve if given more time and second that there might be some treatment that isn&#8217;t available now but will be if he can be kept alive for it because things change.  If I were to grant the Trust&#8217;s application, Kwame&#8217;s father did not disagree at all with what his mother said should happen about the timing and place of any extubation. He didn&#8217;t want to say anything different or to add to what she had said, and he didn&#8217;t want to be involved in any discussions with professionals about it. </p>

The Doctor responded that the cost of treatment had never been a factor and was not part of the team&#8217;s thinking. The only reasoning is that the team did not think it was right to continue treatment to no effect and which could inflict suffering. She reiterated that she was worried about the risk of an unplanned death, of Kwame being overwhelmed by infection resistant to drugs and developing septicaemia.

He would either need to remain in hospital or alternatively he may be able to reside at a neuro-rehabilitation centre. Given his complex needs and the equipment required to manage his care, along with the likelihood of emergency care being required, it is unlikely that Kwame will ever be able to return home. </p>

It may be that his sister is right to say that he would not want to go on living in the way he is now, knowing as I do what a lively and vibrant person he was previously, but I do not think I can automatically assume that is so.  He is on the evidence no longer capable of forming conscious wishes or having thoughts about continued treatment. I note from Dr AA&#8217;s evidence that he demonstrates spontaneous eye opening and blinking with some lateral eye movements but makes no response when spoken to. His pupils are equal and reactive to light but there is no significant other reaction to the light. There is no evidence that he is able to fix or follow an object or person visually.  Tellingly it seems to me given how close he has been to his family and how assiduously they have continued to visit, staff have not observed him to be any different when surrounded by his family.  It is both safer and more accurate to say that I am not able to ascertain what his wishes are or might have been.  </p>

It follows that I without hesitation conclude that whilst he retained a capacity for awareness he knew himself to be as his mother describes it a much-loved member of a large and close-knit family.  I also however regard it as permissible when I consider the helpful way in which Hayden J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re H </span><span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2022/14" uk:canonical="[2022] EWFC 14" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2022">[2022] EWFC 14</ref></span> expressed the view that it was important to think about what might be a child&#8217;s attitude to his circumstances,  to think that Kwame who was so fastidious that he would comb his hair over and over so it was just right is very far removed from the young man whose head is now shaved to help with the pressure sores on his head which the evidence tells me will be a continuing issue.  The gradual degrading of his body is a distressing aspect of his situation to all those who are witnessing it. When I think about what was and would be important to him, I think it would distress him too. Whilst some might regard that as a superficial matter it seems to me that it ties in with those aspects of dignity which also fall to be considered. </p>

It is largely thanks to her efforts that I have heard so clearly the views of Kwame&#8217;s father which have been brought into the analysis. At Ms Stanley&#8217;s request the Guardian was called to give evidence. There was the opportunity accordingly for anyone who wanted to cross examine her or ask her any questions at all to do so. No one did. The conclusion she had reached in her written evidence remained unaltered as well as unchallenged:  </p>

I would recommend that the Trust support [WX] and [UV] to prepare a palliative care  plan  and  make arrangements  for  Kwame&#8217;s death which ensures that his siblings are supported.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">I accept the overwhelming and unified medical views of those who have cared for so long for Kwame and of those who have provided second opinions as to his situation.  It drives me to the inevitable conclusion that he has no prospect of improvement with treatment or, as his father urged me to consider, with more time.  As to the question of more time I cannot on all that I have heard and read regard it as a neutral step to leave Kwame as he is, against the prospect that as his father hopes medical science may evolve and next year there may be something that can be done for him. The way in which his physical condition has started to degrade notwithstanding the excellent nursing care is clear from the review elsewhere in this judgment of his time in PICU since admission. Despite that care his body is degrading; infections come more often and I accept are likely to be increasingly resistant to antibiotic treatment. His skin is starting to be affected by sores and infection; the deterioration in his larynx makes the mechanics of providing ventilation more difficult and more dangerous &#8211; in circumstances where one cannot be sure whether he feels discomfort; or pain; or nothing. I accept the evidence of Dr AA that there is a risk of an unplanned death in which any attempted resuscitation would be both distressing to him and unlikely to be successful. </p>

He appears to have no awareness of his environment, no purposive movement, no response to tactile stimulation.  Of course, there are aspects wider than the purely medical. That those who love him would no doubt continue to be at his side is something from which he cannot derive any subjective benefit by being kept alive. </p>

I am confident that whether it takes place in the PICU where Kwame has been since May 2021 or elsewhere in a hospice setting the extubation can be arranged to be undertaken by skilled and specialist staff who will than provide such palliative care as may be necessary in the short time that Kwame will remain alive. </p>
