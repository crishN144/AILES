Despite that fact, he appears to have been pursued by the Child Support Agency for payments in relation to David Thomas Ratcliffe, presumably because the mother, Vicki Ratcliffe, informed the Child Support Agency that David Elliott is the genetic father of David Ratcliffe.  As I understand it, over ensuing years David Elliott has paid many thousands of pounds in child support to the Child Support Agency, which he is seeking now to recoup.  David Ratcliffe himself is, of course, now fully adult, being aged almost 24.  </span></p>

Again, that form of words appears to imply that some samples have been &#8220;supplied&#8221; by, or via, the solicitor.  The letter then makes reference to the three parties to these proceedings, and records that the result of analysis of DNA markers in the three samples excludes Mr David Elliott from being the biological father of David Thomas Ratcliffe.

The words &#8220;had their identities warranted at the time of sampling by an independent third party&#8221;, make curious use of the passive tense.

In such a situation, those people might, relatively privately, submit samples to Dadcheck.com, pay the fee and feel confident about whatever results are reported.  </span></p>

Such a declaration is no doubt based on a balance of probability.  Nevertheless, before making such a declaration a court has to be judicially satisfied as to the accuracy and reliability of that which it is declaring.  A declaration of parentage under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/55" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 55</ref>A of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1986 Act</ref> is a solemn legal act, which remains binding and operative for all time and all purposes on the issue declared as to the parentage of the person concerned.  </span></p>

I am very sympathetic to the situation of the applicant, Mr David Elliott, who I am sure arrived here today confident that long ago he would have left court with the required declaration, so as to enable him to start recouping from the CSA some part of the payments which he made.  That said, he must have made the payments an appreciable time ago, since the child concerned ceased to be a child five or six years ago, and I am afraid that Mr Elliott will simply have to wait a little longer.  </span></p>
