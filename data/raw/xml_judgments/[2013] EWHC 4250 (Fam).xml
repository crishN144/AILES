In addition she seeks an order for interim periodical payments for the child of herself and the respondent, C, who was born in August 2005.  That application is mounted under s. 23(1)(d) of the Matrimonial Causes Act and will only be a permissible application, given the terms of s. 44(1) of the Child Support Act 1981, if  C or either of his parents is not habitually resident in this jurisdiction.

The wife is 40 years old and was born in the Republic of Z.  The parties met in 2001 and began a relationship in 2002.  On any view, the relationship was then, and has always been, turbulent and it has, since its inception, been punctuated by separations brought about by ugly incidents in respect of which each party blames the other.  However, in August 2005, as I have already mentioned, their son C was born, and he is eight years old and lives now with the wife as his primary carer in country S where he attends an international school.</span></p>

Between 2006 and 2007 it is obvious they were not in full cohabitation but they were seeing each other periodically. They resumed a full, or fuller, relationship in 2007 and became engaged to be married in 2009.  It was in that year that the wife in fact was studying abroad and obviously they were living in a relationship which was intermittent in terms of their common life together bearing in mind that the husband's work is in country P.</span></p>

For the less than two years category, which is the relevant one for my purposes, the husband agreed that he would procure the repayment, in other words the redemption, of the mortgages on the wife's two flats, and the extension of their leases to the maximum extent available in law.  That redemption of the mortgages, it would seem, would cause the husband to have to find a capital payment of &#163;528,000, and in addition, to extend the leases to the maximum extent available in law would probably be, according to Mr. Marshall QC, who represents the wife, another &#163;250,000.</span></p>

In March 2013 the husband bought, in lieu of the property in country S, referred to in the agreement, an alternative property in country S.  The reason he bought this alternative property is because the developer of the property did not complete the development in time;  the contract that the husband had entered into was consensually cancelled and he decided to buy somewhere else.  He purchased this property for 4 million and it is subject to a 3 million mortgage.  Those figures correspond to &#163;3 million and &#163;2 million respectively.  That was in March of this year and after he bought the property the wife and C lived there.</span></p>

The fact that the wife can advance a claim of &#163;400,000 in order to litigate this issue demonstrates that it is her intention to attack on a wholesale and comprehensive basis the prenuptial agreement that she so recently entered into.</span></p>

The significance of the effluxion of time is, of course, as the Supreme Court explained in paragraph 65, that with the passage of time circumstances eventuate in a way in which the parties have not apprehended, and this is one of the principal reasons why the courts look most carefully at the fairness of justifying an old, in the sense of it happening a long time ago, prenuptial agreement.

First, no agreement can ever be allowed to prejudice the reasonable requirements of a child.  Second, and this is referred to in paragraph 78 of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Granatino v Radmacher</span><span style="font-size:14pt">, is the important principle of autonomy, that respect should be accorded to the decision of a married couple as to the manner in which their financial affairs should be regulated, particularly where the agreement addresses existing circumstances and not merely the contingencies of an uncertain future.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The principle of autonomy is, in my view, extremely relevant.  In many cases, and this case is an obvious one, the parties entering into the agreement are sophisticated, highly intelligent and have the benefit of the best legal advice that money can buy. Where in those circumstances they have thrashed out an agreement, which they have both then freely signed, in my view, heavy respect should be accorded to that decision.  The question of autonomy is particularly relevant where the agreement seeks to protect premarital property.  This is clear from paragraph 79 of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Granatino v Radmacher</span><span style="font-size:14pt">, and in this case that is exactly what the agreement was intended to achieve.  As it says on its first page, it is intended to confirm their separate property interests.  By contrast, if the agreement sought to allocate money yet to be earned in a way which was disproportionately in favour of the earner rather than the home-keeper, then, as the Supreme Court point out in paragraphs 80 and 81, it may well be easier to find that the agreement is unfair.</span></p>

If the agreement had the effect of leaving one partner in a predicament of real need, while the other enjoys a sufficiency or more, then such a result is likely to be unfair.  However, the Supreme Court pointed out in paragraph 119 that a predicament of real need, at least on the facts of that case, was merely one that did not leave the claimant, Mr. Granatino, in a state of destitution.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">So that deals with the circumstances which might inform the question of whether the agreement was fair or not.  What then did the Supreme Court say about how to determine whether an agreement has been freely entered into with a full appreciation of its implications?  In paragraph 69 it was stated that there is no rule at all that full disclosure, or full legal advice, is a necessary pre-condition for the satisfaction of this criterion.  On the contrary, the question is in the individual case whether there has been a material lack of disclosure, or a material lack of information, or a material lack of legal advice.  I venture the opinion that usually -- and that is in the usual run of cases and not a case when one is dealing with such a highly intelligent sophisticate as Mr. Granatino -- a full appreciation of the implications will normally carry with it a requirement of having at least enough legal advice to appreciate what one is giving up; but in this case the question of legal advice does not arise, because the legal advice here came from the most high quality sources.  The question is whether the husband here gave sufficient disclosure, and it is important to understand that the disclosure in question, as the Supreme Court pointed out in paragraph 69, is that which is necessary to permit the party to reach a decision that is material. As the Supreme Court put it, "What is important is that each party should have all the information that is material to his or her decision".  That does not require &#8220;full and frank disclosure&#8221; (as Mr. Marshall repeatedly put it); it requires only a sufficiency of disclosure to enable a free decision to be made.</span></p>

It was only on questioning Mr. Marshall that some light began to be shone on this.  Mr. Marshall explained to me that the wife's case will be -- and it is perhaps a signification of one of the defects of our system that we do not have a system of pleading, so that until the husband heard it from Mr. Marshall's mouth, he actually had no idea at all what case he was facing in relation to the repudiation of the agreement -- that, first, the husband was guilty of material non-disclosure; and, second, that there were circumstances surrounding the signature of the agreement, particularly relating to the haste with which it was formed, which should lead the court to conclude, applying Lord Phillips' test, that it would be unfair to apply the agreement.

In the absence of any evidence of that nature from the wife, it is my judgment that it is appropriate for me to seek to apply the agreement to this case as closely as I can, provided that the wife is not left in any real predicament of need.  In these circumstances, I am satisfied that the proposal advanced by Mr. Molyneux in paragraph 8 of his skeleton argument is reasonable and should be adopted.  The fact that the parties may have agreed further things is no concern of mine.

That cost to the husband Mr. Molyneux calculates at &#163;2,300 per month, which is in effect the cost of the additional mortgage of &#163;1 million that was taken out.  Put another way, if this property had cost &#163;2 million and they had a &#163;1 million mortgage, the husband would be saving &#163;2,300 per month in mortgage repayments.  Secondly, &#163;675 a month will be credited, being half of the service charges and bills referable to the fact that this property is jointly owned. Thirdly, that if the wife wishes to occupy the husband's property in Y Street, there should be a credit of &#163;2,750 per month, being as calculated by Mr. Molyneux the net rental cost and service charge.  On the other hand, if she chooses not to occupy Y Street, then that credit would not be given.  The husband has agreed to pay the medical bills in relation to the pregnancy and in addition C's school fees, and the latter is provided for by the agreement.</span></p>

The husband accepts, through Mr. Molyneux, that if the wife's claim is found to have merit, and the wife has as a result incurred unnecessary interest on these litigation loans, then the husband will have to discharge that interest.
