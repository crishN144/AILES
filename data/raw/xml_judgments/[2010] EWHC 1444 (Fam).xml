The Applicant contends that Schedule 1 is not confined to those who have the status of parent but permits the application of a fact sensitive, welfare informed, approach to the determination of who is a parent within the scope of Schedule 1.  On the application of such an approach, the Applicant submits that the Respondent is a parent.</p>

This followed a joint application by the Applicant and the Respondent for the Applicant to receive treatment by way of artificial insemination.

This contained a comprehensive review of this subject and addressed, among other issues, the issue of the paternity of children conceived by artificial insemination by a third party donor.  The proposal in the Working Paper in respect of such children was limited to proposing that &#8220;where a married woman has received AID treatment with her husband&#8217;s consent, the husband rather than the donor should, for all legal purposes, be regarded as the father of a child conceived as a result&#8221;.  The 1982 Report (<span style="font-style:italic">Illegitimacy</span>, Law Com No 118) summarised the legal position as being that: &#8220;the donor, not the mother&#8217;s husband, is the legal father of an AID child&#8221; (para. 12.1).  The Report recommended that the legal position should change as proposed in the Working Paper.</p>

Thus the meaning of &#8220;parent&#8221; in a school prospectus will include a person with de facto parental responsibility even if not a natural parent but exclude a natural parent who has no contact with the child.  On the other hand, the meaning of &#8220;parent&#8221; in a work on genetics will be the biological parents, including a father who has no more connection than the initial act of fertilisation.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;[32]&#160;&#160;&#160;So what is the significance of the fact of parenthood?  It is worthwhile picking apart what we mean by &#8216;natural parent&#8217; in this context.  There is a difference between natural and legal parents.  Thus, the father of a child born to unmarried parents was not legally a &#8216;parent&#8217; until the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1987/42" uk:canonical="1987 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Reform Act 1987</ref> but he was always a natural parent.  The anonymous donor who donates his sperm or her egg under the terms of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990</ref> is the natural progenitor of the child but not his legal parent: see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37/section/27" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss 27</ref> and 28 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1990 Act</ref>.  The husband or unmarried partner of a mother who gives birth as a result of donor insemination in a licensed clinic in this country is for virtually all purposes a legal parent, but may not be any kind of natural parent: see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37/section/28" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s&#160;28</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1990&#160;Act</ref>.  To be the legal parent of a child gives a person legal standing to bring and defend proceedings about the child and makes the child a member of that person&#8217;s family, but it does not necessarily tell us much about the importance of that person to the child&#8217;s welfare.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[33]&#160;&#160;&#160;There are at least three ways in which a person may be or become a natural parent of a child, each of which may be a very significant factor in the child&#8217;s welfare, depending upon the circumstances of the particular case.  The first is genetic parenthood: the provision of the gametes which produce the child.  This can be of deep significance on many levels. For the parent, perhaps particularly for a father, the knowledge that this is &#8216;his&#8217; child can bring a very special sense of love for and commitment to that child which will be of great benefit to the child (see, for example, the psychiatric evidence in<span style="font-style:italic"> Re C (MA) (an infant) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1966] 1 WLR 646" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1966">[1966] 1 WLR 646</ref>).  For the child, he reaps the benefit not only of that love and commitment, but also of knowing his own origins and lineage, which is an important component in finding an individual sense of self as one grows up.  The knowledge of that genetic link may also be an important (although certainly not an essential) component in the love and commitment felt by the wider family, perhaps especially grandparents, from which the child has so much to gain.</p>

While this may be partly for reasons of certainty and convenience, it also recognises a deeper truth: that the process of carrying a child and giving him birth (which&#160;may well be followed by breast-feeding for some months) brings with it, in the vast majority of cases, a very special relationship between mother and child, a relationship which is different from any other.</p>

The phrase &#8216;psychological parent&#8217; gained most currency from the influential work of Goldstein, Freud and Solnit, <span style="font-style:italic">Beyond the Best Interests of the Child</span> (Free Press, 1973), who defined it thus:</p>

His contribution is also unique.  In&#160;these days when more parents share the tasks of child rearing and breadwinning, his contribution is often much closer to that of the mother than it used to be; but there are still families which divide their tasks on more traditional lines, in which case his contribution will be different and its importance will often increase with the age of the child.</p>

He submits that the decision of whether the Respondent is a parent for the purposes of Schedule 1 is a fact sensitive decision and one in which welfare should inform what he calls the discretionary process.  He submits that, by application of this process to the very special circumstances of this case, the Respondent is a parent for the purposes of Schedule 1.  He relies on the fact that the parties to this application agreed to participate jointly in the child&#8217;s birth and that they both then took on the role of the child&#8217;s parents, roles which they continue to exercise.</p>

He relies on the passages from Baroness Hale&#8217;s speech in <span style="font-style:italic">Re G </span>(cited above) in which she identifies the ways in which a person may become a natural parent.  Mr Hayden submits that it would be &#8220;nonsense&#8221; for the definition of parent to be given a broad construction for the purposes of welfare decisions but a narrow construction for the purposes of financial relief under Schedule 1.

Turning to Schedule 1, paragraph 16, the paragraph in which the word &#8220;parent&#8221; is defined, he relies on the use of the word &#8220;includes&#8221; as demonstrating that this definition cannot have been intended to be exclusive.  It is a floor not a ceiling and the question of whether someone is a parent is to be determined by reference to the factual matrix underpinning the relationship between adult and child &#8211; it is a discretionary decision.  Mr Goldrein submits that the context of Schedule 1 embraces welfare which is part of and informs the determination of whether a person is or is not a parent within its provisions.</p>

Mr Hyde submits that the acquisition of parental responsibility does not make a person, who would not otherwise be a parent, a parent.  In this context he relies on <span style="font-style:italic">M v C and Calderdale MBC</span>.  There are, he submits, distinct categories namely parents, parents with parental responsibility (a sub-set of parents) and others with parental responsibility.  He points to the existence of a wide group of people who might have parental responsibility as a result of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37/section/12/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12(2)</ref> (which provides that for the duration of any residence order, the person in whose favour the order has been made shall have parental responsibility) but who would not as a result become parents.  They are in many respects placed in the position of a parent but they are not a &#8220;parent&#8221; for the purposes of the Children Act.  Otherwise, he submits that, for example, grandparents in whose favour there was a residence order, would become parents for the purposes of Schedule 1.  Put simply, he submits that the acquisition of parental responsibility by a person does not result in them becoming a &#8220;parent&#8221;.  They are in the position of a parent &#8211; as defined by section 3(1) of the Children Act &#8211; but they do not thereby become a parent as that term is used in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/10" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 10</ref> and Schedule 1 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.</p>

As Mr Goldrein submits, a broader interpretation would enable the court to require those who objectively should contribute financially for a child to contribute.  On the other hand, as Mr Hyde submits, this would create considerable uncertainty because the boundaries of such a determination would be unclear and essentially discretionary.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have come to the clear conclusion that those against whom orders can be made under Schedule 1 are confined to those who are a parent in the legal meaning of that word.   I have come to that conclusion because in my view, as a matter of statutory interpretation, Schedule 1 is confined to those who have the status of parent (as expressly extended by paragraph 16).  It is not in my view a discretionary welfare informed decision, as submitted by Mr Goldrein, but a matter of status.  I have been persuaded that this is the correct interpretation largely because I have been persuaded that Mr Hyde&#8217;s submissions are correct.</p>

I accept Mr Goldrein&#8217;s submission that there have been significant social advances since 1992 but these do not in my view undermine the effect of this decision.  The attribution of legal parentage has not changed since 1992 save as a result of statutory reform.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, whilst Mr Goldrein can rely on references to the meaning of the word parent changing according to the context, in the context of jurisdiction under the Children Act, namely under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/10" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 10</ref>, it has been decided that parent means biological parent (or other persons who are parents by operation of law).  This is the clear effect of <span style="font-style:italic">Re A</span> and, although a passing reference, is supported by Baroness Hale&#8217;s comments in <span style="font-style:italic">Re G</span> [11].  The applicant in <span style="font-style:italic">Re G</span> was in the same factual position as the Respondent in the present case but, per Baroness Hale, she <span style="font-style:italic">required</span> leave to apply for a section 8 order which she would not have done if she was a &#8220;parent&#8221; by virtue of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/10/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 10(4)</ref>(a).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment the interpretation of parent in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/10" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 10</ref> gives a better guide to the likely meaning of parent in Schedule 1 than the broader analysis of the meaning of &#8220;natural parent&#8221; given by Baroness Hale when considering this issue in the context of welfare.  I agree with Mr Goldrein that in some contexts it is appropriate to give the word parent a broader definition and include a social and psychological parent.  But in my view Schedule 1 is not using the word &#8220;parent&#8221; in a broad welfare informed sense but is confined to legal parent.  I agree with Bracewell J, when she said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B</span>, that if Parliament had intended to alter or amend the general principles as to parenthood, specific enactment would have been made.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This conclusion is supported by the approach taken by the Court of Appeal to the determination of the issue of parenthood in <span style="font-style:italic">J v C</span>.  The issue was determined by reference to the statutes which define parenthood in the context of AID, not by a broad factual analysis as proposed by Mr Goldrein in the present case.  In order to determine whether the applicant was a parent for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/10" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 10</ref> of the Children Act, Wall LJ determined whether he was within the relevant statutory definition of parent as contained in the &#8220;Two Acts of Parliament which define parenthood in the context of AID&#8221; [18].  In my view, I should apply the same approach to the determination of whether the Respondent in this case is a parent within the meaning of Schedule 1.  Adopting this approach, it is not contended that the Respondent is a parent.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Further, in my view, this conclusion is supported by the structure of Schedule 1.  If Mr Goldrein&#8217;s submissions were correct, a person could be a parent by the application of his extended definition as well as by application of the extended definition within paragraph 16.  The former would make the latter unnecessary but it would also cause potential difficulties in the application of paragraph 2, to which the extended definition under paragraph 16 does not apply.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">What is the effect of the Respondent&#8217;s obtaining an order for shared residence?  As a result she has acquired parental responsibility which is defined by section 3 of the Children Act as meaning &#8211; &#8220;all the rights, duties, powers, responsibilities and authority which by law a parent of a child has in relation to the child and his property&#8221;.  This might appear a persuasive point save for the fact that the mere obtaining of parental responsibility is clearly not intended to make someone a legal parent when they would not otherwise be such.  As identified in <span style="font-style:italic">M v C and Calderdale MDC</span> parents with parental responsibility are a sub-set of parents.  And, as stated in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A</span>, a person who acquires parental responsibility &#8220;does not thereby become&#8221; a parent.  Otherwise many people (I have already given the example of grandparents) would become a parent when plainly they are not.</p>

To adapt Bracewell J&#8217;s conclusion in <span style="font-style:italic">Re M</span>  - a person is a parent if they are either a biological parent or if they become a parent by operation of law.  If someone acquiring parental responsibility does not thereby become a parent, the doctrine of estoppel cannot, in my view, assist the Applicant to procure this result on the same factual basis by an alternative route.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In some respects the outcome in this case may seem objectively surprising.  However, in my view it is for the legislature to determine who should be financially responsible for children if it is to extend beyond those who are legal parents or are otherwise within Schedule 1, paragraph 16.  If I were to extend the definition to include anyone who has acted <span style="font-style:italic">as</span> a parent, I do not see how I could properly define the limits of such an extended definition in a way which would provide sufficient legal certainty.  The potential breadth is demonstrated by Mr Goldrein&#8217;s inclusion of foster parents and &#8220;common law&#8221; parents in his proposed definition.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In conclusion, in my view, the word &#8220;parent&#8221; in Schedule 1 means legal parent.  As I have just said, it is also my view that it is for the legislature to determine who should be liable to financial claims for the benefit of children and in particular the extent to which it includes those who are not the legal parents of children but are either to be treated as parents or are otherwise to be made liable.  It is not for the courts to determine, by reference to an essentially discretionary test, that a person should in the circumstances of the particular case be treated as a parent and thereby potentially have the financial obligations imposed by Schedule 1.</p>
