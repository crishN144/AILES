	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an unusual case. It is an application by a married couple, who are of Asian origin, but British citizens, to adopt a young man, now aged nine and a half, who has lived with them, effectively, for his whole life.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The essential background facts and circumstances are as follows. The applicants are now aged in their mid to late fifties and are married to each other. In about July 2005, a lady named F Y travelled to England and spent a period of time residing with these applicants at their home in Greater London. F Y had with her three children, whom she said were her own children. The youngest of the three children was C, to whom this application now relates. C had been born in early 2005. Therefore, at that time, he was only about six months old.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">F Y and her three children resided at the home of these applicants until about the end of 2005. She then returned to Pakistan, taking with her the two eldest of her children, but leaving with these applicants her third and youngest child, C. By then, C was about 11 months old.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within the bundle now before the court, there is a document described as a statutory declaration made by somebody purporting to be F Y on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2005. Within this declaration, she says that she has decided that it is in the best interests of C for him to stay in the United Kingdom with the applicants, &#8220;with view to ultimate adoption&#8221; by them. She attached various documents to that statutory declaration, including a copy of her own passport.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These two applicants do not have other children from their marriage. As I understand it, there have been difficulties with conception. However, the male applicant did also marry another lady and had other children by her. C has a close relationship with those other children and regards them as his brothers. It was only very recently, during the course of these proceedings, that C was first told that he is not the genetic or biological son of these applicants, but is somebody who has simply lived with them for, effectively, all of his life.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">C only has time limited permission to remain in the United Kingdom. This was recently extended by the Secretary of State for the Home Department  until November 2016. If an adoption order is made, that will have the effect that he attains British citizenship and is able to live here for the rest of his life if he wishes. As a result, it was important to engage the Secretary of State for the Home Department in these proceedings, so that she could participate and, if she thought fit, resist the making of an adoption order.</p>

Paragraph 1 of that order made clear that the adoption application would be listed for final hearing here, today, 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2014.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am not willing, on the facts and in the circumstances of this case, to treat the statutory declaration to which I have referred, which dates from as long ago as 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2005, as being a consent from the mother that satisfies the requirements of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. It may well be that, in this case, consent could and should be dispensed with on the ground that the welfare of the child requires the consent to be dispensed with. However, in my view, it is more appropriate to focus on the reality of this particular case, which is that neither the mother nor the father, whoever he may be, of this child can now be found.</p>

In her very thorough report, Ms F-T describes the lengths to which she has gone to try and track down either the mother or any father of this child. She has clearly made exhaustive enquiries within Pakistan and has come to the clear conclusion, for good reasons that are explained in the report, that it is simply impossible now to track down or trace either parent of this child.</p>

There may, no doubt, be cases and situations in which, if vast resources and a considerable number of people were engaged for a significant amount of time in trying, by detective work, to track somebody down, it might be possible to do so. However, even in a situation as grave and final as adoption, there must be some limits to which Parliament intended applicants and, ultimately, the court to go in trying to find birth parents who have simply disappeared.</p>

However, the only identified person corresponding to the name she gave has been tracked down in Pakistan and he resolutely denied paternity of the child concerned and strongly asserted that he only had two daughters by a wife, who had indeed since died. DNA testing was subsequently done, which precluded that gentleman from being the genetic father of this child.</p>

There has been a very thorough investigation into the circumstances of these applicants and the circumstances in which this child has lived and is living, by a social worker, J T, of the local authority for the area in which the family live.  Her report, dated 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2014, clearly concludes that this child has been, and is being, very well brought up by these applicants and thrives in their care.</p>
