	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this tragic case I am concerned with the welfare of a little girl called P (initial chosen randomly) who is two years old. The welfare issue before the court is one of the hardest which a judge of the Family Division ever has to determine, namely whether life-sustaining treatment should be withdrawn. On 30 November 2023, whilst she was at home, P suffered serious injury. When paramedics arrived, P was in cardiac arrest with no discernible heartbeat. She was intubated at the scene and taken to hospital, P has never regained consciousness and is currently ventilated and sedated on the paediatric intensive care unit of a large hospital. P has a devastating brain injury which is not treatable and from which she will never recover. The prognosis is that her condition will continue to deteriorate and she will eventually die. The hospital trust has made an application for declarations pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court that it is not in P&#8217;s best interests for life-sustaining medical treatment to be continued and it is in her best interests for a palliative care regime to be implemented. I am asked to decide whether those declarations are in P&#8217;s best interests. If I decide they are, the inevitable consequence is that P will die.</p>

P&#8217;s mother (&#8220;the mother&#8221;) was represented by Mr Nicholas Stonor KC and Miss Sarah Kilvington and P&#8217;s father (&#8220;the father&#8221;) was represented by Miss Jacqueline Thomas KC and Miss Kalsoom Maqsood. The local authority was represented by Miss Lorraine Cavanagh KC and Miss Lauren Maires. I am profoundly grateful to all the advocates for the manner in which this most sensitive of applications was litigated. Their respective clients could not have asked for better representation.</p>

Following time to take instructions with the assistance of interpreters, both parents left it to the court to decide what was best for P. Their advocates made clear that the parents wished P might continue to be ventilated but recognised the weight of the medical evidence in favour of discontinuing treatment. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">No party invited me to hear any oral evidence given the unanimity of views expressed by the medical experts instructed on behalf of both the trust and the parents. After I had announced my decision, both parents addressed the court, asking to spend as much time with their daughter as possible before she died. With the assistance of the hospital, the local authority and others, I was able to accommodate some of what the parents requested but, because the mother is a prisoner on remand awaiting a criminal trial, I sadly could not grant the mother her wish to spend a last night by her daughter&#8217;s bedside. </p>

The mother does not speak English and requires the assistance of an interpreter. The mother is heavily pregnant and is due to give birth to her third child at the end of February 2024. The father is profoundly deaf and non-verbal and communicates using family signs at home and can understand international sign language. I note that the father spent a number of years living in another European country before moving to the UK. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">P was born in X. The mother left X shortly after her birth to join the father in this jurisdiction. At that time, P was just a fortnight old and was thereafter cared for by her paternal grandmother and her paternal aunt. Her mother had video call contact with her from time to time. In September 2023, P arrived in the UK to join her parents and her younger sister, Q, now aged 15 months. In X, it appears that P&#8217;s main carer was her paternal aunt who took P everywhere with her. P was very close to her paternal aunt and loved playing in the garden with her and going to the shops. P&#8217;s mother and grandmother told the children&#8217;s social worker about P&#8217;s love of ice-cream and of an occasion when P distracted a friend by tapping her arm so that she could steal a lick of her friend&#8217;s ice-cream. P was described as a smiling and clever little girl with a good memory who loved music and, whenever she heard music, liked to dance. Her father said P was an affectionate child who loved cuddles and falling asleep in her parents&#8217; arms.</p>

It took some 20 minutes for the paramedics to gain entry to the family home and eventually the mother opened the door holding P in her arms. P was in a state of cardiac arrest and asystolic. The paramedics managed to achieve a return of spontaneous circulation and P was intubated at the scene. P arrived at hospital at 19.21 and, on assessment in the Emergency Department, she was unresponsive with unreactive pupils. She was noted to be cold and her peripheral circulation was poor. It was thought P had experienced a loss of cardiac output for at least 30 minutes. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In addition to her devastating head injury, P was also found to have a number of other injuries which raised suspicion about the care she had received from her parents. These injuries included multiple retinal haemorrhages in her right eye; a healing fracture of her right posterior 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> rib; and likely recent fractures of her right posterior sixth, seventh and eighth ribs. A police protection order was executed on the evening of 1 December 2023 and Q was placed in foster care where she remains. The relevant local authority issued care proceedings on 4 December 2023 and both P and Q were made the subjects of interim care orders. Alongside those proceedings, a police investigation commenced to establish how and by whom P came to be injured in the family home. P&#8217;s mother has been charged with an offence relating to P&#8217;s care and is presently on remand in prison.</p>

The pattern of brain injury was thought to reflect trauma to P&#8217;s head as well as hypoxia or lack of oxygen following a cardiac arrest. On 4 December 2023, sedation was discontinued to allow for an assessment of P&#8217;s neurological status. In spite of being weaned from sedation, P showed no sign of responsiveness. Her Glasgow Coma Score is 3 and she has unreactive pupils together with no cough or gag reflex. A further MRI scan was performed on 12 December 2023 and this showed further deterioration of her very extensive brain damage.</p>

Airway support was given, but in spite of this, P had a very abnormal breathing pattern and her oxygen levels fell in spite of being on 100% oxygen. This incident demonstrated that P will not manage without intubation and ventilation. </p>

Directions to facilitate the hearing before me were given by Henke J on 23 January 2024. Permission was given to the parents and the children&#8217;s Guardian to obtain an expert opinion on P&#8217;s condition and, in accordance with that direction, I note that Dr Patrick Davies, consultant in paediatric intensive care at Nottingham Children&#8217;s Hospital, saw P on 2 February 2024 and provided a report dated 3 February 2024.</p>

At the directions hearing before Henke J, both parents had interpreters and no communication difficulties were evident. The father had the benefit of an interpreter in international sign language who confirmed to the court that they could communicate effectively with the father. However, the father&#8217;s legal team had huge concerns about his capacity to give instructions and to participate effectively in the proceedings. On 5 February 2024, I made a direction at the request of the father&#8217;s legal team, inviting the Official Solicitor to act on behalf of the father. However, she declined that invitation because there had been no capacity assessment of him. I also made a direction that the father should have the benefit of the same intermediary who was assisting him in the care proceedings.</p>

In a position statement, Miss Thomas KC explained that she had no instructions from her client but had been strongly advised by the intermediary that there were insufficient safeguards to ensure that the father could properly understand and engage with the proceedings. Appended to her position statement was an email from the intermediary requesting that the hearing be adjourned until appropriate language and psychological assessments had been completed. Additionally, it had been directed that the father would have the benefit of both an international sign language interpreter and a British sign language interpreter but only the international sign language interpreter arrived at court. I allowed time for the father&#8217;s legal team both to establish the effectiveness of his communication via that interpreter and to take father&#8217;s instructions with the assistance of the intermediary. </p>

On investigation, those concerns were misplaced since the father was able to communicate effectively with the interpreter. I found myself troubled by what appeared to be a less than helpful attitude shown by the intermediary who did not appreciate firstly, the need for cooperation during an urgent hearing which could not be adjourned and, secondly, the pressures on both parents but particularly the mother who was due to undergo a scan on her unborn child on 9 February 2024 because concerns had been expressed about poor intrauterine growth. However, once I had delivered a firm message about the necessity for cooperation to the intermediary, the father&#8217;s legal team were able to take instructions and satisfy themselves that the father could participate effectively during the hearing.</p>

There was no prospect of any recovery. Whilst P was not yet in organ failure, P was likely to deteriorate over time.

She has no meaningful interaction with the world around her and is unresponsive to external stimuli. She is likely to experience pain when being ventilated and suctioned (to assist with her ventilation) but cannot demonstrate any response to pain in order to show the medical and nursing staff how she is feeling. Ventilation through an endotracheal tube is known to be uncomfortable and distressing and a patient with awareness and the ability to express their reaction would inevitably struggle against ventilation to try and remove that discomfort. The need for suction to clear P&#8217;s secretions needs to be done regularly and is also a very unpleasant and uncomfortable experience. Monitoring of P&#8217;s blood gases requires regular blood tests which are painful and unpleasant. The only benefit of continuing with these interventions would be the prospect of some recovery to offer a balance against the burdens of treatment currently being experienced by P. There was no such prospect in P&#8217;s case and thus no benefit or justification in continuing.</p>

She concluded that P had sustained a devastating neurological injury which was irreversible. P was dependent on others for all aspects of her care and had lost the ability to enjoy her life. It was hard to know whether she was experiencing pain: her muscle spasms in response to the innocuous movements of her limbs required during normal nursing care would be painful for someone who was conscious. However, the absence of an observed response to painful stimuli should not equate with an acceptance that P should be exposed to such stimuli because there was no benefit to enduring them. Dr Reynolds agreed with Dr A that continued mechanical ventilation should be withdrawn in a managed way with appropriate pain relief so that P could die in the presence of her parents. P may breathe for a period of time after ventilation was withdrawn but, if this occurred, re-intubation and connection to mechanical ventilation should not be introduced.</p>

Since the time she was injured, there has been no improvement and indeed P had deteriorated overall. P was not dead from a circulatory perspective because her heart continued to beat and she would also not fit a diagnosis of brain stem death as she could trigger some breaths and her pupils had some reaction. However there was extensive and severe damage to P&#8217;s brain, particularly in her cortex. This part of the brain was responsible for all higher functions including movement, learning, and communication. Without a functioning cortex, P had no ability to be conscious and would never be able to move, think, learn, or communicate. If there was any hope of improvement, this would have become apparent by now and thus the extent of P&#8217;s brain damage was permanent. There were no interventions which could improve her brain function.</p>

P demonstrated no clear pain response but did have episodes of dystonia on stimulation which was likely to be very painful. Continuing intervention involved many invasive procedures which were known to be painful and would at some point inevitably lead to a fatal complication. Though it was technically possible to care for a child on intensive care for many years, this would only be ethical if there was any chance of meaningful survival. P had lost all her dignity, and compassionate extubation and high quality palliative care were in her best interests.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Throughout the hearing, the parents conducted themselves with immense dignity. However, no one who was in court could fail to have been moved by their pain and distress. Those emotions sprang from an understanding of the relevant medical evidence about P&#8217;s condition which had been summarised at my suggestion in plain and unambiguous language by the Trust. The parents&#8217; hope that P might have more time to recover originated in their love for her and in a belief that she might, even now, overcome her devastating injury. Their strong Islamic faith also influenced their stance. Though they did not challenge the evidence or make submissions opposing the Trust&#8217;s application, I have assumed that they would want their child to live and would not want her treatment to be withdrawn. Both made clear they left the ultimate decision to me. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The relevant medical evidence in this case is unanimous and stark. I accept that P has sustained a catastrophic brain injury from which she will never recover and for which there is no treatment which might improve her functioning. The extent of the damage to P&#8217;s brain is severe and renders her unable to interact with the world around her. She will never again be the little girl who loved to dance and eat ice-cream. Her condition has deteriorated since she was admitted to hospital and I accept the evidence of Dr A that she is likely to deteriorate with time as her brain continues to atrophy and die. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">P&#8217;s treatment comprises artificial ventilation by endotracheal tube together with the ancillary tasks which render that intervention practical. Though it is unclear whether P experiences pain, the maintenance of ventilation by, for example, suctioning is known to cause pain and discomfort in those who are not deeply unconscious as P presently is. Moreover, P&#8217;s presentation has developed during her time in hospital. Dr Davies&#8217; clinical examination showed her to be experiencing severe muscle spasms which are known to be very painful. I am satisfied that P&#8217;s quality of life is very poor indeed and that she is more likely than not to be in pain. P cannot signal her pain or distress &#8211; it can only be intuited from what clinical experience tells us that others experience when artificially ventilated. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am satisfied that P has reached the limit of what medical intervention can achieve for her and she is deteriorating slowly but surely. There is no discernible benefit to P from continuing with treatment other than the preservation of life itself and the burdens of her treatment are onerous and likely causing her pain which she cannot communicate. I have factored into my thinking what P&#8217;s attitude to treatment might have been, assuming that, in accordance with her Islamic faith, she would have wished for treatment to continue but, as her parents did, accepted the weight of the medical evidence against this. The strong presumption in favour of taking all steps to preserve life is not absolute and must be weighed in the balance against other factors to arrive at a best interests decision for P. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">With a heavy heart and on the basis of the above analysis, I have concluded that P&#8217;s best interests are served by permitting the Trust to withdraw invasive treatment in accordance with the palliative care plan so carefully negotiated by the advocates in conjunction with the clinical team treating P. That plan envisages extubation and the removal of assisted ventilation in the presence of P&#8217;s parents who will be able to stay with her until she dies, whether that time be calculated in minutes, hours or even days. This will be a carefully managed process with medical staff on hand to ensure that P has appropriate pain relief and sedation to make her as comfortable as possible. P&#8217;s extended family will also be permitted to say goodbye to her and she and her parents will have comfort and support from the hospital imam and their own imam, if he is available.</p>

This process should take place as soon as possible for P&#8217;s sake and the sake of her parents who are under almost unbearable strain.</p>

It also wishes to thank the prison staff who have supported the mother throughout with great compassion and humanity. The police should also be commended for their pragmatic approach to the necessary criminal justice formalities consequential on P&#8217;s treatment being discontinued and her death. The court also thanks the social work team who have gone above and beyond what might have been expected to provide a humane response to P&#8217;s parents. Finally, the court expresses its gratitude to the interpreters who attended court and assisted the parents to communicate but went beyond this in agreeing to help in whatever way they could to facilitate parental contact at the hospital later on 8 February and also on 9 February. </span></p>
