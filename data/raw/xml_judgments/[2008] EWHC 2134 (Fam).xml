An issue has now arisen as to whether the father did in fact consent to one provision in the order. And the raising of that issue has, unhappily, led to delay in the sealing of the order. </p>

The recording starts at 14.18.54, when I entered court to deal with another case, at which point time for the purpose of the digital recording starts to run. The digital timer, which at 14.18.54 was showing 00.00.00, shows that I started to deal with this case at 1.25.15, that is, according to what I will call digital clock time, at 15.44.09. It ended at 2.35.40, that is, according to digital clock time, at 16.54.34. The digital clock was very slightly behind the clock in the court room, for I am recorded at digital clock time 16.19.41 (= 2.0.47) as saying that the time is 4.22. (The discrepancy is, of course, completely irrelevant save for the purpose of &#8216;marrying up&#8217; the digital timer and my recorded reference to 4.22pm.)</p>

Mr Bogle then explained (1.59.12) the insertion in the same paragraph of the reference to FD04F01125, but without saying anything to cast the slightest doubt about the propriety of the reference to the discharge of the father&#8217;s application for a residence order. </p>

I asked Mr Bogle &#8211; he having been nominated for the task by Miss Hudson &#8211; to email me a clean version with all the &#8220;typos&#8221; corrected (2.00.11). I went on to say (2.00.33), &#8220;I will make the order here and now in the terms of this document and on the basis that the final, definitive, text of the order which I hereby pronounce at 4.22 pm on the 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of July 2008 will be in the terms of the document which you will be emailing to me tomorrow.&#8221; Mr Bogle responded, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. I continued (2.00.56) &#8220;But so far as I am concerned, the parties have consented to this order. It seems to me the terms of the order are entirely appropriate and I endorse them, and I have made the order.&#8221; </p>

During the course of this Miss Hudson referred, without challenge (2.15.33), to &#8220;this document, this agreed order&#8221; A little later (2.19.30) Miss Hudson raised the question of whether the order was subject to the rubric. I responded by saying (2.19.38) that that point had now &#8220;gone&#8221; and explaining why. I concluded by saying (2.20.35) that &#8220;the qualification which previously attached to this discussion has gone&#8221;. No-one dissented from that proposition. Following a discussion about costs I suggested (2.30.35) two very slight formal amendments to the paragraph in the order which reserved the matter to me. That was agreed. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is crystal clear that the entire debate before me on 28 July 2008 proceeded on the basis that with only exception (which has nothing to do with the point now in issue) the draft order which had been put before me (at 1.25.18) was agreed in all respects. Likewise it is crystal clear that, this one point of exception having subsequently been resolved by agreement, there came a point (at 1.52.50, repeated at 1.55.11) when I was being invited to proceed on the basis that the draft order was now agreed in <span style="font-style:italic">every </span>respect. Thereafter, in the course of taking me through the draft &#8211; and this, I emphasise was in the presence and hearing of the father &#8211; Ms Hudson made express reference to the fact that the relevant paragraph provided for the &#8220;discharge&#8221; of the father&#8217;s application for a residence order. Since, as had been made clear on more than one occasion prior to this, the whole order was being put before me as an agreed order which, if I approved it, would be expressed as being made, as the draft itself made clear, &#8220;by consent&#8221;, and since there was no comment about, let alone any objection to, this provision, I understood, as any reasonable person in the position of the mother, the guardian and their representatives would have understood, that the father was accepting that this consent order would be containing a provision in the final paragraph providing for the &#8220;discharge&#8221; of his application for a residence order. It was on that basis that, at 4.22pm, I orally pronounced the order. And, in case there was any room for doubt &#8211; and in my mind, both then and now, there was and is no doubt of any kind &#8211; matters were made absolutely clear when a little while later the father signed the order providing in terms &#8220;by consent&#8221; for the &#8220;dismissal&#8221; of his application for a residence order.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In these circumstances, and even assuming for the purpose of argument what I have great difficulty accepting as a fact, namely that the father &#8220;did not understand that he was consenting to the dismissal of his application&#8221;, I do not see how he can now rely upon it as a justification or reason for avoiding the agreement to which he put his signature in the circumstances I have described and which became an order of the court &#8211; albeit unsealed at that stage &#8211; at 4.22pm. Nor, of course, can there be any justification or reason for allowing him to resile from what he agreed and signed, and what he then heard me pronounce as an order of the court, merely because of some subsequent change of heart.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Bogle and Ms Hudson agree that, subject to only two qualifications, the version of the order entitled &#8220;A Final Draft Order (as signed, typos corrected)&#8221; accurately records and correctly reproduces the order signed by the parties at court. The first qualification is, of course, that counsel have corrected a small number of typographical and similar errors. Indeed, the draft has reached with each counsel&#8217;s certificate attached in the following terms:</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;This is to certify that I consider that the above is an accurate copy of the Order as signed by the parties on 29 July 2008 with amendments limited solely to typographical corrections and amendments necessary to make sense of the Order.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have myself checked the text against the signed draft and I am satisfied that each of these corrections or amendments is proper.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The other qualification arises out of the point raised by Ms Hudson in her email of 15 August 2008. By what was quite clearly a slip, the order as signed by the parties did not include the provision for costs which, as the recording of the proceedings demonstrates, I had agreed to make. With the substitution of the word &#8220;assessment&#8221; for &#8220;taxation&#8221; I shall therefore include, as paragraph 29 of the order, the provision as to costs correctly referred to by Ms Hudson. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The order should therefore be sealed in the terms of the draft entitled &#8220;A Final Draft Order (as signed, typos corrected)&#8221; but including as paragraph 29 the words &#8220;There be no order as to costs save detailed assessment of the costs of the child by his Guardian&#8221;. It is appropriate and convenient in the circumstances that the sealed order should reproduce, for the benefit of those who may have to read it in future, the certificates provided by Mr Bogle and Ms Hudson.</p>
