	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I received an explanation from the local authority that the placement order application was made late and after the deadlines set by the court orders I made.  It was sent to the court on 17 November, issued on 22 November 2023.  This is unacceptable.  I raised that in court with counsel as soon as I became aware of this, and asked Ms Bovington to take instructions and give an explanation.  In short, she was instructed that pressure of work and leave in the local authority legal team led to the late issuing.  No-one raised an objection to me continuing to hear the case, but such an application is of the utmost gravity and the issue of it must never been seen as a mere formality.  In future the local authority management team and the legal department must ensure that if an individual worker is on leave or their workload does not allow them to meet the deadline set by the court, that support is offered and work redistributed.  It is disrespectful both to the court and to the mother to issue an application of this gravity late and with no explanation until the judge sought it.</p>

It had not, so I gave directions it must be served straight away and at the time of starting this judgment I understand it has been served, the court manager told me.  I made counsel aware of this situation as soon as I found out this morning by email and sought their views on the way forward.  No objections were made to me giving my judgment, but making it clear that it was not final until the application has been served and an opportunity has been provided to fully consider the detail of that placement application, and if there are any further representations following the service of the application, I will hear them before perfecting the order.  Therefore, I will not perfect the order before 4.00 p.m. on 8 December 2023. </p>

My understanding is that until that is perfected and sealed, my job is not done and I am not, to use the Latin, <span style="font-style:italic">functus officio</span>.

So, in practical terms, the mother has known the local authority case and plans, and the details of the formal application are highly unlikely to have changed the conduct of the case, or indeed her response to it. </p>

Ms George represents P, through her guardian.  The mother is represented by Mr. Wauchope, and she wants P to return home.  The father was originally thought to be a Mr [redacted]  and he, in fact, is on her birth certificate, but a DNA test shows he was not her father.  Mr [redacted], who is another name put forward by the mother and  could not be traced by the DWP order and the inquiries made by the local authority.  The mother in evidence said that she has been in touch with his family and he was not in [country redacted] and he was not in jail, and they wondered if he was dead or alive or was using an alias. </p>

The application was made on 24 August 2022 for an interim care order and on  26 August 2022 District Judge Keating extended the EPO and had ordered for it to be listed.  Sadly, it was not.  The EPO was due to expire at 4.00 p.m. on 2 September.  HHJ Sullivan was the out of hours judge on that date and heard the application to extend out of hours. </p>

By 7 February 2023, the independent social worker had not reported.  There was some confusion around her instruction.  The mother had not done the hair strand test and the putative father, Mr [redacted], had instructed solicitors and wanted a DNA test.  The mother also wanted her new partner to be assessed.  They had been together for one month, and I suggested the mother highlight his role to the independent social worker.  You can see that on B74 of the bundle. </p>

The independent social worker was asked if she could comment on the ability of the mother&#8217;s partner to care for P, and I asked that the redacted version of her report be sent to him and he should come to court if he wanted to be assessed.  If he does not, I said, there would be no further assessment of him.  I made a declaration of non-parentage in relation to Mr [redacted].</p>

The local authority must try to contact him, I said, prior to 3 July 2023 by phone.  There was no hair strand test so I extended time for that, and the mother was given permission to file medical evidence to explain why she has not been able to attend contact.  I do not think that ever has been filed.  We recorded the different spellings of the putative father&#8217;s name and the DWP order did not find him on any of those spellings.  The local authority then made numerous attempts to contact the mother&#8217;s partner.  In short, he has not made an application in his own right to be assessed.</p>

The burden of course is not on the mother.  Much of the evidence in the bundle is hearsay.  So, the police evidence, the social worker&#8217;s original evidence, the comments of  the aunt, Mr [redacted]&#8217;s evidence are all hearsay.  I remind myself of the weaknesses of that type of evidence.  It has not been tested in cross-examination and the weight to be attached to it is for me to determine. </p>

She was a clear and measured witness.  She struck me as someone who had read the bundle with care and gave evidence that she took contemporary notes when discussing things with parents by hand and when observing contact she took electronic notes.  Several of the matters she recorded the mother having said to her were put to her in evidence, with the suggestion that the mother had not said those things but the independent social worker was adamant that she had said them. </p>

She accepted she was off work sick July to September, but was clear that her manager&#8217;s details were available to the mother.  She said she told the mother that P was still seeing the [redacted] family that is the  putative aunt and uncle, but the mother may not have processed this information because she was given other news which she objected to at the same time.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother gave evidence that she was &#8220;not a shit mum&#8221; and that the things that local authority talk about are all in her past.  It is clear to me she loves P and she has got a strong sense of injustice that her travel expenses have not been paid and that P suffered an injury in foster care &#8211; and indeed that the [redacted] family continued to see P without her knowledge even though they pulled out of assessment and were not her biological family.  She frequently spoke over counsel and was rude about the social worker.  She was dismissive of the questions she was asked and did not give a straight answer, but got distracted with what she wanted to tell the court.  She tried to close down any list of questions she did not like.  She did not think that the domestic abuse in her relationships had an impact on P because she was little or she did not see it.  I found the mother&#8217;s evidence shifting and unclear.  Sometimes she said something that I thought might have been meant sarcastically, but it was hard to tell.  It was not clear to me when she wrote down, for example, that first time she came to court, that Mr [redacted] was the father whether she believed that at the time or, as she said in the witness box, it was a throwaway comment because he was there at the birth and on the birth certificate.  She later said in evidence he was never P&#8217;s dad, and they both knew that and it was clear.  She told the independent social worker it was 50/50 as to whether he was the dad.  This was but one of many examples where her oral and written evidence were in a constant state of flux and shifted with each question and answer. </p>

Some of her claims about her past sound as if they could contain an element of fantastical thinking.  She was clear that the independent social worker had been threatened or paid off or corrupted by the [redacted] family, and she said that was 100% fact.  It is clear she is a passionate advocate for her daughter and deeply distressed at the thought that she has not been cared for properly in foster care. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">It is pleaded that the mother has a diagnosis of mixed anxiety and depressive disorder, possible traits of OCD, and there is a possibility that she has emotionally unstable personality disorder.  The mother does not accept in her response that her mental health difficulties have placed P at risk of significant harm.  She asserts her mental health issues no longer affect her and so her care of P will not be impacted upon.  I look back at the report of August 2022 by the perinatal practitioner who said that the mother was referred to the perinatal team on 24 November 2021 by the health visitor due to concerns about her mood fluctuations, domestic violence, depression and anxiety.  She was assessed by a consultant psychiatrist on 23 December 2021 and was initially under consultant care.  Due to concerns, she was allocated a worker.  They think she has a diagnosis of EUPD and is prescribed Sertraline 200 mg but are unsure if it is being taken as prescribed.  She had poor engagement with the service and the worker had only seen her twice.  She also had poor engagement with Family Solutions. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Her diagnosis was that she fits the criteria for depressive disorder with anxiety symptoms, mixed anxiety and depressive disorder.  The psychiatrist was not fully convinced that the mother has OCD, but she could have some traits that could be due to her ongoing anxiety and depressive symptoms.  He says she does have a mental disorder and there is also a possibility of underlying EUPD, which will have an effect on her ability to effectively parent P in the short term and the long term, but with the support of professionals and close monitoring this can be mitigated.  It is not clear to me if the mother actually accepts her diagnosis from the psychiatrist, and in the witness box she said she knows she has mental health issues but has been off her medication for three to four months.  Her written evidence of November 2023 suggests she is still taking her medication and I have no third party evidence about her current compliance with her medication regime.  Again, this is an area where her evidence has shifted. </p>

On 18 August 2022, she said to the local authority she did not collect P from the [redated family] because she had depression and needed a break.  Mr [redacted], in his non-molestation order application, says she sent him a video of her taking 30 Sertraline tablets.  This seems to be supported by I44 of the bundle, the police disclosure, dated 16 September 2022, on which occasion he called the police, telling them that the mother has sent him a video on Instagram of her taking those tablets.  The police found her in a car with packets of tablets.  They record three packets of Sertraline there, and one empty strip with a few missing tablets from the other strips.  The mother became nauseous and was vomiting on the street during her conversation with the police and the ambulance came.  It is not clear what the cause of her presentation was, whether it was due to taking something or due to her diabetes, but either way, she certainly was not well, according to those police reports.  The mother accepts she made suicide attempts by overdosing on insulin when she was 16 and 18, and I will come on to the overdose of insulin in December 2022.</p>

The social worker gave evidence that she asked mother this year, 2023, about her mental health team and was told by the mother she did not have a mental health team.  The mother told me that she was now exercising and that helped her, and that she moved from Sertraline to Prozac before she stopped taking her medication.  There is evidence in the bundle, which I will also look at in more detail later, that the mother can be volatile in contact with the supervisors.  For example, on 14 December 2022 and 8 March 2023 this appears to be the case.  Even if this was not aimed at P, P was exposed to this.  I received evidence from the social worker that the most recent LAC meeting in November 2023 was one in which the mother was unable to remain calm. </p>

The social workers were contacted by the aunt on the 17 August 2022.  She told them that P was dropped off two weeks ago and that the aunt was asked to care for P for two days.

I do not think I need to make an exact finding about who was the victim and who was the aggressor, but certainly this relationship was dysfunctional and destructive, and P was in the mother&#8217;s care for some of this time.  By law under section 3 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 P herself is treated as a victim of such domestic abuse.

She has the ability, I think, to meet her basic care needs.  But some of her behaviours call into question her ability to always be available to P.  The independent social worker saw that she struggled to remain awake during two of the sessions observed and said that was due to her health needs and that suggests at times her physical health might impact on her capacity to be available to her daughter.  The mother was hospitalised in Summer this year due to insulin management and the mother gave evidence this was a mix up with her prescriptions and now she makes sure that she has boxes of medications in reserve.  I have already made a finding about that December 2022 overdose and the incident in September 2022 when she was taken to hospital.  It seems at times the mother&#8217;s diabetes management is so poor that she has been hospitalised. </p>

The mother was rightly concerned that P had an injury in September 2022, and that the child protection medical examiner was concerned that it was not a typical appearance of a scratch.  The examiner was sufficiently concerned they recommended a full skeletal survey, X-ray referral to the LADO, who is the local designated safeguarding officer, and for the police to photograph the matter.  I have asked for those LADO investigation papers.  Ms Bovington will ensure that they are also provided to the mother.  The police investigation concluded with no further action.  The LADO records conclude it was also not possible to determine how the injury was sustained.  The LADO agreed outcome was unsubstantiated and the case was closed. </p>

And it is striking that the mother does not seem to have unpacked with the independent social worker the insulin incident, although she did mention Mr [redacted] stalking and harassing her.  So, the independent social worker was clear that she could not be sure what was true and what was not within what the mother said.  It is submitted that some of those things the mother said may have been said to shock, and that might be right.  But when you are working for your child with others to keep her safe, it is important to be accurate and we need to know what risk there is and in assessing risk what is true and what is not true.  This is a view shared by the guardian, who said that although the mother always answered her phone, the guardian was concerned she had not been open and honest, and that makes it hard to get a complete picture and assess what is going on for P. </p>

A supervision order would only be effective to the extent the mother allows others to advise, assist and befriend her &#8211; and she has been very resistant to that throughout these proceedings.  By way of example, after the insulin incident in early 2023, she was offered an IDVA, but the police say the victim was disengaging with this, stated she had it before and the suspect still got to her.  The social worker recalled that the IDVA had tried to offer a non-molestation order against Mr [redacted] but the mother missed appointments and would not answer their call.  The KFRS referral the police made seems to suggest that the victim was disengaging with this and said she wanted to move back to London. </p>

But against that, the mother  has not being able to work with the social work team or seek their help.  She is volatile and suspicious of professionals and would find it hard to work with others to keep P safe.  She does not see the need for help, so it is hard to see what services could be offered to her.  She did not manage to arrange the independent social worker to come to her home.  She has not been able to make all contact sessions and she has a somewhat chaotic lifestyle.  What she says leads me to think her life is in a state of flux and it is hard to understand the reality of her situation.

As recently as this summer, the mother arrived physically battered at a contact session and whoever was the aggressor in the relationship the mother had with Mr [redacted], the fact is that she has had two abusive relationships in quick succession, and that is deeply destabilising and harmful for P.  She had no real insight into the dangers posed by her choice of company for P.  She has been hospitalised a number of times, related to insulin overdoses and as recently as this summer she was in hospital related to her diabetes management.  If P was returned to her mother and then removed again at this vital stage of her development, that would be very detrimental given the number of changes P&#8217;s head in her life already.  And P would need the local authority involved in her life, at least for the duration of a supervision order, and it seems to me that P could be exposed to further conflict, as happened at the LAC meeting in November, if the mother hears things that people say that she does not agree with. </p>

Adoptions can and do break down and an adoptive family would have all the challenges of raising a child plus the fact that P has had a difficult start in life, and it could impact significantly on P&#8217;s sense of identity self-worth and self-image in the future.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I am satisfied, sadly, that a care order and a placement order are necessary and proportionate orders.  I cannot sadly envisage the mother will be in a position to provide the safe care that comes close to meeting all of P&#8217;s needs within her time frame and I am satisfied that adoption does offer the best way of meeting P&#8217;s needs for permanence and safety and security, </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"> I accept the local authority and the Guardian&#8217;s evidence that this is genuinely a case where nothing else will do for P short of adoption; and that the position is now really so very clear that the child&#8217;s welfare requires me to dispense with the consent of her mother. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I look at contact and the local authority suggests letterbox contact and the guardian gave evidence it would be good if the mother could meet potential adopters, and the level of contact going forward needs to be calibrated by reference to how the mother has responded to this judgment and the impact of her presentation for P. I am clear that the issue of contact needs to be revisited before any adoption order is made in any Annex A report, by reference to the views of the mother and potential adopters, and indeed by reference to the mother&#8217;s reaction to this judgment and the decision of the Court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In my view, letterbox contact once a year is the minimum that should take place and depending on the views of the adopters, and whether the mother can be consistent with that yearly letterbox contact, active consideration should be given to more frequent letterbox contact or even face to face contact if the adopters would countenance it.  And I hope that proper consideration can be given to the mother meeting the adopters, and I sincerely hope that the mother will be involved in life story work for P. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to contact prior to P&#8217;s placement with any potential adopters, it is important that P is not overwhelmed by the mother&#8217;s emotions following this judgment.  I would say that the mother has conducted herself with real dignity it in court today and as long as the mother can emotionally contain any distress, the contacts should remain at the current level until after Christmas.  Thereafter, it should be reduced to once a week for three weeks and then the goodbye contact.  The main thing is that contact is for P&#8217;s benefit and must be structured around her needs. </p>

I do hope that the mother can bring herself to participate in life story work for P and perhaps meet the prospective adopters.  I certainly hope that there will be regular letterbox contact.  It is really important so that P&#8217;s mother knows how she is getting on in the years ahead, and P knows that her mother loves her and cares for her and still thinks of her.</p>
