	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In this matter I am concerned with DZ, aged 10; and SZ, aged 6.  The mother of those children is RZ and the father is HZ.  The family is of Afghan heritage.  Both children reside currently in foster care, having been taken into police protection on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2015 following the service of a forced marriage protection order on the father.  Interim care orders were made in respect of both children in favour of the London Borough of Camden on 14 August 2015.</p>

That application is supported by the mother of the children and the Children&#8217;s Guardian.

The precise circumstances by which the mother came to be in Afghanistan are in issue and I shall deal with this in more detail later.  In the circumstances, whilst I have heard oral evidence from the former and current allocated social workers and from the father, I have not heard evidence from the mother, although she has filed a statement and has been represented at this hearing by Dr George.  Whilst the mother has been in Afghanistan she has given birth to a third child of the family called FZ who is now aged one year and three months old.  FZ is not a subject of these proceedings but is a ward of court.  </p>

That delay has been caused by the need to resolve a difficult issue of disclosure. The reasons that this issue arose, and the manner which it was dealt with are set out in the <span style="font-style:italic">ex tempore</span> judgment that I gave on 12 November 2015.  Save for information concerning the precise current whereabouts of the mother in Afghanistan and information concerning the identity of those who are assisting her in that jurisdiction, it has been possible at this hearing to proceed on the basis of full disclosure of information to the father.  The court is grateful to Ms Carter-Manning for the assistance she has provided as Special Advocate for the father during the case management stage of these proceedings and at the outset of this hearing.</p>

On 23 August 2011 the local authority received a referral from the Police that the mother was the victim of domestic abuse perpetrated by the father and a paternal aunt, QZ and had been locked in a room and prevented from leaving the family home.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Police report states that when the Police visited the home both parents denied any violence.  Following receipt of the referral in relation to that incident, social services undertook an unannounced home visit on 24 August 2011 and the mother was said to have been seen to have visible bruising on her arms and alleged that the father had punched her and that he had been violent towards her since her arrival in the United Kingdom in 2008.  These latter allegations were not and have not been further particularised.  The mother also alleged that the paternal aunt had hit her and DZ.  Both the father and the aunt denied those allegations.  The Police appear to have taken no further action.  The mother makes no allegations of domestic violence against the father in her statement to this court dated 23 September 2015 but has so alleged to those assisting her in Afghanistan.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Following these allegations, the mother and the children were placed in a women&#8217;s refuge on 25 August 2011 before returning home on 31 August 2015, it being said that the mother had minimised the concerns regarding domestic abuse during a Section 47 investigation and had changed her story regarding the origin of her injuries.  During this period DZ alleged that the father had hit her brother SZ using his hand.   The children were made the subject of child in need plans.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In June 2012 the family went to Afghanistan due to a family bereavement.  In August 2012 the father returned, but the mother did not and the children remained with the mother in Afghanistan.  The father contends that the mother was refusing to return to the United Kingdom.  There is no evidence before the court to confirm or refute this contention.</p>

The father informed Social Services that the mother and DZ had remained in Afghanistan.  In March 2013 the local authority closed the case as it appeared that DZ and her mother had not returned and there was no indication that they would return.  SZ remained in the care of his father at this time and there appear to have been no concerns regarding the father&#8217;s care justifying the case remaining open to the local authority.  At some point in 2013 or early 2014 the mother and DZ returned to this jurisdiction.</p>

HZ advised the local authority that DZ had told her that the mother was crying that morning (it would appear to be accepted by all parties that the mother had received news prior to her departure that her sister had been involved a serious accident in Afghanistan) and said that DZ was scared that her father was going to hit her (DZ).  HZ also said that the father had threatened to murder her (HZ) and warned her to stay away from the family.  There is no statement from HZ before the court and it would not appear that the local authority has sought to obtain one.  In the circumstances, what HZ may or may not have said about these matters is only before the court in the form of, at best, second hand hearsay.</p>

The father informed the local authority that the mother had travelled to Afghanistan when she was 8 months pregnant as her sister had been critically injured in a car accident.  The children were seen by social workers and no concerns were raised. The case was again closed due the absence of any identified concerns with respect to the children.</p>

The father told Dr Parsons, the expert psychologist instructed to assess him, and this court that this was against his advice by reason of the advanced state of her pregnancy.  Following giving birth to FZ the mother alleges in her statement that she posted her travel documents back to the father in order that he could apply for travel documents for FZ in England.  She alleges that she has been &#8220;stranded&#8221; in Afghanistan ever since, implying that the father has failed to return her travel documents to her.

For example, when describing the mother&#8217;s allegation the previously allocated social worker, Ms Nevin says in her statement that &#8220;It is believed that an amount of 10,000 USA dollars had been agreed for this marriage&#8221;.  However, it is clear from the minutes of the professionals meeting of 11 August 2015 that the mother said nothing of the sort.  What the mother is actually recorded as saying, in response to a question put to her, is that it would be the case that money is exchanged in respect of a marriage, that she was not sure of the amount and but the &#8220;normal&#8221; rate is $10,000.  Indeed, the mother appears to have made no mention of a dowry in her communications with those assisting her in Afghanistan.   She likewise makes no mention of it in her statement.  As I have recounted, in her meeting with professionals on 11 August 2015 she spoke only of the concept of a dowry in general terms in response to a question asked by professionals.  </p>

It is of note that at this time the local authority did not seek the removal of the children from the care of their father and considered that a forced marriage protection order was sufficient to protect DZ from a forced marriage and to protect both children from removal from the jurisdiction.  Indeed, in her statement to the court Ms Nevin was clear that &#8220;at this time it is not felt that an Interim Care Order is required if a Forced marriage protection order is made by the court.&#8221;</p>

The father exhibits to his statement a letter from his older brother, BZ (together with a copy of BZ&#8217;s passport).  Again, no party disputed the provenance of this letter, although again it is, of course, not a statement of evidence in the proper form.  BZ is the father of the cousin the mother alleged that DZ was to be married to. BZ refutes the allegation of forced marriage, stating that it is beyond his comprehension.</p>

Ms Nevin states that father was unwilling for her to view his WhatsApp messages on the basis that they were &#8220;private&#8221; and that, prior to the phone being given to her, the father had deleted his WhatsApp application and deactivated his Apple email account.

There is no readout from the phone or pictures of the phone.  Further, Ms Nevin is not an expert forensic digital analyst and is not equipped to provide the court with comprehensive evidence on the provenance of what was seen on the father&#8217;s phone. For example, in her final statement Ms Nevin confidently states, in the context of the father conceding he communicated with his brother BZ between June and July 2015, that &#8220;In the call log taken from [the father&#8217;s] phone and in the iCloud backup download there are no calls logged between 22/2/2015 and 18/7/2015.  This suggests that the logs of these calls may have been deleted before the phone was backed up to the iCloud.&#8221;  However, Ms Nevin does not provide, and does not have the expert qualifications to assist the court with any other technical explanations for this situation, for example a back up failure.  Rather, Ms Nevin purports to give opinion evidence and then leaves an adverse implication hanging without further comment.  By contrast, the Digital Forensic Analyst instructed by the Police to examine the phone, very properly, draws no conclusions from the fact that the backup contained no additional data of interest.</p>

In her penultimate statement Ms Nevin contends that she saw on the father&#8217;s phone messages related to a forced marriage passing between the father and the brother of the father whose son it is alleged DZ would be marrying.  Ms Nevin records that on 11 August 2015 that the father&#8217;s brother messaged the father stating &#8220;When y want to came afgh&#8221; and that the reply from the father <span style="font-style:italic">appeared</span> to be &#8220;now&#8221;.  Ms Nevin goes on to observe that there are a number of telephone calls between the father and his brother spanning July and August 2015.

It is not clear from the local authority&#8217;s written closing submissions that this submission is also made in relation to the father&#8217;s alleged wish to have SZ adopted but for the purposes of this judgment I have assumed that it is.  The local authority says that the children should remain in foster care until the mother returns to this jurisdiction in order that her allegations can be adjudicated with her present.  As I have already observed, there is at present no timescale for the mother&#8217;s return.

There are two key elements to this argument.  First, the efficacy of forced marriage protection orders in general and, second, whether the nature and extent of the risks identified in this case are met adequately by a forced marriage protection order.</p>

As will be recalled, the officer&#8217;s evidence was to the effect that a forced marriage protection order does not &#8220;guarantee&#8221; that a person will be stopped from leaving the United Kingdom. As I have recounted above, the officer&#8217;s assertion is based on her contention that not all airlines carry out checks, particularly if tickets are purchased close to the date of travel, and that it is possible to travel to another European country for onward travel without passport checks being undertaken.  </p>

The local authority has adduced no other evidence to support its contention that forced marriage protection orders are ineffective in preventing the removal of children from the jurisdiction for the purposes of forced marriage, for example by way of research or statistical evidence.  I am not aware of any reported cases in which children have been removed from the country despite the existence of a forced marriage protection order and a Port Alert nor have any such cases been drawn to my attention by the advocates.  In the foregoing circumstances, I am not prepared to find that, as a general proposition, forced marriage protection orders are insufficient protection against forced marriage.</p>

Within this context, in deploying the systems of protection available to it the court cannot deal in the creation of certainty but rather must deal in the management of risk.  As such, there can never be a &#8220;guarantee&#8221; that a forced marriage protection order will prevent a child being removed from the jurisdiction for the purpose of a forced marriage.  Indeed, to seek such certainty in every case would be a recipe for disproportionate intervention.</p>

In circumstances where the risk of forced marriage varies from case to case such an approach would result regularly in the risk of disproportionate levels of intervention.</p>

It is possible to envisage cases where, notwithstanding the general position that forced marriage protection orders provide effective protection, there is clear and cogent evidence that the protection afforded by a forced marriage protection order will be circumvented by those bound by that order, for example where there is clear evidence of involvement in people trafficking or smuggling or evidence of prior successful evasion of border controls, such that continued removal under an interim care order is also necessary.  There will be other examples.  Finally, there will, of course, be cases where there are issues above and beyond the risk of forced marriage which may require removal under an interim care order in tandem with a forced marriage protection order.</p>
