Brought by the father, he alleged that Charlie had been abducted from Australia by his mother.  On 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2016, Deputy High Court Judge Verdan QC found that Charlie had not established habitual residence after going to Australia with his mother to live with the father for less than a week.</p>

The jury is entitled to - and should - consider the evidence about propensity in the round. There are two interrelated reasons for this. First the improbability of a number of similar incidents alleged against a defendant being false is a consideration which should naturally inform a jury's deliberations on whether propensity has been proved. Secondly, obvious similarities in various incidents may constitute mutual corroboration of those incidents. Each incident may thus inform another&#8221;. </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On occasion the father would tell her not to tell anyone what had happened and acting immediately afterwards as if nothing had happened.  An example of this was an assault when she was five months pregnant in October 2018.  They were in the shower together at a hotel at Alton Towers and were arguing about another woman, a colleague of the father&#8217;s, R.  He hit her very hard on the top of her head with the showerhead.  She fell to the floor and he hit her again.  What he said was revealing: he said &#8220;Do you think that it was a good idea to say that, with all the stress I am under.  Don&#8217;t you ever<span style="font-weight:bold"/>mention R again.  Do you hear me&#8221;.  Another example of victim blaming.   Of concern to the court was that Charlie was in the bedroom next to the bathroom and the risk is he may well have heard, if not witnessed, what was going on.  </p>

The father damaged S&#8217;s computer by pouring hot water over it then forced her out of the home before only allowing her in if she told him where Q&#8217;s passport was.  This incident was driven by jealousy after he found a message she had sent to a male friend.  S was distressed by this as she lost a number of photographs  (26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2019).  S tells Baptist Care (domestic abuse support body) that the father does not give her money for the baby.

He was either acting in self-defence or the complainants had mental health problems, had blamed the wrong person, had greatly exaggerated what had occurred or they were motivated by money.</p>

Quite often he came out the worst in these incidents.  He said he did not stalk his partners nor coercively control them.</p>

One concern I have is that it is clear from the father&#8217;s evidence that he believes he made a mistake not putting Charlie on the watch list which would have prevented him from leaving Australia.

He monitored S&#8217;s Uber accounts and emails.  From about August 2016, the father encouraged his sister Gto spy on the mother&#8217;s internet searches.

She says she and the father exchanged slight pushes before he pushes her hard with both hands on her torso and she falls out of the shower and onto Q who hits their face on the floor. The police arrive and interview her.  Her first account within about two hours of the incident is as set out above.  She describes a sudden loss of temper to the police.   He told her afterwards and before the police arrived that she fell of her own accord.  That again is typical of the father who victim blames.</span><br/><span style="font-size:11pt">S was reluctant to speak to the police as she herself acknowledges in the video and is concerned that she does not want her allegation to come to this country and be part of these proceedings.  </span></p>

When considering the checklist of behaviours set out in <span style="font-style:italic">F v M</span> above, the following do NOT apply in this case.  The father does not monitor his partner&#8217;s time, he does not force the victim to take part in criminal activity such as shoplifting although I find he has encouraged S to lie to this court, there is no evidence that he has taken anyone&#8217;s wages or benefits, he did not threaten to harm a family pet, there was no question of family &#8216;dishonour&#8217;, there was no suggestion he was going to disclose sexual orientation or HIV status etc.   All the other types of abuse listed apply in this case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue of particular concern for this court is that Q sustained a minor bruise when their mother was pushed out of the shower by the father in May 2020 and Charlie was in the next room when in October 2018 the father was battering S to the ground with a showerhead in an argument in the <span style="font-style:italic">en suite</span> when she was five months pregnant.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">With domestic abuse at this level and with the number of incidents there have been over a 20 year period, there is a risk that the father&#8217;s children will get caught in the crossfire or damaged emotionally by hearing violent arguments occurring between the father and whichever partner he happens to be with.  In my view those issues explain the father&#8217;s lies, he knows his past is littered with complaints of domestic abuse raised by his partners.  I also consider that he is unable to accept he is ever in the wrong.  He always blames others including the victims of his assaults for what he did to them.  This is not a man who is just assertive, stubborn and plain selfish, this is a man who is an obvious and continuing risk to his partners.  </p>
