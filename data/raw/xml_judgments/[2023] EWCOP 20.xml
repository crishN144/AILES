I declined to make the declaration sought and said that I would give reasons later. Given the subject matter there was no urgency about the reasons. Unfortunately, various other matters intervened, and I sincerely apologise to the parties for the great delay in producing this reasoned judgment.</p>

At that stage the plan was to induce labour on Tuesday 2 August, i.e. 2 working days after the bundle was sent. This was in circumstances where the Trust had been aware of T&#8217;s mental health condition since at least 19 May. As Ms Watson pointed out, the need for the application should have been apparent since at least 24 June when T&#8217;s midwife was unable to complete a full antenatal check. </p>

In that response it was confirmed that the application had been issued on 29 July and an induction of labour is indicated because (i) T is a heavy smoker and the rate of stillbirth goes up after 39 weeks, and (ii) T has decided that she would like to have her baby by the estimated delivery date and she wishes for the induction to take place on 2 August 2022 if spontaneous labour has not occurred by that date.

Whilst the court&#8217;s decision to exercise that power depends upon the facts, in CD Francis J made such an anticipatory declaration in a case concerning a 27 year old woman who was 35 weeks pregnant and had a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia and emotionally unstable personality disorder. It was common ground in that case that CD, at the time of the hearing, had capacity to make decisions in respect of the birth of her child, but the clinicians were concerned that there was a risk that she would lose capacity to make decisions at critical moments during the course of her labour.

All are agreed that, for so long as CD retains capacity to make decisions about her obstetric care and the delivery of a baby, she will of course be allowed to do so, even if those decisions are considered to be unwise. If, however, her mental health deteriorates and she loses capacity I consider that it would be in the best interests to try for a normal vaginal delivery if possible and this is consistent with either CD's expressed wish or best interests. The care plan drawn up by the applicant records the expectation that CD will comply with what is proposed but also includes fall back options, including for appropriate minimal restraint, should this not be the case. Restraint would potentially be used to transfer her to the maternity suite, insert a cannula (although only if medically required) or provide general anaesthetic in order to proceed to a caesarean section. A caesarean section would be very much a last resort.</span></p>

The focus however is, as Keehan J has emphasised, particularly acute in cases such as this. The need for an informed birth plan, identifying the appropriate support required, reviewed by the court in a way which permits it properly to be scrutinised and facilitative of representation for P is essential. So too, is the need for a fully transparent process, given the fundamental rights and freedoms that are engaged here. As Keehan J highlights, these rudimentary requirements are a facet of the article 6 rights of all involved. Moreover, failure to plan in a careful and properly informed manner may jeopardise the health, even the lives of the mother and the unborn baby. Thus, it follows, to my mind, inexorably, the court will need to be involved in a way which anticipates rather than being merely reactive to crisis or emergency.&#8221;  </span></p>

However, for the reasons I have discussed, at para 16 above, I consider that in these difficult obstetric cases, that is not only unviable but also potentially dangerous. It is not an overstatement to say that the inevitable potential for delay, including for a very short period, may lead to compromise of the health or risk to the life of the mother and unborn child. It is, also, necessary to say that risk to the health or life of the unborn child is, in these circumstances, rarely likely to be in the mother's best interests. I say 'rarely' rather than never because it is possible to contemplate an obstetric crisis which requires a binary choice to be made between the survival of the mother or the unborn child. This is the prism through which this particular aspect of risk must be evaluated.&#8221;</span></p>

In the present case the Court did not have evidence that T did not have capacity at the time of the hearing and was in reality doing no more than speculating as to whether she might lose it. The evidence was that there was nothing more than a &#8220;small risk&#8221; that she might lose capacity, and in my judgment that is insufficient to justify an anticipatory declaration in a case such as this. There is a serious risk in a case such as this that a woman&#8217;s autonomy will be overridden at such an important time, because of an assumption that she has lost capacity.</p>

Firstly, she could be invited to enter into an advance statement of her wishes and feelings in respect of her obstetric care during birth. It was clear that T was prepared to enter into such an advanced declaration. Secondly, if there was a true emergency, then the clinicians can use the doctrine of necessity to protect the mother. There needs to be some caution about turning what are in truth medical decisions into legal ones.</p>
