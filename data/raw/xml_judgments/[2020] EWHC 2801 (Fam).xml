	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.01in">This is the third judgment relating to the care proceedings involving Lucy (L). I conducted a three-day welfare hearing after issuing my fact-finding judgment on 26 February 2020. The outcome of the fact finding was that I found on the balance of probabilities that William (W), L&#8217;s older brother, did not commit suicide but rather died at the hands of either his father, mother or older brother Charles. I placed all three in the pool of perpetrators. The family members who were in the house that day, in my judgement, all lied to me about what happened on the day of W&#8217;s death and they have not accepted the findings that I have made. It is therefore not possible to know what actually happened to W and the precise circumstances of his death. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.01in">This judgment is concerned with what now happens to L. L is 12 years old and has been in foster care for two years. The case has been very significantly delayed, initially because the police took a long time to investigate W&#8217;s death and make a decision about prosecution, but then because the fact-finding hearing had to be adjourned part heard because the police failed to disclose relevant material (see order of 21 October 2019). As I will set out in more detail below, in the two years that L has been in foster care she has refused to develop any relationship with the foster carer and has effectively lived a double life. She has told nobody at her school that she is in foster care and she has remained totally committed to her family and to returning home. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.01in">The Local Authority (the LA) have put forward a care plan that places L in long term foster care with very limited contact with her family. Ms Howes, a LA social worker, carried out a Special Guardianship Order (SGO) assessment of L&#8217;s older sister, Belinda, and this was negative.  L&#8217;s parents and Belinda&#8217;s primary position is that L should return home to her parents&#8217; care. However, their secondary position is that L should be placed with Belinda in separate accommodation from the family home and Belinda should be her primary carer. That L should live with Belinda is supported by the independent psychologist who was instructed, Dr van Rooyen (Dr v R). The Guardian (Ms Lain) also supports this position so long as a careful package of support is put in place, albeit there are some complexities about how this can be achieved. Very shortly before the hearing the Independent Review Officer indicated in an email that she now supported the Guardian&#8217;s position.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.01in">This welfare decision is a difficult one because on the one hand I have L&#8217;s very strong wish to return home and the obvious psychological and emotional harm of forcing her to remain in foster care for a number of years and, on the other hand, I have a palpable but very difficult to quantify risk of physical and emotional harm if she goes to live with family members. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.01in">I conducted the hearing in a hybrid format with all the family members, Ms Taylor and the Guardian giving live evidence in court and Dr v R and Ms Howes giving evidence remotely. I undertook this format because I wanted to see the family members, and particularly Belinda, in person. There were some technical issues with the remote evidence, but this did not prevent the conduct of a fair and effective hearing.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.01in">I start with the evidence of Dr van Rooyen (Dr v R), the independent psychologist instructed. Dr v R is highly experienced and was an excellent witness who had given very careful consideration to the complexities of L&#8217;s case. She met L on a number of occasions and also spoke to the family.  She was highly concerned about the position L was in and her emotional response to foster care. She said that she had never seen a child who had managed to maintain such complete detachment from her foster care placement and compartmentalise her life for such a prolonged period. Although she said that most children who are in foster care want to go home, she felt that L was an extreme and particularly worrying case. She gave evidence of L&#8217;s lack of emotional development over the last two years and the likelihood of L becoming <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;emotionally retarded, delayed and unhealthy in life&#8221;</span> if she remained in foster care. It was her view that the relationship with the foster carer had got worse over time, particularly because L had apparently thought she would be going home after the fact-finding hearing. I note at this point that there was no criticism by anyone of the foster carer; the evidence strongly suggests that she has done her utmost to help L, support her and integrate her into the family, but L has resisted all these efforts. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.01in">Dr v R said she thought it was highly unlikely that L would engage with a new foster carer and that if it did happen it would take a long time and involve her having significantly less contact with her family. She emphasised the crucial stage that L was at for her emotional development. She said that at present all L&#8217;s emotional needs were being met by her family rather than the foster carer. Dr v R said that the Father had been trying to get L to engage with the foster carer. This is important because the LA argue that a significant part of the reason for L&#8217;s refusal to engage with the foster carer is because the family have actively sought to undermine her role. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.01in">Dr v R accepted that a placement with Belinda would be challenging and also accepted the significant concerns in the SGO assessment carried out by Ms Howes. She said that there were serious issues about the family dynamics and minimising risks within the family.  However, she said that there were positives. Belinda and L have a very strong bond and a support package could be put in place to help Belinda in looking after L. She described how Belinda would need to be given the primary carer role and the family would have to step back from parenting L. She thought that this would be very difficult for the Mother in particular. The family would have to have a clear understanding of, and commitment to, the rules and the LA would need to monitor this. Belinda would need to develop both physical and psychological independence from the family. </p>

The family had a clearly entrenched culture of minimising concerns and not acknowledging difficulties within the family. This included the problems W had had at school and well recorded incidents of violence as referred to in the fact-finding judgment. There was also a risk around the fact that no professional knows the circumstances around W&#8217;s death. </p>

She described Belinda as having the commitment and bond to L in order to prioritise her interests and that Belinda was capable of putting to one side her view of her parents.  She also said that Belinda and the rest of the family had a strong motivation to make a placement with Belinda work because they know that otherwise she will be returned to foster care which would be very harmful to her. </p>

Ms Howes records Belinda being very concerned about her loss of independence if she was looking after L and the difficulties that would arise for her University course and perhaps her social life.  Belinda is recorded as saying that living independently would be impossible and Ms Howes felt that she had not developed the skills to live independently. Ms Howes said that Belinda was resentful towards the LA and the police. It was Ms Howes&#8217; view that Belinda and the family were supporting Belinda as carer as a vehicle for bringing L home.  My reading of the situation is that when the SGO assessment was carried out the family were hoping to persuade the LA and the court to allow L to return home. However, they have now accepted that that is very unlikely to happen and so the ground has shifted to promoting Belinda as the carer. </p>

As I said in the fact-finding judgment, she is plainly an intelligent woman and is very engaging, save when being pressed on subjects she is not comfortable with. She is recorded by all the professionals as having a close relationship with L and already exercising some protective role in respect of her. This may be particularly because the Mother speaks limited English and is much less integrated into British society than are her daughters. Belinda has both intelligence and insight when it comes to the situation L is in but becomes highly defensive and hostile when challenged about either the facts of what happened to W or the role of the Local Authority. She was hostile to Mr Archer in cross examination, but it should never be forgotten that cross examination is a very uncomfortable experience for most witnesses, and in Belinda&#8217;s narrative this is a family which has been very badly treated by local authority, police and ultimately the court.  </p>

This risk is difficult to quantify, not least because neither I nor any of the professionals know what happened to W and the circumstances in which he died other than that he did not commit suicide, it was not an accident and three family members are in the pool of perpetrators. This is a closed family which shares nothing with outsiders. It is also a family where there is strong evidence of seriously aggressive behaviour by all the male members of the family.  I cannot discount the prospect of future aggression and violence by at least the Father and Charles. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.01in">There are two aspects of the risk which particularly concern me. Firstly, L is entering adolescence and has had a deeply troubling few years. Although at the moment she is very contained and self-controlled, it must be possible that she will become disturbed and angry when she starts to push boundaries more and perhaps when she reflects on whatever has really been going on in this family. She has been an entirely innocent victim of events and it would be quite understandable for that to make her angry. That may well lead to conflict within the family, to which the response is unpredictable. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.01in">There is also a very high level of uncertainty around Charles and the degree to which he poses a risk. There is no reason to believe he would be violent to L, but he does appear to be a cause of great tension within the family. It is possible that L could get caught in the middle of whatever is happening within this family. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.01in">The second feature is that this is a family which is wholly hostile to the Local Authority and the police and unlikely to either be honest in their response to any monitoring but also very slow to seek help when needed. A good example of this was the incident in 2018 when it seems Charles attacked Belinda and the Father did call the police. However, when the matter got to court Belinda refused to give evidence and the family all sought to downplay the incident when I conducted the fact-finding hearing. I am very concerned that if there is violence within the family the police will not be called, and L may not be protected. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.01in">However, I do think that Belinda is genuinely committed to L&#8217;s best interests. Although she may well have been reluctant to take responsibility for L when speaking to Ms Howes, when faced with the choice of L going into long term foster care, Belinda&#8217;s commitment to her little sister is in my view genuine. I also think Belinda may well have more insight into the risks the family pose than she is prepared to own up to in court. Belinda was not there when W was injured. She, and indeed the rest of the family, are in the position that if they publicly accept any risk or any part of the fact-finding judgment, they are effectively inviting a prosecution of a family member for a very serious crime. That is a very strong motive to refuse to publicly accept the findings and may not fully reflect her true position. However, I fully accept that this is speculation and there is a real risk which must not be discounted.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.01in;text-indent:0in">death and anything to do with Charles, when it came to cooperating with the LA if L was placed with Belinda, I did sense a shift in their evidence. The Father certainly understands that if L is not to be placed in long term foster care, then he and his wife have to work with the LA. I believe him when he says that he will sign up to a placement with Belinda. I think the Mother will find that more difficult, but I suspect and hope that she will be ultimately guided by the Father and Belinda. I do not doubt for one moment both parents&#8217; love for L and ultimately their desire to do the best for her.  </p>

I will follow the course proposed by Mr Day and Ms Rayat and continue the interim care order and request the LA to draw up a transition plan for L to move to Belinda&#8217;s independent care outside the family home. I will adjourn the application for a final care order so that further steps can be undertaken by the LA to give effect to the judgment. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.01in">There is urgency in this matter given how long L has been in care and her difficulties in foster care. A transition plan should be drawn up that sets out the assistance that will be given to Belinda; a process for engaging with the family and drawing up a working together agreement with them should be set out. This will necessarily involve boundaries over contact with the parents and Charles. There will also need to be a process for approving Belinda as a Regulation 24 carer. Unsupervised contact between L and Belinda should be facilitated as soon as possible. This will allow them to plan their new home together and I hope will give both of them a very positive incentive to accept and adopt the proposal. </p>

If this cannot be agreed, then there will have to be a further directions hearing. I would be grateful for the Guardian&#8217;s view as to whether I should write to L myself explaining why I consider she cannot return to her parents or whether the Guardian would rather undertake the explanation herself. </p>
