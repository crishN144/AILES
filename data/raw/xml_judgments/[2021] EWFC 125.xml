	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">This is my judgment following a final hearing in an application made by the London Borough of Tower Hamlets for care and placement orders in respect of two children, &#8220;W&#8221;, a boy born in 2019 and aged 20 months, and &#8220;X&#8221;, a girl born in 2020 and aged eight months.  </p>

The mother has been found to lack capacity to conduct this litigation and so the Official Solicitor has been appointed as her litigation friend.</p>

The extension was required due to time lost through technical difficulties.  This was a hybrid hearing: the mother, her counsel and intermediary attended at court, as did the father, his interpreter and a representative from his solicitors.  The other participants attended remotely.  This judgment is being delivered orally at the conclusion of the hearing.</p>

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The mother is aged 25.  She is of Bangladeshi heritage and was born in Bangladesh, but came to the United Kingdom as a young child.  The mother has an identified learning disability, although I do not have a formal assessment of her cognitive functioning.  She attended mainstream school with an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP) and one-to-one support.  She has historically been supported by Tower Hamlets Community Learning Disability Service.  She has worked.  She has trained as a barista and worked in a coffee shop prior to her pregnancy with W.  She currently works as a cleaner in a hospital.  The mother is the second of six children.  She has an older sister and four younger brothers, two sets of twins.  All four of her brothers have had some involvement with the criminal justice system.</p>

While they were there, the mother was married to a Mr J.  The mother has said that that relationship was violent.  She returned to the UK in September 2018 and Mr J remained in Bangladesh.  They remain married.</p>

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The parents have known each other for some time as the father was a friend of the mother&#8217;s late father.  The relationship commenced in 2018.  It is not disputed that the parents kept their relationship secret from the mother&#8217;s family, who would not have approved as the mother was already married.  When the mother became pregnant, it seems that it was initially assumed that her husband was the baby&#8217;s father.  Throughout the pregnancy the mother remained living at home with her mother and brothers, her father having died the previous year.</p>

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">During the pregnancy, the mother had an allocated social worker from the Adult Social Care Team, Ms L.  Just before W&#8217;s birth, on 5 August 2019, there was a change of social worker and the mother&#8217;s case was reallocated to Ms M.  She was supported during the pregnancy by a specialist midwife team.  The evidence is that throughout the pregnancy the mother was struggling to meet her own medical needs and those of the unborn baby.  She was diagnosed with gestational diabetes but had difficulty managing her glucose levels.</p>

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Despite the mother&#8217;s obvious need for support, and at least some uncertainty as to how she would manage to care for the baby once born, a referral to Children&#8217;s Social Care was not made until mid-June 2019, relatively late in the pregnancy.  A social worker, Ms N, was allocated from the local authority&#8217;s pre-birth team.  She made attempts to speak to the mother by telephone but these were unsuccessful.  She therefore arranged. through the maternal grandmother who, at the time, was the mother&#8217;s registered carer, to visit the family home, and did so on 17 July 2019, accompanied by the allocated social worker for two of the mother&#8217;s brothers.  That visit was terminated, due, on the local authority&#8217;s case, to high levels of anger and aggression in the home, particularly from the mother&#8217;s younger brother.  On leaving the home, Ms N called the police due to her concerns for the safety of the mother and the maternal grandmother.</p>

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Following the referral to Children&#8217;s Services, the mother disengaged from midwifery services and failed to attend any further midwife appointments until 2 August, when it was determined that she needed to be induced.  It appears that the mother had become very anxious about the involvement of Children&#8217;s Services.  There is a dispute about whether more could and should have been done to help her to engage with the support that was offered to her.</p>

On W&#8217;s birth, it appeared that both the mother and the baby had an infection, although it is not clear what it was as the mother refused testing.  She did accept antibiotic treatment and the infection resolved.</p>

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">In the following days there were a number of discussions between the mother, the mother&#8217;s new social worker Ms M, and Ms N.  It has not been easy for me to disentangle the local authority&#8217;s thought processes in terms of their plans for the baby around the time of the birth.  It seems from what is recorded of the discussions that the local authority&#8217;s initial plan was that the mother and baby should be placed together in a mother and baby residential assessment unit, although it is not clear whether one was ever identified.  It is clear that the mother, at least initially, was very anxious about this proposal and wanted to return to her family home, which the local authority did not consider, particularly in the light of the mother&#8217;s brother&#8217;s very recent stabbing, to be a safe environment for the baby.</p>

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">On 14 August, a contested hearing took place before District Judge Cooper.  The district judge made an interim care order and approved the separation of the mother and baby and a placement for W in local authority foster care.  The order records that the local authority had made attempts to secure a mother and baby residential placement but that there were none available to take the mother, given her high level of needs.  At the hearing before me there was a lack of clarity as to what attempts the local authority had made, and what enquiries had been made of potential residential units.</p>

Steps were then taken to arrange for DNA testing, but in the meantime the mother&#8217;s family registered W with the mother&#8217;s husband named on his birth certificate.  On 23 September 2019 DNA testing confirmed the father&#8217;s paternity of W.  I understand that the birth certificate has subsequently been amended.</p>

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">At that hearing it was not clear whether the parents wished to be assessed together or separately.  The mother became very distressed during the hearing.  She has subsequently said that the father was making fun of her learning disability while they were at court.  She told the court she did not want to be assessed together with him.  The order records that the parents needed to be clear about the status of their relationship.</p>

During that assessment, the parents presented as a couple and indicated that they wished to be assessed together.  Towards the end of the assessment period, the mother became pregnant with X.  The pregnancy was known to the assessment team prior to the completion of their report.  The report concluded that neither parent would be able to care for W.  The assessors also indicated that they did not consider that a further assessment after the new baby was born would be necessary or appropriate.</p>

The tenancy is in the mother&#8217;s sole name.  On the move to Newham, the mother&#8217;s case was closed to Adult Social Care in Tower Hamlets.  Her social worker tried to speak to the appropriate team in Newham but their response was delayed because this coincided with the start of the COVID pandemic.  When Ms M eventually managed to make contact, she was told that the mother did not meet Newham&#8217;s eligibility criteria for support.</p>

LIFT were asked to undertake an updating assessment.  They carried out a further interview with the father and prepared an addendum report.  The conclusion was that the findings from the additional assessment did not change the original recommendation.</p>

In making that decision, I took into account the delay that the proceedings had already incurred and the substantial further delay that would be caused by vacating the final hearing.  I took the view that where the local authority&#8217;s care plan was for adoption, it was in the children&#8217;s interests for all possible carers within the family to be explored, but that the hearing should be used at least to determine the threshold criteria and potentially also to decide whether or not the parents could offer care to the children.</p>

It follows too that children will inevitably have both very different experiences of parenting and very unequal consequences flowing from it. It means that some children will experience disadvantage and harm, whilst others flourish in atmospheres of loving security and emotional stability. These are the consequences of our fallible humanity and it is not the provenance of the State to spare children all the consequences of defective parenting.

The relevant passages from the Guidance are set out later in this judgment. </p>

In my view, the evidence of Ms M and Ms N indicated that in this case there was a lack of integrated planning during the mother&#8217;s first pregnancy with W, between the Adult Social Care Department supporting the mother as an adult with a learning disability, the health care services offering ante-natal care and support, and Children&#8217;s Services.  </p>

Health care services and Adult Social Care were aware of the pregnancy from this point.  Despite this, there was no referral to Children&#8217;s Services until mid-June, less than two months before W&#8217;s birth, which, as Ms N said, left little time to build a relationship with the mother and to engage her in planning for the birth.</p>

I accept that both Ms M and Ms N were conscientious social workers, doing the best they could within their own particular spheres. In Ms M&#8217;s case, she was only allocated as the mother&#8217;s social worker just before W&#8217;s birth, so there was no opportunity for her to liaise with Children&#8217;s Services during the pregnancy.  Over the period of her involvement from August 2019 until April 2020, Ms M said, and the records support this, that she was frequently in touch with the mother in the context of support with the mother&#8217;s own needs.  She had a good understanding of the mother&#8217;s disability and of her need for professional support.  </p>

It is a different assessment model which focuses on the ability of parents to meet the identified needs of the individual child and to provide attuned and responsive care.  The local authority says that that approach is focused on the best interests of the child and is equally valid.  It is far broader than the narrow PAMS approach, which is essentially an assessment of basic care skills and no more.  The local authority points out also that both the father and the Official Solicitor consented to the LIFT assessment and must be assumed to have considered its methodology, or at least to have had the opportunity to do so.</p>

Having heard Dr Cosgrave&#8217;s evidence, I do consider that LIFT relied too heavily on the early contact reports which suggested that the mother was struggling with aspects of W&#8217;s basic care when other later reports suggest that she does have the ability to respond to and act on advice and to learn new skills.  </p>

For example, LIFT seem to have accepted as accurate a hearsay report of the maternal grandmother informing the social worker that the mother was unable to tell if water was hot or cold, even though there were formal assessments of the mother&#8217;s care needs which indicated that she had a much higher level of ability to care for herself than that report would suggest.</p>

The multi-disciplinary approach meant that the parents&#8217; capacity was considered from a much broader perspective than would have been the case if this had been a simple parenting assessment carried out by a social worker. The report is lengthy, and is accompanied by detailed appendices setting out the work done with W, his foster carer and each of his parents.  Dr Cosgrave explained that the interviews with the parents usually take place on four or five occasions with each parent and would last for about two hours on each occasion, although for the mother more time was allowed so that it could be broken up into shorter sessions, and time for filing the report was extended accordingly.</p>

I reject that argument.  It was initially put on behalf of the Official Solicitor that the assessors had not used the mother&#8217;s communication passport, but it became clear during the evidence that this was not correct.  It was also put that LIFT did not carry out a cognitive assessment of the mother.  Dr Cosgrave explained that they would have done so if they thought it was required, but they considered they had sufficient understanding of the mother&#8217;s functioning from the information provided and from their own interactions with her.  They worked on the basis that they knew she had a learning disability and tailored their communications with her accordingly.  The whole team is trained to work with parents with a learning disability and have significant previous experience of such work.</p>

The allegation is that the assessment took a snapshot of her as she was without exploring her ability to acquire and develop new skills.  I have thought carefully about this criticism, which goes to the heart of the Official Solicitor&#8217;s case that a further assessment of the mother is required.</p>

Dr Cosgrave herself accepted that.  She explained that LIFT typically did not carry out PAMS-type assessments of the parents&#8217; basic skills; where that was an issue, they would expect that to have been carried out separately by Children&#8217;s Social Care.

It is a much more complex assessment than the PAMS assessment.  We are not looking to see if a parent can do the day-to-day care, it&#8217;s can they manage the relationship, adapt to the child&#8217;s needs and attune to them?  Sometimes, parents are very good at the day-to-day skills but not emotional regulation and responsiveness.  That is why we look to that, not the basic skills&#8221;.</span></p>

Asked how helpful it is to someone with a learning disability for an assessment of this nature to be conducted, Dr Cosgrave&#8217;s answer was that although the concepts are complicated, the process of attunement is a fundamental part of the parent/child relationship and one which is essential to a child&#8217;s development.</p>

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The assessment carried out by LIFT did not follow the Good Practice Guidance (either the social work version or that aimed at clinical psychologists) in that its primary focus was not on the mother&#8217;s ability to acquire new skills which might enable her to meet the children&#8217;s basic care needs.  There has been no other assessment of the mother&#8217;s abilities in that respect.  There is therefore, in that sense, a gap in the evidence.  The court does not know to what extent the mother might be able to develop her ability to be able to care for the children on a day-to-day basis and to keep them physically safe.</p>

That evidence relates to both parents&#8217; ability to provide the children with stimulation and emotionally attuned care, the nature and stability of the parents&#8217; relationship, the father&#8217;s understanding of the mother&#8217;s learning disability, and his ability and willingness to support her in caring for the children. </p>

I also decided that it was appropriate to require her to give evidence with participation directions in place, including the support of her intermediary to assist her in understanding questions and in formulating a response.

The mother&#8217;s evidence on this issue was complicated, in my judgment, by her strong desire to care for the children together with the father, and her own recognition that she would not be able to care for them alone.  She was therefore highly anxious to present a positive picture of the relationship and wary of the questions which sought to explore the tensions between the parents.</p>

When the LIFT assessment was carried out, only W had been born.  She thought that placing two young children in the care of these parents would be highly risky.  She did not think that either parent would deliberately cause harm to the children, but considered that there would be a high risk of neglect and that both children would be likely to suffer emotional and physical harm as a result.  She thought the parents would be unable to manage and that the family dynamics would become overwhelming for everyone.  To the extent that the Guardian&#8217;s conclusions relied on the outcome of the LIFT assessment, I will evaluate that evidence later in my judgment.</p>

I agree with Ms P&#8217;s view that, overall, the contacts have a repetitive quality in that they usually follow the same pattern.  In the more recent contacts, it has become increasingly apparent that W is becoming restless and wanting to explore his environment, but there is little indication that the parents are responding to this and able to adapt their interactions with him.</p>

The composite schedule produced by the local authority runs to 31 pages.  It is the fourth version of a threshold document produced in these proceedings.  Some of the allegations are dense, in that they bring together, sometimes in a single sentence, a number of different issues which bear no obvious relationship to each other.  In other instances, the opposite fault is apparent, in that many allegations simply repeat each other, sometimes on more than one occasion.  It is also true that no real distinction is drawn between the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s31</ref> &#8220;relevant date&#8221; for W, which is 14 August 2019, and the relevant date for X, which is 17 August 2020.

That is disputed by the Official Solicitor on the basis that in her evidence the mother does not accept all of the primary facts alleged by the local authority in respect of her parenting ability at the relevant time. However, there is substantial evidence in support of the local authority&#8217;s case.  </p>

The parents were not, at that time, presenting as a couple who intended to care for their child together, and for reasons I will come on to explain, there was limited support available in the maternal grandmother&#8217;s home.  Therefore, the care likely to be provided to W was care by his mother.</p>

It is the case, however, that even by the time of X&#8217;s birth, the risks associated with the mother&#8217;s learning disability remained present.  Her learning disability is, of course, a static factor and even the Official Solicitor does not suggest, as I understand it, that she would be able to care for either or both children at present, without being given an opportunity to develop new skills.  I appreciate that the Official Solicitor&#8217;s case is that she should have been given that opportunity before now, but that does not alter the fact that in August 2020, as was the case in August 2019 and remains the case now, the mother&#8217;s learning disability presented a formidable obstacle to her caring for either child.  At the point when X was born, of course, the challenges she faced were magnified as she would then have had to care for two very young children together rather than just one.  I conclude that the threshold criteria were met on this basis also at the relevant date in X&#8217;s proceedings.</p>

There is substantial evidence from Ms M, and in the local authority records, that the mother was distressed at the referral to Children&#8217;s Services and that her relationship with the midwives was affected as a result.  The mother had been diagnosed with gestational diabetes and it was important for her own health and W&#8217;s that she should be regularly monitored, particularly towards the end of the pregnancy when the risks were highest.</p>

However, that does not alter the fact that the mother failed to engage and, regardless of whether or not she is to be blamed for that, her lack of engagement during the pregnancy put her unborn baby at risk.  Given the mother&#8217;s learning disability, there was a clear and obvious need for professional support from both Health Services and Social Care in managing the pregnancy and making plans for the birth, and in the absence of that support, W was likely to suffer significant harm.</p>

Ms N set out in her witness statement what happened on that date and her oral evidence was consistent with this account.  She says that one of the mother&#8217;s brothers was very aggressive and told the social workers to &#8220;get the fuck out&#8221;.  The mother was highly distressed and shouting.  The maternal grandmother appeared frightened and unable to manage the conflict.  Ms N was so concerned about the wellbeing of those in the home that after she left she dialled 999.</p>

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">The mother accepts that there was shouting in the home on that date but explains that that was because she had no warning of the visit and because the social worker was rude.  She says that questions were asked about W&#8217;s biological father and this upset her mother and her brother.  </p>

However, the social worker&#8217;s description of the incident - which is not really disputed and which I accept - is one of a scene where the emotions of family members got out of control very quickly and escalated to a point where an experienced social worker felt she had to leave the home and seek police assistance.  I find that on this occasion the situation in the home was volatile, that the mother&#8217;s brother was aggressive towards the social worker and that the maternal grandmother was unable to control the environment.  That finding also suggests, at the very least, that the maternal grandmother would struggle to provide effective support to the mother in caring for W in the home.</p>

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">Overall, the Official Solicitor says that the local authority has not proved the necessary causal link between any facts I might find proved under this heading, and a likelihood of harm to W.  The mother herself has accepted in her evidence that the home was not safe for W as her brothers were in and out of prison.  The Official Solicitor, however, points to the fact that the mother&#8217;s nephew, her sister&#8217;s son, was regularly spending time at the home without any apparent concern being raised on the part of the local authority, and says that the local authority have failed to identify the clear harm that W was likely to suffer if living in the home.</p>

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">I find that the nature of the criminal activities in which the mother&#8217;s brothers were involved demonstrate a propensity on their part towards physical aggression and violence.  The incident on 17 July shows that such behaviour was not limited to activities outside of the home, and also that the maternal grandmother was unable to control it.  I note also that the mother told the LIFT assessors that in the past her two youngest brothers had attacked her mother.  The fact that another child in the family sometimes visits the home can carry little weight in those circumstances and does not prove, of course, that there is no risk even to that child.  </p>

There is also a likelihood of significant emotional harm due to exposure to aggression and volatility in the home.  I take into account also that the mother herself, who has direct experience of living in the home, believes that it was unsafe.</p>

The local authority&#8217;s evidence about the events in the week after W&#8217;s birth presents a confused picture and it has not been possible, even at this hearing, to establish clearly the local authority&#8217;s decision-making process over this crucial period.  </p>

It appears that the local authority had taken the decision to issue proceedings by that time, because Miss N had a letter of intent with her, which she gave to the mother.  The mother became very upset.  She accepts that she threatened to kill herself if she could not return home with W.  In this context, I note Ms M&#8217;s evidence to the effect that when the mother does not want something, she will use hyperbolic language to make sure her position is understood.</p>

She set out the options the local authority was considering for W&#8217;s interim care.  The possibility of a residential placement is identified as one of the options.  The first factor against that option is recorded as being &#8220;the mother is not currently in agreement with the proposal&#8221;.</p>

On that occasion the mother&#8217; presentation was much calmer, no doubt because she understood Ms M&#8217;s role as her adult social worker to be a supportive one and she did not see her as a threat.  There was some further discussion about a mother and baby unit and it appears that this was presented as an option to the mother which she was free to decide to choose.  On this occasion, the mother said she would be prepared to go to the mother and baby unit.</p>

Therefore, she became very fearful of that option and mistrustful of the social worker who was presenting it.  I do not find that the mother failed to listen to or act on the social work advice.  In my view, the lack of coherent planning and liaison between Adult and Children&#8217;s Services created a confusing situation for the mother around the time of W&#8217;s birth.  The mother did not clearly understand what was required of her or what the local authority was proposing.  She did not have access to advice in a format that was accessible to her.  </p>

The local authority seeks a finding, broadly speaking, that the mother&#8217;s allegations represent an accurate picture of the parents&#8217; relationship.

I note also that the explanation that the mother was influenced by friends was made fairly late in these proceedings and that the mother has previously said to professionals, not that the allegations were untrue or that she was influenced to make them, but that things have improved since they were made.  However, the fact that the mother is now denying that any of the abuse took place and that, aside from the mother&#8217;s contemporaneous reports, there is no corroborative evidence that it did, means that I am unable to make a finding on the balance of probabilities.  </p>

I accept that the mother was very distressed and agitated in the hospital, to the extent that she threatened to kill herself.  That needs to be seen in the context of the mother&#8217;s learning disability which leads her at times to express herself in an exaggerated and unguarded way, and in particular I bear in mind the circumstances at that time, when the mother had recently given birth and was highly fearful that her child would be removed, and was not being provided with clear information by the local authority.  That evidence, in my view, is balanced by the contact records which, on the whole, even in the early stages, show the mother has an ability to contain her emotions at least during short periods of contact.

Neither child as yet has any identified additional needs, although there may be an increased likelihood of cognitive impairment due to the mother&#8217;s learning disability.  The developmental assessment carried out by LIFT for W indicated that he was meeting age-related expectations in most areas of development, although his cognitive abilities were a relative weakness.

Many parents would struggle to do so.  I entirely accept that as a proposition, but the criticism, in my view, is misplaced.  LIFT did not expect the mother to discuss concepts such as attunement in the abstract.

The Official Solicitor asks how, when some of the contact notes present a very positive picture of contact, LIFT could draw such a significant conclusion from a single session.  Again, I consider that criticism to be misplaced.  It is necessary to bear in mind that the LIFT observation of contact was an information gathering process of an entirely different order to the general observation of contact sessions which was carried out by the contact supervisors.</p>

The conclusions they drew from the observation are supported by other aspects of the evidence, including the information gathered during the wider assessment, and I consider them to be valid.

It was apparent from his answers that he placed more emphasis on loving the child as opposed to explicitly stating what the physical and emotional needs of the child are.</p>

It was clear that he saw the mother as taking on the role of providing primary care for W.  Asked how he would manage if she were unable to do so, he responded &#8220;She is perfectly all right of taking care of the child, bath, shower, feeding and all things.  She takes care of him quite well.  She is understanding of his needs.  Everything apart from that, whatever I can help as a dad, I do that as well and I&#8217;m there to help as well so I don&#8217;t see there is any problem&#8221;.</p>

The assessors comment that this was striking, even taking into account the impact of cultural differences and working with an interpreter.  They went on:  &#8220;[The father] struggled to take W&#8217;s perspective and understand what his needs are, tending to attribute emotional capacity to him beyond W&#8217;s years.</p>

It was clear that [the father] was trying his best to answer the question but he was unable to demonstrate his problem-solving abilities by explicitly naming his knowledge of W&#8217;s needs, how he would reconcile these needs alongside working full-time or what a typical day would look like at home.&#8221;</p>

I acknowledge that the father&#8217;s case now is that he would not be working and would be prepared to look after the children full-time at home.  However, despite that, I had little sense that he saw himself as playing a significant role in caring for the children and he would be highly likely, in my view, to leave the primary care role to the mother.</p>

On the contrary, it is an undermining and destabilising factor.  During the LIFT assessment, the mother was unable to appreciate why professionals might have concerns about the relationship and became irritated when the topic was raised.  She acknowledged that she had made allegations against the father, but could not see why this would lead professionals to be worried about her own safety and wellbeing.  The issue was explored with both parents on a number of occasions during the assessment, but without resolution.  The father&#8217;s answers to questions about the relationship were vague.  He was unable to explain how the second pregnancy had come about and who had taken responsibility for the decision whether or not to use contraception.  The parents&#8217; accounts of the relationship; how it had begun and how it had developed, differed in some significant respects.  </p>

I need to exercise caution in evaluating these observations, given the mother&#8217;s learning disability, the stresses of being observed and the cultural and language barriers.  However, even taking into account all of these factors, my own assessment of the parental relationship is that it offers little in the way of emotional support or stability to either parent.  There is, in my judgment, a very high likelihood that the relationship will suffer further instability in the form of serious allegations being made by the mother against the father.</p>

I bear in mind that in this case it may be difficult for both children to come to terms with their life story.  It would have to be explained to them that they had two parents who loved them very much but were unable, in the mother&#8217;s case certainly for reasons well beyond her control, to provide them with a permanent home.  The decision in those circumstances that they should be adopted may well seem unfair to them and they may struggle to come to terms with it.  Adoption in circumstances such as those pertaining in this case has the potential to cause the children real and lifelong psychological pain and distress.</p>

However, so far, those relationships have not developed.  The mother currently is not on speaking terms with any member of her family and those relationships are very strained.  There have been shifts in the relationships over time and there was a period in late 2020 when they seemed to improve.  However, it is very uncertain whether, if the children were to live with their parents, they would be able to develop consistent relationships with their wider family going forwards.</p>

The advantage of adoption is that it can offer the children a secure and stable home together where there is a very high likelihood that their physical, emotional and educational needs will be met.  They would have a family to whom they can belong and where they can develop to the best of their ability.  They would have parents who are able to recognise and respond to their emotional needs and to adapt to those needs as the children grow and develop.</p>

A further disadvantage is the sense of loss and anger they may well feel in later years when they discover that they have parents who love them very much and committed to them throughout lengthy proceedings and fought very hard to resume their care.</p>
