The father now applies to this court for an order for C&#8217;s return to England.  His application is made under the provisions of Article 11(7) and (8) of the Council Regulation (EC) 2201/2203 (commonly called &#8220;Brussels IIa&#8221;).  The application is opposed by his mother.</span></p>

English is not her first language, but she has put before the court her arguments clearly and I have had no difficulty understanding her arguments nor has she had any difficulty understanding the process, thanks in no small part to the careful contribution of Mr Vine in the exposition of his case.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'CG Times';font-size:14pt">The background to the case can be summarised as follows.  C was born on 28</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt;font-family:'CG Times'">th</span><span style="font-family:'CG Times';font-size:14pt"> April 2010 and therefore had his sixth birthday earlier this week.  The parties lived together until June 2014, when they separated.  They initially continued to live together in the house, but finally separated completely in the latter part of 2014 when the mother moved out of the family home.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'CG Times';font-size:14pt">There is a history of disagreement between the parties.  There have been a number of tensions and some incidents, including, it is said, some incidents when the police have been called.  I am not in a position to make any findings about the truth of those matters.  They may have to be investigated in due course in court.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'CG Times';font-size:14pt">Initially, the parties, following separation, entered into a shared care arrangement.  C&#8217;s time was divided almost equally between mother and father.  There is no reason for this court to believe that this arrangement caused C any particular difficulty, although the mother was unhappy about the arrangements and continues to have some complaints about whether it was the right solution for C.  At any rate, that was clearly the arrangement for C&#8217;s care until August 2015.</span></p>

She has lived in this country for 12 years but she has gone back to Poland on a number of occasions with C in the course of his life and up to this point there had been no difficulties. Previously, C and the mother returned at the conclusion of each holiday.  However, on this occasion that did not happen.  They went for a holiday for some eight days. That was the agreement between the parties although  C&#8217;s father has alleged that he only consented under duress.  I have not had an opportunity to investigate that in any detail in this hearing.</span></p>

Both parents were present and represented at the hearing.  Oral evidence was heard.  The mother&#8217;s case, it seems, was that she accepted that the child had been wrongfully abducted but sought to persuade the court that an order for summary return should not be made, relying on the defence in Article 13(b) of the Hague Convention, namely that there was a grave risk that C&#8217;s return would expose him to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place him in an intolerable situation.  The district court in Poland adjourned the application to enable a psychological assessment to be carried out.  </span></p>

It is clear from that transcript that both parties gave evidence and the mother in her evidence said, amongst other things: &#8220;I don&#8217;t have any chance of getting custody of my son in Great Britain therefore I didn't apply for it there.&#8221;  She further made a number of assertions about the life of the family prior to the departure in August.  She said: &#8220;I don&#8217;t have the applicant&#8217;s consent for the child&#8217;s stay in Poland.&#8221;  Asked to identify the &#8220;great emotional harm&#8221; that she said he would suffer were he to return to England, she alleged that C did not have good memories for the time he lived in England, that he was much better off in Poland.  She listed his various activities.  She described him as bilingual now.  She indicated to the Polish court that she would not return to England were the court to order C&#8217;s summary return. Thus, it seems the case put before the Polish court was that C would be returned to England without her.</span></p>

The psychologist interviewed the mother and C and observed them together, but significantly did not speak to the father.  The conclusion of the assessment was that C wanted to live with his mother in Poland and see his father in school holidays.  The psychologist described the mother as C&#8217;s main carer and reiterated that the mother did not intend to return to England were the court to make a summary return order.  The psychologist advised that to remove C from Poland and separate him from his mother could expose him to psychological harm.</span></p>

On that occasion, the court gave its decision, which is, to all intents and purposes, a judgment.  The court specified the facts as it found them to be.  It concluded that C had been wrongfully removed within the terms of the Convention under Article 3.  It noted that there had been in effect a shared care arrangement - the precise words are: &#8220;The father looked after the child by taking turns with the child&#8217;s mother and these rights were effectively exercised by the father.&#8221;  Consequently, the court found that C should be returned unless one of the defences under the Convention was proved.</span></p>

His colleagues weren't invited to the child&#8217;s home.  The child did show that the father was important for him.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'CG Times';font-size:14pt">The scheme of the Regulation, in short, is this.  Where a court to which a child has been abducted within the European Union has determined that the child should not be returned, having been satisfied that a defence under the Hague Convention is made out, the court of habitual residence retains jurisdiction to make decisions as to the child&#8217;s future in accordance with the provisions of Article 11 of the Regulation.  In exercising that jurisdiction, it is a welfare jurisdiction and the court must only make decisions in accordance with what it conceives to be in the interests of the child&#8217;s welfare.  That applies, in my judgment, to applications such as this for the summary return of the child as well as to long-term decisions.  The court of habitual residence retains jurisdiction to make decisions as to the child&#8217;s welfare notwithstanding an order for non-return by the courts of the country to which the child was abducted.  In exercising that jurisdiction, this court applies the principle that the child's welfare is the paramount consideration.  That applies to all applications and all matters arising under the welfare jurisdiction including an application for the child's summary return.</span></p>

Child abduction is contrary to the welfare of children generally and this abduction has been contrary to the welfare of this child.  That is a factor which the court must take into account when carrying out its welfare evaluation.</span></p>

Such an eventuality would, she said, cause her difficulties.  I accept that it would.  She said it would cause her financial difficulties, because in the eight months or so when she has been living in Poland again she has started a business which is just growing, she has put money into it and it is just getting going.  I accept that she would face challenges managing that business over the next few months were she to return to this country following an order that C should return.  I also accept that she might find difficulties getting employment here in the short term, and acknowledge her concern about being forced to resort to benefits.  She expressed strong views about how she did not want to be back on benefits which apparently was the position at an earlier stage.  Nonetheless she was clear in telling this court that reluctantly she would return to this country with C were I to order C&#8217;s return today.</span></p>

As I have indicated, the fact that the mother was refusing to return with C, so that a return for C to this country would involve a separation from his mother, was regarded by the Polish court as an important component and a decisive factor in its decision that to order his return would expose C to a grave risk of harm.  As a result, this court is in a different position from that of the Polish court. When the Polish court was faced with the prospect of separating C from his mother, it ruled that C would be at a grave risk of harm.  I consider this to be a significant change of position: that risk of harm is no longer present and no longer a factor for me to consider.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'CG Times';font-size:14pt">In reaching my decision, it seems to me the key arguments on each side are as follows.  I start with the arguments in favour of C remaining in Poland.  First, C has lived in Poland now for eight months and is relatively settled there.  The mother describes in her statement and in her oral evidence details of how he has settled down there.  He is enjoying life in preschool.  He has made friends.  He is bilingual so he is able to participate in activities there.  He has a lot of family there to whom he is close.  The mother is living at the moment with her sister, who has  kindly sat with her in court providing support today.  There is one cousin living in the house and a dog, and C clearly enjoys life there.  I accept that he is settled and it is to an advantage for him to be with his family.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'CG Times';font-size:14pt">Secondly, it follows that there would therefore be a significant disruption for C were he to be ordered to come back to this country now.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'CG Times';font-size:14pt">Thirdly, if I finally order at the conclusion of these proceedings in a few months&#8217; time that C should go back to Poland - in other words, if the mother persuades me that the right course is for C to go back to Poland - ordering to come back now and then to go back to Poland would involve two moves for C and therefore two experiences of disruption.  Albeit that his stay in Poland has come about as a result of a wrongful abduction, there is a status quo which has been established over the last eight months which would be disrupted, and I have to consider the impact of a change of circumstances as part of my welfare assessment.</span></p>

Having heard her give evidence, it is manifestly clear that she would be very distressed (and is distressed) at the prospect of having to come back to this country.  That is likely to have, in my view, some adverse impact.  Both of those factors &#8211; the financial difficulties and the emotional difficulties the mother will face &#8211; will have some knock-on effect on C.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'CG Times';font-size:14pt">On the other hand, there are a number of factors which are in favour of ordering his return to this country.  First, C would be returning not by himself (as it seemed at the time of the hearing before the Polish court) but with his mother. A return would therefore enable C to resume the shared care arrangements from which he was uprooted in August.  In particular, it would enable him to resume a close relationship with his father.  I accept that he has been able to see his father.  Unlike many cases of abduction, there has been contact over the last eight months (I think four visits) and some Skype.  But that is nothing like the level of contact and involvement which this father was having with his son prior to the wrongful abduction.  Ordering C&#8217;s return to this country would enable that relationship to be resumed at the level it was.  That, in my view, is an extremely important factor.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'CG Times';font-size:14pt">Secondly, a return to this country would facilitate what I regard as a thorough and fair assessment of the competing cases these parents are putting forward for his long-term future.  The mother wants C to live in Poland permanently; the father wants him to remain in this country.  That is a difficult decision and a court would need the best evidence and a full and fair assessment of what is the right option.  In my judgment, that can be achieved if he is returned to this country.</span></p>

In my view, the effect of separating him from his friends and family in Poland could be ameliorated by arrangements for staying contact in the summer, as the father concedes should happen.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'CG Times';font-size:14pt">Finally, the court is faced with the fact that this child has been unlawfully abducted.  The mother, although she seems to have accepted that before the Polish court, was very reluctant to accept it in her evidence to me.  Indeed, if I may say so with respect, she seemed to hold the position &#8211; that he was not abducted &#8211; in the teeth of the evidence.  Abduction is contrary to the interests of children generally.  C has suffered harm as a result of his abduction by being removed without warning from his close relationship with his father and his home life in this country.  The reason why dozens of countries from all over the world have signed the Hague Convention, and more countries are joining the Hague Convention every year, is because it is recognised that child abduction is pernicious and damaging to children.  It is damaging to children generally and it has been damaging to this child in particular.  The mother says that the father can go to see C in Poland or even live in Poland.  That may be a long-term option but that is not something, in my judgment, which is at all feasible today.  It is the mother who is to blame for the fact that we are where we are because she acted wrongfully in removing C in the way that she did and not returning him at the conclusion of the holiday last summer.  As a result, C has suffered the harm of being separated from his father which is a factor that I must take into account in assessing where his welfare lies.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'CG Times';font-size:14pt">It is, in my judgment, in the interests of C&#8217;s welfare that this court tries to put that right.  That is consistent with the policies underpinning the Convention and Brussels IIa.  It is also, most importantly, consistent with C&#8217;s welfare.  In the long term, the mother wants to apply for permission for C to live in Poland.  She appears to have told the Polish court that she had no chance of getting custody before a British court.  Let me say categorically to both parents &#8211; and let there be no doubt about this &#8211; that the mother does have a chance of persuading me in the long run that she should take C to Poland.  Whatever order I make today, I am not making a decision about the long term.  Both parents have a great deal to offer this little boy.  I &#8211; or another judge &#8211; will have to have to make the stark decision as to which is the right option in the long term.  I tell the mother straight that she does have a chance in the long run of getting an order which permits her to take C to Poland.  </span></p>

First, Mr Vine has drafted an order which he put before the court.  As has become clear in the course of the hearing, the order that I am likely to make at the end of the hearing departs from it to some extent and consideration must be given to how that can be done. </span></p>
