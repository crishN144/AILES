	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am concerned with a boy, &#8220;G&#8221; who is aged 16 months and subject to a care order made in favour of the applicant local authority. By an application dated 11 June 2024 brought under the inherent jurisdiction, G&#8217;s father (&#8220;the father&#8221;) seeks the court's authorisation for G to be circumcised. G's mother (&#8220;the mother&#8221;) supports the application. I <span style="color:#000000">intend no disrespect to either the mother or father in referring to them as such in this judgment and do so purely for the purposes of protecting their, and their child's anonymity.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 25 June 2024, the matter came before me for directions. At that time, the father was the applicant. The parties agreed that where there was a disputed issue of non-therapeutic circumcision in relation to a child in care, the local authority should bring the matter to court promptly for resolution, this having been the approach of the court in <span style="font-style:italic">Re P (Circumcision: Child in Care)</span> [2021] EWHC 1616 (Fam), [2022] 4 WLR 53 at paragraph 27(xii). I substituted the local authority as the applicant and directed medical evidence and final witness statements from the parents and local authority to be filed. The parties agreed no oral evidence would be required and were content to proceed on submissions.</p>

I have also read skeleton arguments filed by all the parties, save for the mother. I shall refer to the key evidence as I see it below but emphasise that if I have not referred to something in this judgment, that does not mean I have not considered it. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The hearing was delayed because neither parent attended the hearing on the first day. I was told that the father was a serving prisoner, but it was believed that he had been released from prison on 1 September 2024, although his whereabouts were unknown. The day before the hearing, Mr Bartlet-Jones, counsel who had represented the father in the care proceedings, emailed the court stating that the father was no longer in receipt of legal aid funding, no updating witness statement had been filed and counsel had not been able to confirm his instructions. Mr Bartlet-Jones indicated that he would appear on the father's behalf pro bono and sought permission to attend remotely, which I granted. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 4 September 2024, Mr Bartlet-Jones told me that he had still been unable to contact the father and raised the possibility of an adjournment. After discussion with the parties, I asked that enquiries be made as to whether the father had been given notice of the hearing or served with the order dated 25 June 2024. On 5 September, Mr Bartlet-Jones confirmed that fortunately, he had been able to speak to his client, who was still incarcerated, and that he wished to pursue his application, and to rely on his statement dated 7 June 2024. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I also asked for enquiries to be made regarding the mother's non-attendance. I was informed that the social worker, Ms Lauren Sutherland, had previously emailed the court papers with the order including notice of the final hearing to the mother, but she had not had any contact with the local authority or her children for some five weeks. On 5 September 2024, Ms Sutherland had been able to speak to the mother who told her that she had not received the papers due to issues with her phone. She had also not filed a witness statement but told Ms Sutherland that she supported F's application. The mother did not seek to adjourn proceedings or participate in the final hearing as she was in Kent. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I was directed to Rule 27.4 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 regarding the non-attendance of the parties. I was satisfied that both the mother and the father had been given reasonable notice of the application and the hearing in accordance with Rule 27.4(3)(a), Both had confirmed their respective positions, and neither party sought an adjournment. Notwithstanding their non-attendance, I was also satisfied, given G's age, the plans for adoption and the need for a decision to be made promptly, the circumstances of the case justified proceeding with the hearing in their absence, per Rule 27.4(3)(b).</p>

The care proceedings had been issued due to concerns about the parents' history of drug use, mother's mental health and father's criminal history. In addition, the parents' relationship was volatile with a history of domestic abuse by the father against the mother. The parents each accepted they were unable to care for the children and did not oppose the making of the final orders.  </p>

A local anaesthetic is injected into the base of the penis and the foreskin retracted. The ring is passed over the head of the penis and the retracted foreskin is pulled back over the ring, tied and trimmed back to the edge of the ring. Any bleeding edges are cauterized. Over the next week, the thread cuts through the foreskin which will drop off with the ring, revealing a fully circumcised penis. </p>

She emphasised that each twin will go through the adoption matching process with life history work done which travels with them. Adopters are all trained in continuing such work, including cultural and religious matters, with the children they adopt and there is an overarching service available to them, as described by the social worker, if they need any further support. At the end of Cafcass involvement, they write a &#8216;later in life letter&#8217; to the children which will also travel with G and S.

T</span>heir views are of considerable importance, and I attach significant weight to them.  That said, circumcision alone is not likely to establish or enhance P&#8217;s sense of cultural or religious identity; this would be best achieved at his age by regular contact with his parents who can, in the best way they consider possible, help him to understand his identity and the faith into which he has been born.  When he is older, they can be on hand to help him to reach a decision on whether to be circumcised.  My decision has, to some extent, been influenced by the fact that presently neither parent chooses to see P, and neither parent has (contrary to their offer to do so) provided P with age-appropriate books and/or learning materials about Islam.&#8221;</p>

I also found the mother's reasons for supporting the father's application on religious grounds to be unconvincing. The father concedes that he is not a practising Muslim, and so religious grounds fall away. He now argues that the sole reason for G to be circumcised is that this will preserve his identity, as it is part of Lebanese culture that all males are circumcised. Whilst this is a relevant factor, it does not tip the balance in favour of circumcision when weighed against the other welfare considerations I have referred to above and in the knowledge that G&#8217;s half Lebanese identity can be otherwise promoted. </p>
