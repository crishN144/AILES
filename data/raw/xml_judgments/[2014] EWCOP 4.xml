	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2014 I granted declarations in respect of TH, a 52 year old man presently in a minimally conscious state at what has been described as the lower end of the spectrum of that condition (i.e. a very profound disorder of consciousness). There is no doubt TH lacks capacity to litigate in these proceedings and also lacks the capacity to give or withhold consent to his medical treatment.  I have considered the papers and also heard oral evidence from Dr Gary Dennis, Consultant Neurologist at the Sheffield Teaching Hospital&#8217;s NHS Trust, Senior Nurse Cliffe who works in the neurology department, Professor Barnes, Honorary Professor of neurological rehabilitation at Newcastle University, TR, TH&#8217;s ex-wife and long term partner and GM TH&#8217;s friend of many years.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to withdrawal of nutirition and hydration I am persuaded that the correct course is to adjourn this issue to provide for a structured clinical assessment to evaluate whether there is evidence that TH&#8217;s primary neurological pathways are sufficiently intact to permit any evidence of awareness to be detected and fully to assess, over a set period of time, TH&#8217;s general awareness, responsiveness and capacity to experience pain.  The National Clinical Guidelines have been drawn to my attention in some detail and Professor Barnes has highlighted the benefits of a standard assessment tool, for example the Sensory Modality Assessment and Rehabilitation Technique (SMART) and the Wessex Head Injury Matrix (WHIM).</p>

Nonetheless both agree there is much to be gained by formalising that assessment and collating the clinical data in order to obtain the clearest picture of TH&#8217;s prolonged disorder of consciousness.  </p>

Professor Turner-Stokes said in evidence that she was &#8216;reasonably confident that future guidelines will state that, before making any decision concerning the withholding of ANH there should be formal testing in the form of the SMART diagnostic test coupled with WHIM tests carried out over a period of time.  In future therefore, no such application for an order authorising the withdrawal of ANH from a patient in a vegetative state or a minimally conscious state should be made unless:</span></p>

Ultimately authority to resuscitate was not pursued.

He has a particular interest in &#8216;life expectancy&#8217;.  He is well recognised at national and indeed international level in his field.  He has been President of the British Society for Rehabilitation Medicine and is the founder President of the World Federation for Neuro-rehabilitation.  In addition he is an author of over a hundred journal articles in his field as well as many review articles.  He is the author of the definitive text books on undergraduate and post graduate neurological rehabilitation and has significant experience in the management of rehabilitation and other health services.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his very helpful report dated the 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April he concluded that it would be likely that if TH suffered a cardio respiratory arrest then that would indicate progression of his underlying and already severe neurological disability.  In those circumstances Professor Barnes considered that it would not be in TH&#8217;s best interest to proceed with resuscitation on collapse. He noted that a DNAR (Do Not Attempt Ressucitation) order is now in place and that such an order is both reasonable and in his view in TH&#8217;s best interest.  Understandably nobody has sought to dissuade me that this properly represents TH&#8217;s best interest and I endorse that decision.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The medium term objective is to transfer TH&#8217;s care from the hospital to a specialist nursing home.  TR opposed that.  Though she is full of respect and genuine admiration for TH&#8217;s treating clinical team she believes that TH would loathe his present situation.  She tells me that <span style="font-weight:bold">he</span> would find it a violation of <span style="font-weight:bold">his</span> dignity.  Without the advantage of lawyers acting on her behalf her &#8216;proposals&#8217; are instinctive rather than structured.  She says that she wishes TH to be returned to her care and to look after him along with his mate &#8216;Spud<span style="font-weight:bold">&#8217;</span>.  (I don&#8217;t think I have ever been given this man&#8217;s full name).  As the hearing evolved it became clear that what TR really wanted to do was to ensure that TH&#8217;s voice was heard in this court room with her as the conduit for it.  TH would not want his present situation she says, he wishes to die, preferably as quickly and as painlessly as possible. That these are his wishes she has no doubt.  For her part she told me she was &#8216;not ready to let him go&#8217;, but she would be failing him, she thought, if she did not communicate what she was confident were his views to this court.  I will say more concerning the issue of TH&#8217;s wishes below but I propose to preface those observations by setting out something of the background to this case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">TH was admitted to the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield on the 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February of this year.  At that point, as Professor Barnes has emphasised in evidence to me and indeed in his report, he had a reduced Glasgow coma score of just 3 out of 15 which is the lowest possible score, indicative of a very severe depression of consciousness.  TH was also noted to have jerking movements to the right side of the body with deviation of the eye to the right. That, it was considered, indicated epileptic activity.  This seizure activity was terminated in the casualty department but he was then transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where he was intubated due to his persisting depression of consciousness.  His general health revealed a background of known alcohol excess and his seizure was thought to be due to alcohol withdrawal and hyponatremia.  That is a condition characterised by a very low serum sodium which in turn can cause neurological damage and is associated with excessive alcohol consumption.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Though there was some small improvement, TH remained confused when transferred on to the ward. However, on the 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> February he had a further episode which was probably, in Professor Barnes&#8217;s view, a &#8216;generalised tonic clonic seizure&#8217; which required intravenous treatment.  The following day there was a further episode associated with high temperature and these difficulties continued with a further reduction of serum sodium.  It was at that point, due to what was recognised to be an increasingly complex and serious condition, a referral was made to the neurological department at the Hallamshire Hospital.  It is pertinent to record that prior to this admission TH had a pre existing serious neurological disability called Central Pontin Myelinolysis.  That condition is characterised by degeneration of the brain stem / pontin region and is again often, though not exclusively, associated with alcoholism.  To add to this complex picture TH was also known to have Wernicke-korsakkoff syndrome.  That is characterised by visual problems, unsteady gate, mental changes such as memory loss and occasional behavioural issues, again associated with alcoholism.  </p>

TH had been chair bound and incontinent and had marked ataxia.  He also had pressure sores as a result of his wheelchair bound status.   Suffice to say that even prior to this admission therefore, TH&#8217;s condition had become debilitating.</p>

The neurological status however has shown no signs of recovery and there is consensus between Dr Dennis and Professor Barnes that TH remains under a serious neurological disability.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In a letter filed in these proceedings, dated 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> April, Dr Gary Dennis noted that whilst TH&#8217;s acute medical problems have in fact improved his current clinical state in fact appears worse than prior to his admission to hospital.  &#8216;He is unable to communicate in a comprehensible manner either verbally or non verbally.  He does not understand even the simplest of commands.  Further EEG&#8217;s have excluded the possibility that the present condition is due to underlying continuous epileptic activity. Whilst the speech and language therapy team feel TH is able to swallow soft food stuff the consensus is that &#8216;TH&#8217;s understanding of a need to eat is severely compromised and he therefore does not initiate feeding.  When he is fed by nursing staff he tends to spit out food thereby not sustaining sufficient calorie intake to maintain his weight&#8217;.  He is presently fed by his naso gastric tube and there have been occasions, now some weeks ago, when he tried to pull the tube out.  TH is incontinent of both urine and faeces and has a urinary catheter<span style="font-weight:bold">.  </span>I have<span style="font-weight:bold"/>been told by Nurse Cliffe and by TR that TH wears an adult size nappy.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As Professor Barnes&#8217;s evidence was not disputed, no party had required him to give evidence.  Bearing in mind TR was not represented I took the view that the serious decisions contemplated in this case really required the assistance of Professor Barnes in evidence.  Evidence on issues of this importance could not, in my view, be taken over the telephone or by video link unless it was unavoidable and although the question of Professor Barnes&#8217; attendance was only raised in the afternoon of the 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May he agreed to attend and was here by 10.30am in London on the 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> having travelled down from Newcastle on very short notice.

He did not entirely discount it as a possibility, but as he readily acknowledged, &#8220;improvement&#8221; in these circumstances could only mean a relatively small increase in the level of consciousness. There is no &#8220;cure&#8221; and MR scans, he told me, showed that the brain has suffered catastrophic damage from which it will not recover. As he put it in his report, TH&#8217;s condition is &#8220;permanent and irreversible&#8221;. </p>

He needs passive therapy in a sense of stretching exercises for the limbs and good quality nursing care. The nursing care would include appropriate management of his feeding, catheter, pressure areas, etc. However this is nursing care rather than rehabilitation.&#8221;</p>

This could equally apply to relatively &#8220;mild&#8221; chest infection.

Such overwhelming infections, it was recognised, are less readily treatable and will often require a period of time in an intensive care unit for respiratory support as well as intravenous antibiotics. Moreover, such overwhelming infection would probably indicate, in Dr Dennis&#8217; and Professor Barnes&#8217; view, a natural progression of TH&#8217;s condition. Both ultimately concluded that if overwhelming infection occurred, then it would not be in TH&#8217;s best interest for that to be treated with antibiotic therapy. </p>

In clinical terms, however, he considered the distinction would usually be reasonably clear. But in order to assist the treating team, he proffered the suggestion that if an infection is so severe that TH requires intensive care, respiratory support or cardiovascular inotropic support, then such infection should not be treated, but if the infection is milder such as not to require that kind of level of support, then the infection should be treated. </p>

Despite the range of clinical difficulties that I have set out, Dr Dennis nonetheless considered that at 52, TH had &#8220;the strength of a man of his age&#8221;, and considered that life expectancy might be at the more positive end of the spectrum. As head of the clinical team he sees TH regularly, and I place considerable emphasis on his view. It can, of course, only be speculative, but he sees the possibility of TH living for 12/18 months, possibly longer. </p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;My estimate of the worst case scenario is that TH could die within the next few days/weeks as a result of complications of his neurological condition. A likely possibility is overwhelming infection giving rise to pneumonia/septicaemia. The possibility of renal failure also needs to be considered. It is also quite possible that he could have cardiopulmonary arrest as a result of the brain damage in the pontine region. The best case scenario would be that TH does not develop such complications and is able to live for several more months or even a year or so. This is a possibility as long as he receives good quality nursing care. I have seen many individuals who in similar advance state of neurological disability who with good quality nursing care and appropriate treatment of complications have managed to live for many months/years in a similar disabled state. On the balance of probabilities I consider that his actual prognosis is nearer the worst case scenario than the best case scenario.&#8221; </p>

He had not, at that stage, heard from Professor Barnes. Presented with that factual scenario, Professor Barnes unhesitatingly discounted it.

Namely, that there is some evidence that TH feels some pain or discomfort, but his capacity for feeling pain is plainly very much reduced. I have been told of an occasion when, as a consequence of a blocked catheter, TH had a litre and a quarter of urine drained. Dr Dennis was surprised to find such a build up of urine without any striking visible pain prior to its release. </p>

Given the genesis of the concepts used in the Code of Practice, he was correct to consider whether the proposed treatments would be futile in the sense of being ineffective or being of no benefit to the patient. Two of the treatments had been tried before and had worked. He was also correct to say that &#8220;recovery does not mean a return to full health, but the resumption of a quality of life which Mr James would regard as worthwhile&#8221;. He clearly did consider that the treatments in question were very burdensome. But he considered that those burdens had to be weighed against the benefits of a continued existence. He was also correct to see the assessment of the medical effects of the treatment as only part of the equation. Regard had to be had to the patient&#8217;s welfare in the widest sense, and great weight to be given to Mr James&#8217; family life which was &#8220;of the closest and most meaningful kind&#8221;.&#8221;</span></p>

He drank alcohol, she said, all his life to help him cope with self confidence and self esteem. But getting to know the real TH was to uncover a  troubled, complex person, she said, which she attributed to his childhood. &#8220;He disliked the constraints of society around him. Drinking was an escape from his demons&#8221;. He never liked hospitals. She told me he was particularly affected when his mother was transferred to a nursing home.

Following a fall in 2012, TH was diagnosed with Ataxia she said, which impacted upon his independence and ability to play the drums. He felt unable to play the drums and never did again as his coordination was effected in his arms and legs, and he no longer had feeling in his feet. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">TR described that loss as tremendous for TH. She tried to encourage him to start drumming again to build up his strength in his arms and legs, but he refused steadfastly. Drumming, she said, was his life, and from that point he became less interested in the world around him. He hated the fact that he had to rely on people, especially to get his beer. He declined to attend the Ataxia clinic. He refused to cook. He lost his appetite. He was frightened to eat as he couldn&#8217;t keep it down.  Though he could drink, he refused the &#8216;build up&#8217; drinks as TR called them.  A piece of evidence which I think illuminates his own feelings about his situation.  Self hygiene became more difficult. He was devastated at the thought of &#8220;strangers&#8221; coming to bath him, and pleaded with TR to continue. He said he wanted to have some dignity left. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">He declined all support. He wished for no intervention from outside services. He was frustrated and angry with his disabilities. As he was never going to improve, he would rather die young and drink to the end he said. He expressed it uncompromisingly. &#8220;My brain is fucked, I am fucked and I want to drink as it&#8217;s the only thing I enjoy.&#8221; </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">TR confirmed the medical view that it is now sometime since TH communicated at all.  When he last spoke he appeared to be mentioning an old school friend his noises, for that is all they are, were peppered with occasional expletives.  TR thought that TH &#8216;has fear in his eyes and looked frightened&#8217;.  GM agreed with that description.  She told me in evidence that she was not ready for TH &#8216;to go&#8217; but she was not here for herself, she knew what TH wanted and she would be letting him down if she failed to communicate that to me.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If ever a court heard a holistic account of a man&#8217;s character, life, talents and priorities it is this court in this case.  Each of the witnesses has contributed to the overall picture and I include in that the treating clinicians, whose view of TH seems to me to accord very much with that communicated by his friends.  I am left in no doubt at all that TH would wish to determine what remains of his life in his own way not least because that is the strategy he has always both expressed and adopted.  I have no doubt that he would wish to leave the hospital and go to the home of his ex-wife and his mate&#8217;s Spud and end his days quietly there and with dignity as he sees it.  Privacy, personal autonomy and dignity have not only been features of TH&#8217;s life, they have been the creed by which he has lived it.  He may not have prepared a document that complies with the criteria of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/24" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 24</ref>, giving advance directions to refuse treatment but he has in so many oblique and tangential ways over so many years communicated his views so uncompromisingly and indeed bluntly that none of his friends are left in any doubt what he would want in his present situation.  I have given this judgment at this stage so that I can record my findings in relation to TH&#8217;s views.  Mr Spencer on behalf of the Trust does not argue against this analysis, he agrees that nobody having listened to the evidence in this case could be in any real doubt what TH would want.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I must record that the Official Solicitor&#8217;s lawyers appear not to share my analysis of the cogency and strength of TH&#8217;s wishes regarding his treatment. I confess that I have found this surprising. If I may say so, they have not absorbed the full force of Baroness Hale&#8217;s judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Aintree</span> and the emphasis placed on a &#8216;holistic&#8217; evaluation when assessing both &#8216;wishes and feelings&#8217; and &#8216;best interests&#8217;. They have, in my view, whilst providing great assistance to this court in ensuring that it has the best available medical evidence before it, focused in a rather concrete manner on individual sentences or remarks. To regard the evidence I have heard as merely indicating that TH does not like hospitals as was submitted, simply does not do justice to the subtlety, ambit and integrity of the evidence which, in my judgment, has clearly illuminated TH&#8217;s wishes and feelings in the way I have set out. </p>

In due course the clarity, cogency and force that they are found to have will have a direct impact on the weight they are to be given. &#8216;Wishes&#8217; and &#8216;best interests&#8217; should never be conflated, they are entirely separate matters which may ultimately weigh on different sides of the balance sheet. </p>
