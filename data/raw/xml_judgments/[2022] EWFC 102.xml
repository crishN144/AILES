	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">This case concerns AE, a young girl now aged 17 months. Her mother is 37 years old. She is a highly educated Egyptian lawyer. She did a law degree, then left the law for about a decade before returning as a lecturer. The mother&#8217;s family are largely professional people working in education or in science based areas.</p>

The two families live in Northern Egypt in large towns about 30 miles from each other. I have had no chronology provided to me so I will be forgiven if dates are slightly out, but it will not be material. </p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">The father had been married for the first time, but that marriage came to an end by 2016 when he was introduced to and swiftly married the mother. The father has been living in England since about 2000 and has acquired British nationality. The mother has, so far as I am aware, only lived in Egypt prior to the marriage and she is an Egyptian national. She entered the country following the marriage on a spousal visa. The couple lived in Lancashire in the father&#8217;s rented property. </p>

She stayed for some months. The father, who did not go with her, was not enthusiastic about her going because of the Covid outbreak and because of her pregnancy. He was even less enthusiastic about her returning. He had felt that her role was by his side as he struggled with keeping his work afloat in Covid. He was not pleased about her absence and he pronounced Talaq by telephone.</p>

The father had told the mother that he loved somebody else. She says that he kept her short of money. He said he did not have spare money and paid for everything he could. It is that behaviour, namely saying that he loved somebody else, which is said to constitute the emotional abuse, and the financial behaviour, the financial abuse. </p>

She had previously made contact with the local social services and complained about what she regarded as the father&#8217;s domestic abuse. She had been advised of the existence of Clare&#8217;s Law and discovered that the father had a conviction for battery of his first wife in 2016 for which he was fined. That apparently was thought to put her at risk of physical abuse.</p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">Around the turn of the year, 2021, the mother&#8217;s complaints had extended to a significant fear of FGM. It is clear to me that the complaints that were made by her of danger to the child were largely from the paternal family, but she also expressed the view that her own brother might be a risk. The mother herself had undergone the procedure, organised, as I accept it was, by her own father without consulting her mother, and that it happened whilst her mother was at work. It took place when she was ten, which places it in or about 1995. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">The mother made it very clear to those to whom she was expressing her fears that she did not want to go to Egypt. She was frightened of doing so because if she did, she felt that her daughter might be subject to FGM. She said that the father would not be able to stand up to his own relatives who would wish to see the procedure carried out. She also expressed an anxiety that the father might remove her daughter to Egypt at his family&#8217;s behest. These fears were expressed to a large number of people including social workers from the two different Local Authorities, refuge workers, and domestic abuse charity workers, and her complaints were broadly all of the same nature. </p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">By at least February the fear of FGM was the mother&#8217;s principle cause of concern and domestic abuse had disappeared into the background. She told the social worker that the father&#8217;s family believed in FGM and that his own nieces had been subject to FGM. </p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">It seems to me an oddity of the social services&#8217; approach that everything that the mother said was taken as gospel truth. No enquiries were made of the father or the extended family. I understand that the social services&#8217; starting point, and certainly the starting point of the refuge, should be to listen to the mother, but there is a difference between listening and assessing. </p>

In August 2021 the mother was saying that there was no risk of FGM and went on to explain, as she continues to state, that everything that she was alleged to have said was either mistranslated, miscommunicated by others, well meaning or not, on her behalf, or simply not said. </p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">In these proceedings the father has always said that there is no risk from his family of FGM. His engagement in these proceedings has been inconsistent, it seems to me because he has always put his work first. Likewise, he has been passive in seeking contact which he says that he wants, and I accept that he does want. Not much turns on his position, but he has not been very proactive in taking steps in these proceedings or communicating his views to the Local Authority.</p>

Some three working days before the case was due to start, when I was sitting in Nottingham, it was drawn to my attention that an email had been received by the court which suggested that the mother was without representation for the trial that was about to begin. I called the case in for urgent directions, and counsel who had just been instructed attended on the mother&#8217;s behalf. Over the next few days and weekend he worked extremely hard on preparing the mother&#8217;s case. On the second day he was abruptly dismissed by the mother.
