As a consequence of these proceedings and in particular from August 2003 until very recently, X lived in foster care provided by a commercial company.

I make no apologies for having had to choose between equally cogent but different professional opinions and where I have done so I have identified my reasons.  In permitting the admission of expert evidence, the court expressly determines that there is a need for a particular skill and expertise which the court does not possess.  It does not follow that an eminent opinion so admitted (and even if agreed to by others equally eminent) is sufficient to bind a court.</p>

The mere expression of opinion or belief by a witness, however eminent, that the vaccine can or cannot cause brain damage, does not suffice.  The court has to evaluate the witness and soundness of his opinion.  Most importantly this involves an examination of the reasons given for his opinions and the extent to which they are supported by the evidence.  The judge also has to decide what weight to attach to a witness&#8217;s opinion by examining the internal consistency and logic of his evidence; his precision and accuracy of thought as demonstrated by his answers; how he responds to searching and informed cross-examination and in particular the extent to which a witness faces up to and accepts the logic and proposition put in cross-examination or is prepared to concede points that are seen to be correct; the extent to which a witness has conceived an opinion and is reluctant to re-examine it in light of later evidence, or demonstrates a flexibility of mind which may involve changing or modifying opinions previously held; whether or not a witness is biased or lacks independence&#8221;</p>

Paper overviews can artificially limit the contextual material upon which opinion and in particular diagnostic opinion is given and can reduce the quality or cogency of the forensic expert&#8217;s opinion by his or her reliance on multiple hearsay.  To that extent I agree with the analysis of Professor Tim David as discussed in a recent article on forensic evidence in family proceedings: <span style="font-style:italic">Arch Dis Child </span>(2004) 799-804.  The simple point is that forensic medical practice should mirror clinical medical practice unless there is a very good reason to the contrary which, if relied upon, should be overt.  Wherever possible, a forensic practitioner should rely upon the available primary data and for the paediatrician that would usually include seeing the patient and carers.  Whether my conclusion is one that is of general application must be the subject of further inter-disciplinary professional debate: it is after all lawyers and courts who have control over the manner of instruction of forensic experts. </p>

That happened on 6 separate occasions over a period of 11 days.  She remains resolute in her evidence that she has no recollection of doing so.  It is accordingly very difficult to deduce what her intention may have been.  Having heard mother in evidence, I find that there can be no doubt, that as mother was herself an insulin dependent diabetic, she knew of the consequences to Z of her being prescribed insulin if she was not in fact diabetic.</p>

Mother was at all times in control of the BM machines that were used to take the electronic readings of the blood sugar levels.  I have no doubt that in common with many other diabetes sufferers, she failed to enter the date/time electronic data that would have helped to provide an analysis of the records that the machine keeps.  I accept the technical evidence that the records will be internally accurate (i.e. consistent) once a machine is calibrated and that those readings cannot be manipulated by deletion or sequence alteration.  There is of course the possibility that out of date &#8216;sticks&#8217; can be used which will affect the accuracy of readings but I have considered that possibility in my analysis of the records.</p>

As almost all of the readings relate to mother&#8217;s own diabetic condition, one can hypothesise that her own blood sugar levels vary considerably and that her own condition is relatively unstable.  From her own evidence I can deduce with some certainty that she is well aware of that fact and indeed she has in the past required hospitalisation when she has become hypoglaecemic and unstable.</p>

This would be an unlikely event but one I do not exclude even though the illness would ordinarily be expected to be severe.  In any event, I have come to the conclusion that that explanation even if applicable to the illness that Z suffered for part of the material time would not account for all of the discrepancies in the recorded results and the recollections of the same.</p>

I have come to the conclusion on this aspect that father was correct in his earliest witness statements, namely, that mother was over influenced by the advice and/or healthcare presentations of others and that she convinced herself that Z was exhibiting symptoms of diabetes.

I have come to the conclusion having listened to both of them that outside of the seizures I have described, much of what mother was reporting was a confusion between genuine seizures and wobbly episodes.   In addition, having regard to what Dr R said in evidence, I think it is probable that mother has to some extent exaggerated what were wobbly episodes so that they have been reported as and construed to be seizures.  I do not believe this to have been deliberate or malicious exaggeration but an ingrained attitude of over dramatic description i.e. she is not an objectively reliable medical historian as to detail.</p>

Having regard to the volume of evidence about wobbly episodes, I find it to be significant that, as Dr C confirms, the only date upon which mother presented Z as having a &#8220;wobbly day&#8221; was the day of the fit in October 1999 when the child was given rectal Diazapam by her (following advice she was given as to what to do).

Her eyes would not follow events and would appear glazed.  She would not be concentrating and would have slurred speech and a clumsy gait.  At times she could not control her limbs and would usually be described as drowsy and sometimes very sleepy.  She had the demeanour of a person who was drunk.

If I apply the essential logic of his argument to the evidence of Dr G, which I accept, then it is equally likely for there to have been an underlying medical disorder that caused repeated ataxic episodes.

JG believes that her professional integrity was questioned by mother and that the vehicle for that was communication through her (JG&#8217;s) son.  I have no doubt that mother complained about JG and that there was nothing in the substance of the complaint.  There is insufficient evidence for me to say that mother&#8217;s complaint was deliberately false in the sense that she used it to divert a professional from her investigations but JG&#8217;s reaction was very understandable and I do not criticise her for it.  It is probable that the complaint was an example of mother&#8217;s increasing level of panic and frustration at the lack of consistent or conclusive diagnosis and she wrongly interpreted JG to be &#8216;the enemy&#8217;.</p>

She confirmed that a diagnosis such as cerebral palsy would have been considered because that condition involves an altered tone or spasticity.  There can be different alterations in tone, high and low and different presentations at the same time i.e. in combination.  Z&#8217;s altered gait and presentation would have been a low tone or floppy upper trunk together with high tone in her lower limbs.  Z&#8217;s altered posture would involve muscle contraction at rest in her legs.  The alteration in soft tissue over time can itself lead to pain for a number of reasons but one is perhaps more obvious than the rest, increased muscle tone can alter the blood supply to limbs such that the child could experience severe cramp pains that would cause her to scream.  The medical record that sets out the independent observation of Z&#8217;s thigh muscles rippling and bulging may be indicative of the extent of the tonal problem she experienced.</p>
