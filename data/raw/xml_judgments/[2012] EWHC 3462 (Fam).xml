The matter came before me on the afternoon of the 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> November 2012, having been listed "at risk" with a two hour time estimate.  In the event, with a substantial file of papers and two bundles of authorities to consider, this was an inadequate time estimate and I had no alternative but to reserve my judgment, albeit that in an application such as this time may be of the essence, hence I have hastened to produce this Judgment.  If I have not extensively recited all of the authorities that were placed before me, it is not because I have not considered them, rather it is because of the need to communicate my decision to the parties in respect of this urgent matter.  I am grateful to all counsel for their detailed and helpful skeleton arguments, and for their oral submissions. </p>

The PMA, which purported to be governed by the law of State A, made provision for financial resolution on divorce. The agreement provided for the possibility that the couple might reside in various jurisdictions and recited that the PMA was still intended to bind them and to remain subject to State A law. The PMA provided that the couple agreed to submit any questions about its validity, interpretation or enforceability to arbitration by a trained family law practitioner in State A.  Clause 8.1 of the PMA provided as follows:  </p>

Each party expressly waives any  right to trial by a court or trial by a jury on such issues.  The Parties further  agree that any arbitration that should be required under this Article shall be  conducted in [State A]."</span></p>

The provision that was made for the Wife comprised (a) $50,000 on execution of the agreement and thereafter (b) $200,000 per annum up to a maximum of $3m.

The Wife disputes that the courts in State A have jurisdiction to consider the Petition and the Wife is seeking in State A to dismiss the Husband's petition for want of jurisdiction.  On the 4 October 2012 an application was issued by the Husband for a stay of the English suit on the grounds of (a) the arbitration clause and (b) <span class="Emphasis">forum conveniens</span>.  Mr Pointer QC asserts on behalf of the Wife that the first of those two grounds was not a basis for a stay of the English suit: he says that it could only have been a ground for stay of the financial remedy claim, and my preliminary view is that this assertion must be correct.  </p>

The return date of that application may be some months away.  In the meantime, however, as explained below, the Husband is pressing ahead with (one set of) the proceedings that he has instituted in State A .  The Wife asserts that it will be hard for him to establish that the courts of State A have jurisdiction to entertain the divorce proceedings since he was not domiciled there for a year before he launched the suit.  Plainly, that is not a matter which is presently before me, or about which I should express any opinion. </p>

The essence of the Wife's complaint to support the instant application for an <span class="Emphasis">Hemain</span> injunction is that her English proceedings have effectively been stayed, the Husband's State A proceedings have been stayed on his own motion, but the Husband is nevertheless pressing ahead with his action in the X County Superior Court so that the arbitration process can proceed.  Mr Pointer QC states on behalf of the Wife that the Husband's underlying policy is to delay in England and advance the arbitration in the US so as to hijack the stay application here.  He says that I must invoke the <span class="Emphasis">Hemain</span> jurisdiction here in order to preserve a level playing field between the parties until the issue has been properly investigated.  </p>

Mr Scott QC, on behalf of the Husband, did complain that the Wife had not filed any evidence but, in the circumstances pertaining in applications such as this, I do not draw any important distinction between the statement of Ms Davis and a statement that the Wife could have signed herself.  If any technical point is to be pursued, it can be cured by the Wife undertaking to file and serve a statement confirming the truth of what Ms Davis says in her statement dated 20 November or, as I said in court at the time, the Wife could have sworn in court as to the truth of what Ms Davis says in her statement. </p>

	    <p class="jus" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.25in">In short, the Wife contends (through Ms Davis) that she should not be bound by the PMA.  She says that the parties entered into the PMA 4 days prior to their wedding.  The Wife contends that she was told by the Husband that if she did not sign the PMA he would not proceed with the marriage.  This, she contends, coupled with the imminent arrival of 125 guests (many of whom were flying in from different jurisdictions and states), placed her under a great deal of pressure.  She also says that she had been "<span class="Emphasis">led to believe by the Husband that there would be some flexibility in the financial settlement in the event that they were to separate in the future</span>".  Mr Pointer QC's note says that "<span class="Emphasis">there may be other grounds</span>" for not holding the Wife to the PMA.  I pay no regard to that assertion for the purposes of the decision that I have to make, devoid as it is of any particularity.  </p>

The Wife has declined to co-operate.  The Husband has the pending proceedings in the State A court referred to above, to determine whether the PMA's enforceability should indeed be resolved by arbitration.  The Wife now asks me to order the Husband to stop his State A proceedings, for the time being at least, and the arbitration.  For the Husband, Mr Scott QC contends that this is misconceived. He maintains that the English court only exceptionally restrains foreign arbitration proceedings and that it is inappropriate to do so here.  He says that the right course is to await: (i) the decision of the State A court, as the supervising court of the arbitration; and (ii) if arbitration is ordered to proceed, the outcome of the arbitration.  </p>

Mr Pointer QC submits that the circumstances that pertain in this case "<span class="Emphasis">are quintessential territory for an Hemain injunction</span>", the idea being that a party should not be able to secure an unfair advantage by delaying or stopping the English proceedings, while pressing ahead abroad.  Mr Scott QC says that it is a power to be exercised with caution, not least because although as a matter of English legal form the injunction is granted <span class="Emphasis">in personam</span>, "<span class="Emphasis">the remedy cannot avoid being seen as an indirect interference with the process of the foreign court</span>": Dicey at 12-078 citing <span class="Emphasis">British Airways Board v Laker Airways Ltd</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1985] AC 58" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1985">[1985] AC 58</ref> and other cases.  Mr Pointer QC answers this by stating that he is not seeking an anti-suit injunction, he merely wants to secure an interim injunction, designed to preserve the status quo ante pending the hearing of the application for a stay.  He relies here on a passage from the judgment of Munby J (as he then was) in <span class="Emphasis">R v R (Divorce: Hemain injunction)</span> [2005]1FLR 386 where he said: </p>

The purpose of a Hemain injunction is to prevent one spouse stealing a march on the other by manipulating the two sets of proceedings to his own forensic advantage.  Whether or not that is in truth what he is doing, and whether or not the case for the grant of a Hemain injunction is thus made out, turns in the final analysis not on questions of forum (non) conveniens, nor on the question of whether or not England is the natural forum, but on whether, at a time when typically those questions have still to be resolved, the spouse who it is sought to injunct is conducting the litigation &#8211; the two sets of proceedings &#8211; to his own forensic advantage and, more particularly, in a manner that can properly be characterised as vexatious, oppressive or unconscionable."</span></p>

The use of the word "unconscionable" derives from English equity law. It was the courts of equity that had the power to grant injunctions and the equity jurisdiction was personal and related to matters which should affect a person's conscience. But the point being made by the use of the word is that the remedy is a personal remedy for the wrongful conduct of an individual. It is essentially a 'fault' based remedial concept. Other phrases have from time to time been used to describe the criticism of the relevant person's conduct, for example, "vexatious" and "oppressive", but these are not to be taken as limiting definitions; it derives from "the basic principle of justice" (per Lord Goff, SNI Aerospatiale v Lee, at 893)."</span></p>

The arbitration agreement must be treated as a "distinct agreement" and can be void or voidable only on grounds which relate directly to the arbitration agreement. Of course there may be cases in which the ground upon which the main agreement is invalid is identical with the ground upon which the arbitration agreement is invalid. For example, if the main agreement and the arbitration agreement are contained in the same document and one of the parties claims that he never agreed to anything in the document and that his signature was forged, that will be an attack on the validity of the arbitration agreement.

I have to decide whether the Husband is being oppressive or vexatious in desiring to continue his arbitration process in State A whilst having, in effect, stayed the Wife's proceedings in England. </p>

I agree with Mr Pointer that an interim order is to be viewed differently from a full anti-suit injunction, the former being limited in scope and purpose. </p>

It is clear from the authorities, and in particular from Munby J (as he then was) in <span class="Emphasis">Bloch v Bloch</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 1 FLR 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 1 FLR 1</ref>, and in<span class="Emphasis"> R v R</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 FLR 386" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 FLR 386</ref>, and from Baker J in <span class="Emphasis">S v S</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] 2 FLR 502" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] 2 FLR 502</ref>, that I have to ask myself a number of questions:</p>

	      <p class="ind" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in"><span class="Strong">Can it be shown that England is the natural forum and that pursuit of the foreign proceedings (here, arbitration) would be vexatious or oppressive</span>?   In my judgment, the answer to this question must be in the negative.  The parties entered into a PMA which the parties recorded as desiring, with the benefit of full advice.  Of course, the Wife may show that there are good reasons not to be held to it, but that is an issue which she can raise with the arbitrator appointed in accordance with the PMA.  I take fully into account the fact that, as Baker J said in <span class="Emphasis">S v S</span>, when seeking an <span class="Emphasis">Hemain</span> injunction, in contrast to a permanent anti-suit injunction, there is no need to show that England is the natural forum.  As Mr Pointer succinctly put it, the question is not whether it is unconscionable for the Husband to take proceedings in the US, but whether it is unconscionable for him to issue an application for a stay of the English proceedings and at the same time press ahead with the proceedings in State A.   I do not find, in the particular circumstances of this case, that the Husband is acting to his own forensic advantage and, more particularly, in a manner that can properly be characterised as vexatious, oppressive or unconscionable.</p>

The fact is, that given the terms of their PMA, and the express clause providing that issues as to its validity are themselves to be the subject of arbitration, the Wife has not yet satisfied the court, on the balance of probabilities, that England is the natural forum to determine the financial issues arising on the divorce of this American family who made a PMA with express provision that those issues be determined by arbitration in State A.  However, I recognise that, in the case of an interim injunction, this question is substantially subsumed into the wider question addressed at a) above and c) below. </p>

	      <p class="ind" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in"><span class="Strong">Is The Husband behaving vexatiously or oppressively by seeking arbitration in State A?</span>  In my judgment it is hard to see how the Husband can properly be accused of such behaviour when what he seeks to do is to invoke the arbitration clause contained within the PMA which the parties signed, with the benefit of legal advice.  That is not to pre-determine the issue which the Wife raises in relation to the pressure that she says she was under when she signed the PMA.  Indeed, as I have set out above, I am assuming for the purposes of this Judgment that she has an arguable case in that regard.  It was made clear by Baker J in <span class="Emphasis">S v S</span> that it is not sufficient simply to demonstrate that the Respondent is seeking a stay of proceedings in this country whilst continuing in the meantime to litigate abroad.  It all depends on the facts.  The facts of the instant case are unusual, indeed I have been directed to no reported case of an <span class="Emphasis">Hemain</span> injunction where a spouse is seeking to rely on an arbitration clause.  In my judgment, it is that arbitration clause which makes this case different.  An American couple took American advice and entered into an American PMA which contained an arbitration clause.  That clause also provided a means of resolving any issue as to the validity of the PMA itself.  This means that the Wife would appear to have a proper forum for airing her case that she was pressurised into signing the PMA.  I do not find that the Husband is behaving vexatiously or oppressively by invoking the arbitration clause in the PMA. </p>

I have already stated that in my judgment the conduct complained of is not vexatious or oppressive. </p>

This must apply all the more in a case where the parties have at least some expectation that their PMA will be upheld, although as I have said, there is provision for determining the status of the PMA itself.  If the matter is to proceed in State A, there will be an arbitration hearing there at which the Wife will have the opportunity to present evidence setting out the reasons why she should not be held to the PMA.  If it is determined that the Wife should not be held to the PMA for the reasons summarised above, or at all, then the question of forum will presumably remain very much alive between the parties.  </p>
