On the particular facts arising here, it falls to me to consider whether an aunt who brought her teenage nieces to this country in 2022 pursuant to a Guardianship order obtained in the Family Court in Karachi, Pakistan, and who later applied for an adoption order in this country, brought them here &#8216;for the purposes of adoption&#8217;.</span></p>

She accordingly contacted the Coram International Adoption Centre (&#8216;CIAC&#8217;), enquiring about the arrangements for adopting children then living abroad; she studied the CIAC website, but believed from her contact with them that their work was principally targeted to couples who were seeking to bring non-related (orphaned) children from abroad specifically for the purposes of adoption, and &#8220;this did not apply to me&#8221;. At or about the same time, the Applicant</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000"> also contacted her local authority with the same enquiry; nothing came of this either.  Sometime later, the Applicant sought</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> advice from immigration solicitors in England about bringing the children to this country; she was advised to obtain &#8216;an adoption order&#8217; in Pakistan.  </span></p>

Once there, she says that she was advised by lawyers that an adoption order was not available to her in Pakistan, and she was advised instead to issue formal Guardianship proceedings, under the Guardians and Wards Act of 1890 (the statute under which I believe that a limited number of adoption orders are in fact made in Pakistan) in the Karachi East Family Court.  She did so, I find, with the intention of safeguarding the child's welfare in her care in the most complete and legally secure way available to her under the family laws of Pakistan.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">So let me turn to the facts.  I have considered carefully the reason and intent behind the Applicant&#8217;s decision to bring the children to this country in 2021, when they were left without a parent to care for them in Pakistan.  On the facts as I find them to be, the Applicant brought the children to this country &#8216;for the purpose&#8217; of providing them with a permanent home; as she put it herself, it was &#8220;to give [the children] love, home and a sense of belonging&#8221;: see </span>&#167;<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">18 above.  This step was taken in fulfilment of the obligations which had been placed upon the Applicant (as she saw it) by the children&#8217;s parents in 2010, by the creation of the Guardianship deed; the authority vested in her by this document was confirmed and reinforced by the Guardianship order which the Applicant obtained in the Family Court in Pakistan in November 2021. </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I accept that the Applicant genuinely believed that the order which she had obtained in Karachi was the equivalent of an adoption order; she understood that the order gave her the highest available level of responsibility for, and authority in respect of, the children. Her evidence in this regard is entirely plausible; international family law, and the vesting of parental rights under different legal regimes, is a complex area. Some adoption orders obtained abroad plainly do attract automatic recognition by the English Courts (see section 66(1) of the ACA 2002); the Home Office even recognises some &#8216;de facto&#8217; adoptions achieved abroad (see p.19 of the 2024 Guidance).  Unsurprisingly, it is acknowledged in the 2024 Guidance that circumstances may exist &#8220;where it is not clear if a child&#8217;s situation can count as lawful adoption. In these circumstances the adoptive parents should seek legal advice as to the status of the child&#8221; (p.6), which is precisely what the Applicant ultimately did here.   The Applicant further told me, crucially, that she did not believe that she would need to make an application to adopt the children once she had arrived in this jurisdiction with them; she thought she had all that she would need to exercise full responsibility for them.  As I referenced above, she discovered the need to do so only when HM Passport Office informed her that the Guardianship order granted in the Family Court in Karachi did not endow her with the legal status which she had believed she had acquired there.  </span></p>

It follows that this application can be dealt with in accordance with the regime which applies to ordinary non-agency adoptions.</span></p>

Those regulations require, inter alia, a United Kingdom adoption agency to assess the suitability of persons wishing to adopt (regulation 3); the regulations require the prospective adopter to obtain an eligibility certificate from the Secretary of State for Education (confirming that the person has been assessed and approved as eligible and suitable to be an adoptive parent) (regulation 4); the regulations further require the prospective adopter to take various steps to demonstrate the security and integrity of their plans for adoption (obtaining reports from the relevant foreign authority, visiting the child in a discrete visit in advance of the visit in which the prospective adopter then brings the child back). These regulations were plainly not complied with in the instant case, and if the bringing of these children into the United Kingdom had been &#8216;for the purposes of their adoption&#8217; this would in all probability have been punishable under&#160;section 83 of the ACA 2002. </span></p>

The regulations were not, I believe, designed to capture a case such as this, but are rather targeted at potentially unsuitable carers seeking to bring unrelated infants to this country to create a family by way of adoption.  Although the Applicant failed to apply to the Adoption Agency for an assessment of her suitability to adopt the children (regulation 3) prior to bringing the children to the UK, she has nonetheless subsequently been very favourably assessed since her return. She has co-operated fully with the Adoption Agency in providing the information it required to undertake such an assessment (regulation 3).  Although she failed to provide the Adoption Agency with the notification and information set out in regulation 4(2)(b) and (d) prior to and after visiting the child in the state of origin, I am satisfied that there has been no prejudice or compromise to the overall assessment process. Although the Applicant did not obtain the certificate of eligibility from the Secretary of State for Education (regulation 4(2)(a)(i)/(ii) AFER 2005) she nonetheless applied properly and in a timely way to the Home Office for entry visas for the children under rule 297 of the Immigration Rules. The Applicant failed to give notice to the relevant local authority within 14 days of the children&#8217;s arrival in the UK of her intention to adopt them (regulation 4(4)), but she did give notice to the authority of the children&#8217;s arrival within about four weeks, by no later than 5 December 2022, and gave notice of her intention to adopt as soon as she had been given leave to make the application by HHJ Karp.  </span></p>
