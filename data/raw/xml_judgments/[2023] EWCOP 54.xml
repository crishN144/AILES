	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Miss T is the much loved member of a close-knit family. She is one of four siblings (three sisters and a brother). She was diagnosed with advanced cervical carcinoma on 12 September 2023. A CT scan undertaken on 11 October 2023 confirmed her tumour was (then) 7.5 cm wide. To treat her cancer she needs two courses of urgent treatment: (1) five weeks of daily external beam radiotherapy and concurrent weekly cisplatin chemotherapy; and (2) high-dose rate brachytherapy delivered over a three day period. The applicant describes this latter treatment as &#8220;highly invasive, painful and distressing&#8221;. Stage 1 cannot be commenced until there is certainty that stage 2 will be provided because of the side effects, and because the risks of stage 1 are not medically justifiable without stage 2 being administered. Her family are in shock and deeply concerned for her.</p>

Recognising the distressing nature of the treatment, they ask the court to authorise the ventilation and sedation of Miss T over the three day necessary period for delivery of the brachytherapy. Without the brachytherapy, Miss T&#8217;s life expectancy would be a matter of months. They wish to begin the stage 1 treatment on Monday 20 November 2023. </p>

This is necessary to protect her identity and confidential information. I also prohibited the naming of the treating clinicians. There is currently no public interest in reporting this information. The reporting restriction represents the correct balance between Article 8 and 10 ECHR for now. </p>

She has never lived independently and needs support. She is surrounded by a happy family with whom she lives. She has a great interest in animals and loves to visit and feed nearby horses. She is very close to her twin sister. BT informs me she operates intellectually at around the five year level. She is described as gentle and eager to agree.</p>

No party felt it necessary to call evidence and ask questions. I heard the briefest of submissions. Therefore, at the conclusion of the hearing on 16 November 2023, I informed the parties of my decision. Namely, that Miss T lacks capacity in the relevant areas; and, notwithstanding the arduous treatment regime, the proposed treatment is in her best interests. After careful scrutiny, it is also necessary to authorise the ventilation and sedation of Miss T over the &#8216;stage 2&#8217; three day period.   I briefly set out below my reasons for making the declarations and orders sought.</p>

He has exhibited certain earlier psychiatric reports (one relates to property and affairs from 2020 and noted &#8220;significant cognitive impairment&#8221; when the mini-mental state examination was carried out).  His written evidence is that Miss T can read a little &#8220;and has no idea even about simple maths&#8221;.

She has been in this role since 2005. She diagnosed Miss T with a locally advanced cervical carcinoma (FIGO state IIIC1 squamous cell carcinoma). She has been involved with Miss T&#8217;s care since 9 October 2023. She notes that Miss T was diagnosed after a cervical biopsy undertaken on 12 September 2023.  She states that thereafter it was important to determine whether her cancer had metastasised. It was agreed, after careful thought, that Miss T would tolerate a CT scan. This was undertaken without sedation on 11 October 2023. The investigations reported a 17mm left external iliac lymph node which is suspicious but no other nodal or metastatic disease. The decision was made that curative and not palliative treatment was required. </p>

Her family were involved. In advance of this meeting, Dr M met with Miss T and a carer on 13 October 2023. Dr M discussed the treatment options. She concluded that Miss T did not have capacity to make a decision to consent to the proposed treatment course for her cervical carcinoma. Thereafter a multi-disciplinary team met to discuss Miss T&#8217;s treatment options on 20 October 2023. The MDT comprised gynae-oncologists, oncologists, radiologists, pathologists. The MDT confirmed the treatment was:</p>

She notes because of the complexity of Miss T&#8217;s case she has experienced some delay and there cannot be further delay going forward as that could lead to a reduced cure rate. As per guidance from the Royal College of Radiologists and British Gynaecological Society Guidelines the entire stage 1 and stage 2 treatment should be completed within 50 days for maximum effect. This would mean that Miss T would receive the brachytherapy between 2-4 January 2024. </p>

She says this is an important part of the radical treatment of cervix cancer. At the start of brachytherapy, patients are taken to an operating theatre where applicators are placed into the cervix, uterus and additional interstitial needles to ensure coverage of the tumour, parametrium and vaginal extensions. She describes in some detail the delicate and difficult nature of the treatment, which I set out, as it explains why the applicant has deemed it necessary to seek the court&#8217;s authorisation for three days of ventilation and sedation. Dr M states: </p>

		    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">&#8220;The applicator is inserted in theatre. When the applicator is inserted the ring shape sits at the top of the vagina, just below the cervix with the black tube inserted through the cervix into the canal of the uterus. Additional needles are then inserted into the tissues surrounding the cervix. There will be needles inserted through the ring. If there is still vaginal extension at the time of brachytherapy, the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> diagram shows a perineal plate which would be sutured to the skin on the vulva with 6 stitches and then needles pushed through the vulval skin to treat extension down the vagina. The applicator is kept in-situ with gauze vaginal packing and sutured in place. It is understandable that patients find this treatment difficult to tolerate. In all circumstances of treatment, the patient is looked after one to one by a nurse with an epidural and patient-controlled analgesia providing continual analgesia throughout the 2 or 3 days of their admission. In view of the size of [Miss T&#8217;s] tumour I would anticipate that interstitial needles will be required.&#8221;</p>

The patient is also given a patient-controlled analgesia to press and a one-to-one nurse is allocated to care for the patient. If interstitial needles are required, then an epidural is inserted which is kept running for the duration of the inpatient stay. The in-patient team regularly review the patients with epidurals. For patients with capacity, the applicator is removed following the final treatment using a Methoxyflurane inhaler to manage the pain and anxiety.</p>

For this reason, it is being proposed to undertake this part of the treatment as an inpatient on ITU sedated and ventilated for the whole time during her admission.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">&#8220;The proposal to deliver brachytherapy in four fractions over 3 days following a single operative procedure to insert the applicators reflects standard practice. Once the brachytherapy applicators have been put in place under anaesthetic it is important that they are not displaced by movement of the patient. This requires the patient to remain on bed rest throughout the three days. A urinary catheter is required and constipating medication is given to avoid bowel function during that time which would disturb the geometry of the applicators. Repeated scans before each of the four radiation exposures is imperative to identify any changes in applicator position and to recalculate doses to the bladder and bowel which will also change in size and position over this period. This is challenging for all women who have to undergo this procedure despite the use of regular analgesics and other medications. The proposal to undertake the brachytherapy under anaesthesia and sedation maintained throughout the period of treatment has been carefully considered and anaesthetic opinion given in the statement of Dr [K]. I agree that this approach is in the circumstances the only realistic means of delivering effective and safe brachytherapy given the underlying concerns with the ability of [Miss T] to understand and comply</p>

After MRI and CT scans, and with arterial and central venous lines in place, she would be cared for in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). As is common with patients in ICU, she would have continuous monitoring of her physiological parameters and her gas exchange. Her sedation will be monitored clinically using the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale. She will require to be transferred from ICU during the day to attend scans and radiotherapy treatment and transfer will be undertaken by a doctor and transfer technician.

Once the correct formulation of &#8220;the matter&#8221; has been arrived at, it is then that the court moves to identify the &#8220;information relevant to the decision&#8221; under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/3/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3(1)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref>.&#160; That latter task falls, as recognised by Cobb J in&#160;<span style="font-style:italic">Re DD</span>, to be undertaken on the specific facts of the case.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I remind myself that the assessment of capacity is time and issue specific. I am in no doubt, in November 2023, that Miss T is unable to make a decision whether to consent to the stage 1 and 2 treatments now and over the next two months. I have no doubt she is also unable to make a decision to consent to the ventilation and sedation. Her cognitive profile means that she cannot retain and understand all the relevant pieces of the information, even in broad outline, to be able to weigh up and use this information. I accept Dr M&#8217;s capacity assessment evidence set out above, supported as it is by two highly experienced learning disability nurses. Moreover, their assessment is entirely at one with the family&#8217;s view and the second respondent&#8217;s written evidence. Miss T cannot understand and weigh the relevant information and therefore she is unable to make a decision. That inability is, in my judgement, caused by her cognitive challenges brought about by her unique learning profile, which is an impairment and/or a disturbance of the mind or brain. Therefore it is clear she lacks capacity in respect of the matter for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> and I will make a declaration to that effect. I am satisfied in arriving at this conclusion that both all practicable steps have been taken to assist her to obtain the ability to make the decision, and furthermore, that within the timescales necessary she will be unable to be in a position to make a capacitous decision. In particular I see no basis for thinking that over the course of the treatment, and before 2 January 2024, there is any likelihood of steps being taken to assist her to be able to consent to the ventilation and sedation. This is not realistic and should not be attempted given further explanation of her cancer and the difficult nature of the treatment is likely to be anxiety causing. </p>

I also accept the medical evidence of Dr M in respect of the risks of the stage 1 treatment and in particular the life threatening risk of neutropenic sepsis. Miss T will need careful observation from professionals.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I also accept the risks of the anaesthesia set out by Dr K and agreed by Dr Bell. General anaesthesia is routinely offered and is safe, but as the summary of the evidence above notes there are risks. I am comforted by the fact Miss T has very recently safely managed general anaesthesia. However, I do not discount the fact that this Trust&#8217;s medical team have not provided the brachytherapy treatment in circumstances where the patient is sedated and ventilated. Each move from ICU to the radiotherapy site comes with small risks. Great care will be needed.  I also factor in the risks of delusion and the risks of pneumonia from the prolonged ventilation. </p>

As is well known the best interests assessment is much wider than the medical evidence, the risks, benefits and disbenefits. The court&#8217;s aim is to arrive at the right decision, from the options, for the person the subject of the proceedings. </p>

However, she does not know she has cancer. As I came into court yesterday, Ms Richards helpfully sent me a note asking me not to mention the &#8216;cancer&#8217; word as Miss T was briefly on the remote hearing link. Miss T has very little understanding of her diagnosis and the prognosis options.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">As Baker J sets out (above) the continuation of life needs no elucidation. Certainly no justification. Miss T is, however, a person with a zest for life. Whether it is a question of her feelings or her values, she is a family person. She believes in spending time with her sisters and her brother. She loves the happy family time when they all share Christmas. She evidently enjoys her holidays with her family and they enjoy fun activities together. She is fortunate to live a life in a private home surrounded by her family. She has not known institutional care. Her parents wisely arranged financial, practical and housing matters with the assistance of her brother and her sister. Her family deal with her finances. Their evidence is clear that Miss T is desirous of this life. They wisely note, given her cognitive profile, that they have not troubled her with questions such as &#8216;would she want to live?&#8217; I understand their evidence to be that they need not ask that question, as the answer is obvious, that she does. That is hinted at in the photographs I have seen and the rich description of family life set out in the written evidence. This is a close, committed and caring family. Family life is a value that Miss T cherishes. She feels it every day. </p>

Her life has much value. Miss T is very close to one of her sisters and she has been unwell. Her brother is concerned for the health of Miss T&#8217;s sister, if palliation were the treatment route for Miss T. In the context of this close family, I place weight on the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4 (6)</ref> (c) factor: namely that Miss T would likely want to protect her twin sister from the anxiety and upset of her own early death.</p>

They are in favour of stage 1 and 2 and keen for it to start on Monday. I take into account the unanimous clinical and expert evidence that the stage 1 and stage 2 treatment with sedation and ventilation is in Miss T&#8217;s best interests. I have not lost sight of the fact that it is a considerable step for the state to authorise a patient to be rendered unconscious for three days to submit to an otherwise invasive, intimate and distressing treatment. In legal terms this is a profound interference in Miss T&#8217;s Article 8 ECHR right to respect both in terms of her bodily integrity, her dignity and her psychological wellbeing. I have deliberately set out in detail, in the summary of the evidence above, the nature of brachytherapy. It is important to understand the unpleasant, invasive nature of that treatment, which can lead to PTSD, to fully understand the necessity of sedation for Miss T. </p>

The interference in her Article 8 rights is necessary and proportionate for the reasons I have endeavoured to explain above in the best interests analysis. Life has significant value. Miss T&#8217;s rich life, enhanced by her family, is a thing of great value. Notwithstanding the risks and the difficult invasive treatment, stages 1 and 2 are plainly in her best interests, over a palliative pathway. I will make an order to that effect.</p>

It seems to me there is a question over whether Miss T would be deprived of her liberty when sedated. It is not necessary to resolve that question, given the urgency with which this judgment must be handed down. Any deprivation of liberty occasioned by the care home or inpatient hospital stay can be covered by standard or urgent authorisation of deprivation of liberty as provided for <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref>. </p>
