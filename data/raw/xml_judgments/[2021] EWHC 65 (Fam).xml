	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">It is clearly established in English law that an adult (that is, someone who has reached the age of 18) is presumed, unless proved otherwise, to have capacity to decide whether or not to accept medical or surgical treatment. It is equally clear that a capacitous adult has an absolute right to accept or refuse treatment, for reasons good or bad or, indeed, for no reason at all, and even if the consequence of refusal is the certainty of very serious harm or even death. The decision of a capacitous adult is therefore determinative, in the strict sense in which I use the word. Subject only to being satisfied that the capacitous adult&#8217;s expressed decision is in fact his true decision and not vitiated by the undue pressure of either events or people (as to which see <span style="font-style:italic">In re T (Adult: Refusal of Treatment)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1993] Fam 95" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1993">[1993] Fam 95</ref>) the only function of the court is to give effect to it, whether or not it might accord with his judicially-determined best interests. Indeed, the court is not concerned to evaluate, let alone to impose an outcome determined by, his best interests.  </p>

It is said that, whatever was or was not decided in those two cases, this is not the law. Times have changed, it is said. Views as to the proper balance between medical paternalism and patient autonomy have altered, with the balance, it is said, continuing to move against the former and in favour of the latter. The <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref> has fundamentally changed the legal landscape as also, in this particular context, it is said, has the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>. And there have been other developments in the law; especial reliance is placed upon what is, on any footing, the very important decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <span style="font-style:italic">AC and Others v Manitoba (Director of Child and Family Services) </span>2009 SCC 30, [2009] 2 SCR 181, [2009] 5 LRC 557.

[She] is not refusing all medical treatment. She is exercising a choice about how she wishes to fight her disease, a choice that is grounded in her human dignity, self-determination, bodily autonomy, and religious conscience. The Applicant seeks to deny [X] her autonomy, requesting a twoyear &#8220;rolling order&#8221; which authorises doctors to repeatedly impose a medical procedure on [X] which she finds deeply repugnant. The Applicant further asks that the &#8220;rolling order&#8221; remain effective right up to the point [X] reaches the arbitrary chronological age of 18.   </p>

It seems to me imperative that the court, sooner rather than later, and before we have the next crisis, is able to give proper attention to Mr Brady&#8217;s very important submissions so that the next time, if there is a next time and the case comes back to court, there will be a clear legal framework available for the resolution of the next crisis.

Unless, perish the thought, she were to die in the meantime, X would be celebrating her 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday in January 2021.

And, if the experience of the last two hearings is anything to go by, there will not be adequate time to consider this difficult legal question before urgent medical necessity intervenes.

In matters of religion, as in all other aspects of a child&#8217;s upbringing, the interests of the child are the paramount consideration. 44  There are many examples of the working out of these principles in the family courts. Sometimes, as in the cases involving blood transfusions for the children of Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, the issue is literally one of life or death (using those words in the secular sense).

Put shortly, our objective must be to maximise the child&#8217;s opportunities in every sphere of life as they enter adulthood. And the corollary of this, where the decision has been devolved to a &#8216;judicial parent&#8217;', is that the judge must be cautious about approving a regime which may have the effect of foreclosing or unduly limiting the child&#8217;s ability to make such decisions in future. </p>

This, I emphasise, is not such a case. The point is very simple and profoundly important. This court in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction in relation to children undoubtedly has power to authorise the use of restraint and physical force to compel a child to submit to a surgical procedure: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re C (Detention: Medical Treatment) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] 2 FLR 180" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] 2 FLR 180</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re PS (Incapacitated or Vulnerable Adult) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2007/623" uk:canonical="[2007] EWHC 623 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] EWHC 623 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 2 FLR 1083" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 2 FLR 1083</ref>. I say nothing about how this power should appropriately be exercised in the case of other forms of medical or surgical intervention. In the case of the proposed termination of a pregnancy, however, the point surely is this. Only the most compelling arguments could possibly justify compelling a mother who wished to carry her child to term to submit to an unwanted termination. It would be unwise to be too prescriptive, for every case must be judged on its own unique facts, but I find it hard to conceive of any case where such a drastic form of order &#8211; such an immensely invasive procedure &#8211; could be appropriate in the case of a mother who does not want a termination, unless there was powerful evidence that allowing the pregnancy to continue would put the mother&#8217;s life or long-term health at very grave risk. Conversely, it would be a very strong thing indeed, if the mother wants a termination, to require her to continue with an unwanted pregnancy even though the conditions in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1</ref> of the 1967 Act are satisfied. </p>

So, the vitally important question remains: Is the decision of a <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick</span> competent child determinative in the same way as the decision of a capacitous adult? If not, are there any, and if so what, circumstances in which the decision of a <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick</span> competent child <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> determinative? The question could hardly be more important, for on the answer depends whether the <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick</span> competent child is autonomous in the same way as a capacitous adult is autonomous.

Nor, in my judgment, is this an appropriate occasion to consider a point raised by Ms Butler-Cole and Mr Ruck Keene but not explored in argument: the question whether the appropriate procedure for cases of this kind is by application under the inherent jurisdiction or application for a specific issue order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.

It suffices to note that, whatever may be the appropriate procedure for a child under the age of 16, there can be no doubt that an application under the inherent jurisdiction is available in relation to such a child and that in relation to a child who has reached the age of 16 the application should, as Mostyn J recognised, be sought solely under the inherent jurisdiction, and not under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.     </p>

The 16- or 17-year-old is conclusively presumed to be &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Gillick</span> competent&#8221; or, alternatively, the test of &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Gillick</span> competence&#8221; is bypassed and has no relevance. The argument that W, or any other 16- or 17-year-old, can by refusing to consent to treatment veto the treatment notwithstanding that the doctor has the consent of someone who has parental responsibilities, involves the proposition that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/46/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> has the further effect of depriving such a person of the power to consent. It certainly does not say so. Indeed if this were its intended effect, it is difficult to see why the subsection goes on to say that it is not <span style="font-style:italic">necessary</span> to obtain the parents&#8217; consent, rather than providing that such consent, if obtained, should be ineffective.

First, her consent would be fully effective as such. Second, a failure or refusal to give consent would be fully effective as a veto, but only because no one else would be in a position to consent. If it is a possible view that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/46/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> is intended to put a 16- or 17-yearold in exactly the same position as an adult and there is thus some ambiguity, although I do not think that there is, it is a permissible aid to construction to seek to ascertain the mischief at which the section is directed.&#8221; </p>

I am quite unable to see how, on any normal reading of the words of the section, it can be construed to confer such a right. The purpose of the section is clear: it is to enable a 16-year-old to consent to medical treatment which, in the absence of consent by the child or its parents, would constitute a trespass to the person. In other words, for this purpose, and for this purpose only, a minor was to be treated as if it were an adult. That the section did not operate to prevent parental consent remaining effective, as well in the case of a child over 16 as in the case of a child under that age, is apparent from the words of sub<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section (3</ref>).&#8221; </p>

They were not concerned with the jurisdiction of the court. It is of the essence of that jurisdiction that the court has the power and the responsibility in appropriate cases to override the views of both the child and the parent in determining what is in the child&#8217;s best interests. Authoritative and instructive as they are, the speeches in <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick&#8217;s</span> case do not deal with the principles which should govern the exercise of this court&#8217;s jurisdiction in the present case.

		  <intro>
		    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.04in">&#8220;Since Parliament has not conferred complete autonomy on a 16-year-old in the field of medical treatment, there is no overriding limitation to preclude the exercise by the court of its inherent jurisdiction and the matter becomes one for the exercise by the court of its discretion. Nevertheless the discretion is not to be exercised in a moral vacuum. Undoubtedly the philosophy behind <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> of 1969, as well as behind the decision of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick&#8217;s</span> case is that, as children approach the age of majority, they are increasingly able to take their own decisions concerning their medical treatment. In logic there can be no difference between an ability to consent to treatment and an ability to refuse treatment &#8230; Accordingly the older the child concerned the greater the weight the court should give to its wishes, certainly in the field of medical treatment. In a sense this is merely one aspect of the application of the test that the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration. It will normally be in the best interests of a child of sufficient age and understanding to make an informed decision that the court should respect its integrity as a human being and not lightly override its decision on such a personal matter as medical treatment, all the more so if that treatment is invasive. In my judgment, therefore, the court exercising the inherent jurisdiction in relation to a 16- or 17year-old child who is not mentally incompetent will, as a matter of course, ascertain the wishes of the child and will approach its decision with a strong predilection to give effect to the child&#8217;s wishes. (The case of a mentally incompetent child will present different considerations, although even there the child&#8217;s wishes, if known, must be a very material factor.) Nevertheless, if the court&#8217;s powers are to be meaningful, there must come a point at which the court, while not disregarding the child&#8217;s wishes, can override them in the child&#8217;s own best interests, objectively considered. Clearly such a point will have come if the child is seeking to refuse treatment in circumstances which will in all probability lead to the death of the child or to severe permanent injury. An example of such a case was [<span style="font-style:italic">Re E (A Minor) (Wardship: Medical Treatment)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1993] 1 FLR 386" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1993">[1993] 1 FLR 386</ref>], which came before Ward J on 21 September 1990. There a 15-year-old Jehovah&#8217;s Witness, and his parents of the same faith, were refusing to allow doctors to give the boy a blood transfusion without which there was a strong risk (on the medical evidence) that the boy would die. Ward J authorised the blood transfusion. In my judgment he was right to do so. In the course of his judgment he said: </p>

So far in this judgment I have been principally concerned to explain why, as it seems to me, the court has not only the power but the inescapable responsibility of deciding, in that specific context, what is to be done in the interests of her welfare. I am very far from asserting any general rule that the court should prefer its own view as to what is in the best interests of the child to those of the child itself. In considering the welfare of the child, the court must not only recognise but if necessary defend the right of the child, having sufficient understanding to take an informed decision, to make his or her own choice. In most areas of life it would be not only wrong in principle but also futile and counter-productive for the court to adopt any different approach. In the area of medical treatment, however, the court can and sometimes must intervene. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.04in">It will, I think, be apparent from what I have said that even in the case of normal medical treatment I cannot accept [counsel&#8217;s] proposition that the child&#8217;s decision should determine the matter. The determination must always be that of the court. If one is then to try and specify the grounds upon which it would be right for the court to intervene I do not for my part find it particularly helpful to speak in terms of special or extraordinary cases as distinct from normal cases &#8230;  One must, I think, start from the general premise that the protection of the child&#8217;s welfare implies at least the protection of the child's life. I state this only as a general and not as an invariable premise because of the possibility of cases in which the court would not authorise treatment of a distressing nature which offered only a small hope of preserving life. In general terms, however, the present state of the law is that an individual who has reached the age of 18 is free to do with his life what he wishes, but it is the duty of the court to ensure so far as it can that children survive to attain that age. </p>

It makes no difference whether the risk arises from the action or inaction of others, or from the action or inaction of the child. Due weight must be given to the child&#8217;s wishes, but the court is not bound by them.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">There is, however, a further important point of principle to be derived from certain observations of Lord Donaldson that I have already quoted but which bear repetition. The context is, of course, that as a matter of generality (though not necessarily in all contexts: see in <span style="font-style:italic">In re D</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">Birmingham City Council v D (Equality and Human Rights Commission and others intervening) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2019/42" uk:canonical="[2019] UKSC 42" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] UKSC 42</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2019] 1 WLR 5403" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] 1 WLR 5403</ref>), the issue of whether a particular child is <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick </span>competent may arise at any time until the child, having reached the age of 18, has attained majority.

I do not criticise counsel for taking the point, but I have to say that it is the kind of point which probably has more traction amongst the dreaming spires of the Academy than in the robust and ultimately pragmatic world of the court room. We have to remember that the common law developed over the centuries as a process by which practical lawyers sought pragmatic, if principled, solutions to the practical problems thrown up by the unpredictable process of litigation, and that at the root of the process was the system of oral adversarial argument.

And, more directly germane to the issues I have to consider, only a person who has reached the age of 18 can make an advance decision (section 24(1)) or a lasting power of attorney (section 9(2)(c)). </p>

I say this in no criticism of Ms Butler-Cole and Mr Ruck Keene, whose submissions, which in part reflect certain views circulating in the Academy, have been immensely helpful in helping me to focus my thinking and to refine my conclusions. I have to say, however, that some of the thinking in the Academy savours too much of the Thomist schoolmen.

Rather, the courts proceed by examining the question of whether the person has the capacity to make a decision in relation to the treatment. I see no reason why, in principle, the same approach should not be followed when the question is one not of mental capacity but of <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick </span>competence.  </p>

However, the common law has more recently abandoned the assumption that all minors lack decisional capacity and replaced it with a general recognition that children are entitled to a degree of decision-making autonomy that is reflective of their evolving intelligence and understanding. This is known as the common law &#8216;mature minor&#8217; doctrine &#8230; The doctrine addresses the concern that young people should not automatically be deprived of the right to make decisions affecting their medical treatment. It provides instead that the right to make those decisions varies in accordance with the young person&#8217;s level of maturity, with the degree to which maturity is scrutinised intensifying in accordance with the severity of the potential consequences of the treatment or of its refusal. </p>

This literal interpretation of the &#8216;mature minor&#8217; doctrine, with respect, miscasts its actual development and application, both in Canada and abroad.

This is an analysis that is best analogized with a &#8220;sliding scale&#8221; type of approach.

Neither have attained the age of majority notwithstanding a recognition of competency either by statute or common law.

But whilst such protection is available to an adult, it might be arguable that an infringement of a <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick</span> competent teenager&#8217;s rights under article 8(1) (by forcing treatment on him) could be justified as being necessary to safeguard his life, as long as it is proportionate to the risks involved in the patient not receiving the treatment. It appears therefore that as long as the treatment is medically perfectly orthodox and life-saving, a domestic court might authorise treatment against the teenager&#8217;s wishes, without necessarily falling foul of articles 3 or 8 of the Convention.&#8221; </p>

In the sphere of medical assistance, even where the refusal to accept a particular treatment might lead to a fatal outcome, the imposition of medical treatment without the consent of a mentally competent adult patient would interfere with his or her right to physical integrity and impinge on the rights protected under art.8 of the Convention. </p>

However, for this freedom to be meaningful, patients must have the right to make choices that accord with their own views and values, regardless of how irrational, unwise or imprudent such choices may appear to others. Many established jurisdictions have examined the cases of Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses who had refused a blood transfusion and found that, although the public interest in preserving the life or health of a patient was undoubtedly legitimate and very strong, it had to yield to the patient&#8217;s stronger interest in directing the course of his or her own life. It was emphasised that free choice and self-determination were themselves fundamental constituents of life and that, absent any indication of the need to protect third parties &#8211; for example, mandatory vaccination during an epidemic, the state must abstain from interfering with the individual freedom of choice in the sphere of health care, for such interference can only lessen and not enhance the value of life.&#8221; </p>

It follows that Russian law protects the individual&#8217;s freedom of choice in respect to their health care decisions as long as the patient is a competent adult and there is no danger to innocent third parties. These provisions &#8230; were prima facie applicable in the instant case because all the refusals of blood transfusions which had been described in the domestic judgments had been formulated by adult Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses having capacity to make medical decisions for themselves. In the only case involving a minor, the hospital did not apply for judicial authorisation of a blood transfusion, although such a possibility was explicitly provided for in law, which indicates that authorisation was considered unnecessary for medical or other reasons.&#8221;  </p>

Thus it is now a commonplace that, in addressing the question of what is in a child&#8217;s best interests and required for the child&#8217;s welfare, the judge has to adopt the standards of 2021 and not those of 1989 (when the principle was enshrined in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, let alone those of 1925 (when the principle first received statutory recognition in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/45" uk:canonical="1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5) c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Guardianship of Infants Act 1925</ref>): see <span style="font-style:italic">Owens v Owens </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2017/182" uk:canonical="[2017] EWCA Civ 182" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWCA Civ 182</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2017] 4 WLR 74" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] 4 WLR 74</ref>, para 40: </p>

She says that there is cogent medical evidence before the court that: X is at risk of developing life-threatening complications of sickle cell disease on some future occasion for which a blood transfusion will be the only effective treatment; in the event of a further life-threatening sickle cell crisis X would be at &#8220;significant&#8221; risk of serious irreversible harm or death due to complications such as a stroke if she does not receive further blood transfusions; and a blood transfusion has good prospects of successfully treating a further life-threatening sickle cell crisis and improving her overall physical health. She also asserts that X will not resist the administration of a blood transfusion if authorised by the court and restraint will not be required. This is precisely the sort of case, she says, in which an anticipatory order should be made. It would be contrary to X&#8217;s best interests to defer an application until a further crisis develops, leading to the need to make a further urgent application to the court with the attendant risk that the court will have to reach a decision under pressure of time and without the advantage of proper representation. Such an order has the benefit of certainty and predictability and will avoid the need for further repeated applications to the court, potentially on an urgent basis if X&#8217;s condition deteriorates suddenly.      </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">So far as concerns <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref>(3A)(a) it is plain that it is not enough that the point of law is one &#8220;of general public importance&#8221;; it must also be &#8220;of national importance.&#8221; Despite the profundity of the ethical and societal issues to which Mr Brady refers, I am not persuaded that the matter is, within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref>(3A)(a), of &#8220;national importance.&#8221; Nor am I persuaded that the matter is &#8220;so significant&#8221; within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref>(3A)(b) as to justify a hearing by the Supreme Court.

That is a powerful point, but it is, in my judgment, heavily outweighed by the considerable advantage the Supreme Court (assuming for this purpose that the case ever gets there) will derive from having the benefit of the Court of Appeal&#8217;s considered views. </p>

Mr Brady identifies two matters on which, he submits, my judgment is vulnerable: first, what he refers to as &#8220;the greater freedom of the Court of Appeal to overrule or clarify&#8221; <span style="font-style:italic">In re R </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">In re W</span>; secondly, my failure &#8220;to identify a compelling State justification required by Article 14 &#8230; in conjunction with Articles 3, 5, 8 and 9 &#8230; to justify a law which permits a court to overrule the medical treatment decisions of a competent 16/17 year old &#8230; while prohibiting the court to similarly override the treatment decision of a person age 18 and older.&#8221; He submits that &#8220;such a distinction, based solely on age, is inherently arbitrary and cannot be justified.&#8221; I do not, with respect, accept either proposition as demonstrating a real prospect of success. There is nothing in what I have said to suggest that the Court of Appeal would have &#8220;greater freedom &#8230; to overrule or clarify.&#8221; As to the second point, Mr Brady has been unable to identify anything in the Strasbourg jurisprudence which supports his proposition; quite the contrary.      </p>
