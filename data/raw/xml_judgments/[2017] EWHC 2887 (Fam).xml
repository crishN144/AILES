The letter is from Oliver Urquhart Irvine, The Librarian and Assistant Keeper of the Queen&#8217;s Archives, and is addressed to The Postal Copies and Searches Department at the District Probate Registry at Leeds. It reads as follows:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;We recently ordered the will of the Duke of Windsor (your ref 45483) from the Find A Will search service on gov.uk; however, only the grant to the executors was received. On behalf of the Royal Archives, I would like to formally request a full copy of the will and codicil for research purposes. Although the Royal Archives holds many originals and copies of probate records for past members of the Royal Family, this is a gap in our holdings and therefore in our knowledge.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The Royal Archives is seeking to ascertain the identity of the current rights holder to the papers of Edward, Duke of Windsor whose copyright will not expire until 2042. As the law currently stands any literary works which were unpublished before 1 August 1989 remain in copyright for 70 after the death of the creator [<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1988/48" uk:canonical="1988 c. 48" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988</ref>]. The term &#8220;literary work&#8221; covers work, other than a dramatic or musical work, which is written, spoken or sung; it does not solely refer to works of literature but may also include letters, song lyrics, databases and computer programs to name a few examples. Copyright can exist independent of the ownership of a document and descends with the residue of the creator&#8217;s estate unless otherwise assigned. As such many other organisations hold papers created by the Duke of Windsor but do not hold the copyright and are likely to approach us for advice.  Similarly, we have previously been approached by researchers seeking permission to publish letters by the Duke of Windsor but have been unable to advise whether copyright is held by Her Majesty The Queen. With a copy of the will and codicil, we will be able to determine the identity of his residual beneficiary and begin the process of identifying the current copyright holder.</p>

All it seeks is a direction authorising the disclosure to Mr Irvine, in his capacity as The Librarian and Assistant Keeper of the Queen&#8217;s Archives, of copies of the will and codicil. (For the distinction between these two processes see the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Brown</span>, para 44.) There is, therefore, in my judgment, no need to invite the intervention of the Attorney General.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Irvine identifies two reasons in justification of the application. First, the desire of the Queen&#8217;s Archives to fill a gap in its holdings. Second, the practical need for the Queen&#8217;s Archives to identify those who currently hold the copyright in literary works created by the Duke of Windsor. Each of these two reasons is compelling. Either alone would, in my judgment, quite plainly justify the disclosure which is sought. It would be absurd to deny to the Royal Archives copies of the will and codicil of one who was born a Royal Prince, died a Royal Duke and was in his time His Majesty the King. </p>
