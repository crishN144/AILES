	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.6in">The court is dealing with two related applications concerning AG, age 24 years. The applications are made by the local authority and they seek orders under the Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007 (FMCPA) and under the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA). AG is represented by the Official Solicitor as AG&#8217;s litigation friend in both applications. AG&#8217;s parents, Mr and Mrs G, are respondents to both applications. They are unrepresented although have been assisted at each hearing by the McKenzie Friend, Mr H and an interpreter. HG, AG&#8217;s older brother, was a party to the application under the FMCPA but no orders are now sought by the local authority against him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.6in">These applications have been in existence for two years. During that time the parents have not objected to the continuation of an interim FMPO whilst assessments have been undertaken regarding AG&#8217;s capacity. The court determined in October 2022, largely based on the expert assessment undertaken by Dr Rippon, consultant psychiatrist, that AG had capacity in the following areas &#8211; residence, contact, marriage and sexual relations but not in relation to her capacity to conduct the proceedings in the court of protection, or in relation to the care and support she required, or her finances, Dr Rippon has since reported that AG also lacks capacity to conduct the FMPO proceedings. </p>

Mr and Mrs G both gave oral evidence with the assistance of an interpreter. In addition, there was the opportunity for me to meet AG in the presence of her solicitor and counsel. As had taken place when I have met her previously a note was taken and circulated to the parties.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.6in">The court is very conscious that the parents have not had legal representation and has taken every step to make sure they have been able to effectively participate in these proceedings. To their credit they have attended every court hearing. They have been supported by their McKenzie friend, Mr H, who has helped them actively liaise with the other parties. They have had the assistance of an interpreter at each hearing and the advocates have helped support them. Ms Sutton KC, in particular, has liaised with them and included in her questioning, points that she is aware the parents would wish to raise with the witnesses. The court is very grateful to the parties for the constructive and collaborative approach they have taken in this case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.6in">Ms S has been the allocated social worker since September 2021 when the matter was first referred to the local authority by the Home Office regarding the request for an assessment of AG&#8217;s capacity to enter into a marriage following the application by AG&#8217;s husband to join her here in the UK. Her statement outlines the steps she has taken since then and the basis of her concerns regarding the pressure AG is put under by her parents, as outlined in the relevant background above, and the extent of what she considers is their coercive and controlling behaviour. Ms S considered that following AG&#8217;s return home in October 2022 she was having to rely on AG&#8217;s boyfriend to get a true picture as to what was going on as AG was very guarded when she spoke to Ms S, and was unable to share her wishes and feelings and her fears of what her parents would do if she shared any information.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.6in">In her most recent statement Ms S sets out her assessment of the risks to AG of being forced into a marriage by her parents. In her view the risk to AG being forced into another marriage arranged by her family remains. She bases that on her view about AG&#8217;s vulnerability and what she considers to be the coercive and controlling behaviour towards her from her parents, which Ms S states she has experienced first-hand as described in her most recent statement. In addition, she considers that AG is not able to stand up to any pressure from her family and cites as examples AG&#8217;s inability to place boundaries around her parents visiting her at CG, she relied on the staff to do that at AG&#8217;s request. That dynamic combined with the family not being willing to accept any boundaries increases the risks to AG. As Ms S notes, AG has a history of saying one thing to her family and another to the professionals, which strongly suggests AG is not able to express her true views to the family. An additional risk, in Ms S&#8217;s view, is the inability of AG&#8217;s family to work constructively and openly with the public services that are there to protect AG. The circumstances surrounding the fall from the window in December 2022 illustrate this issue. Due to the inability of AG&#8217;s parents to give a full account of the events of the fall there was a delay in AG receiving the treatment she should have had. This had serious implications for AG as it delayed her knee injury being treated, and it resulted in two operations rather than one. All these factors feed into Ms S&#8217;s assessment that AG will be under pressure to marry again. Ms S acknowledges an arranged marriage is not a forced marriage but Ms S considers, due to  the risks of AG becoming anxious about this issue, she is at risk of losing capacity about this issue and would be unable to resist any pressure from the family to get married.</p>

For example, their non-compliance according to AG with the statement of expectations when AG returned home in October 2022. Ms S remained clear about the two conflicting accounts given about the December 2022 injuries, first the parents reporting a slip on the ice and then in January 2023 AG referring to jumping out of the window.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.6in">Ms S agreed with Ms Sutton that this was her first FMPO case. She also agreed there had been no assessment of risk at the start of the proceedings and she had not explored the differences in accounts regarding the circumstances of the marriage. For example, how many times AG had met Mr Q. Ms Sutton pressed Ms S regarding what steps had been taken to discuss with either AG or the parents about the trip back to Pakistan in March 2021. Ms S accepted she had not discussed that with either AG or her parents. Ms S agreed this was important information she had not properly analysed. Ms S stated the basis upon which she considered the marriage in 2019 was forced was because AG went to Pakistan not knowing she was going to be married. In considering the future risk and the matters Ms S said she took into account, she accepts she did not discuss those with AG&#8217;s parents, she said she based it on what AG told her only. Ms S accepted there is no evidence of a person AG is going to be forced to marry. Ms S said that she based her assessment of there being a high risk on the grounds of how the parents have behaved to date, particularly not being able to comply with the statement of intentions when AG returned home. Ms S accepted that AG was now in a different situation as she is not living at home and that protective factors were now in place. Ms S considers if an order is not in place it gives the family freedom to arrange a marriage and she thinks that would happen, however she accepted the protections in place now (with the support from AG&#8217;s placement) and that the situation is different. She agreed an updated risk assessment was required to reflect the changed position of where AG was now living.</p>

She has supported Ms S since mid-2023 and taken a more active direct role with AG since December 2023 during a period when Ms S was not available. Ms R considers that the risks arise from AG&#8217;s own impulsivity and learning disability and any coercion and control she feels from her parents, which increases her anxiety. These factors, either individually or together have, in the past, caused AG to engage in very serious self-harming behaviour (such as drinking bleach and jumping out of a first floor window). As a consequence, Ms R said AG needs a robust care plan to help her manage both her relationship with her parents and her own impulsivity and anxiety.</p>

It ended up with AG ringing her parents once she had arrived at the shared lives placement to inform them what had taken place. Ms R was present and is able to understand Urdu. According to Ms R, AG informed her parents that when she was ready to leave CG the social workers had moved her to another placement. To her parents, AG denied it was her wish to move to her own accommodation. The parents were upset and felt that AG was not being truthful. They said they did not want to speak to her anymore and put the phone down. Ms R described AG becoming very upset and crying uncontrollably. When AG spoke to her parents a little later she denied the decision to move to the shared lives accommodation was hers, stating it was the social workers decision which her father didn&#8217;t accept.</p>

Prior to that she had involvement in a supervisory capacity through case discussion with Ms S. Ms R said her team will now take over.  She considered their shared cultural heritage and Ms R&#8217;s ability to speak Urdu has assisted. She was present when AG telephoned her parents after she arrived at the shared lives placement. It struck her when AG telephoned her parents about her move, that her parents kept pressing AG that this was not her decision which caused AG distress. Ms R described how she talked through the options with AG about collecting her belongings from her parents&#8217; home and how AG was able to reach a decision with that support. She said that took about two and a half hours, and this demonstrated that with the right level of support AG is able to return to make her own decisions and reduce the risk of impulsive behaviour. Whilst recognising how upset AG&#8217;s parents must have been, Ms R did not consider AG&#8217;s parents displayed much understanding of AG&#8217;s position. Ms R has not met AG&#8217;s parents.</p>

Ms R made clear that AG has talked about the importance of her family and loves her family but she considers AG is a different person when she is away from her family, her character is more evident and she is better able to express her wishes. Ms R considers that whilst AG has made some improvement  she still needs support. Ms R agreed with Dr Rippon that AG is not able to outline the risks of not getting the right support but the situation should be kept under review, confirming the current care plan will be reviewed every three months.</p>

When it was suggested to her that it was so she could call for help she responded <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;Why she in danger?&#8217;.</span> Mrs G denied any suggestion she sought to control what AG said to the social worker and denied she had not given the correct information as to how AG came to be injured to the ambulance or hospital in December 2022.

At the hearing on 8 December 2023 she first raised the issue of a trip to Pakistan in the context of her passport being returned, which had not been raised before. At this hearing she raised the issue of a shared care arrangement involving her parents which she had not raised before, although it aligned with the position set out in the document submitted by her parents the day before.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.6in">In relation to the FMPO she follows the route map outlined by the President in <span style="font-style:italic">Re K</span> (ibid). Turning first to the underlying facts there is no issue that at the time of AG&#8217;s marriage to Mr Q in September 2019 she had capacity to make decisions about marriage. There is a dispute about whether AG met Mr Q prior to the marriage or was involved in any of the wedding preparations, as the parents state she was. Ms Scott relies upon the evidential picture that is built up from what AG told others and the local authority evidence about the parents coaching AG. Ms Scott submits that the only basis for a finding that the marriage in 2019 was a forced marriage would be for the court to find that AG&#8217;s ability to consent was vitiated based on the records of what she told the police, Dr Rippon and her solicitor. The doubts she expressed to those third parties were not shared with her parents, which is consistent with AG not being able to share her true wishes and feelings with them, the dynamics of their relationship and the parents clear approval of the marriage.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.6in">Ms Scott accepts that AG is now divorced but submits this needs to be looked at in the context of Mr and Mrs G&#8217;s strong disapproval of her relationship with her boyfriend and the steps they have taken to put AG under pressure to end the relationship. Mr G accepted that it would not be allowed in accordance with their culture or religious beliefs for AG to have a romantic relationship with a man outside of marriage. Mr G did not accept it would bring shame on the family, but this appeared to be on the basis that the wider community would not be aware of it.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.6in">Ms Scott invites the court to reject Mr G&#8217;s evidence that it is up to AG whether she gets married again as being a matter entirely for her bearing in mind the background of controlling and coercive behaviour by the parents and their inability to accept any decision that AG makes that does not coincide with their wishes. This has to be considered in the context of the evidence that demonstrates AG is unable to communicate any decision of hers that does not accord with her parents&#8217; wishes. The risk is heightened by the lack of a consistent account about the proposed trip to Pakistan. Ms Scott invites the court to draw the conclusion that there is no wedding in Pakistan and the trip was for the purpose of AG getting married.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.59in">The second stage is whether there is a need to protect AG from a forced marriage. Ms Scott submits it is relevant to this issue that the history demonstrates AG is unable to share with her parents what she wants and in those circumstances there is a high risk of AG being forced into a marriage due to the dynamics of the relationship between AG and her parents and their strong cultural and religious beliefs around marriage. In the circumstances of this case she submits very little pressure may suffice to bring about the desired result and reminds the court of what was said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re SA</span> when Munby J (as he then was) stated:  &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">where the influence is that of a parent or other close and dominating relative, and where the arguments and persuasion are based upon personal affection or duty, religious beliefs, powerful social or cultural conventions, or asserted social, familial or domestic obligations, the influence may&#8230;.. be subtle, insidious, pervasive and powerful. In such cases moreover, very little pressure may suffice to bring about the desired result.&#8217;</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.6in">If the court is satisfied there is a need to protect AG, the third stage requires the court to make an assessment of the risks and protective factors that relate to AG. Ms Scott accepts the local authority has not carried out a formal assessment of the risks to AG of a forced marriage. She submits it is for the court to carry out that assessment. The protective measures that are in place in this jurisdiction mitigate the risk, however she submits that is not the position if AG goes to Pakistan where the following factors significantly increase the risk, namely AG is divorced, Mr and Mrs G would disapprove of any other relationship AG may have outside of marriage, Mr and Mrs G are likely to get AG to behave in the way they deem appropriate in circumstances in Pakistan where AG would be unable to freely express her wishes.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.6in">The final stage is where the court must achieve an accommodation between the necessity of protection under Article 3 and the need to respect family and private life under Article 8. The court will need to consider the degree of risk in AG suffering a forced marriage, the quality of available protective measures and the nature and extent of the interference with family life. This, submits Ms Scott, will involve work with Mr and Mrs G and AG. Consequently, she seeks orders for 12 months that have the effect of preventing AG from travelling abroad other than with her shared lives carer, preventing Mr and Mrs G from applying for further travel documents and allowing the local authority to hold AG&#8217;s passport.</p>

Due to the vulnerability of people like AG she submits the court should err on the side of caution in deciding what constitutes a deprivation of liberty (<span style="font-style:italic">Cheshire West</span> [57]). The care arrangements mean that the carers are aware of where AG is and her movements are known and noted. If she tried to leave in circumstances where she is assessed as posing a risk to herself, steps would be taken to persuade her to return and if not successful the police would be called. Her care needs cannot be met in the family home due to the control exerted by her parents, her need to gain life skills to increase her independence, to be able to access the community and the management of her psychological and emotional needs arising from her impulsivity and heightened anxiety.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.6in">Ms Scott submits that if the court does not accept the analysis by the local authority, the care and treatment of AG will be <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;practically impossible&#8217;</span> as AG could decide to return to live in the family home and relies on her recent change of position, which echoes what the parents have said. If she did that there is a real risk she would come into conflict with her parents as has happened in the past, with the consequent anxiety which then gives rise to a very real risk that AG will again act impulsively and cause herself significant harm. The court should resist considering capacity in silos and that when looking at AG&#8217;s capacity when making a decision about where she is going to live, it must include information about whether her care needs can be met in that placement. Viewed from that perspective Ms Scott submits the conclusion that Dr Rippon should have come to was that AG lacked capacity to make decisions about options for her residence that are not able to meet her care needs.</p>

As Ms Sutton observes, that is what happened on 22 January 2024 when AG was supported to wait before collecting any belongings from the family home as well as the management of her feelings about the move. The care plan specifically addresses that purpose when it states how AG <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;will be supported by her shared lives carers in dealing with any conflict that arises.

Ms Sutton relies on a number of matters including the local authority&#8217;s own observation in their position statement in December 2023 that this placement fell <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;well short&#8217; </span>of continuous supervision to amount to a deprivation of liberty; AG is not under complete supervision in the placement; the restrictions (such as window restrictors) do not equate with complete control; AG is not subject to personal searches; there are no limits on who she has contact with in the sense that she requires the permission of her carers; and in due course the intention is that she will access the local community independently.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.6in">Ms Sutton submits the local authority analysis to support its submissions regarding deprivation of liberty conflates two separate matters, namely capacity and welfare. If AG expressed a wish to move from her current placement she would be assisted by the local authority to think about the options having regard to their statutory obligations under the Care Act 2014 and AG&#8217;s eligible needs. This would be the case for anyone in AG&#8217;s position and AG should not be treated any differently because she is involved in proceedings. The care plan makes it clear that there is a structure and framework to provide support and for steps to be taken at each stage to ensure AG&#8217;s wellbeing at the relevant time. In addition, if the local authority believe AG lacks capacity in relation to a matter at the relevant time the provisions of ss 5 and 6 MCA provide statutory protection for any proportionate steps the local authority may take (which fall short of a deprivation of liberty of liberty) if such steps are a proportionate response to the likeliness of AG suffering harm, having regard to the seriousness of that harm. Additionally, if there was a significant change of circumstance, the local authority can take any steps that come within s4B MCA, and are able to deprive AG of her liberty whilst a decision is sought from the court for the purpose of doing any vital act. A vital act is &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">any act which the person doing it reasonably believes to be necessary to prevent a serious deterioration in P&#8217;s condition&#8221; </span>(section 4B(5) MCA).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.6in">Ms Sutton submits the inherent jurisdiction could be invoked to provide a protective regime to protect AG&#8217;s autonomy in accordance with <span style="font-style:italic">DL v A Local Authority and others </span>[2012] EWCA Civ 253 [53]). Ms Sutton bases this on the court being satisfied that even if AG does not lack capacity within the meaning of the MCA to make decisions regarding contact with Mr and Mrs G she can, at times, be subject to coercion and undue influence by them and at such times is unable to give real or genuine consent regarding the contact arrangements she wishes to have with them. Due to the dynamics of the relationship between AG and her parents the influence may be subtle. Ms Sutton submits this is illustrated by AG&#8217;s change in position prior to this hearing when she had consistently said she would like contact on two occasions per week to then change to shared residence, which aligned with her parents&#8217; position. This coincides with an increase in telephone contact between AG and her parents. Ms Sutton recognises that any orders made under the inherent jurisdiction must be only those that are necessary and proportionate. The framework Ms Sutton submits that meets that balance is that until 31 December 2024 Mr and Mrs G must not make any contact with AG save for face to face contact twice per week for up to six hours, with AG then returning to SLP, and telephone contact with AG once a day for 15 minutes. There would be provision for this to be kept under review and varied by agreement or order of the court and a structure would be set out as  to how to manage any requests for changes and a date by which any application should be made to extend the order beyond December 2024.</p>

The attendance note from her discussion with her solicitor states AG trusts her parents not to force her to get married and she has said she doesn&#8217;t want to get married until she is 26 years old. As AG has been assessed to have capacity to make decision regarding marriage, whilst her wishes are not determinative, they are very important. Ms Sutton refers to the guidance in <span style="font-style:italic">Re K (ibid)</span> at [52] which stresses that if a court is to override the capacitous wishes of a person who chooses to marry, it must be satisfied that there is a real and immediate risk of that person suffering inhuman or degrading treatment which is sufficient to cross the Article 3 ECHR threshold. Whilst fact specific, in <span style="font-style:italic">Pretty v United Kingdom</span> (2002) 35 EHRR 1 at [52] the court held that  includes <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;actual bodily injury or intense physical or mental suffering&#8217;.</span></p>

No risk assessment was undertaken at that time, or later as the information evolved. Ms S had no experience of FMPO, she lacked any effective supervision of her work, and no contact was made with AG&#8217;s college or with any wider family or friends.

However, submits Ms Sutton, the court could find that the marriage was not entirely free from family influence as it was an arranged marriage brokered by Mr and Mrs G.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.6in">When looking at the future risk Ms Sutton submits the evidence demonstrates that AG has had a boyfriend, Mr O, and has put herself at significant risk in order to see him, and has also placed herself at significant risk when unable to regulate her emotions, for example ingesting bleach on two occasions and jumping from a window on two occasions. AG alleged to the police she was slapped by Mr G when she said her parents found out about this relationship. Although Ms S&#8217;s evidence was unimpressive regarding her analysis of the cultural, religious and societal norms for women of Pakistani heritage and Muslim faith, Ms Sutton submits that Mr G accepted it would not be allowed when asked about what would happen if AG had a relationship out of wedlock. Although he did qualify that with saying, they as parents, can only give an opinion, the message, submits Ms Sutton, was clear. Ms Sutton submits this means there is likely to be ongoing tension between what the parental beliefs are and what AG may want, pending any further work with AG and her family. Ms Sutton submits there was a gap in the evidence due to the lack of engagement by the local authority with the family and AG over recent events, such as the trip to Pakistan.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.6in">Ms Sutton submits the way forward is that if the court concludes there is a need to protect AG from any attempt to be forced into marriage in the future there should be a holding position to enable AG to settle in SLP and a proper assessment undertaken as to the actual future risk. In those circumstances, she submits, pending this further analysis the current order should be extended on an interim basis for 6 months. This strikes the balance between the necessity of protection and the need to respect private and family life. Ms Sutton submits there should be detailed directions for the local authority to undertake an effective risk assessment, to include the risks of AG travelling to Pakistan, her general capacity to travel with a framework as to how any preparation for travel should be undertaken and educative work with the family with a final hearing in 6 months&#8217; time. The directions should also include provision for a round table meeting. Whilst Ms Sutton recognises this does not accord with AG&#8217;s wishes it strikes the balance between the further evidence that needs to be filed and AG&#8217;s wish for these proceedings to come to an end.</p>

This is likely to be due to a combination of factors including their lack of insight and understanding regarding her particular needs, particularly when she does not follow their views as to the decisions she should make. They understandably wish to protect AG, viewing any situation from their perspective as to what she should do, but in doing so their actions have serious consequences for AG due to the dynamics in their relationship which risks disabling AG from making any informed choice or decision.</p>

They could give no credible reason why they had not given a full account to the ambulance and hospital about what had happened to AG and their actions in not giving that account had a direct impact on AG in causing a delay in her getting the appropriate medical treatment. It is difficult to understand the motivation for doing this, when it so obviously caused harm to AG.

I accept the evidence from the local authority of the repeated attempts by them to be able to communicate with AG on her own, only to be thwarted in that aim by the actions of the parents.  From the start of their involvement in 2021 the influence and control both Mr and Mrs G have over AG has been clear to the local authority and I accept their evidence about that. Whilst Mr and Mrs G may feel they are taking steps to protect AG what they are actually doing is preventing her from being able to express her wishes and feelings, increasing her anxiety which, in turn, puts her at increased risk of harming herself due to her impulsive behaviour in such situations and which can also impact on her capacity to make decisions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.6in">It is clear these disputes caused significant tensions in the family relationships, when that occurs AG becomes overwhelmed with anxiety and on occasion takes impulsive actions that put her at risk of serious harm. In their oral evidence the parents were unable to display any real understanding, insight or empathy of AG&#8217;s viewpoint. In seeking to suggest, as they did in relation to certain matters, that they were expressing an opinion did not convey the full picture when their underlying disapproval was clear, for example in relation to AG having a relationship out of wedlock, and the impact of that on AG bearing in mind her particular needs. It is clear, in my judgment, that their influence still impacts on AG. I consider it more likely than not that the change in AG&#8217;s position, advocating a shared care arrangement during this hearing, which mirrored the position of the parents put to the court the previous day,  will have been as a result of discussions between Mr and Mrs G and AG. The number and length of the phone calls had increased, AG knew the hearing was going on and will have felt divided loyalties between what she had been saying to her solicitor and what I infer the parents were discussing with her about the shared care arrangement.</p>

There is no evidence of any other person suggesting it was a forced marriage, and no evidence of physical or emotional abuse prior to the marriage.

This uncertainty is founded largely on the failure of the local authority to properly investigate and analyse the evidence, or keep it under review. However, I am satisfied that the marriage was not entirely free from family influence, in particular from Mr and Mrs G.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.6in">The issue of future risk is more complicated. Mr and Mrs G&#8217;s disapproving views about relationships out of marriage and their lack of real understanding about AG&#8217;s position is clear. As a result, there will be an ongoing tension about what the parents want to happen and think should happen and AG&#8217;s wishes. The lack of coherent detail about the apparent wedding in Pakistan in February 2024 is deeply concerning. Three different names were given for the &#8216;friend&#8217; who was getting married. A purported wedding invitation produced by the parents during this hearing gave a fourth name. The parents oral evidence provided no further clarity.</p>

This work should include an assessment of AG&#8217;s capacity to travel and a framework to underpin any travel, as suggested on behalf of the Official Solicitor.

Both those important documents provide a comprehensive package of support to ensure that AG is able to make decisions about her day to day life in an informed and capacitous way. There is a structure for regular reviews and they will be overseen by Ms R and her team, who are the specialists in supporting someone with AG&#8217;s particular needs.<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>The whole purpose of ensuring (by way of various court directions) that the care plan and risk management plan were robust, was to ensure that carers are equipped to support AG &#8220;in the moment&#8221;, help her manage her anxiety and distress and/or assist her to think through situations rather than behave impulsively. This is exactly what happened on 22 January 2024 when AG was supported to wait (and not immediately attend the family home) to collect belongings. The expert advice and the plans now before the court appear to be working.

This confirmed the position endorsed by the local authority in the order dated 8 December 2023 about the proposed placement at SLP. AG has periods of 1:1 care totalling 30 hours per week, other than those periods the carers are aware where she is but there is no continuous monitoring and this was agreed by Ms R in her oral evidence. In my judgment, the objective element of the test is not met even making all due allowance for the need to err on the side of caution.</p>

The local authority had not previously sought to grant a standard authorisation, confirming in the order dated 9 June 2023 that was because the mental capacity element was not met. Reliance by the local authority on <span style="font-style:italic">B v A Local Authority </span>[2019] EWCA Civ 913 is misplaced as the situation in that case was different where decisions regarding capacity made the local authority&#8217;s care practically impossible. That is not the situation here. The local authority have demonstrated they can care for AG, illustrated in supporting AG on the day of the recent move to the SLP. These cases are very fact specific and, as a consequence, provide limited assistance to courts in other cases.</p>

In short, what is proposed is a time limited order limiting contact between AG and her parents to one telephone call a day for up to 15 minutes and two periods of face to face contact each week for up to 6 hours on each occasion. This would be underpinned by a framework to manage any requests to change those arrangements with a view to proportionately managing and enabling AG to retain her capacity to make decisions about contact with her parents. Ms Sutton submits such orders are necessary and proportionate to maintain AG&#8217;s capacity for a limited period of time to assist her to settle into SLP, effectively utilise the support available under the care plan and help her maintain and retain her capacity. This, she submits, is in accordance with <span style="font-style:italic">DL (ibid)</span> and follows the approach taken by Cobb J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re RK.</span></p>

Frequent lengthy visits to the family home, coupled with lengthy phone calls interfere with the support for AG in helping her develop her independent living skills as detailed in her care plan. Ms Scott outlines the concern of the local authority in the structure proposed by Ms Sutton, which includes the fact that AG often instigates the  phone calls to her family and there needs to be provision for AG to change her mind with safeguards to ensure any decision is capacitous,</p>

The order will only be in place for a limited period until December 2024. I am satisfied, bearing in mind the history of this matter that without that structure being in place it is very likely AG will be unable to manage the consequences of any pressure on her to spend increasing time with her parents which, in turn, will impact on her ability to make capacitous decisions.</p>
