The methods of enforcement that she has resorted to have included an attachment of earnings order and registration of the order in the appropriate magistrates&#8217; court, namely, the Brent Local Justice Area Family Proceedings Court.  At one stage, shortly after the order was made, the husband declared himself bankrupt, but the wife obtained an annulment of that bankruptcy on the grounds that it was merely a sham designed to frustrate the maintenance order.  </span></p>

It is clear from paragraph 10 of that ruling that there has been a sorry history over the years of the husband from time to time being in employment and/or having other sources of income, such as the rent from some restaurant premises which he owned in conjunction with his mother.  Yet he has never paid anything at all towards the underlying order.  It also appeared from the district judge&#8217;s narrative of the history that currently (i.e. as of July) the husband appeared to be living at the home of his own mother and claimed to be without income, capital, or other assets.  </span></p>

It is, frankly, inconceivable that the payer under a given maintenance order should be at risk of being imprisoned by less restrictive criteria in a magistrates&#8217; court than in one of the higher courts.  </span></p>

The question then arises: what did Parliament intend by the words &#8220;the means to pay&#8221; where they appear in the Debtors Act 1869; and indeed what did the makers of rule 33.14 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 intend by the same words &#8220;the means to pay&#8221; where they appear in that rule?  </span></p>

Indeed a court should never attempt to define a loose phrase which Parliament has selected but not chosen further to define.   But, in my view, the ordinary and natural meaning of the word &#8220;means&#8221; is income or assets of some kind.  It is noteworthy that in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>, at <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25(2)</ref>(a), Parliament expressly referred to &#8220;the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have ... including in the case of earning capacity any increase in that capacity which it would in the opinion of the court be reasonable to expect a party to the marriage to take steps to acquire&#8221;.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in"><marker name="tab"/><span style="font-size:14pt">It is very clear from that provision that at the time of considering whether or not to make financial provision, and if so what financial provision to make, the court must have specific regard not only to current income, property and other financial resources but also to &#8220;earning capacity&#8221;, including any reasonable increase in that capacity.  Parliament has expressly spelled it out.  But there is nothing to that effect either in the proviso to section 5 of the Debtors Act 1869 or in the recent rule 33.14.  That, to my mind, is not surprising.  It is one thing when the court is deciding whether or not to make a maintenance order, or the level of that order, to take into account current or likely earning capacity, but it is a very different matter to imprison a person for not maximising his earning capacity.  It would, frankly, be intolerable if a person was liable to be imprisoned on an argument that although he was, say, earning &#163;20,000 a year he ought to be earning &#163;30,000 a year.  It is scarcely more tolerable to imprison somebody on an argument that although in fact he is not earning, and has no income, he could and should be earning.  It seems to me that those sorts of considerations are far too speculative a foundation for the ultimate and grave sanction of imprisonment.  </span></p>

She had expressly said that she cannot be sure that the husband has currently an income, or capital, or assets.   But she went on to say that there &#8220;is both wilful refusal and culpable neglect&#8221;, and her expressed reason for that was simply that &#8220;he has both an earning potential and could apply for benefits but he chooses not to&#8221;.  It seems to me that in the end the only matter of which this district judge was sure (which is the required standard of proof) was that the husband has &#8220;earning potential&#8221; which he was choosing not to exercise or maximise.  </span></p>

There is, of course, the alternative basis in para.14(j) that he &#8220;could apply for benefits but he chooses  not to&#8221;.  The district judge did not identify in any way at all exactly what &#8220;benefits&#8221; she considered he could apply for, nor what the level of them would be.  Generally speaking, benefits are designed only to provide relatively subsistence levels for the recipient of the benefit and not to provide a surplus out of which the recipient can pay maintenance.  Even if there is scope for some very small surplus, it is fanciful to suppose that there are any benefits to which this husband could conceivably be entitled that would enable him to make maintenance payments remotely approaching &#163;750 per month, still less to pay anything off the arrears.  </span></p>

To the respondent wife in this case, who acts in person, this judgment must have seemed, and to the lay reader, and perhaps even a lawyer, this judgment must now seem like gobbledegook, and the eyes glaze over.   The issue was the very serious one of whether a man was lawfully sent to prison.   It ought to be possible to resolve and be clear about it by a much more simple process, particularly as the jurisdiction is one which may frequently be exercised by lay magistrates in circumstances where (as in this case) one or both parties may increasingly act in person.   This area of the law is in dire need of modernisation, simplification and reform.</span></p>
