I therefore do not need to set out the detailed background to the matter. The case concerns alleged &#8220;parental alienation&#8221; and in the August decision I ordered that Z, the older child, should return to the care of her mother, the First Respondent. </p>

This was in part because the parents had listened to each other&#8217;s evidence, and to the evidence of Ms Rayworth the Social Worker, and Ms Geraghty the Guardian, as well as the interventions of the Court. However, given the unfortunate history of this case, the need for some level of clarity going forward, and the possibility that some lessons might be learnt by what has gone wrong in this case, I decided to give a full reserved judgment. </p>

They were both made subjects of Interim Care Orders (&#8220;ICO&#8221;) on 19 May 2022 on the grounds of risk of psychological harm to the children.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There were various issues with contact and the first court application was made by the Father on 10 June 2019, i.e. 3 and a half years ago. There were then numerous applications and hearings, which culminated in a fact finding hearing in February 2022 before HHJ Watson. The detail of those earlier events, is set out in my August judgment.  The Judge made no findings against the Father, but made findings of parental alienation against the Mother. The Judge ordered a 90 day &#8220;Reunification Plan&#8221;, by which the children were to move to live with Father, together with the Independent Social Worker (&#8220;ISW&#8221;) Ms Barry-Relph, who would stay in the Father&#8217;s property. It can only be said this Plan went extremely badly with the children smashing property in the Father&#8217;s home, absconding, being moved to foster care with police involvement, and Z remaining in foster care whilst X returned to her Father&#8217;s care. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is the clear view of the LA and Ms Geraghty that the Reunification Plan was misguided and the role of Ms Barry-Relph unhelpful. I note that neither the social worker, Ms Rayworth, nor Ms Geraghty were involved at the time when the Reunification Plan was put in place and enforced. It also must be acknowledged that hindsight is always a wonderful thing. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As is set out in that judgment I decided in August 2022 that Z should go back to live with her Mother. She has remained there since that date. However, her younger sister, X, continued to live with her Father. Although X consistently said she wished to return home to live with her Mother and Z, she did in practice appear to be happy and reasonably settled with the Father. She went on holiday with the Father, his partner and his partner&#8217;s son to Florida, and that was a successful trip which X enjoyed. I note that the Reunification Plan was supposed to last three months, but X remained with her Father for 9 months despite her clearly expressed view that she wanted to return to her Mother. It was the LA&#8217;s care plan until 6 January that X would remain with her Father. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, on 6 January X absconded from school and went to her Mother&#8217;s house, which is fairly close to her school. It seems likely, although I cannot be certain, that this action was not planned, and X spotted the opportunity after school when there was no one at the school gate. Ms Tyler points to some evidence that X at least had planned the move, but is neither necessary or appropriate for me to investigate this further. When X got to the Mother&#8217;s house, she was rapidly followed within a very few minutes by two teachers. As soon as she appeared, the Mother&#8217;s friend rang the police on 111. The police attended shortly thereafter. After a discussion between the police, X, and the LA, it was decided that rather than return X to her Father, she should stay over the weekend with B&#8217;s parents, Mr and Mrs H.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_12">
	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Father, through his Counsel, strongly criticised the Mother for not immediately seeking to persuade X to return to the Father and not pointing out to the police that the allegations X and Z were making about their Father were historic allegations which had already been dismissed by HHJ Watson. I think this criticism is somewhat unfair. The Mother explained, and this does not seem to be in dispute, that the police went into a separate room with X and spoke to her without the Mother being present. I also think Ms Tyler does not fully take into account the heightened emotions and difficult situation that occurred when X arrived at the Mother&#8217;s home. Z was present, as were B&#8217;s two daughters and another child. It was hardly the moment for a calm conversation with X about the rights and wrongs of the situation. I accept the Mother&#8217;s account that she believed the correct thing to do was to leave the police and the LA to decide what should happen next. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">X spent the weekend at Mr and Mrs H&#8217;s house. She went to school on Monday 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January. On that day in the afternoon Z attended at the school and tried to speak to X. She was highly dysregulated and upset. Ms Rayworth, the Social Worker, and the Father were at the school. Ms Rayworth tried to persuade X to go home, but she refused. Ms Rayworth spoke to X for about 1.5 hours and she was adamant that she did not want to go back to the Father&#8217;s house. X then spoke to her Father for about 30 minutes. Ms Tyler was critical of Ms Rayworth for not allowing the Father to speak to X for longer and that they should have &#8220;stayed there until it was done&#8221;. Again, I think this criticism was misplaced. This is an 11 year old child who was plainly very upset. There came a point when the Social Worker was quite right to say that the adults had said enough and a decision had to be made there and then as to where X was going to stay.</p>

I rejected that application in a short separate judgment. In essence, I considered that the benefits of delaying the hearing for a CPA were outweighed by the disbenefit to the children, and indeed the parents, of further delay of between 4-6 months. This family has been subject to court proceedings for 3.5 years, and public law proceedings for almost a year. The strain on all concerned, and the effect of uncertainty on the children has been devastating. I am not convinced that a CPA would tell me very much that is likely to change the outcomes of the case. I understand the LA do intend to do a CPA after the hearing. </p>

This is a highly fact specific scenario in which labels and generalisations are not in my view helpful. In a very large number of cases that appear before the Family Courts, particularly concerning private law, the parents have some degree of animosity towards each other and whether consciously or unconsciously may influence the views of the children about the other parent. It must however be remembered that children are autonomous human beings who have their own feelings and their own perceptions.

I think the Mother was trying to be honest with the Court and genuinely intends to engage with the PAP and with encouraging the girls to have contact with the Father going forward. I am not wholly optimistic as to how that will go. I accept Dr Parker&#8217;s analysis set out above, that the Mother&#8217;s anxieties can easily deflect her from persuading or pressurising the girls to do something they do not want. I can see that the Mother&#8217;s will to do the right thing could quite easily be overborne by Z&#8217;s very strong personality and sense of grievance, as well as the Mother&#8217;s worries about Z&#8217;s risk of self harm and suicidal ideation.  </p>

His focus was remorselessly on creating or preserving their relationship with him. He put that relationship above their relationship with each other, or with their mother, and justified this by suggesting that the situation was the Mother&#8217;s fault for not engaging properly at earlier stages. The Father sought to justify his decision making on the basis that it had been supported by professionals, such as Ms Barry-Relph. Although I understand the Father&#8217;s viewpoint, it is essential that he takes responsibility for his own decision making and the impact it has on his children. </p>

This case is an example of how the adversarial process of litigation, particularly when combined with lengthy delays, serves to entrench positions and produce poor outcomes for the children. </p>

I fully support her continuing the sessions with Dr Choudhry and the PAP programme. It is essential that she learns strategies going forward for more actively, and perhaps at times more forcefully, parenting the children. It is not sufficient for the children to talk to her and feel supported, there are times as a parent when it is necessary to lead and to tell children to do things they don&#8217;t want to do.</p>

There were many stages of the evidence when I felt that the Mother was being judged by unfair and unrealistic standards.

The Mother was denied any contact with her children between March and July 2022. When she was told in June that X was at the school fence very much wanting to see her mother she went and gave X a hug. She was criticised in cross examination for acting inappropriately by breaking &#8220;the rules&#8221;. I consider that the Mother acted as any loving parent in her situation would have done. Somewhere in the history of this case we have lost our humanity. Ms Tyler submits that this paragraph may be taken to justify parents breaching safe contact arrangements. That the Mother breached an order may be clear, but the failure to understand why she did so, and judge it with some humanity is what has been lacking in this case. </p>

I can accept his belief of the great importance of them having a relationship with their Father. I find it much more difficult to accept the degree to which he has prioritised that relationship over their sibling relationship and over their strongly expressed wishes.</p>

It is not possible to be confident about what would have happened without the orders made in March 2022. I accept X did appear to be reasonably content, and at times had a good time, with her Father through that period. However, she was consistently saying she wanted to live with her mother and sister. X must have felt that her voice was being ignored, and her compliant behaviour not rewarded. This is an example of a case where by March 2022 there were no good options. However, the option that was chosen has not had a good outcome, albeit this is with the great benefit of hindsight. </p>

The paramount issue for me is the child&#8217;s best interests. In determining that issue I must have regard to the welfare checklist. The family justice system makes frequent reference to the wishes and feelings of the children, and the need to listen to the voice of the child. However, in this case the voice of the children has in my view been lost. Both children have been completely clear and consistent that they want to live with their Mother and that they want full contact with each other, and also with S &amp; T. </p>

I have no doubt that X loves her Father. X was prepared to stay with him. However, her actions entirely accord with what Ms Rayworth said. She believed she was placed with her Father for 3 months, then this was extended and by January with the hearing approaching she saw an opportunity to go back to her Mother and she took it. </p>
