To do that, the Husband sold his previous home &#8211; a maisonette in the same road, for &#163;880,000. The initial mortgage on the new property was some &#163;1.35m. He says in his s.25 statement that he was earning $400,000 or more at the time of the wedding. The foreign statement suggests gross earnings of $573,428 in 1994, $788,600 in 1995, and $727,387 in 1996. Before those final 3 years, they had not topped $135,000pa.

The Husband points to this fund as a further contribution of his from pre-matrimonial wealth, and the extent to which that is fair will be considered below. His case is that he invested at least $7,000,000 into X company in the start-up phase, and indeed the wife agrees that at the outset, money went in to the entity rather than came out. In addition to the property in London, the husband also points to four apartments abroad and an interest in a property investment portfolio, but with the passage of time, has little extant documentation about these assets. He says that his total wealth at the time of the parties&#8217; marriage was some $8,000,000 to $10,000,000.</span></p>

At the same time, they significantly extended their borrowing across the 2 properties, up to a total of &#163;5.6m., creating liquidity to spend on works to the two properties of about &#163;2.5m. Since then more has been borrowed, and the combined loan across the 2 properties is now some &#163;8.1m. Their rural address itself is now valued at &#163;4,600,000.</span></p>

The scheme of the Trust was that the Wife was named as the settlor and she and J were named as the beneficiaries. It was a fully discretionary Jersey trust with a professional trustee. The Husband was named as the &#8220;Power Holder&#8221; and his sister as the Protector. The Trust held a number of the X company ownership shares and subsequently acquired other assets, including a flat in R town. Following advice received during the course of these proceedings, prior to the end of the last tax year, the assets of the Trust were appointed out of the Trust to the Wife because of new legislation by which she was to become deemed domiciled for UK tax purposes after that date. </span></p>

Both of their Forms E set out income needs at only a little less that &#163;500,000pa. They bought the flat in R town which the Wife would dearly love to retain and the parties spent significant sums on its renovation. It is now worth &#8364;3.273m (&#163;2,834,652 net of sale costs). The husband, after retiring from X company, started giving away large sums of money to charities and other philanthropic entities - his foreign tax returns show he gave away $778,209 in 2014, $531,532 in 2015 and over $600,000 in 2016. The Wife had been well aware of his philanthropic projects, and indeed involved in them, but says that she was not aware of the scale of these last contributions.</span></p>

L-Fund is as indicated now completely paid out and M-Fund close to closing, albeit an actual date for repayment to the Husband of his capital account that reflects its value to him (around &#8364;6,000,000) has yet to be determined and is not within his control. The problems that the parties have, and the significant mistrust between them that has evidently been engendered, is all down to the very significant tax liabilities which they both now will have to bear, and which have only really become apparent during the course of this year.</span></p>

Eventually, in his Form E filed at the end on November 2016, he estimated an outstanding liability to tax of some &#163;540,000. This was said to be dating back to the tax year 2010/11, and subject to further work and negotiations. Although such negotiations have yet to begin in earnest, the accountant&#8217;s estimate for the amount of outstanding tax has spiralled progressively so that it now stands at a total of &#163;8,787,833, of which some &#163;1,606,872 may be reclaimed against a potential foreign tax credit, leaving some &#163;7,180,961 to pay. </span></p>

The single joint experts, Westleton Drake, in their most recent report have put the best-case scenario for the Husband&#8217;s historic liabilities at &#163;4,131,121 before the application of any tax credit, and the worst case on the same scenario as &#163;6,744,442. Their &#8216;reasonable estimate&#8217; for this liability alone is put at &#163;5.5m - &#163;6m, and this upper figure combined with various property taxes and the Wife&#8217;s liabilities as settlor of the K Trust comes to the total which has now been agreed.</span></p>

Although a share of the liability (taken at &#163;1,026,604 but potentially less or more) is nominally hers, it is clear that the primary responsibility for the lack of reporting and payment over the years has been the Husband&#8217;s. Whilst he was clearly aware (from a disclosed note sent to him in November 2007) that as a resident nondomiciliary he was subject (as was the Wife) to income and capital gains tax on any income earned or remitted, he nevertheless remitted in the 9 years since (ie beginning with the year from 6</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> April 2008) capital totalling some &#163;8,844,536. This amount averages very nearly &#163;1,000,000pa, and prima facie should have incurred a charge to tax of some &#163;3,189,581. The Husband says that as he was always paying foreign taxes in this period, he never thought that he should also be paying taxes here as well.</span></p>

The two small remaining issues around this number are as to the impact of the Husband&#8217;s foreign pension, which pays him &#163;27,049pa, and to which the wife seeks to ascribe a capital value (&#163;250,000), and a small investment of the husband&#8217;s in &#8216;F&#8217;, whose value is agreed at &#163;166,750, but not whether it should be treated as being liquid. </span></p>

The problems created have not however led to either party seeking an outcome that is wildly different in apparent substance. In fact they both now argue for a division of the assets on the schedule that appears at first analysis to be more or less equal.

Apart from that he argues for equality of division of the remaining liquid assets after the entirety of the estimated sum due to tax (&#163;7.18m) is set aside from the currently liquid assets. This will leave each party with a little under &#163;4m in immediately available liquid assets, and just under &#163;3m to come from the remaining interests in X company as currently constituted &#8211; that is up to the paying out of the capital account that represents the effective proceeds of M-Fund. Because of the cap that he proposes, the Wife will receive little more than that, and is unlikely to share in any substantial receipt by the Husband under the subsequent (albeit currently remote) X company Funds.

Further, she argues that she should now be entitled to receive the lion&#8217;s share of the available liquidity, on the basis, she says, of her greater need, the Husband&#8217;s greater financial acumen in dealing with X company into the future, and because the great reduction in liquidity has been caused by what Mr Leech QC describes as the Husband&#8217;s &#8216;mismanagement&#8217; of the family&#8217;s tax affairs, and his further heavy discretionary spending on charity and lifestyle items. In return for that greater liquidity now, she concedes a smaller share of the future X company receipts, but on an uncapped basis.

As the Husband is fully retired, there is no further endeavour required on his part to receive any of such money as may eventually come his way.

This is self-evidently because the standard of living which the parties were able to enjoy during the marriage will no longer be available to them. Both estimated their future needs in Form E at just under &#163;500,000pa. Whilst the Wife has not revisited that number, Mr Leech QC acknowledges that it not attainable going forward. For the husband, Mr Southgate QC suggests the figure of &#163;158,000 for each party, and this may be somewhat conservative having regard to what their available resources will be in the future. With so many imponderables still to be weighed, quite what each party should be in a position to spend going forward is quite impossible to quantify with any precision. But what can be said is that this is a case where the standard of living during the marriage will never be re-attained. And, it is worth commenting that that is as it should be, because that standard was probably only available in circumstances where for years the parties were not paying the tax that was properly due on the funds remitted to this country over the period.</span></p>

The Husband seeks to retain the rural address, which, on the basis of a splitting of the borrowing which it shares with their London address as has been proposed to leave it charged with the sum of &#163;2,500,000, would provide a value for the equity in the property of &#163;1,962,000. The borrowing would of course have to be serviced, and it is noticeable that no part of this is included in the husband&#8217;s reduced budget. Even if the whole &#163;3m housing fund which he proposes were allocated to reducing the borrowing, he would still owe the bank about &#163;1.6m. Whilst he has said that he may relocate to Switzerland, and indeed is criticised by the Wife for currently renting there, it is clear that the rural address is dear to his heart and he will retain it if he can.</span></p>

Although the parties have never yet lived there, this is in part because of the works that they initially commissioned in relation to the property, and in part because the ownership structure within the Trust would have required the wife to pay a stiff rent for the privilege. However, she says going forward that she would like to retain that property, R town being her home city, albeit that she would seek to retain a home in London at least for the next 10 years, she says for J&#8217;s sake. The Husband rather scoffs at that and says that J will no doubt visit both her parents, but is most unlikely to live permanently with either of them again. In her oral evidence the wife fairly conceded that, if she wishes to have a home in London, as well as in R town, she may have to choose two less expensive properties. Ultimately, given that both parties&#8217; most likely net worth at the end of these proceedings, on either case, will be around the &#163;7m mark, a housing fund of &#163;3m all in for each of them seems both proportionate and sensible.</span></p>

This means that as amplified by their different genders, any capitalisation calculation for them on the same annual lifetime figure will produce a much higher capital sum for the wife, who is in her 50s, than for the husband who is now in his 70s. By way of example, Mr Leech QC demonstrates that to produce the Husband&#8217;s suggested income figure (&#163;158,000pa) for life for each of them, would cost &#163;3.3m for the wife, but only &#163;1.95m for the Husband. And if that is increased to &#163;251,000pa (H&#8217;s Form E budget less donations, work expenses and the remittance charge), the gap only increases - &#163;5.475m for the Wife; &#163;3.155m for the Husband. It is thus clear that, if the parties&#8217; respective needs are to be quantified and determined, the Wife&#8217;s figure would inevitably be larger than the Husband&#8217;s. Mr Southgate QC does not demur from this, but says that the court can and should place a cap on the wife&#8217;s receipt by reference to an overall needs assessment at &#163;7m (although he put her actual figure at around &#163;6.3m based on &#163;158,000pa, and &#163;3m for a house), and that any additional receipt by the Husband which would inevitably be well in excess of his needs at the same level, would be justified by reference to his premarital contributions, referred to above.</span></p>

One of these is the extent to which any assessment of needs in circumstances such as these should be informed by the artificially inflated standard of living during the marriage. Another is whether it can be appropriate for any assessed &#8216;needs&#8217; figure to be a cap, rather than a safety net. There is a real danger that such an analysis will lead to a blurring of the 2 principles of need and sharing &#8211; for if the Wife&#8217;s entitlement to share is limited by her need, is not the court returning to the old discriminatory days before the House of Lords decided </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:11.5pt">White v White</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:11.5pt">? Mr Southgate&#8217;s rejoinder to that would be to ask how else the court can mark his client&#8217;s premarital contribution &#8211; but if that is to be done in any meaningful way, that must surely happen in a computation that is substantially independent of any needs based assessment.

And those needs must be considered as a protective floor for the wife, and not a confining ceiling to her claim. Having said all of that, I would accept that in the highly unusual and fact-specific circumstances of this case the parties&#8217; previous rate of spend is not a helpful guide. If the tax liabilities prove to be greater than now anticipated, as well they may, then I do not consider that the wife should be left with less than &#163;3m for a housing fund, or an income fund which produces less than &#163;158,000pa for her &#8211; so the wife&#8217;s receipt should not be less than &#163;6.3m if it is to fairly meet her needs reasonably assessed in the current circumstances. To that extent I accept Mr Southgate&#8217;s figures. If her sharing claim should leave her with more than this, and this includes an amount of more than &#163;7m, then the Wife should not be excluded from her entitlement, however.</span></p>

Moreover, it is a construct which is not always capable of clear identification. An asset can, of course, be entirely the former, as in many cases, or entirely the latter, as in&#160;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;color:#000000">K v L</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;color:#000000">. However, it is also worth repeating that an asset can be comprise both, in the sense that it can be partly the product, or reflective, of marital endeavour and partly the product, or reflective, of a source external to the marriage. I have added the word "reflective" because "reflect" was used by Lord Nicholls in&#160;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;color:#000000">Miller</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;color:#000000">&#160;(paragraph 73) and "reflective" was used by Wilson LJ in&#160;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;color:#000000">Jones</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt;color:#000000">&#160;(paragraph 33). When property is a combination, it can be artificial even to seek to identify a sharp division because the weight to be given to each type of contribution will not be susceptible of clear reflection in the asset's value.

I am satisfied from the evidence before me that there was such a contribution, but I am quite unable to determine its exact financial extent.

However, it is clear that some significant portion of that account is likely to have been built up in the last 2 years before his departure, during which 2 years the parties were married, following 6 months&#8217; engagement. It is also evident from the foreign statement that there was a sharp increase in the Husband&#8217;s salary in his last 3 full years with the firm, which is at least suggestive, if nothing more, that those years &#8211; 1994/5/6 - would have seen the most significant accretions to the account.

Nevertheless, I agree with him that it would be wrong in this case to penalise the Husband whether in terms of his liquidity post outcome, or in terms of hard cash, because of his perceived tardiness in setting right his tax affairs. It must have been the case that the husband was at the very least peripherally aware that he should be reporting to HMRC the very significant remittances of capital into this jurisdiction. To the extent that he &#8216;buried his head in the sand&#8217; about this, he has caused significant and quite unnecessary penalties to be likely incurred by both parties. I do not find that the Wife&#8217;s own bill is in any way down to any omission on her part &#8211; all of the parties&#8217; financial arrangements were made through the Husband, and it is he who should have acted long before these proceedings prompted him into action. However, these parties still have available to them resources which will possibly finally tally somewhere close to &#163;14,000,000, which is down, alongside the Wife&#8217;s own non-financial contribution, to the Husband&#8217;s long and successful career.

Firstly, I must determine what that liquidity should be, by reference to the size of the appropriate amount to be set aside from presently available liquid funds to meet the eventual tax bill, over which the parties are currently at odds. Mr Southgate proposes to set aside now the full amount anticipated by the experts - &#163;7.18m. I do not consider that this is quite necessary, primarily for the reason that this is almost certainly not going to be the exact amount that will ultimately be required. Whether it proves to be less or more, there is likely to be a lengthy period of negotiation whilst the eventual liability is fixed, and there is no good reason for keeping each party in a difficult cash position while that goes on. However, there does need to be a fund that is a little greater than the &#163;4.7m postulated by the wife, especially if the projected foreign tax credit takes some time to materialise. Removing the F investment (discussed below) from that section of the joint asset schedule leaves the combined liquidity currently available to the parties at &#163;14,976,500. I consider that the prudent amount for the parties to set aside from that is more or less &#163;6m. This leaves just under &#163;9m in available liquidity.</span></p>

Each party undoubtedly needs appropriate accommodation, and in the end neither took great issue with the notion that such could be found for the sum of &#163;3m, and although both currently aspire to hang on for the time being to one of their current homes for as long as practicable, that very understandable wish cannot translate itself into a need, so as to justify a greater share of liquid cash in the short term. If either party wishes to lock up more in bricks and mortar now than they will ultimately be able to afford, then they will have to budget accordingly, but the other party should not be put to financial sacrifice to enable that to happen.</span></p>

More than half of that is an income fund that is sufficient to release to her &#163;158,000pa for the rest of her life. She does not need the whole of that fund in cash now, only to know that she can with confidence expect that funds in excess of that amount will be made available to her, on any sensible analysis in good time to ensure that she is always able to meet her needs as they arise. But other than that, she does not have a need for immediate liquidity that is significantly greater than the husband&#8217;s. Indeed, much of her projected income fund will be foreseeably utilised by her long after his actuarially expected death. In fact, on the basis of the outcome which I will order, both parties will (as far as can now be anticipated) receive an award in excess of their respective &#8216;needs&#8217;. In those circumstances, equivalent liquidity for the immediate future is both proper and fair.</span></p>

Whilst this may be true, it remains the case that both sides envisage that the Wife will have a long-term interest in the value of the X company investment (and on the Wife&#8217;s case not subject to any cap), and in those circumstances I cannot see that the Husband&#8217;s greater understanding of the investment is a good reason to advance more liquidity to the Wife now. She will still have a financial interest in X company going forward in any event.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">I shall just finally resolve the two small outstanding issues that remain on the asset schedule between the parties. Firstly, in relation to the F investment (&#163;166,750), it is clear from the Husband&#8217;s evidence that this is not a liquid investment, as the Wife would say, and indeed that it may never be recouped. He is content that it should remain on the schedule as illiquid, on the basis that should there be any recovery, it will be shared between them. I will treat the asset as illiquid, and discuss its disposal below. Secondly, the Husband has a small foreign pension from which he derives some &#163;27,409pcm. Normally, this would be set off against his needs, rather than be treated as an item of capital value. However, in this case, where because of his shorter actuarial lifespan he is anyway able to live confidently at a greater rate than the wife from the same capital base, I consider that fairness dictates that I should treat it as Mr Leech QC suggests at its capital value when I consider the overall distribution of the assets at the conclusion of the discretionary exercise. Having said that, it is not a &#8216;matrimonial&#8217; item, and therefore not one in which the Wife could aspire to share.</span></p>

If, once &#163;6,000,000 is set aside as a prospective tax fund, there remains &#163;8,976,500 of available liquidity, and no reason why this should not be divided equally, this suggests that each party will start with &#163;4,488,250. Of the funds still to come from X company, a further &#163;1,180,961 will need to be set aside for tax if the current estimate is accurate. This would leave &#163;4,695,320 in funds still anticipated to be capable of recoupment under M-Fund, if all of the other estimates are accurate, which of course they will not be.</span></p>

I have to remember that, given the uncertainty about the amount of available funds because of the tax position, and of course because property valuation too is an uncertain exercise, especially with the London market in its current state, the exact amounts on which I am working are estimates. So too, the actual sums to be received from X company, and the timing of those receipts cannot be known with any certainty. However, even if those sums were certain figures I would not be persuaded that the Husband&#8217;s premarital contributions justified an unequal division of that fund. These are matrimonial funds, and the undoubted product of marital endeavour, held principally in the Wife&#8217;s name. An equal division will ensure that whatever the outcome of the various issues currently in play, each will receive a fair and indeed equal amount in respect of both liquid funds and the anticipated receipts from X company M-Fund, as well as certainty in relation to their respective needs. </span></p>

I have also considered whether there is a basis for an unequal distribution in the Husband&#8217;s favour of the more illiquid interests that he retains in the X company investments (N-Fund and Fund &#8216;P&#8217;), and, as the Wife herself proposes this to offset the greater liquid settlement that she seeks, and bearing in mind that her needs should be fully met from her earlier receipts by this judgment (&#163;6.72m on current best estimates), I find that this is appropriate, and that these funds should be split 75/25 in the Husband&#8217;s favour upon receipt. These amounts are a long way off, and their eventual value extremely uncertain, but could in due course be significant. </span></p>

The adjustment in his favour is thus not significantly in hard currency (he receives around 52% of the whole pot on current figures); it cannot be, because of the uncertainties inherent in the tax investigation that is about to commence, if both parties are to have their needs met at an acceptable level with any certainty. But I also do not find that his initial contribution looked at now was such that this outcome is an unfair one to him.</span></p>

They are nevertheless &#8216;matrimonial&#8217; and as such it is right that the Wife should share in them when available, albeit in a lesser proportion. </span></p>
