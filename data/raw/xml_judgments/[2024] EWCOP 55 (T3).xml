	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">CD is a 66 year old married father of four and grandfather of two, who is currently cared for as an in-patient at a hospital (&#8220;the hospital&#8221;) operated by the Applicant NHS Trust (&#8220;the Trust&#8221;). CD lacks capacity to conduct this litigation and proceeds by his litigation friend, the Official Solicitor. EF is his son, GH his daughter. They have been joined as parties on their application. EF and GH purport to express the views of the whole family about CD&#8217;s treatment and best interests.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">CD is of Bangladeshi origin. He has end-stage renal disease, ischaemic heart disease, type 2 diabetes, vascular dementia, and has suffered recurrent strokes. He receives haemodialysis at the hospital, now twice weekly. Each session, if completed,  takes up to about four hours. His brief medical history is that he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2010. From 2016 he developed progressive diabetic kidney disease. He had a heart attack in 2018 and a stroke in 2019. In September 2022 he electively started haemodialysis but three months later he had a second stroke resulting in a significant deterioration in his cognitive function. After an initial period of unconsciousness, he spent a long time in hospital recovering before being discharged to a nursing home. The family told me that he temporarily lost his vision after the second stroke but this improved. His kidney management was transferred to the hospital because of difficulties performing haemodialysis. In his confused state CD became resistant to it. The family agreed that a family member would attend the hospital whenever CD underwent dialysis to try to reassure him and reduce his agitation. The clinicians at the Trust have paid tribute to the family&#8217;s dedication in supporting CD through dialysis and more generally when they visit him, as they frequently do as a family, bringing home-cooked Bengali food with them. EF and GH told me that prior to his strokes, CD worked as a taxi driver and before that in catering. He has always enjoyed good food and the company of his family and continues to do so. He has a particular soft spot for his youngest daughter, now 16. He lights up when she and his other family members including his grandchildren enter his room. He enjoys stroking her hair. He also enjoys singing to himself.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For dialysis to be performed the patient requires a catheter to be inserted. A temporary catheter may be used for a short number of days but for long term dialysis a tunnelled catheter is required, which is fixed in situ. On 6 June 2024 a crack was identified in the plastic exit lumen of CD&#8217;s long term dialysis line. An attempt was made on the ward to replace a tunnelled dialysis catheter under local anaesthetic but CD was too agitated for this to be performed and so replacement was achieved when he was put under general anaesthetic on 7 June 2024. He was discharged to the care home on 15 June 2024 but the following day suffered a new brain haemorrhage and infarct. He was then an in-patient for about a month. It seems that following his strokes, CD has now lost his ability to speak English but can converse in Bangladeshi using the dialect he was brought up with and which his family members can also speak. </p>

He has attempted to pull out his catheter on a total of four occasions since his third stroke in mid-June 2024, and this despite having 1-1 nursing and other protective measures (such as placing hospital mittens on his hands). On two occasions a catheter could be reinserted under local anaesthetic. On a third occasion clinicians decided that it would be unsafe to attempt further insertions under local anaesthetic. so it was performed under general anaesthetic.</p>

In the event that the Court declined to make the decision sought by the Trust, counsel jointly invited the Court to provide clarity for all concerned by making a declaration that the insertion of a tunnelled catheter for the purpose of dialysis was in CD&#8217;s best interests, rather than to leave that question open.</p>

The use of a temporary catheter creates a significant and cumulative risk of infection and sepsis which could be immediately life-threatening to CD. That specific risk could be avoided by either inserting a tunnelled catheter (which brings its own risks) as the family think is in CD&#8217;s best interests, or by removing the catheter and not replacing it, as the Trust think is in CD&#8217;s best interests.

With haemodialysis his life expectancy is probably between 3-6 months possibly a year but Dr A said it was more likely that CD would survive only to the lower end of the range of 3-6 months.

The procedure carries risk to him of infection and bleeding together with risks associated with heavy sedation or general anaesthesia. Dr B advised the Court that there was a 10% chance that CD would die under general anaesthetic because of his co-morbidities, and a further 10% chance that he would suffer a significant complication such as a further stroke. But the Trust accepts that heavy sedation or general anaesthesia would not be so unsafe that they should not be administered if the insertion procedure and further dialysis was considered to be in CD&#8217;s best interests. The procedure takes a relatively short time &#8211; it is not major surgery. The patient typically has some moderate pain around the site for a few days. CD might well suffer from confusion, even delirium on coming round from anaesthetic or heavy sedation. Restraint might be required to administer the sedation or anaesthetic effectively and safely. </p>

Ordinarily a catheter should remain in situ and functional for at least a year. The Trust believes that the stage has come at which it cannot be said to be in CD&#8217;s best interests to keep inserting haemodialysis catheters only for them to be plucked out. When CD removes a catheter he puts himself at risk of significant blood loss, infection, and the need to expose him to further risks from another procedure to re-insert. If he were to pull out the catheter when undergoing dialysis it could be catastrophic, causing an immediate threat to his life from haemorrhage. </p>

However, he also becomes agitated due to other interventions. He has become agitated and aggressive, even biting staff, when staff have tried to check his blood sugar or on the medication round. He spits out oral medication not, I expect, because it causes him pain or discomfort to take it, but because of some confusion in his mind. This is due to his dementia and poor cognition.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Court must also look at the utility of re-insertion. Insertion is necessary for haemodialysis which, in turn, is essential to help to preserve CD&#8217;s life. I acknowledge that preservation of CD&#8217;s life on successful dialysis will probably be for no longer than a few months. Nevertheless, that is a material difference compared with a period of about two weeks without dialysis. I must look at the benefits and burdens to him of his life if it is to be preserved by continuing dialysis. He would have the burdens of undergoing continued haemodialysis, now twice a week for up to four hours. It is right to record that he has found it difficult to complete dialysis, struggling to continue for the full four hours. However, he has successfully done so on the last two occasions.  The process does not appear to be painful for him but it is very tiring and can cause some exacerbation of his confusion. His dementia and poor cognition appear quite often to cause him agitation after three hours or so of dialysis. On previous occasions, for example on 10 September 2024, he could not tolerate dialysis for the full procedure and it ended 30 minutes early after agitation. After that a decision was taken to reduce dialysis to twice a week from three times. The family have agreed to that reduction. Members of his family are always present at dialysis to support and calm CD. They will continue to fulfil that role.</p>

It is not possible to discern his actual present wishes and feelings about undergoing further treatment including insertion of a catheter because he cannot think through all the benefits, risks and disadvantages, or communicate his views, but his family are all of the same view, namely that he has a quality of life such that re-insertion of a catheter and continued dialysis are merited. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">An important factor in this case is that CD has repeatedly pulled out his catheter. Measures have been taken to try to prevent that from happening including the provision of hospital mittens and 1 to 1 care. I am sure that all steps would be taken including strapping and mittens to keep any catheter now inserted out of CD&#8217;s reach or grasp. Nevertheless there is a very real risk that insertion could be rendered ineffective by CD pulling out the catheter. I must take that risk into account and it is a highly relevant consideration. Furthermore, the steps taken to mitigate that risk such as hospital mittens and 1 to 1 care are restrictions on CD which to a greater or lesser extent constitute burdens upon him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I remind myself to consider all the principles and matters set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s1</ref> and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s4</ref> and the relevant case law. The presumption that steps should be taken to preserve life, the family&#8217;s views, evidence as to CD&#8217;s beliefs and values and his past wishes and feelings, and the evidence of the pleasures that he still derives from interactions with his family and others and from good food, weigh in favour of his undergoing the procedure and continuing with dialysis. I am cautious about finding that it is in his best interests to undergo a procedure the purpose of which he might unknowingly frustrate by pulling out a catheter, but without the insertion of a catheter his life cannot be preserved, and his life, if preserved, will continue to bring him real benefits alongside its burdens. There is no advanced decision to consider but the evidence is that CD is a man who, if he still had capacity, would not want his life to end prematurely unless its burdens became wholly overwhelming.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have to try to examine the question of treatment and best interests from CD&#8217;s point of view. Having considered all the evidence and circumstances, I have concluded that the burdens and risks involved in inserting a tunnelled catheter and continuing with haemodialysis, and the risk of CD pulling out a catheter after insertion, whilst significant, do not outweigh the benefits to CD of preserving his life - or at least providing a chance of his live being preserved - a life that brings him times of considerable pleasure. The presumption that it is in his best interests to preserve his life is not displaced by the evidence as to the burdens and risks that will come with attempts to preserve his life because those burdens are balanced by  benefits from a life that can be preserved. Preservation of life may only be for a few months at most but at the end of a life, that period of time can be particularly precious. The evidence about CD is that in the present circumstances he would have wanted treatment to be given to try to preserve his life. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Accordingly, I do not accept that it would be contrary to CD&#8217;s best interests to insert a new tunnelled catheter and to continue haemodialysis. As the parties invited me to do in the event of such a conclusion, I shall declare that it is in CD&#8217;s best interests and lawful for him to have a new tunnelled haemodialysis catheter inserted under sedation or general anaesthetic and to receive haemodialysis thereafter subject to any significant change in his clinical presentation and provided that the treating clinicians are willing to offer this treatment. The applicant may use reasonable and proportionate force to administer sedation and/or general anaesthesia to the minimum extent necessary for the insertion of the tunnelled catheter. I shall authorise any deprivation of liberty occasioned by the use of such force.</p>

Although I have not made the order the Trust sought, the medical professionals including Dr A have given full respect to the difficult decision-making in relation to CD&#8217;s care and treatment. EF and GH, who articulated their case and gave their evidence with great composure, expressed their sincere thanks to the staff and healthcare professionals at the Trust for the care they have given and continue to give to CD. Dr A spoke warmly of the family&#8217;s dedication to CD. The family and the Trust have good relations which I hope will continue. </p>
