	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I gave directions set out in an order dated 6 January 2009 the terms of which were annexed to my judgment. Paragraph 9 of that order required each party to file and serve by 16 January 2009 a succinct statement (not exceeding four sides of A4 paper) setting out (a) precisely what order for costs (if any) they were seeking and (b) the reasons why they said such order should be made. The order went on to provide that I would decide what order(s) for costs should be made following such brief oral submissions as either party might wish to make at a hearing on 20 January 2009.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father complied with that direction, filing his submissions on 16 January 2009. The mother did not, sending me on 19 January 2009 (the day before the hearing) a note which said that she would need to obtain information from her previous solicitors as to the costs, which were substantial, and to establish which costs related to the Schedule 1 and which to the section 8 proceedings. (As the father points out in his final submissions, the mother did not in fact provide any information whatsoever about her own costs in the submissions which she eventually filed on 9 February 2009. Even now, as he says, there is no indication, not even the roughest of estimates, of what actual costs the mother has incurred in the Schedule 1 proceedings. He goes on to aver that the mother&#8217;s application for an adjournment was a &#8220;fake&#8221; and simply a device to see his submission first and to &#8220;get round&#8221; the direction I had given. The mother, he says, has deliberately put me in the difficult position of trying to do justice in costs without any idea of what her costs actually are, presumably because she hopes to get some advantage by so behaving.)</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the upshot I had no alternative but to postpone consideration of the costs. I made an order on 20 January 2009 adjourning the issue of costs on the basis that the mother was to file any submission she wished to make by 13 February 2009 and that the father might file further submission in reply within 14 days. My order recited that the parties consented to me deciding all questions of costs on the written submissions without necessity of an oral hearing.</p>

The mother raised five points which I referred to as (A) to (E) respectively. The relevant paragraphs in the judgment are as follows: (1) [26], (2) [27]-[28], (3) [29]-[30], (4) [31]-[33], (5) [34]-[36], (6) [37]-[39], (7) [40]-[41], (8) [42], [58]-[81], (9) [43]-[44], (A) [46]-[47], (B) [48]-[49], (C) [50]-[51], (D) [52]-[53], and (E) [54]-[57].

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I should add that, as set out in my order of 20 January 2009, I refused the father permission to appeal on the one point (issue (1)) on which he had sought permission. The father has renewed his application to the Court of Appeal and has sent me his grounds of appeal dated 3 February 2009. He tells me that the hearing of his application for permission is listed for 18 March 2009.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father, as I have said, has a pending application before the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal in relation to issue (1). He tells me that he asked Dr Pelling to request the mother, via her McKenzie friend Mr Holden, to agree to postpone the final costs decision pending the outcome in the Court of Appeal. He assumes (his expression) that I would not object if both parties agreed but says that, so far, no agreement has been forthcoming. So he asks me to postpone my decision to await the outcome in the Court of Appeal. Referring to his grounds of appeal he submits that there is an arguable case and that the Court of Appeal &#8220;may well&#8221; grant permission to appeal, in which case, he says, &#8220;it would surely be better to wait&#8221;, for if the appeal succeeded then the Court of Appeal could be asked simply to remit the question of costs in relation to issue (1) back to me as part of all the costs. The father reiterates that stance in an email dated 2 March 2009.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I decline the father&#8217;s invitation, and would have adopted the same stance even if both parties had agreed. My decision on the costs to date has nothing to do with the proceedings in the Court of Appeal and cannot be affected by the outcome of those proceedings, whatever that may be &#8211; a matter on which I refuse to join the father in his speculations. I should decide the matter of costs now, and in accordance with the directions I gave on 20 January 2009.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father&#8217;s submissions as filed on 16 January 2009 are succinct and to the point. He says that his costs of all the financial and enforcement applications dealt with by me in my judgment should be summarily assessed together in the total sum of &#163;2,500 to be paid by the mother within 28 days.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">He sets out his reasons as follows: He says that the various applications made by the parties were all interlinked and dealt with finally by me together at the same hearings and in the same judgment. It is manifest from the judgment and order, he says, that he substantially succeeded both in resisting the mother&#8217;s applications and on his own applications. It would not be reasonable to waste time and money constructing detailed bills or schedules of costs in relation to each and every application. He asks me to take a broad-brush approach and award him summarily a fixed sum reflecting his substantial success. He says that he has spent well over 300 hours personally in dealing with all the various matters from beginning to end and additionally spent &#163;8,084 on legal advice from counsel, including instruction costs. He suggests that, as the mother has had what he calls &#8220;some limited success&#8221;, a global sum of &#163;2,500 for his costs is just and reasonable in all the circumstances.</p>

He succeeded on the trustee question (issue (5)). The mother failed in her application to have trust monies paid directly to her (issue (6)) and to be sole trustee or in sole control of the trust. He succeeded on the age &#8216;21 vs 18&#8217; point (issue (8)), which he says occasioned much research of authority, and also succeeded on the related jurisdiction point, namely whether procedurally the court could or should alter the District Judge&#8217;s order. He succeeded in obtaining what he calls sensible procedural provisions in connection with the Deed of Settlement (issues (6), (C) and (D)).</p>

Instead of producing a draft Deed of Settlement in early 2006, and dealing promptly with the settlement process in the normal way, they pursued what he characterises as unwise and unnecessary enforcement measures which sought, contrary to accepted practice, to place funds into the mother&#8217;s sole control. What he calls the July 2007 &#8220;afterthought Deed&#8221; sought no real change, the mother still seeking, immovably, the ultimate control of &#163;220,000 without genuine protection of his reversionary interest, thus, as he puts it, forcing him into unavoidable and expensive conflict. Had he substantially failed then, he says, doubtless the court would hit him with massive costs, so reciprocally, having substantially succeeded, he should be awarded costs.</p>

Issue (2), he says, <span style="font-style:italic">was</span> of consequence because it supported the (successful) case for accounting. He disputes that he lost on issue (3), for, he says, he succeeded on the accounting point &#8211; the key issue &#8211; which had been strongly resisted by the mother; the issue as to four months as opposed to reasonable time was, he says, minor in this context. In relation to issue (4), he says that he succeeded on the issue of substance, namely that there should be accounting by provision of receipts. That items less than &#163;10 could be omitted is, he says, <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span>, not least given that, in the nature of the exercise, the vast majority of expenditure is likely to be on rather more expensive items and moving costs. In relation to issue (5) he says that he was fully successful on the important issue. In relation to issue (6) he disputes that he lost, given that I declined to decide the point. In relation to issue (7) he says that, although a defined cut-off date was refused, I protected him by giving him a liberty to apply and making it clear that a cut-off date might have to be imposed in the future, referring in this connection to what I had said in paragraph [44] of the judgment. In relation to issue (8) he points out that he had never opposed the extension to tertiary education, the issue, resolved in his favour, being whether the relevant age is 21 or 18 in the event that N does not in fact go on to higher education. In relation to issue (9) he says that it was <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span> &#8211; he had assumed that &#8220;implementation&#8221; <span style="font-style:italic">ipso facto</span> included &#8220;timing&#8221; but is grateful for the express inclusion of the latter. </p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">He doubts if this raises a valid costs point. He points out that the mother did not seek a wasted costs order against Dr Pelling and says that the fact remains that he succeeded on what I note he calls &#8220;a difficult procedural strategy&#8221; which the mother strenuously but unsuccessfully opposed and then went on to succeed on the point of substance which again she had unsuccessfully opposed. He rejects her analysis of his non-appearance before District Judge Roberts, saying that it is fallacious. He does not seek to re-argue his medical unfitness. But it remains the fact, he says, that a 5 day hearing before the District Judge &#8211; this was for the section 8 claim as well as the Schedule 1 claim &#8211; was cut to 2 days at most, and he has paid the whole of the costs (including of the section 8 claim) incurred by the mother before District Judge Roberts under the order she made. It is, he says, completely speculative as to whether the District Judge would have made different orders had he attended; if for example the 21 vs 18 issue had been fought out then, the result, he suggests, might have been the same &#8211; 21 &#8211; and then further costs might have been incurred on a successful appeal to achieve substitution of 18. So, he says, the net total might have been worse for the mother in terms of costs had he attended (and, he adds, had he attended, then, on the usual principle, she would not have got her costs of the section 8 proceedings). Finally, he says the mother&#8217;s reference to paragraph [90] of my judgment is a &#8220;blatant misquotation out of context&#8221; of what I actually said.</p>

He stands by his initial submission of 16 January 2009 with this one major qualification: <span style="font-style:italic">If</span> I reject a summary approach then equally he wants all or a major proportion (at least 80%) of all his own costs on a detailed assessment, rather than the modest global net sum of &#163;2,500; he will put in his full bill for all costs paid, to include the cost of advice from counsel, his own time (with pecuniary loss claimed at two-thirds of a solicitor&#8217;s rate), and the service provided by Dr Pelling by way of court approved advocacy and related work (in which context he refers me to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/41/section/27/10" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 27(10)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/41" uk:canonical="1990 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Courts and Legal Services Act 1990</ref>). On that footing he says that there would be a claim in the order of at least &#163;38,000 instead of the compromise net figure of &#163;2,500. This is based, he says, on counsel&#8217;s advice costing &#163;8,084 and 300 hours at two-thirds of a solicitor&#8217;s rate of &#163;150 per hour.</p>
