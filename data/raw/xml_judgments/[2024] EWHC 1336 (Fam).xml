They are the persons to be protected in the application. The respondents are M (&#8220;the Mother&#8221;), F (&#8220;the Father&#8221;), and X (17 year old). In the original application the children&#8217;s adult sister (A) and brother (N) were respondents but they were discharged in February 2024. C was discharged from proceedings on 14 February 2023 as was the FMPO in respect of her. </p>

On 9 June 2022 she told the Safeguarding Lead at school that her parents had booked a ticket to take her to Afghanistan to marry a man who was known to her parents. She said she had no choice but to marry him. The following day she told the social worker and the police the same thing, and that her parents had planned to wait until she had finished school but had brought forward the plans because she was in trouble at school. She implied to the social worker that once her parents knew she had spoken to the police and social services she would experience verbal and physical abuse. She referred to the fact that A had been married before her 17th birthday and had not initially wanted to be married. In the view of the social worker, C was afraid of her parents. </p>

He did not inform the school of this plan. He bought one way tickets because they were cheaper. From this point onwards the source of information becomes more complex. There is some information subsequently given by the parents in statements.  There were subsequently some parts of the evidence and the hearings which were CLOSED (in the sense that material was not disclosed to the parents or the older siblings&#8217; representatives), and this judgment only refers to matters which were in OPEN by the end of the proceedings. It should be made clear for the avoidance of doubt, none of the material involved national security and all was shared with the LA and the Guardian. Therefore the use of the nomenclature of OPEN and CLOSED is colloquial rather than statutory. </p>

At a hearing on 12 January 2024 she proposed that she would return within a couple of weeks and wanted assurance that the authorities would not remove her passport. The parents agreed and the LA withdrew its committal application as against the Mother at the 12 January 2024 hearing and adjourned the committal proceedings against the Father and the two eldest children of the family. Subsequent events suggest that C being allowed to say she wished to return to the UK may have been because she was by this stage pregnant. </p>

A problem arose because the family had proposed that C&#8217;s uncle, would accompany her (as is required in Afghan law). However, when the uncle was informed that he would only be able to travel to Turkey, and would not have a visa to enter the UK, he declined to assist. Eventually, after a great deal of negotiation, N agreed to travel to Afghanistan to collect C. He initially refused on account of his studies in the UK, but the Court offered to write to his college asking for leave of absence, at which point he agreed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There were a number of hearings in the week of 1 February 2024. This culminated in a hearing on 7 February 2024 at which only I, Ms Mahey and Ms MacLynn attended with C on a remote link in Afghanistan. C agreed to return to the UK on 9 February but to be allowed to go back to Afghanistan if she so wished. She also made it a condition of her return that the Father&#8217;s passport be returned if she returned, and I so ordered. The main issue in this judgment is whether I should reverse that order. The LA agreed to discharge all orders and to apply to withdraw committal proceedings if she returned. </p>

She informed Ms Nunn and Ms Mahey that she is married, having undergone a Nikah in Afghanistan. She reported that this took place before the current proceedings began (before 19 September 2023). She reported that her parents had tried to pull out of the Nikah but were unable to. She also told the social worker that she liked her husband and is content being married. She indicated that she was going to obtain antenatal care in this country and wanted to return to Afghanistan in a few more days as she wished to have antenatal care and hoped to catch up with her friends here. C maintained that her mother remains unwell in Afghanistan. She subsequently confirmed to the social worker on 13 February 2024 that she had informed her parents that she had told the social worker this information. Therefore, the gist of the CLOSED material is now open evidence &#8211; that C is married and is pregnant.  </p>

X who is now 17.5 years old submits through her counsel that she is at not risk of forced marriage, wishes to remain in Afghanistan with her mother, and there should be no FMPO in respect of her. </p>

The LA, supported by the Guardian, say that both parents have been palpably dishonest in this case, and have shown no respect for the Court or Court orders. Ms Jenkins submits that there is evidence that suggests that the Father&#8217;s physical presence in Afghanistan is an important component in marriage arrangements.  Their evidence simply cannot be trusted. When C returned to the UK in February 2024 she said that there had been a Nikah in the summer of 2023, which appears to coincide with the time the Father was in Afghanistan. If the Father is allowed to travel to Afghanistan then there is absolutely no control over his actions in respect of forced marriage, and indeed it will help him to facilitate such a marriage. </p>

In all other cases, the court should impose a time limit when making such orders. The time limit will vary from case-to-case and, like all other elements, be a bespoke provision imposing a restriction only in so far as that is justified on the facts as found. Unless the court can see with clarity that there will be no need for any continuing order after a particular date, for example when it is clear that the circumstances will change so that the risk is removed, the appropriate course will be for the court to list the matter for further review a short time before the passport and/or travel ban will otherwise expire.&#8221;</span></p>

The family then travelled to Saudi Arabia on a one way ticket, without informing the children&#8217;s schools of the holiday. They then allegedly spontaneously decided to go on holiday to Afghanistan. This is despite the fact that the parents had said that they considered Afghanistan under the Taliban to be unsafe. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When they got to Afghanistan the Mother became too ill to return to the UK and decided to remain in Afghanistan for medical treatment. This is despite the fact that the GP in London reported that the Mother had not attended with any serious medical complaint and had not sought hospital treatment for the early stages of heart disease or any other concern. Whatever the well publicised problems with the NHS, it seems very surprising to remain in Afghanistan, particularly through the winter, for medical treatment rather than return to London. I note that despite a court order, the parents have not filed any further evidence of the Mother&#8217;s alleged health treatment in Afghanistan. I note that the Mother flew from London to Saudi, and then on to Afghanistan with no obvious problems. So the onset of her alleged inability to fly seems convenient. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">According to C&#8217;s conversations when she returned to the UK in February 2024, and was speaking away from the family, there was a Nikah in the summer of 2023 in Afghanistan. She subsequently became pregnant. This fits entirely with the threats her family made earlier to force her into marriage; the timing of her Father being in Afghanistan; and the probable reasons why the family did not return to the UK that summer. The parents deny that a marriage took place, but it seems a very odd lie for C to make up. If she was doing it to cover the pregnancy, then that would be totally obvious to her parents that she had become pregnant outside marriage. However, they seem unconcerned about this strange situation. It is a lie that would also place her at very great jeopardy in Afghanistan. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Mother has not made clear when she became aware that C was pregnant. She was living in the same house as C in Afghanistan, and yet never informed the Court about the pregnancy.  The Father says that he did not know about the pregnancy until C returned to the UK. They say the father of the child lives next door in Afghanistan, and they did not know C was having sex with him. This story seems staggeringly unlikely given the family are living in Afghanistan under Sharia law and the Taliban government. Unmarried sex is a very serious offence under Sharia law, and punishable in Afghanistan by stoning to death. Yet these parents seem strangely unbothered by their teenage daughter becoming pregnant by a man the Father claims not even to know and returning to Afghanistan pregnant but unmarried. </p>

This is then supported by C&#8217;s account, when she feels she can speak relatively freely. I note Ms Cavanagh urged caution in making findings given that the Mother had not given oral evidence, however she did not ask me to adjourn the hearings to hear oral evidence, as I indicated I was quite prepared to do.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In order to continue the Passport Order, I need to consider whether it is justified and proportionate, given the fact that the removal of a passport is a significant interference in this case in the Father&#8217;s Article 8 rights, and a block on his freedom of movement. For the avoidance of doubt, I do not consider that the removal of his passport interferes with his Article 5 right to liberty. I also need to consider whether there has been a material change of circumstances which would justify me varying the order on 6 February 2024, when I indicated that the passport would be returned if C returned to the UK. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I accept Ms Jenkins&#8217;s submission that removing the passport and thus not allowing the Father to travel to Afghanistan will lessen, though not remove, the prospects of the younger children being forced into marriage. It seems likely that the Nikah for C was performed when the Father was in Afghanistan, and he had a role in setting up the marriage. Of course, arrangements can be made electronically, or via another, probably male, family member. However, the Father is a very significant figure in the family, and certainly Ms Mahey&#8217;s perception in the past has been that he controls the family&#8217;s decision making. It may, although this is necessarily speculative, be a significant disincentive for another Afghan family to wish for their son to marry one of the girls if the Father cannot be in attendance and cannot leave the UK. I therefore agree that removing the Father&#8217;s passport will at least be an impediment to the younger children being forced into marriage. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If, on the other hand, I allow the Father to travel to Afghanistan then it is quite possible that none of the family will return, and the prospects of the younger children being forced into marriage will be significantly increased. It needs to be clearly borne in mind that these are British children who were raised in the UK and went to London schools. Forced marriage is a massive intrusion into their private lives with life-long consequences. It involves placing them at serious risk of rape and unwanted pregnancy. In those circumstances it is, in my view, proportionate, applying the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Bank Mellat</span> tests, that the removal of the Father&#8217;s passport is proportionate to a legitimate aim being pursued. As Ms Jenkins submitted, it does not prevent the Father pursuing family life, because the Mother and children can return to the UK at any time, my having found that the story of the Mother&#8217;s medical problems preventing her from flying is extremely unlikely. Further, this is not an open-ended order but one limited to the date Z becomes 18, and thus lasting about 3.5 years. </p>

For the reasons set out above, I give this argument no weight. I am confident that if the Father had genuinely wanted the family to come back to the UK at any point since September 2023 he could have persuaded them to do so. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In respect of the change of circumstances since 6 February 2024, the key issue is that the focus has shifted from C to her younger siblings. If the purpose of the Passport Order was to protect C, I would discharge it. Sadly, the LA and the Court were unable to stop C&#8217;s marriage, and I can only hope that she is telling the truth when she says she is content in the marriage and that she freely wished to return to Afghanistan in February 2024. There is no more the Court can do. However, the same is not true for her sisters and brother where the active risk remains very high and the Passport Order has an important role. The lack of honesty in the parents&#8217; most recent witness statements provide ample justification for varying the order of 6 February 2024. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, I have concluded that the FMPO should continue in respect of X until her 18th birthday. From my interactions with C, I conclude that I can put very little weight on what the children of the family say being their own independent and unpressured views. Although I am confident that X&#8217;s legal representatives have tried to ensure that she is speaking freely, in circumstances where she is in Afghanistan and there is no method of independent verification, I cannot be confident on this. Marriage in the UK under the age of 18 is now unlawful and I consider the interference in her rights by imposing an FMPO until her 18th birthday, is slight. On the other hand, this may give her some important protection for the next few months</p>
