	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">This application relates to the appointment of Neil Cawthorn (Mr Cawthorn) as the property and affairs deputy for AR.  It has also been used to address issues relating to his appointment as a property and affairs deputy for others.    </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Cawthorn is a solicitor and the principal of Neil Cawthorn &amp; Associates (NCA).  He acts as a deputy through a division of that practice called the Professional Deputy Service (PDS) which has no legal personality of its own. He has been appointed by the Court of Protection (the COP) to act as a property and affairs deputy for patients (Ps).  He so acts for over a hundred Ps. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The main reason why this application has been transferred to me is that it raises issues relating to the validity of the orders relied on by Mr Cawthorn to enable him to charge remuneration as a deputy. </p>

	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I recognise that there were pragmatic reasons and factors that affected the approach to the way in which the relevant background orders were sought, relied on and made, including the point that in many of the cases the remuneration was cost neutral because the relevant local authority (Suffolk County Council - SCC) treated the Deputy&#8217;s charges (and still treats them) as disability related expenditure. </p>

	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">However, there is no doubt that the COP acting through its then Senior Judge (Judge Lush) and an authorised court officer (Mr Batey) with the concurrence of Judge Lush must carry considerable responsibility for the problems now facing the COP, Mr Cawthorn and most importantly the Ps for whom he acts as a property and affairs deputy. However, the Crown has not been joined to these proceedings because the Public Guardian does not seek any order for his costs and both he and Mr Cawthorn have decided that they do not seek an order for costs to be paid by the court (and so the Crown). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Finally, at the outset of this judgment I record that the Public Guardian accepts that Mr Cawthorn provides a good service as a deputy. <span style="font-weight:bold"/>This acceptance is based on evidence in this case and other contact between him and the Public Guardian.  As appears later, I agree. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">It is not clear, and to my mind it does not matter, whether Judge Lush gave specific authority for the ACO orders, as he had for the order dated 15 March 2013, or whether they were made by Mr Batey as an authorised court officer under the general supervision of Judge Lush as the Senior Judge.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">At the hearing Ms Whayman was not available.  This was not surprising given the timetable and I indicated that I was not prepared to take an approach that attached less weight to her statement because she was not cross examined on it and I had envisaged that, if wider oral evidence was required, I would have to adjourn and give directions.  I also indicated that I was doubtful that cross examination of any of the witnesses would add value.  After considering their positions the parties (by which I mean Mr Cawthorn and the Public Guardian) agreed to proceed on the basis that there would be </p>

The informality of the procedure adopted may have been founded on some pragmatic considerations and the historic approach of the old Court of Protection before the MCA.  However, in my view the flaws are not confined to issues that can properly be described as procedural flaws that could or should not found the revisiting or setting aside of the ACO orders.</p>

By making an order that does not as envisaged by Rule 167(1)(c) (now 19.13 (1)(c)) provide that remuneration is to be determined by reference to the schedule of fees (fixed fees) set out in a Practice Direction the COP is not filling a gap or varying the Rules or Practice Directions.

AR&#8217;s net assets have increased since 2016 but, as in argument, I take &#163;8,000 and so charges of &#163;360 for a solicitor and of &#163;240 (now &#163;280) for a local authority.  Absent any inflationary increase the rate claimed and set out in the 2014 ACO order is &#163;685 if management of a tenancy and accommodation is involved which it is in AR&#8217;s case.  Also, in her case &#163;110 is claimed as and when the deputy becomes responsible for managing direct payments.  This has not yet occurred but may do and would increase the annual fee to &#163;795.

This is quite close to the 2014 ACO order and so what Mr Cawthorn claims.  The equivalent annual fees for a solicitor under PD 19B are up to April 2017 &#163;1,500 and then &#163;1,185 and from April 2017 &#163;1,670 and then &#163;1,320.  This is significantly more than the remuneration sought by Mr Cawthorn and so the 4.5% of net assets cap of &#163;360 for AR points strongly in favour of the conclusion that it is most unlikely that a solicitor (other than one who sets up a service like Mr Cawthorn) would accept appointment as AR&#8217;s deputy. </p>

The Public Guardian accepted this is what the deponents believed.  But in his final position statement he questioned the impartiality of one of the deponents (Ms Farrar who was at court and willing to be cross examined and had prepared a visitor&#8217;s report for the Public Guardian in respect of an assurance visit relating to ECC&#8217;s deputy service in early 2015).  However, during the hearing the basis for this assertion disappeared when it was pointed out that contrary to the indication from the Essex postal addresses of some Ps for whom Mr Cawthorn (and so PDS) acted as a deputy at the relevant times the local authority that owed duties to them was Suffolk and none of the Ps for whom Mr Cawthorn acted as a deputy at the relevant times were in the area for which ECC is the relevant local authority.  Accordingly, it was not pursued. </p>

The thrust of the regulatory evidence was that a high majority of local authorities (and professional deputies) receive a green rating on the RAG rating system used by the Public Guardian.  In broad terms over three business years around 75% were rated green around 20% amber and less than 5% red.  A green rating under that system indicates satisfactory (or as I understand it a higher) performance assessed by reference to published deputy standards which reflect compliance with the MCA and in particular its individual best interests approach.  To support his disagreement with points advanced by and on behalf of Mr Cawthorn the Public Guardian also took some samples from some green, amber and red assessments. </p>

However, and in line with the approach taken at that best interests meeting, I consider that it is likely  that short and longer term housing solutions will be found more quickly with the co-operation of ECC or through a scheme along the lines of a shared housing ownership scheme that Mr Cawthorn has pursued and put into effect for Ps in SCC, if Mr Cawthorn is the deputy.  This is because of the focus, flexibility and experience that Mr Cawthorn can and will continue to bring to this problem and the relationship he and his team have with AR and her foster mother. </p>

I do not agree.  Fee levels in most aspects of life are reviewed from time to time and unless and until changes relating to bulk applications and their cost are introduced (and this is not something that the COP can do) it is in the best interests of Ps to have a built-in provision to address inflation rather than the expense and inconvenience of regular returns to the COP to address the need for fee increases.  The effect of such a provision can be considered from time to time by the Public Guardian as the regulator.  I suspect that one based on the CPI as suggested is unlikely to cause inappropriate increases of other problems and will avoid unnecessary expense and time being spent on repeated applications. </p>

His invoice for this sum relates to a period ending on 31 October 2016 and he should confirm that this is because it was the date of the hearing which led to the order of DJ Eldergill dated 16 November 2016 and why that invoice seeks a management fee from that date and so before he was appointed as AR&#8217;s interim deputy on 1 December 2016. </p>

If I have missed something on the papers concerning this I apologise but I am not clear what and how the means test for contributions to local authorities operates for each of the relevant Ps and more generally the impact of that means test for Ps with net assets less than &#163;16,000.

For example, if participation in the HOLD project would promote AR&#8217;s bests interests the prospects of this being achieved by the possible appointees may be a weighty factor.  </p>
