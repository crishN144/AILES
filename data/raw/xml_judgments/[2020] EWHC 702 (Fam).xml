The primary case of the witness [&#8220;XX&#8221;] is that the evidence establishes a real and immediate risk of harm or death such that European </p>

A broadly similar approach as the Supreme Court adopted in <span style="font-style:italic">PJS v News Group Newspapers </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2016] AC 1081" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] AC 1081</ref> is required.  There must be an intense focus on the nature and extent of the risks under Articles 2 and 3, and on the comparative gravity of those risks and of the rights under Article 8 and 10 of the ECHR in the individual case.  The justifications for interfering with Articles 8 and 10 or for restricting each of those rights must be taken into account, and a proportionality test must be applied.&#8221; </p>

Ms Michalos submitted that the Media&#8217;s postulation wholly misses the point of the Media&#8217;s own application which is for permission to name XX so that his involvement can be splashed across the Press with the consequence that it will quickly become known and actively discussed on social media. </p>
