	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this matter I am concerned with seven children.  KB, aged 15, NB, aged 12, ZB, aged 9, AB, aged 8, KAB, aged 7, ALB, aged 4 and RB, aged 3.  The mother of the children is JB (hereafter &#8216;the mother&#8217;).  She is herself one of ten siblings.  The father of the eldest child, KB, is RM.  He lives in Slovakia and has had notice of these proceedings although, at present, his position regarding the proposals for KB does not appear to have been ascertained definitively.  The father of the six youngest children is BB.  All of the children and each of the parents are Slovakian nationals and are of Slovakian Roma origin.  KB has stated that he has a twin sister, VB, who is placed in care in Slovakia.   </p>

Those proceedings were issued in March of this year.  The threshold criteria pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 31</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> are conceded by the mother in this case (it would not appear that either RM or BB has yet formally conceded the threshold).  Specifically, the mother concedes certain facts pertaining to her care of the children and concedes that the two eldest children, KB and NB, are beyond parental control.  The care proceedings are at present listed in the Family Court for a final hearing before Her Honour Judge Lazarus on 2 November 2015 with a time estimate of 5 days.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 4 August 2015 the Family Court at Medway received a document from the Centre for the International Legal Protection of Children and Youth of the Slovak Republic (which organisation is the Central Authority of the Slovak Republic) entitled &#8220;Intervention to be a Third Party to the Proceedings&#8221;.  By that document the Central Authority sought to be made interveners in these care proceedings. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In its document of 4 August 2015 the Slovak Central Authority made clear that it sought the return of all of the children to Slovakia, either into the care of the mother and BB or into residential or foster care if the mother and BB were assessed in Slovakia as incapable of parenting the children.  The Central Authority suggested that the return of the children to Slovakia &#8220;could be achieved using the procedure under Article 56 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003&#8221;.  There was no suggestion at that stage that the Slovakian Central Authority sought a transfer of jurisdiction to the Slovakian courts pursuant to Art 15(1) of BIIa as distinct from inviting the English court to contemplate final orders facilitating placement of the children in Slovakia and to utilise the procedure for consulting the Slovak Central Authority under Art 56 as a precondition to that end.  On 26 August 2015 the care proceedings were transferred to the High Court.</p>

Within the body of that Skeleton Argument, dated 17 September 2015, the Slovak Central Authority does invite this court to consider transferring jurisdiction to the Slovakian court of its own motion pursuant to Art 15(2)(b) of BIIa.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the circumstances, whilst there is, in fact, no formal application from the Central Authority of the Slovak Republic under Art 15(2)(c) for transfer jurisdiction to Slovakia, it is clear from the face of the Skeleton Argument filed by the Slovak Central Authority that it urges this court to exercise its power under Art 15(2)(b) of BIIa to transfer jurisdiction in relation to all seven children to the Slovakian court of its own volition so as to enable the Slovak courts to decide the best interests of each of the children. </p>

	    <num>8.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I decided at the outset of this hearing that the Slovak Central Authority should have permission to intervene in these proceedings, both for the purposes of determining the issue under Art 15(1) and for the determination of the substantive proceedings concerning the children (which, for reasons I will come to, will now be limited in this jurisdiction to considering the welfare of KB and NB).  The Slovakian Central Authority is not represented before the court.  The Central Authority made clear in correspondence that it would not be in attendance or represented at this hearing but invited the court to have regard to the submissions set out in its Skeleton Argument and to contact the Central Authority if any further information was required.</p>

	    <num>9.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By an application dated 15 September 2015 the mother herself applied under Art 15(2)(a) of BIIa for an order pursuant to Art 15(1) transferring these proceedings to the courts in Slovakia.  The application by the mother was issued in respect of all seven children.  However, during the course of this hearing the mother indicated that she now seeks the transfer of jurisdiction to the Slovakian court in respect of the youngest five children only.  BB also now, I am told, adopts the same position.  </p>

	    <num>10.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother&#8217;s position on transfer of jurisdiction expressed at this hearing is consistent with her indication at a hearing on 14 July 2015 (recorded on the face of the order of Her Honour Judge Cameron of that date) that she agreed that KB and NB should remain in long term foster care in light of the fact that they were beyond her parental control and that she would not be able to parent all seven children.   The mother has today confirmed to her legal advisers that this remains her position.</p>

	    <num>11.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority supports the transfer of jurisdiction to Slovakia in respect of the youngest five children but opposes a transfer in relation to KB and NB.   Whilst initially opposed to transfer of jurisdiction to the Slovakian courts in respect of any of the children, the Children&#8217;s Guardian gave further consideration to her position at court and now also supports the transfer of jurisdiction to Slovakia in respect of the youngest five children.  In tandem with the local authority, the Children&#8217;s Guardian opposes the transfer of jurisdiction in relation to KB and NB.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the circumstances, it can be seen that all parties and the Slovak Central Authority now make common cause in submitting that jurisdiction in respect of the five youngest children should be transferred to the courts in Slovakia.  It can also be seen that it is now only the Slovakian Central Authority that contends that this court should, of its own volition, transfer jurisdiction in respect of KB and NB to the Slovakian courts.  </p>

Unnecessary satellite litigation in such cases is a great evil. Proper regard for the requirements of B2R and a proper adherence to the essential philosophy underlying it, requires an appropriately summary process. Too ready a willingness on the part of the court to go into the full merits of the case can only be destructive of the system enshrined in B2R and lead to the protracted and costly battles over jurisdiction which it is the very purpose of B2R to avoid. Submissions should be measured in hours and not days. As Lady Hale observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Re I </span>in the passage already cited by Ryder LJ, the task for the judge under Article 15 "will not depend upon a profound investigation of the child's situation and upbringing but upon the sort of considerations which come into play when deciding upon the most appropriate forum."</p>

The family moved to the United Kingdom from Slovakia in 2008.  The maternal grandparents and six of the mother&#8217;s siblings also reside in the United Kingdom.  Prior to the family moving to the United Kingdom, information received from the Slovak Central Authority indicates that NB spent a period placed in care in Slovakia due to the mother being unable to provide accommodation for him and BB being incarcerated in prison.</p>

The issues which triggered that involvement were the neglect of the children&#8217;s care (including an incident where RB was admitted to hospital with severe dehydration), repeated issues of homelessness and signs that both KB and NB were beyond parental control.  This latter issue had manifested in both elder children becoming involved in the criminal justice system in this country, in KB refusing to engage in education, absconding and demonstrating a marked lack of fear and in NB refusing to engage in education, developing negative beliefs about himself and demonstrating aggression and difficulty in regulating his emotions.</p>

Within the current proceedings two assessments of the family have been undertaken.  A &#8216;Sunlight Parenting Assessment&#8217; report was completed on 28 August 2015 regarding the capacity of the mother to meet the needs of the children.  This assessment did not consider the parenting capacity of BB, or his ability to support the care of the mother by reason of his having been deported as set out above.  The report concluded that the mother was not in a position to meet the needs of the children and that her capacity to make changes was not one that was within timescales commensurate with the children&#8217;s needs.  A report was also commissioned from the ROMA Support Group.  That report, dated 7 September 2015 made a number of recommendations for engaging the mother should she return to the United Kingdom.   In addition to these assessments of the family, a kinship assessment was proposed of ZE, who is the maternal grandmother of the children.  However, ZE confirmed her withdrawal from the assessment process by a letter dated 30 July 2015.</p>

The mother acknowledged that the children may be placed in a children&#8217;s home upon their return but stated that she and BB had a four bedroomed flat in Slovakia in which to accommodate the children.  The mother has now returned to Slovakia without the children and is living with BB in the four bedroomed flat.  The precise date the mother left for Slovakia is not known, although on 13 August 2015 the mother telephoned KB and informed him she was in Slovakia.  On 26 August 2015 the maternal grandmother informed the social worker that the mother will not return to the United Kingdom.  On 31 August 2015 KB informed his foster carers that the mother is now four months pregnant with twins and had left for Slovakia in order to avoid the involvement of the local authority with her unborn children.</p>

On 14 July 2015 the mother agreed to the suspension of contact.  On 30 July 2015 the foster placement for the youngest five children broke down following a significant deterioration of the children&#8217;s behaviour.  This deterioration followed an incident of unauthorised contact between the children and their mother on 27 July 2015.

The social worker makes clear in her statement that both children have expressed frustration that the issue of maternal contact has been revisited by the social worker and that both KB and NB have exhibited behaviour that suggests that they feel that they are not being listened to, each boy accusing the social worker of ignoring their views.  NB does not wish to have contact with his father and RB does not wish to have contact with BB.  Both RB and NB do however have a close relationship with their maternal grandmother in England and wish to have contact with her.</p>

The clear wish of NB was not to return to his mother&#8217;s care, whether in the United Kingdom or in Slovakia.  When he was asked what he thought about returning to Slovakia if his younger siblings returned he was unsure of his position.  Following the visits of the Guardian and the social worker to ascertain NB&#8217;s views the foster carer reported disturbed behaviour by NB.   On 11 September 2015 the foster carers sent a note to the local authority stating that NB had been very unsettled.

The Children&#8217;s Guardian was concerned that this episode of absconding was linked to the recent news that his mother had returned to Slovakia and to information received by KB that he too may be returned to Slovakia.  Within this context, it is of note that when he returned to the foster placement on the evening of 31 August 2015 KB spoke to his foster carer about his concerns regarding returning to Slovakia.  KB said that there was no point in speaking to the Guardian about his wishes as his maternal grandmother had told him he had to go to Slovakia and he had no choice.  KB said he had visited his grandmother than morning and had spoken with a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Slovakian solicitor</span>&#8221; who had said he would be living in Slovakia in a matter of weeks.  KB repeated that, in the circumstances, there was no point is saying he wanted to stay in England as he had no choice in the matter.  He further told the foster carer that he had learnt from his grandmother that his mother was four months pregnant with twins.  KB expressed the view that his mother would not care for him and NB once &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">we are deported</span>&#8221; because she will be too busy with the new babies.  At the conclusion of the conversation with his foster carer KB was persuaded to speak to the Guardian the next day if that could be arranged although this does not appear to have taken place.</p>

The view of the social worker is that both KB and NB have shown a commitment to remain in their current placement.  Within the placement improvements in the behaviour of both KB and NB have been noted and, in the assessment of the social worker, both boys demonstrate willingness and an ability to engage with the foster carers.  </p>

Within this context, the local authority&#8217;s final care plans for KB and NB now provide for the both boys to remain placed with their current foster carers until they reach the age of majority.  As already noted, the mother consents to this plan in respect of KB and NB, as does BB in respect of NB (again, it is not clear that RM has given his consent in respect of KB).</p>

For example, is the other Member State the former habitual residence of the child (see Article 15(3)(b)) or the place of the child&#8217;s nationality (see Article 15(3)(c)). Secondly, it must determine whether the court of that other Member state &#8216;would be better placed to hear the case, or a specific part thereof&#8217;.

The starting point for this evaluation is the principle of comity and co-operation between Member States of the European Union enshrined in the European Union Treaty.  In particular, these principles demand that the judicial and social care arrangements in Member States are to be treated by the courts in England and Wales as being equally competent to those in this jurisdiction (<span style="font-style:italic">Nottingham City Council v LM </span>at [19]).  Thus, for example, for this court to take into account the fact that the court in Slovakia may be minded to take a different view of the seriousness of risk to the children from their mother and respective fathers to that identified by the assessments in England would constitute a comparative evaluation of the efficacy of the Slovakian courts and, accordingly, would be impermissible (<span style="font-style:italic">Nottingham City Council v LM </span>at [38]).</p>

Another example will be whether proceedings in the Member State can be conducted in the first language of the family, negating the need for interpreters and permitting the family more effectively to participate in proceedings.</p>

They must mean the same thing, which is that it is in the child's interests for the case to be determined in the courts of this country rather than elsewhere. This question is quite different from the substantive question in the proceedings, which is &#8216;what outcome to these proceedings will be in the best interests of the child?' It will not depend upon a profound investigation of the child's situation and upbringing but upon the sort of considerations which come into play when deciding upon the most appropriate forum. The fact that the parties have submitted to the jurisdiction and are both habitually resident within it is clearly relevant though by no means the only factor.</span></p>

Of course, children do not tend to express their views, wishes and feelings in the technical language of European Union law.  As in this case, a child is much more likely to express a general wish not to return to another Member State and/or to one or both parents for reasons which pertain, for example, to the child&#8217;s fear of what awaits him or her in the other Member State, the child&#8217;s view of his or her parents ability to provide care or the child&#8217;s wish to remain with trusted foster carers or in the company of friends made in this jurisdiction, rather than to state in terms that, for example, he or she considers the court of the other Member State is not better placed to determine his or her future or to argue that a transfer of jurisdiction would not be in his or her own best interests.  However, such views on the part of the child may nonetheless be relevant to the court&#8217;s determination of an application under Art 15(1) notwithstanding that the child&#8217;s reasons for not wishing to return are not expressed strictly in terms of the questions posed by that article.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By way of example, a determination of whether the courts of another Member State are better placed to hear the proceedings will often involve consideration of whether that other Member State is better placed to conduct assessments which will inform the welfare outcome in the case.  The participation of the child in such assessments is both a right of the child and crucial to an accurate, child centred appraisal of the welfare aspects of the case (see UNCRC Art 9(2), UN Committee on the Rights of the Child General Comment No 12 (2009) (CRC/C/GC/12) para 54 and the 1996 European Convention on the Exercise of Children&#8217;s Rights Art 3 (ETS No 160)).  Within this context, when considering whether another jurisdiction is better placed to hear the case it is legitimate to ask, for example, what level of co-operation by the child in assessments in that jurisdiction, and what level of acceptance by the child in the welfare outcome recommended by such assessment, will be achieved in circumstances where strongly held wishes and feelings of the child regarding his or her return to the Member State in question have been, from the child&#8217;s perspective, ignored.  An older child who resists strongly his or her return to another Member State may well be far less willing to participate in assessments, in arrangements for interim contact and in the process of care planning pending final orders in that Member State.  Such a situation is plainly relevant to the question of whether the courts of that Member State are &#8216;better placed&#8217; to hear the case notwithstanding that the child&#8217;s reasons for not wishing to return are not expressed strictly in terms of the questions posed by Art 15(1).  There will be other examples dependent on the particular facts of the given case.</p>

Where, for example, a child has expressed a visceral objection to returning to the other Member State in question and threatened absconding or self harm if such a return were to be enforced against his or her wishes and feelings, it may legitimately be said that to transfer jurisdiction to the courts of that Member State is antithetic to that child&#8217;s best interests such that the clearly expressed wishes and feelings of the child must be a weighty factor in determining the narrow best interests question on the issue of forum.  I pause to note that whilst Art 15 speaks of the transfer of the jurisdiction to hear the case rather than the physical removal of the subject child to the jurisdiction of the other Member State, and therefore admits of the possibility that the child may remain in the original jurisdiction whilst proceedings in that other Member State are determined, it is difficult to see how, practically, a transfer of jurisdiction could be effective if it did not result also in the return of the subject child to the receiving jurisdiction.  By way of further example within the context of the question of best interests under Art 15(1), and having regard to the interconnected nature of the &#8216;better placed&#8217; and &#8216;best interests&#8217; tests, it might also be said that it would not be in the child&#8217;s best interests to transfer jurisdiction in the face of the child&#8217;s expressed wish not to return to the Member State in question where to cut across that expressed wish would have the effect of reducing markedly the efficacy of assessments and care planning in the other Member State.  Once again, there will be other examples dependent on the particular facts of the given case.</p>

The Central Authority intends to deliver that assessment to this court.  As already noted, the Slovak Central authority proposes, if the assessment is negative, to place the children in what at some points in the documentation provided by the Central Authority is described as a &#8220;children&#8217;s home&#8221; and on other occasions as &#8220;foster care&#8221; in Slovakia.

The local authority further points out that, in circumstances where the mother concedes much of the factual background, including hitting ALB, there will be no need for witnesses of fact from England to participate in proceedings.  As to the assessments, the local authority submits that, in the context of the parents having reunited, its assessments did not include BB and that any further assessment of the parents as a couple would need to take place in Slovakia as that is where the parents are now located.

In particular, the local authority submits that in light of their ages, 12 and 15 respectively, the expressed views of NB and KB concerning a return to Slovakia should be accorded weight in the determination of the questions of whether Slovakia is better placed to hear the cases in respect of KB and NB and whether transfer of jurisdiction is in the best interests of KB and NB.  The local authority further point to the fact that the assessments of the mother in respect of her sole capacity to care for KB and NB have been completed, that the mother and BB do not (in contrast to the young children) advance themselves as joint carers for KB and NB, that the mother has expressly consented to KB remaining in his current foster placement and that the mother and BB have expressly consented to NB remaining in his current foster care placement.  Within this context, the local authority submits that, by contrast to the position in respect of the younger children, the English court is manifestly better placed to hear the case in respect of KB and NB and that it is in the best interests of KB and NB that the English court does so.

The mother submits that the assessments that now require to be undertaken in this context are best carried out in Slovakia.  The mother further points out that, by reason of his immigration status, the father is not permitted to re-enter the United Kingdom in order to take part in an assessment, further bolstering the submission that Slovakia is better placed (indeed, uniquely placed) to complete the required assessment of the couple.  Whilst there are a significant number of family members in England, the mother reminds the court that they do not advance themselves as kinship carers for the children and that there are also extended family members in Slovakia.  The mother further reminds the court that it must treat the Slovakian authorities as equally competent as their English counterparts.</p>

It is further important, given the ages of these children, and for the reasons I have set out above, to have regard to these expressed wishes and I have borne them carefully in mind.  However, in my judgment the expressed wishes and feelings of ZB, AB and KAB do not act to change my overall conclusion that the Slovakian court is better placed to hear their cases.  Whilst I note and take account of their recently expressed views having regard to their age and maturity those views must be placed in their proper context.  That context is the consistent expression by all three children to date of their love of their mother and their wish to return to her care.  In my judgment their recent expression of wishes to the contrary in one meeting with the social worker is not a sufficient basis on which to conclude that those wishes outweigh the forensic advantages set out above with respect to the jurisdiction of Slovakia.  </p>

The current foster carers for KB and NB have been approved as long term carers for the boys and have made clear their wish to care for the boys in the long term.   Within this context, the local authority&#8217;s final care plans for KB and NB now provide for the both boys to remain placed with their current foster carers until they reach the age of majority.

In particular, in my judgment both boys have made clear that they see their efforts at improved behaviour and at making progress in other areas of their lives as part of a &#8216;promise&#8217; or &#8216;compact&#8217;, their much improved behaviour and effort being that which they are prepared willingly to give in return for remaining in the stable, secure and supportive placement provided by the current foster carers, which placement they value and from which they derive much benefit.  Within this context it is important to consider what the effect on the boys would be of breaking that promise or compact (as the boys would surely see it) by transferring jurisdiction to the courts in Slovakia.   As I have already noted above, whilst Art 15 speaks of the transfer of the jurisdiction to hear the case rather than the physical removal of the subject child to the jurisdiction of the other Member State, and therefore admits of the possibility that KB and NB could remain in this jurisdiction whilst proceedings Slovakia are determined, it is difficult to see how, practically, a transfer of jurisdiction could be effective if it did not result also in the return of KB and NB to the receiving jurisdiction.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Were jurisdiction in respect of KB and NB transferred to the courts in Slovakia those courts would, given the steps proposed by the Slovak Central Authority following transfer, need to seek to engage KB and NB in a number of ways.  In particular, they would need to assess for themselves what placement in Slovakia would be in KB and NB&#8217;s best interests.  This would, given the age and maturity of KB and NB require their engagement in the assessment process.  However, in my judgment it is highly questionable whether such co-operation would be achieved in circumstances where the clearly and strongly expressed wishes and feelings of the KB and NB regarding return to the Slovakia had been ignored.  In the circumstances, I find myself satisfied that the expressed wishes and feelings of KB and NB, whilst not determinative, constitute a further reason for concluding that the courts in Slovakia are not, in the particular circumstances of this case, better placed to hear the case in respect of KB and NB.</p>

Whilst some delay in respect of the younger children is inevitable in light of the fact that the care plan for these children remains unresolved the same cannot be said for KB and NB.  Given the consent of the mother and KB and the finalised care plans of the local authority, the proceedings in respect of KB and NB can (subject to the consent of KB&#8217;s father being obtained) be finalised by way of a consent order almost immediately.  In my judgment it cannot be said that the courts in Slovakia are better placed to hear the case in respect of KB and NB where such a transfer or jurisdiction would result in a considerable period of delay to which the children would not be exposed were the proceedings to remain in this jurisdiction.  </p>

In my judgment it is plainly in the best interests of the youngest children for their respective futures to be determined in the jurisdiction in which each of the realistic options for their long term welfare is located and in the jurisdiction that is best able to assess each of those options within the national, cultural, linguistic, ethnic and religious<span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt"/>context which comprises the heritage of the children.  For reasons I have already set out, in my judgment it cannot be said in respect of the younger children that to transfer the proceedings in the face of their very recently expressed wishes would be antithetic to their best interests when placed in the history of their expressed views.</p>

This is of course no reflection on the competency of that jurisdiction.  Rather, my conclusion is consequent upon my judgment that it is in KB and NB&#8217;s best interests for their cases to be determined in the jurisdiction in which assessment, care planning and placement decision making has already been concluded, the jurisdiction in which a long term placement has already been located and the jurisdiction in which the parents of the children (subject to confirmation of the position of the father of KB) have consented to the children remaining for the purposes of securing their long term welfare.  </p>

In particular, having regard to the strongly expressed views of KB and NB, there is in my judgment an appreciable risk that the behaviour of both boys would regress significantly (with the physical dangers attendant thereon) and that there emotional welfare would be damaged if their clearly expressed wishes and feelings in this regard were ignored.  In my judgment this risk is one which must weigh heavily in my determination of the question of whether a transfer of jurisdiction is in the best interests of KB and NB.  </p>

For example, in <span style="font-style:italic">Re L-M (Transfer of Irish Proceedings) </span>Cobb J suggested that where an Art 15 request is made it would be helpful for the requesting State to communicate the request through the International Judicial Network rather than through the Central Authority.  However, in circumstances where in this case the Slovak Central Authority has demanded rigorous adherence to its stated requirement for all communications regarding the children to pass through the Central Authority, enquiries will need to be made as to whether the guidance given by Cobb J regarding the use of the International Judicial Network will, in this case, result in a more effective and timely response to the transfer request.  Enquiries will also need to be made to establish to which court in Slovakia the transfer request should be directed.</p>

As the transfer in respect of the younger children in this case is of a public law process, and placement of the youngest children in care in Slovakia is contemplated, at least initially, confirmation that the 'competent authority' in Slovakia has consented to the placement under Art 56 will be required (<span style="font-style:italic">Health Service Executive v SC and AC </span>(<ref href="#" uk:canonical="Case C-92/12" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case">Case C-92/12</ref>) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2012] 2 FLR 1040" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] 2 FLR 1040</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re L-M (Transfer of Irish Proceedings) </span>at [42]).

It is likely, if the Central Authority adopts the practice they have followed to date, that any additional submissions from the Central Authority will likewise be in writing.
