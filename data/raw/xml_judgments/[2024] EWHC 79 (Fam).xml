	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case concerns a 2.5 year old girl, X. The case has a most unhappy procedural history and is now in week 127. This is particularly unfortunate given that the Local Authority (&#8220;LA&#8221;) application is for a care and placement order, and the applications were made almost immediately after the child&#8217;s birth. This delay has been highly detrimental to X&#8217;s best interests, whether or not the orders sought are ultimately made.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The matter was listed before me, as the Family Presider for the Midlands, to consider whether a costs order should be made against an intermediary, Ms Z, for the wasted costs of a 5 day final hearing that had to be adjourned; and whether I should vary the order appointing a deaf intermediary for the Mother during the final hearing.  For reasons that I set out below I did not make any costs order against Ms Z, and I have decided not to vary the order for the appointment of an intermediary. However, I will set out some guidance on the use of intermediaries in the Family Court, particularly given the apparent paucity of such guidance and the differences that seem to now arise between the practice in the Family Court and that in the criminal courts. </p>

X was born in early July 2021. The applications for care and placement orders were made on 22 May 2023. The Mother (&#8220;M&#8221;) is the First Respondent, and the Father (&#8220;F&#8221;) is the Second Respondent. </p>

All of these matters are said to place X at risk of significant harm. The M had an earlier child with a different father, who was subject to public law proceedings and was placed with his paternal grandparents under a Special Guardianship Order (&#8220;SGO&#8221;). The threshold findings in that case included that the child and M had been living in an abusive household; that the M could not prioritise the child&#8217;s needs; and the M&#8217;s poor mental health and self-harm. </p>

Our concerns primarily focus on the potential for [M] to gravitate towards risky relationships and conflict.  Therefore, an extension of one month of her placement at [the placement] will allow us to complete additional work around protection, it would allow her time to sort out her property and would encompass a transition towards life in the community.  We would recommend during this time too that the local authority considers the nature of the support her family will offer her, as well as the exploration of services available to support [M] specifically with her deafness (devices will be needed to aid her with her care of [X]).&#8221;</span></p>

Relying on an interpreter in this situation is not at all appropriate and the hearing intermediary only has access to the interpretation and not the original language, which can muddy the waters even further. I have seen a few &#8216;hearing&#8217; intermediaries attempting to advise the court regarding a deaf person and they have little to offer and are prone to making the same errors and making the same assumptions, as any other non-specialist professional without a background in deafness, meaning that their reports at best add little, and at worst mislead the court. A Deaf intermediary on the other hand can monitor communication directly, intervene to assist if needed and advise the court in situations where there is a misunderstanding or miscommunication. The use of a Deaf intermediary in court also helps to advise the court on the nature of BSL, the interpretation process and Deaf culture/norms. The &#8216;power imbalance&#8217; of a deaf person surrounded by hearing professionals is somewhat addressed by having a deaf professional assisting the court and is a safeguard against accusations of discrimination. &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

These are fact-sensitive decisions that call for not only an assessment of the relevant circumstances of the defendant, but also the circumstances of the particular trial.

We immediately acknowledge the valuable contribution made to the administration of justice by the use of intermediaries in appropriate cases. We recognise that there are occasions when the use of an intermediary would improve the trial process. That, however, is far from saying that whenever the process would be improved by the availability of an intermediary, it is mandatory for an intermediary to be made available. It can, after all, sometimes be overlooked that as part of their general responsibilities judges are expected to deal with specific communication problems faced by any defendant or any individual witness (whether a witness for the prosecution or the defence) as part and parcel of their ordinary control of the judicial process. When necessary, the processes have to be adapted to ensure that a particular individual is not disadvantaged as a result of personal difficulties, whatever form they may take. In short, the overall responsibility of the trial judge for the fairness of the trial has not been altered because of the increased availability of intermediaries, or indeed the wide band of possible special measures now enshrined in statute.</span></p>

It would, in fact, be a most unusual case for a defendant who is fit to plead to be found to be so disadvantaged by his condition that a properly brought prosecution would have to be stayed. That would be an unjust outcome where, on the face of the evidence, a genuine complaint has properly been brought against the defendant.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.17in;margin-right:0.59in">It will be &#8220;exceptionally rare&#8221; for an order for an intermediary to be appointed for a whole trial. Intermediaries are not to be appointed on a &#8220;just in case&#8221; basis. Thomas [36]. This is notable because in the family justice system it appears to be common for intermediaries to be appointed for the whole trial. However, it is clear from this passage that a judge appointing an intermediary should consider very carefully whether a whole trial order is justified, and not make such an order simply because they are asked to do so. </p>

These include having breaks in the evidence, and importantly ensuring that &#8220;evidence is adduced in very shortly phrased questions&#8221; and witnesses are asked to give their &#8220;answers in short sentences&#8221;. This was emphasised by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">R v Rashid</span> (Yahya) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2017] 1 WLR 2449" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] 1 WLR 2449</ref>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">All these points are directly applicable to the Family Court. Counsel submitted that there was a need for intermediaries because relevant parties often did not understand the proceedings and the language that was being used. However, the first and normal approach to this difficulty is for the judge and the lawyers to ensure that simple language is used and breaks taken to ensure that litigants understand what is happening. All advocates in cases involving vulnerable parties or witnesses should be familiar with the Advocates Gateway and the advice on how to help vulnerable parties understand and participate in the proceedings. I am reminded of the words of Hallett LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">R v Lubemba</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/crim/2014/2064" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCA Crim 2064" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCA Crim 2064</ref> at [45] &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Advocates must adapt to the witness, not the other way round&#8221;</span>. A critical aspect of this is for cross-examination to be in short focused questions without long and complicated preambles and the use of complex language. Equally, it is for the lawyers to explain the process to their clients outside court, in language that they are likely to understand. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, it is the role of the judge to consider whether the appointment of an intermediary is justified. It may often be the case that all the parties support the appointment, because it will make the hearing easier, but that is not the test the judge needs to apply. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Applying this analysis of the law on the appointment of intermediaries to the facts of the case, I accept that the appointment of a deaf intermediary for M in this case is necessary for the entirety of the hearing. The M&#8217;s communication issues here are profound, both because of her deafness, but also the further issues highlighted by Dr O&#8217;Rourke.  These issues go well beyond the fact that she is profoundly deaf and encompass wider communication difficulties. It also appears that there is a particular problem with the use of a hearing intermediary for a person who is deaf, given the very specific interpretation issues involved with British Sign Language.</p>

In most cases, I would take the view that it was the job of M&#8217;s lawyers to ensure that she understood what was happening through explanations at the breaks during the hearing day.  However, I accept that that would be a very onerous, and potentially not possible, on the facts of this case because of the particular issues.</p>
