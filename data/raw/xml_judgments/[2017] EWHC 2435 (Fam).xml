	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am concerned here with three boys, C (aged 13), A (aged 15) and J who will be 18 in December this year.  There are significant jurisdictional consequences to J&#8217;s age which I will address, in some detail, below.  The children are of mixed ethnicity, white and black Caribbean.  The Local Authority&#8217;s involvement with the family began in 2015 and culminated in the issuing of proceedings in October 2015.  On the 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2016 HHJ Tolson QC made Final Care Orders at an Adjourned Issues Resolution Hearing.   The Judge&#8217;s orders did not withstand the scrutiny of the Court of Appeal and on the 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2017 M&#8217;s appeal was allowed.  Though the decision was announced that day, the Judgment was deferred and handed down on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> May 2017.  </p>

The parties' united stance in this appeal demonstrates an objective unease at the lack of fairness in the process. The burden of proof rested on the local authority throughout, not only in relation to establishing the threshold for the making of statutory orders but also that the intervention in the family's life proposed in the care plans was necessary and proportionate.&#8221;</span></p>

In that view he was, in my judgement, entirely correct.  The fact remains however that M and the children are entitled to proper procedural fairness.  At this hearing M has once again challenged the threshold criteria.  Sadly, it has to be said, the very fact of this opposition serves to undermine her own assertion that she has &#8216;moved on&#8217; and &#8216;progressed&#8217; in her understanding of the issues, since the commencement of these proceedings.  </p>

Dr McLean filed a report dated 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2017 and gave evidence before me.  I found him to be measured, reflective and thorough in his approach.   The following observations I found to be particularly helpful:</p>

She did not appear anxious or depressed. Of those people that she was or had been close to, she only spoke in superlatives and seemed incapable of having any mixed feelings or critical thoughts about them. On the other hand, in relation to professionals whom she felt have been critical of her, such as Social Services, she talked in very angry tones. At these times, she could seem paranoid in the sense that she attributed to them malicious motives for their actions. She was quite unable to see that they might have been acting in a professional or caring fashion. These paranoid ideas are not delusional and seemed to be a consequence of her fear of an authority that can act in a way that she sees as being against her interests. When she does not feel threatened in a relationship, she can present as both friendly and warm. These different responses may explain why she has been perceived very differently by her GP and Social Services.&#8221;</span></p>

Two further conclusions need to be recorded from Dr McLean&#8217;s assessment.  Firstly he noted that &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">[M] has a difficulty not only in expressing feelings, but also in managing negative feelings. This is particularly so in the case of loss. There were a number of incidents of loss she related that she had clearly not managed well and in particular, it seems that the loss of her [mother] in 2014 was destabilising for her. She described this event as &#8216;devastating&#8217;, but was unable to talk further&#8230;&#8217;</span></p>

These were, if I may say so, particularly well focused.  I do not need to set them out in full but some require to be highlighted.  Dr McLean considered that M&#8217;s presentation and history &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">would suggest a diagnosis of Asperger&#8217;s Syndrome</span>&#8217;.  This is defined as a developmental disorder that appears in early life which causes social and relational difficulties attributed to underlying deficits in reading, recognising, managing and communicating feelings.  In evidence Dr McLean said that it is generally regarded, diagnostically, as having been absorbed into the broad spectrum of autism at what he termed &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">the higher end&#8217;</span>.  As I understood his evidence, the label given was less important than the underlying features of M&#8217;s personality, which he identified and to which I have referred.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Asperger&#8217;s Syndrome, Dr McLean considered, is not known to respond to any significant degree to any treatment.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> Again, I saw this analysis illustrated in M&#8217;s responses to cross examination.  Clear, short, seemingly unthreatening questions frequently elicited a thoughtful, sometimes insightful reply.  By contrast, overtly challenging questions provoked genuine confusion (at times), hostility and occasionally wild and seemingly paranoid allegations.  More widely, I consider it likely that this explains why M forms functional relationships with some of the professionals and highly dysfunctional ones with others.  Given that the threshold criteria are advanced in the way they are and, to a great extent, have to be, (as criticisms of M&#8217;s parenting) it is perhaps unsurprising that M has been unable to respond constructively to them.</p>

[M] has a little understanding of children&#8217;s physical, behavioural, and educational needs. In practice, however, evidence from the court bundle and the children&#8217;s presentation on reception into care suggest that she was unable to maintain a clean home environment or to promote the children&#8217;s physical self-care such as brushing teeth, keeping clean, or providing themselves with food. For example, on reception into care at the age of 16 [J]</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt"/><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">had no idea how to use money or make his own breakfast. In terms of their behavioural needs she appears to have been unable to set boundaries on them, and in terms of education, though she values this, she was unable to promote their school attendance or the development of relationships with teachers or peers that might promote this. &#8221;</span></p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">&#8220;In addition, M has no understanding of social and emotional development, and therefore is unable to appreciate others&#8217; concerns about her children&#8217;s severe disturbance in these areas. From the beginning, she has been unable to develop her children&#8217;s capacity to identify and regulate their own feelings. When the children were in her care she was unable to help them with their communication difficulties, their difficulties in social relationships and their consequent isolation. All three children assessed for our original report showed very serious deficits in their capacity to think about their own internal states of mind, or to communicate or manage their feelings.&#8221;</span></p>

In short she has difficulty seeing her children as separate and autonomous individuals.  I have noticed congruence in the evidence between the children&#8217;s perceptions of themselves and M&#8217;s own belief structures.  She and they consider themselves (i.e. the boys) to be &#8216;brilliant&#8217; and &#8216;geniuses&#8217;.  Each of the boys has great strengths and talents but the inculcation of this sense of superiority has had a corrosive effect on their capacity to forge relationships.   </p>

In her evidence she described how she had researched this on the internet and come to believe that it presented a significant health risk to herself and her children.  She explained how, in due course, she concluded that the bedroom should not be utilised for sleeping in and so moved the boys into her own room or into the sitting room.  The bedroom later evolved into a store room and its chaotic nature, she reasoned, led to the &#8216;unfair&#8217; allegations made against her of untidy, chaotic and unclean living conditions, which remain within the Schedule, set out above.  I relate this in some detail because I believe it helps in understanding M&#8217;s thinking and illustrates both why it is not appropriate to identify this case as one of simple neglect and better to understand M&#8217;s enmeshment with her children.  C has also spoken of the &#8216;poor air quality&#8217; in the flat which coincides directly with M&#8217;s view of the impact of the mould.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr McLean considered that M had particular difficulty in managing separation or loss of any kind.  The most significant loss was that of her mother which all agree including, to some extent, M herself, led to a significant diminishment of her capacity to manage from day to day.  Undoubtedly there is deterioration in the care given to the younger boys, particularly following their grandmother&#8217;s death.  This encompasses not merely their school attendance but also medical and dental care.  It is right to say, as Ms Gillman, counsel on behalf of M, has identified, that in the children&#8217;s earlier years there is impressive school attendance and appropriate visits to doctors and dentist.  I agree though with Dr McLean, Ms Sophie Rayner (social worker) and the Guardian that this falling off is not solely due to the loss of M&#8217;s primary support but also rooted in her difficulty in understanding her children&#8217;s emotional and developmental needs as they approach adolescence.</p>

In truth however, she sees school attendance as very dangerous for her children.  She perceives it as a place where they are ridiculed and bullied and from which they must be protected.  Her eldest son N, not subject to these proceedings, continues to live with his M.  He is 21 years old and has only left the flat on one occasion in over 3 months.  M told me that she tried to encourage him to do so but I did not gain the impression that she had much commitment to this.  In common with her sons M has come to regard the flat as a place of refuge and safety.  Within it and precipitating the Local Authority&#8217;s intervention the family had become extremely socially isolated.</p>

Underlying this is the children&#8217;s own level of functioning to which I will turn presently.  C, in consequence of his own autism is highly sensitive to food smells and textures.  J experimented, for a time, with veganism.  All this made it very difficult for M to manage.  The consequences, I find, were unacceptable.  I am satisfied that the children&#8217;s diet was poor and reflected in their low weight.  What is significant however is that this too occurred in consequence of M&#8217;s inability to regulate the physical and emotional needs of her children in consequence of her own developmental difficulties.  </p>

I would wish to highlight this because I sense that it has not always been fully appreciated by some of the professionals, nor properly factored into their understanding of the case.  So many of the concerns the Local Authority has expressed have their root in M&#8217;s distortedly positive view of her children&#8217;s abilities and her own incapacity, partly in consequence of this, efficiently to identify or meet their physical and emotional needs.  I am satisfied that the threshold criteria is met here as particularised in the Local Authority&#8217;s document but I emphasise that these circumstances came about in consequence of the overwhelming challenges faced by a mother with developmental difficulties herself, variously managing four boys, two of whom were on the autistic spectrum and one of whom may also have been.  It seems to me to be crucial here for M, the children and the professionals involved to identify not merely the factual findings but their underlying dynamics.  I do this not to render my findings as to threshold &#8216;less incendiary to the mother&#8217;, to borrow Ms Sprinz&#8217;s phrase but because I consider mother&#8217;s frequently benevolent intentions will have, on some level, been absorbed by the children and will likely have ameliorated the harm they have sustained.</p>

I was reminded in evidence that at the time of the Local Authority&#8217;s intervention C and A were speaking to each other in a language that they had devised.  There was an elaborate and quite rigid structure to their interactions predicated on an achievement and award system.  Achievement of particular tasks enabled time on the computer or an opportunity to pet and stroke the cat.  The extensive chronology prepared by the social services plots an escalation of concern encompassing those matters set out in the Schedule in the months leading up to statutory intervention.  </p>

To my mind, the most significant of these is a note prepared by C himself in the course of the Anna Freud assessment.  On a piece of paper in which he describes &#8216;My previous home&#8217; he records the following, set out in a tight linear format: &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">poor air quality; limited food; limited drink; limited resources; garbage on floor&#8217;.  </span>I have not included the entire list but it is difficult to resist drawing obvious comparisons between this and that compiled by the Local Authority in their threshold criteria document.  The latter was a recently produced document, C&#8217;s document was written on the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2017 (C put a date on the document himself).  I should also record that I do not regard the assertions in C&#8217;s list as conclusive proof of their contents, they require to be evaluated alongside the evidence more generally.  Some of C&#8217;s descriptions reflect his age, functioning and level of maturity but, in my judgement, illustrate his &#8216;feelings&#8217; as opposed to accurate descriptions of fact, nonetheless they reveal a consistent picture.  Thus, included in the descriptions I have set out above are: &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">Mutant horrible creatures; spiders; horrible&#8230;&#8217;.</span></p>

For example he cannot remember anything before the age of seven, and his memory of the events surrounding his leaving the foster home is extremely limited. Everything outside his home was seen as frightening, and he avoided this by staying indoors. He depersonalises most feelings, saying for example, &#8220;it&#8217;s logical to miss someone who has been helpful.&#8221; He is unable to tolerate any feelings of dependence, and denies his need for anybody when asked. His sudden exposure (when removed to a foster placement) to more ordinary family life, in which people attempted to engage him in relationships, was experienced as extremely traumatic, and in this context it is unsurprising that he appeared to suffer an emotional breakdown when he walked out of the placement in a fugue-like state. In emotional terms, [J] is functioning better in his current residential placement, where fewer demands are placed upon him and there is some sensitivity to the severity of his difficulties in relating to the world. While he was in the environment of his home, [J] was able to avoid the realities of preparing for life as an adult. He explicitly lacks any concept of a future in which he functions in the real world. This has implications for his future care, in that if he is confronted with this too quickly he may become more, rather than less, disturbed. [J] must be seen as an extremely vulnerable individual who is seriously disabled in relation to coping with the ordinary demands of everyday life in almost all its aspects.</span></p>

Ms Daum told me that it is driven by what she describes as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">a form of suicidality&#8217;</span> by which she explained she considers J <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;is giving up on the whole idea of having or developing any thing other than a very, very narrow and isolated life&#8217;</span>.

I suspect that the process was almost entirely driven by a determination to secure that which is undoubtedly in J&#8217;s best interests i.e. continued placement at this residential unit.  However, I am convinced that the assessment displays insufficient forensic rigour to justify its conclusion.  Neither do I regard its determination that J lacks capacity as adequately reasoned.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Furthermore, having listened to the evidence from those who undertook the assessment I am far from satisfied that they explained the purpose of the assessment to J.  Indeed I would go further, I do not think they did. One of the key principles of the Mental Capacity Act is that a person should not be treated as unable to make a decision until everything practicable has been done to help the person make their own decision (see s1 (3)).  The code of Practice dedicates an entire chapter to providing guidance and prompt consideration of a range of practical steps which might assist in this objective.  It seems to me to be fundamental to the assessment process that P is informed of the purpose of the assessment.  Mr Cheung insinuated that he had done this but, if he will forgive me for saying so, I did not find him convincing.  In the written assessment there appears, at (5), the following question: <span style="font-style:italic">have you explained</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">the purpose of the assessment to P</span>?  The answer, which I repeat in full, reads &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">Yes&#8217;.  J is aware of the current situation and this topic has been brought up and discussed on many different occasions</span>.&#8217;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There can be no question that assessment of mental capacity is a very recent issue in this case.  It only came to light at all a few weeks ago at the IRH.  Self evidently therefore it could not have been discussed &#8216;on many different occasions&#8217;.  What has been the subject of intensive investigation however is where J should live.  I am very clear that what is being referred to here is the substantive decision rather than the capacity to take it.  J, as I have alluded to earlier, is fiercely and politically resistant to what he considers to be disproportionate state intervention in private life.  This is a consistent preoccupation in his conversation.  As I said in the course of evidence, if it had been properly explained to J that an assessment of his capacity to take decisions as an autonomous adult was being tested I would have expected a voluble and unambiguous response on his part, none is recorded.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It seems to me that a prerequisite to evaluation of a person&#8217;s capacity on any specific issue is at very least that they have explained to them the purpose and extent of the assessment itself.  Here, that did not happen.  In my view, it is probably fatal to any conclusion.  In any event, it, at least, gravely undermines it.  I have very much in  mind <span style="font-weight:bold">PC and Anor v City of York Council [2013] COPLR 409</span> where Peter Jackson J (as he then was) made the following observation: </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Earlier in the proceedings J&#8217;s solicitor, Mr McGovern, considered whether in the light of J&#8217;s age, he was competent to instruct and participate in these proceedings. That was a thorough and detailed assessment which had been carefully planned and sensitively undertaken.  Mr McGovern was clear J did not wish to be directly involved in the proceedings or separately represented.  He considered that even if J had wished to, he found it difficult to give reasons for his views and was &#8216;concrete&#8217; in his thinking.  Ultimately, he considered that despite his chronological age, J was not competent to instruct and that &#8216;integrating him into these proceedings would have &#8230; adverse impact &#8230; on his already fragile state&#8217;.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">What is significant however is that during the course of his assessment Mr McGovern spent sometime considering the question of where J should live.  I emphasise that this assessment was directed entirely towards the issue of competence to instruct and participate in proceedings.  Nonetheless, J&#8217;s observations on the issue I am considering here are interesting.  J said he wanted to return home, not to be with M or N but to the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;home itself&#8217;</span>.  J amplified this, saying he sees being at home as &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">freedom &#8211; not in the sense of being allowed out as he does not wish to go out</span>&#8217;.  He said, &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">at home there is freedom not being homogenised by society&#8217;</span>.  He also observed that education was &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">indoctrination</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">by the State to make people slaves&#8217;</span>.  He considered that being in the unit was &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">like being in a prison&#8217;</span>.  He expanded on this saying &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">not in the physical sense but the emotional</span>&#8217;.  He continued, that he was &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">forced to communicate in a way with people that was not beneficial to him&#8217;</span>.  </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">The proper test for the engagement of s 48 in the first instance is whether there is evidence giving good cause for concern that P may lack capacity in some relevant regard. Once that is raised as a serious possibility, the court then moves on to the second stage to decide what action, if any, it is in P's best interests to take before a final determination of his capacity can be made. Such action can include not only taking immediate safeguarding steps (which may be positive or negative) with regard to P's affairs or life decisions, but it can also include giving directions to enable evidence to resolve the issue of capacity to be obtained quickly. Exactly what direction may be appropriate will depend on the individual facts of the case, the circumstances of P, and the momentousness of the urgent decisions in question, balanced against the principle that P's right to autonomy of decision-making for himself is to be restricted as little as is consistent with his best interests. Thus, where capacity itself is in issue, it may well be the case that the only proper direction in the first place should be as to obtaining appropriate specialist evidence to enable that issue to be reliably determined.&#8221;</span></p>

The case therefore invited a direction appropriate to the circumstances, to enable this issue to be resolved with dispatch, even though the situation might not have been serious enough to justify making any further direction or order with regard to F's living conditions at that stage. .&#8221;</span></p>

It would be entirely disrespectful to J to curtail any aspect of his autonomy on the basis of such unsatisfactory evidence.  I am entirely unclear as to whether J has capacity to decide where he lives or not.  Accordingly, even on an interim basis, the presumption of capacity has not been rebutted.  These are important principles which must never be eclipsed by a paternalistic emphasis on welfare.  To do so, lets in the dangers Lord Reid alluded to in <span style="font-weight:bold">S v McC: W v W</span>(supra).

Often, indeed, the facts of a particular case will exhibit a number of these features. There is, however, in my judgment, a common thread to all this. The inherent jurisdiction can be invoked wherever a vulnerable adult is, or is reasonably believed to be, for some reason deprived of the capacity to make the relevant decision, or disabled from making a free choice, or incapacitated or disabled from giving or expressing a real and genuine consent. The cause may be, but is not for this purpose limited to, mental disorder or mental illness. A vulnerable adult who does not suffer from any kind of mental incapacity may nonetheless be entitled to the protection of the inherent jurisdiction if he is, or is reasonably believed to be, incapacitated from making the relevant decision by reason of such things as constraint, coercion, undue influence or other vitiating factors.&#8221;</span></p>

That principle must apply whether the suggested incapacity is based on mental disorder or some other factor capable of engaging the jurisdiction.

I am clear that he is not.  The question that arises is how he can most effectively be protected with the least intrusive and most proportionate curtailment of his autonomy.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The starting point is that a thorough, MCA compliant assessment of capacity be undertaken immediately.  All agreed in exchanges, that in the circumstances of this case, this should be undertaken by a Consultant Child and Adult Psychiatrist.  This judgment should not be taken as requiring an assessment to be conducted by a psychiatrist in every case of this kind.  Frequently, that will simply not be possible in the time available nor will it always be necessary.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When the report is available, it will be necessary to revisit the question of capacity and therefore jurisdiction.  I am entirely satisfied that the inherent jurisdiction of this Court permits J to be protected whilst these investigations resume.  I have already set out the benefits of J remaining in the unit and have no doubt at all that to do so is in his best interest.  Without revisiting these issues I would emphasise that the primary advantage that the unit offers to J is the opportunity of interacting with other people, precisely that for which he has no appetite and would wish to avoid.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having established jurisdiction, a question then arises as to how to frame the injunctive relief.  The wide scope of this relief was considered in detail in the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-weight:bold">Wookey v Wookey</span><span/><span style="font-weight:bold">[1990]1Fam126</span> and revisited in <span style="font-weight:bold">P v P [1999]2FLR857</span>.  Whilst the relief available will invariably be bespoke, there are some identifiable characteristics to it which cast light on its application.  Injunctive relief is a discretionary remedy, it acts in personam and it is derived from equitable principles.  Furthermore, it may only be granted to those amenable to its jurisdiction and it must be capable of being put into effect.  It follows logically from these general propositions that the injunction must serve a useful purpose and have a real possibility of being enforced in personam.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Central in considering the extent of the relief to be granted is the requirement to identify a balance between the protection of the individual and respect for his liberty.  Thus, the order must reflect the tension between these two competing rights and obligations.  The interference must be the minimum possible and proportionate to the identified objectives.  It should also be for the shortest duration.  It follows that the need for the restriction should be kept in regular review.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Gilman, who has acted on behalf of M, has put her case with great fidelity to her client&#8217;s instructions and with considerable sensitivity.  M, as I have referred to earlier in this judgment, has functional difficulties.  These render her almost uniquely unable to care for her children because she is unable to disentangle her own distorted anxieties from theirs. The effect is to reinforce their instinct to recoil from the world.  It is plain to me, as Miss Gilman has effectively highlighted, that M loves each of her children greatly, even though J struggles to reciprocate the emotion or understand it.  She delights in their dry and ironic humour and though her actions can have adverse consequences, she is highly motivated to protect them from the world.  The threshold criteria pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 31(2)</ref> is met abundantly here, it does not, in this case, connote blame or attract censure.  It is the unfortunate coincidence of the distorted functioning of M and her boys.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As J has emphasised, he is motivated to protect &#8220;freedom of mind&#8221;, always an illusive concept. He is not concerned with freedom of the body. There is no evidence that he feels his physical movements to be restricted in the unit in any way at all.  The identified danger to his welfare development is a return to  M&#8217;s home which, I repeat, has been identified by the experts as a &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">kind of suicide</span>&#8217; for him.  Accordingly, I do not consider the injunction should be drafted in terms which compel him to live in any particular place but I do want to restrain him from living at M&#8217;s home.  This I believe to be the proportionate intervention having regard to the principles I have set out above.  It is to endure only until I reconsider the question of capacity further and inevitably that of jurisdiction too when a detailed capacity assessment has been completed.  </p>
