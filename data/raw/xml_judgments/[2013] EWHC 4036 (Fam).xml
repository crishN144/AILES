I have read a report from her treating psychiatrist.  Her diagnosis is of paranoia and psychosis.  She also abuses drugs.  She is described as challenging, and she can be volatile.   She has had two previous children, both of whom were removed from her very early in their lives.  The elder was removed from her care in 2007 aged three weeks, when mother physically injured that child by causing twisting injuries to his arms and bruising to his chest.  Both those children now live with those children&#8217;s father.

She is undoubtedly incapacitous in some respects, the extent to which is not clear because she has not been assessed.  She is likely to have understanding in a number of respects, particularly those aspects of her own health care and her own wishes and feelings about her child which do not require sophisticated intellectual understanding.</span></p>

He describes how her usually more placid demeanour has become more and more aggressive, hostile, confrontational and oppositional, during the monitoring of her pregnancy.  She has had, until recently, a fairly trouble-free pregnancy and her two previous deliveries were normal.  She has had some internal bleeding.  It is not clear how accurate her description of the severity is of that.  There is a fear there may be problems with the attachment of the baby&#8217;s placenta.  She became very agitated when he needed to examine her and refused to be examined.  She is not currently medicated or accepting her medication, and this cannot take place until after the birth. She showed pressure of speech; she swore, was verbally aggressive and she had what the obstetrician called </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;an outburst&#8221;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> She was threatening.

He believes that the risk to the baby when born would be high if the mother were to be allowed to hold the baby. He also infers that the mother&#8217;s mental health was not as severely effected at the time when her older child was injured since she was not known to mental health services at that time.  </span></p>

However, I perceive that the Official Solicitor, or indeed any legal representative acting on behalf of a party, incapacitous or not, cannot be bound to withhold information which comes to their notice from their client.  And it seems to me that this mother probably has the capacity to understand the nature of this application and that the local authority intends to remove the child from her.  In my view, the only basis upon which a legal representative can agree not to disclose information to their client is if that client consents to that course of action, and in order to obtain such consent the Official Solicitor would have to alert the mother to the nature of these proceedings.  Mr Jones tells me that the authority shares that concern.</span></p>
