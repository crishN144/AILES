Non-disclosure is a bane which strikes at the very integrity of the adjudicative process. Without full disclosure the court cannot render a true certain and just verdict. Indeed, Lord Brandon has stated that without it the Court cannot <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">lawfully</span> exercise its powers (see <span style="font-style:italic">Livesey (formerly Jenkins) v Jenkins</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1985] FLR 813" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1985">[1985] FLR 813</ref>, HL).

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As Thorpe LJ observes the phenomenon of non-disclosure is regrettably commonplace. Its treatment in the authorities stretches back at least to the famous decision of Sachs J in <span style="font-style:italic">J-P C v J-A F</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1955] P 215" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1955">[1955] P 215</ref>. From that case can be identified the origin of the duty of the court to consider drawing adverse inferences where non-disclosure is found. That duty has been reiterated in many subsequent decisions. Sachs J memorably stated:</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">In cases of this kind, where the duty of disclosure comes to lie on a husband; where a husband has &#8211; and his wife has not &#8211; detailed knowledge of his complex affairs; where a husband is fully capable of explaining and has had opportunity to explain, those affairs, and where he seeks to minimise the wife&#8217;s claim, that husband can hardly complain if, when he leaves gaps in the court&#8217;s knowledge, the court does not draw inferences in his favour. On the contrary, when he leaves a gap in such a state that two alternative inferences may be drawn, the court will normally draw the less favourable inference &#8211; &#160;especially where it seems likely that his able legal advisers would have hastened to put forward affirmatively any facts, had they existed, establishing the more favourable alternative.&#160;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There must surely be a sound evidential basis for reaching a conclusion as to the scale of undisclosed assets. The Court should not be led into a knee-jerk reaction that says simply because evasiveness and opacity is demonstrated there is some vast sum salted away.  This is not to say that the Court has to put a precise figure on the scale of the hidden assets, let alone to identify by reference to evidence where they are or what they comprise: see  <span style="font-style:italic">Al-Khatib v Masry </span>at para 89 and <span style="font-style:italic">Ben Hashem v Al Shayif</span>  at para 70.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That said, analysis of the cases shows that the Court always makes a broad (sometimes very broad) estimate, based on admissible evidence, of the scale of the hidden funds. Sometimes there is direct evidence of the existence of the hidden money revealed by documents improperly obtained, and as Thorpe LJ points out in para 36(iv) of <span style="font-style:italic">Lykiardopulo</span>, the ramifications of <span style="font-style:italic">Tchenguiz v Imerman </span> have yet to be worked out. Sometimes the wife is able to give direct evidence of observations made by her or of things said to her by the husband (as happened in <span style="font-style:italic">Lykiardopulo</span>). Sometimes the evidential exercise is based on a host of unexplained payments made by the husband, as the wife sought (unsuccessfully) to argue in <span style="font-style:italic">FZ v SZ and Others (Ancillary Relief: Conduct: Valuations)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] 1 FLR 64" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] 1 FLR 64</ref>. </p>

	    <content>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Ben Hashem v Al Shayif</span> the wife&#8217;s case was that the husband&#8217;s resources were in fact in excess of US$500m and may even have exceeded US$800m, and the Court was invited to find that the husband was worth in excess of &#163;250m. Munby J conducted a detailed lifestyle analysis at paras 68 &#8211; 71 and concluded that &#8220;I am satisfied that the husband is worth many millions &#8211; and significantly more millions than he has been willing to admit &#8211; but nothing in the materials before me justifies a finding that he is worth hundreds of millions&#8221;.</p>

It would be wrong if the more usual consequence of the application of the principle was for the adverse inference to be too conservative with the result that unfairness is in fact visited on the Claimant giving rise to what might be termed a non-discloser&#8217;s dividend. I accept that the court must be astute to avoid this unfairness and that a strong message must be sent out that a non-discloser should not be able to procure a result from his non-disclosure better than that which would be ordered if the truth were told. But the court must be realistic and there must surely be some finding, soundly based on admissible evidence, as to the broad extent of the hidden funds.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have to say that in case of this complexity I am baffled as to why such a course was adopted, although in fairness to District Judge Malik it was devised with the active encouragement of both Counsel. The motive was, at least so far as W was concerned, to try to limit costs, in circumstances where she was funding her own legal fees by borrowing. Written final submissions are one thing, but further extensive documentary disclosure followed by written final submissions thereon are quite another. W had no idea what H might produce. Even allowing for W&#8217;s understandable anxiety about costs I cannot fathom why further days in court were not fixed. In fact, H supplied further clarificatory material which was quite important.</p>

This occupies pages 255 &#8211; 356 of Appeal Bundle C2. I am frankly amazed that everyone seems to have been content that these 101 pages would simply be addressed by counsel in writing. Final submissions on behalf of W were produced on 21 April 2011. These ran to 32 pages.  In para 125 it was stated:</p>

The Judge emailed out a draft judgment on 13 June 2011. A hearing was fixed to consider consequential maters on 20 July 2011. On 17 July 2011 Counsel for W sent in a note suggesting emendations; this included a request that the Court should actually say that it was satisfied that H could pay the arrears (this was absent from the draft, but was included in the final version). </p>

He was represented by his solicitor Mr Wilson. Mr Marsden makes the fair point that at no stage following the advertisement of capitalisation on 21 April did H&#8217;s representatives ever complain that they were being ambushed by this. Moreover, they did not raise complaint about this with the District Judge after receipt of his draft judgment on 13 June 2011, or indeed at the hearing on 20 July 2011. </p>

But over the 9 year period from 2002 to 2011 H had to live, and the evidence showed he and W2 very lived well indeed. Until 2007 he was living in Monaco where, no doubt, he paid astronomical sums in rent. And there would have been heavy travel costs, no doubt. His credit card statements showed high expenditure at smart shops and fine restaurants. So on the evidence before District Judge Malik it would have been far from implausible that a sum of &#163;1.7m would have been entirely spent.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Before we go to the three issues, we must say a few words about the appropriate approach of the court to the issues so far as they are appeals on fact. As Mrs Talbot Rice rightly reminded us, an appellate court is severely handicapped in judging the credibility of oral evidence, even though transcripts are provided, because it has not heard and seen the witnesses giving evidence nor observed their demeanour. She has referred us to statements in <span style="font-style:italic">Benmax v Austin Motor Co Ltd</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1955] 1 All ER 326" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1955">[1955] 1 All ER 326</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1955] AC 370" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1955">[1955] AC 370</ref><span style="font-family:Verdana"/>which made it clear how very difficult it is for an appellate court to interfere with a finding of primary fact founded on the credibility of a witness. Although that case suggests that it may be easier for an appellate court to interfere with an inference drawn from primary facts, that must now be read subject to the cautionary words of Lord Hoffmann in <span style="font-style:italic">Biogen Inc v Medeva plc</span> (1997) 38 BMLR 149 that specific findings of fact are inherently an incomplete statement of the impression made on the trial judge by the primary evidence and that such findings are always surrounded by a penumbra of imprecision as to emphasis, relative weight, minor qualification and nuance. It is accordingly necessary for this court to treat the judge's findings with appropriate respect. It must be very slow indeed to interfere with any such findings. That, however, does not mean that an appeal on fact can never succeed. If this court is convinced that the judge was plainly wrong, then it is its duty to interfere.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My first conclusion is that the decision to invoke the capitalisation provisions in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s31</ref>(7A) and (7B) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref> and to make an award of &#163;675,000 thereunder in the circumstances which I have described was demonstrably wrong in principle and flawed. It is noteworthy that in the principal authority concerning capitalisation, <span style="font-style:italic">Pearce v Pearce </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 2 FLR 1144" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 2 FLR 1144</ref>, CA (which was not cited to the court) both parties had formally applied for capitalisation. It must be elementary that the proposed payer of a capitalisation award should actually receive, with ample notice, an application for that relief. Moreover, the directions of the court and the evidence would need specifically to address the relief sought. All manner of bespoke Duxbury calculations would likely need to be done. The fact that H&#8217;s representatives did not raise a complaint about this change of tack by W after 21 April 2011 does not cure this fundamental defect. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My second conclusion is that procedurally this case went right off the rails. It cannot be right or proper for further important disclosure to come in by post after the oral evidence has been closed and for such material to be addressed merely by written submissions. The fact that both Counsel were actively supportive of this arrangement does not cure the irregularity.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My third conclusion is that the inferences here were neither properly drawn nor reasonable. District Judge Malik did not work his way through the steps I have suggested in para 16 above. Most significantly he at no point attempted even a broad estimation of what he believed H had hidden away in residue. It may be said that tacitly he must have found that H had access to around &#163;2m, of which he was awarding &#163;1m to W. But how do his ten findings lead to that conclusion? In many respects they strike me as either stale or inconsequential and incapable of leading to a tenable finding that H had salted away a vast sum. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the evidence before him there was perhaps &#163;500,000 of equity in W2&#8217;s F property. One must doubt the propriety of attributing that to H without any notice having been given to W2 that such a finding would be sought. And there was about &#163;550,000 recoverable from LMG. If it is said that there was another &#163;1m hidden away somewhere how was that consistent with the known expenditure of the &#163;6.7m proceeds of sale set out by me above and H&#8217;s demonstrated high living since 2002? High expenditure does not necessarily signify hidden reserves. Rather, it may merely indicate the force of habit in circumstances where H genuinely seemed to have believed that the investment in LMG would bring him a splendid return. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">District Judge Malik also failed to address the incongruity of H having vast sums salted away but he and W2 having to borrow &#163;500,000 by way of mortgage on the F property. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I emphasise that I have not reached my conclusions thus far in reliance on any material advanced to me by H that was not before District Judge Malik. However my decision is fortified by the contents of the Barclays letter of 17 November 2011 which I have admitted. The data therein is expressed in my para 39 above and shows that the prospect of any recovery from LMG is bleak indeed.</p>

I do not need to consider the grounds individually for this purpose, although I do formally give permission to appeal those grounds (Nos. 3, 4 and 5) adjourned to me by Parker J.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am empowered to exercise the discretion anew. I have been much tempted to do so as it appears to me to be highly likely that H is right when he says that he has no money at all, and that all that there is the F property owned by W2. However,  as I have stated at para 21 above, I do not doubt that H through a combination of bloody-mindedness and incompetence made a proper investigation of his affairs very difficult. I have therefore decided to direct a retrial. W is entitled to have the discretion exercised anew following a full trial with oral evidence.</p>
