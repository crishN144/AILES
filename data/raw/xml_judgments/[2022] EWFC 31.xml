	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In May 2021, in the course of proceedings before the Court of Appeal (<span style="font-style:italic">Re N (Children)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2021/785" uk:canonical="[2021] EWCA Civ 785" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] EWCA Civ 785</ref>), it became clear that there had been a breach of the Adoption Agencies Regulations 2005 [&#8216;AAR 2005&#8217;] with respect to a decision made by a local authority, acting as an adoption agency, to apply for an order authorising a child&#8217;s placement for adoption. The local authority was Somerset County Council [&#8216;SCC&#8217;]. The breach involved a failure to obtain a report on the child&#8217;s health, or have advice from the agency medical adviser that such a report was unnecessary, as required by AAR 2005, reg 15. In addition the &#8216;child permanence report&#8217; did not include a medical summary written by the agency medical adviser, as required by AAR 2005, r 17(1)(b). Once it was understood that these breaches had occurred it became apparent that, rather than being a one-off, the circumstances in <span style="font-style:italic">Re N</span> were, in fact, indicative of a systemic failure by SCC to adhere to the medical requirements of the AAR 2005 over the course of some years and involving adoption decisions made with respect to many children.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following an extensive internal review, SCC identified some 12 children, who were each the subject of a placement for adoption order made under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/21" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 21</ref> [&#8216;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref>&#8217;], but whose further progress towards full adoption had been placed on hold pending clarification of their position, as a matter of law, because of an acknowledged breach of the medical elements of AAR 2005. SCC applied to the Family Division under Part 18 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 [&#8216;FPR 2010&#8217;] seeking a declaration that &#8216;the placement order made with respect to&#8217; each child &#8216;was lawfully made&#8217;. The application was heard by Mrs Justice Roberts, who, following an extensive judgment handed down on 10 November 2021 [<ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2021/3004" uk:canonical="[2021] EWHC 3004 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] EWHC 3004 (Fam)</ref>], granted the declarations that were sought with respect to ten of the children (two children having been removed from this &#8216;primary cohort&#8217; prior to the hearing due to the failure of their prospective adoptive placement). In addition to the primary cohort, SCC had identified some 200 to 300 other children (&#8216;the wider cohort&#8217;), where similar breaches of the AAR 2005 had occurred, and where the children were either at an earlier stage in the adoption process, prior to the making of a placement order, or had actually been adopted. Again, SCC intended to use the procedure under FPR 2010, Part 18 to seek a declaration from the court concerning the validity either of its internal decisions as to the child&#8217;s suitability for adoption or, where adoption had already occurred, of the relevant adoption order.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Publication of Roberts J&#8217;s judgment had, however, caused other local authorities to review their own position with the result that a number identified the same, or similar, breaches of the medical elements of the AAR 2005. Whilst the prospect of the court, in the person of Roberts J, reviewing individual decisions made in up to 300 SCC cases was itself a daunting one, the idea that this process might now need to be undertaken in courts up and down England and Wales for a large number of children, many of whom will have been in their adoptive homes for some years, led to the case being transferred to me, as President of the Family Division, for further consideration.</p>

The other parties are the Clinical Commissioning Group [&#8216;CCG&#8217;] for Somerset, represented by Mr Damian Garrido QC, the various children&#8217;s guardians who had been appointed in the substantive proceedings relating to the primary cohort, represented by Ms Cleo Perry QC and Ms Elizabeth Willsteed, and CAFCASS Legal acting as an Advocate to the Court, represented by Ms Alev Giz and Mr Jamie Niven-Phillips. At an early directions hearing the court invited the Secretary of State for Education to intervene, and I am most grateful that this invitation has been taken up and that the Secretary of State [&#8216;S of S&#8217;] has been represented by Ms Hannah Slarks. Finally, the court has been assisted by written and oral submissions on behalf of CoramBAAF, by Ms Alexandra Conroy Harris.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By the time of the final hearing before this court on 4 March 2022, it had become clear that many, if not a majority, of local authorities in England had realised that they, too, were likely to have been acting in breach of some aspect of the medical requirements of AAR 2005. The number of children that are potentially affected by this unfortunate situation is therefore likely to be very significant indeed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having considered the matter in the light of the helpful submissions from each party, and noting that there is now a broad consensus as to the way forward, as a matter of law, I have concluded that an application for a declaration as to the validity of existing placement orders or adoption orders is neither appropriate nor required. The outstanding FPR 2010, Part 18 applications for a declaration made by SCC will be dismissed. There is no basis for other local authorities or adoption agencies to issue similar applications with respect to breaches of the medical requirements of AAR 2005 that may have been discovered in cases where placement orders or adoption orders have been made. Where, on the facts of any particular case, a party to the original proceedings is concerned that a breach of the AAR 2005 may go to the validity of a placement order or an adoption order, then the route to challenge that order is by application for permission to appeal out of time. It is, however, difficult to contemplate a case where a health issue is so significant that it may lead to a successful appeal, yet where that issue was not fully known to the court (notwithstanding any breach of the medical requirements of AAR 2005).</p>

It is not, therefore, necessary in this judgment to do more than to focus upon the relevant requirements of the AAR 2005, set within a description of the overall decision making process that leads to a child being put forward by a local authority adoption agency for adoption.</p>

The governing regulations are the Adoption Agencies (Wales) Regulations 2005 (as amended by the Adoption Agencies (Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2020). For present purposes the relevant Welsh regulations (regs 15 and 17) are effectively in like terms to their English counterparts. The court has not heard bespoke submissions as to the position in Wales, but this judgment proceeds on the basis that, with respect to the issues that have been raised, the requirements laid upon a local authority adoption agency are the same in England and in Wales. Without intending any disrespect, reference in this judgment to AAR 2005 is intended to include reference to AA(W)R 2005.</p>

In SCC the primary error has been for the adoption agency to rely upon the Initial Health Assessment, which is a standard report that is completed for all looked after children. It is not a report commissioned by the adoption agency for the purposes of AAR 2005, reg 15. In breach of the regulations, no further advice was sought from the agency medical adviser and that adviser was not required to sign off that a further report was unnecessary. In addition there is concern that the agency medical adviser may not have been validly appointed although there is nothing in the regulatory scheme to require a formal appointments process. In other local authorities, other errors have been reported, for example reliance upon reports prepared by a specialist nurse, rather than a doctor.</p>

The court was told that, where breaches have occurred, this has been due to reports being written by specialist nurses, rather than by a doctor or the agency medical adviser. The statutory guidance, at paragraphs 3.33 to 3.35 stresses the importance of there being a full assessment of the health of each adopter by a doctor. Given the long-term consequences of adoption, the firmness of the wording of this guidance is important with agencies being said to have a &#8216;duty to satisfy themselves that prospective adopters have a reasonable expectation of continuing to enjoy good health&#8217; is both proportionate and fully understandable.</p>

SCC therefore conceded that its applications for declaratory relief with respect to the wider cohort should be dismissed. The court was greatly assisted by the clarity of Ms Slarks&#8217; submissions on behalf of the S of S which, in my view, accurately described the correct position in law. These are not adversarial proceedings between competing parties and, in circumstances where it is conceded that the applications should be dismissed, it is not necessary to take time in summarising the competing submissions of each party.

The case was one where the plaintiff&#8217;s solicitor obtained an attachment against the defendant in default of a pleaded defence, disregarding a court order extending the period for filing the defence, which he considered to be a nullity. The order in question had been intended to give effect to an agreement between the parties, but had mistakenly allowed the defendant longer to file a defence than had been agreed. The Lord Chancellor, Lord Cottenham, set aside the attachment, and stated at pp 342-343: </p>

First, there is a legal duty to obey a court order which has not been set aside: &#8220;it must not be disobeyed&#8221;.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst the need to draw a distinction between an order that is void, and one that is voidable, will arise more frequently in relation to marriage and divorce, the Court of Appeal applied a similar approach in the context of adoption in <span style="font-style:italic">Re F (Infants) (Adoption Order: Validity)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1977] Fam 165" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1977">[1977] Fam 165</ref>. The decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Re F</span> is instructive and plainly relevant to the issue before this court. Adoption orders had been made providing for a husband and wife to adopt two children of the wife&#8217;s former marriage. Under the law at the time, an adoption order could only be made in favour of a married couple (or a single person).  It was subsequently discovered that the applicants&#8217; marriage was void because, at the time of the marriage, the husband was still married to his former wife. The applicant wife obtained a decree of nullity and the couple married again once the husband was free to do so. Their application to the county court for a declaration as to the status of the adoption orders was dismissed. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the adoption orders were good on their face and valid until set aside by a competent court. In the circumstances of the case, the orders were voidable and not void, and the court was not obliged to set them aside. It had not been established that the interests of justice were served by setting them aside and leave to appeal was therefore refused. Giving the judgment of the court, Ormrod LJ, referring to errors of fact as to marital status or, in another case, country of residence said:</p>

Like marriage and divorce, adoption is primarily concerned with an individual&#8217;s status, in terms of his or her legal, familial relationship with others. The policy impetus in favour of setting aside those orders which must be set aside because they are void, for want of jurisdiction, yet preserving those which need not be set aside and are merely voidable, is likely to apply to adoption just as it does with respect to marriage and divorce.</p>

The Court of Appeal condemned the local authority&#8217;s actions in the strongest terms as being &#8216;disgraceful&#8217; and an &#8216;abuse of power&#8217;, and Wall LJ repeatedly indicated that a local authority acting in this way was vulnerable to challenge by judicial review (paragraphs 36, 94, 95 and 102). Nevertheless the court did not entertain any suggestion that the first instance judge&#8217;s dismissal of the father&#8217;s application had been somehow rendered unlawful in consequence of the local authority&#8217;s actions.</p>

Any appeal would be against the decision of a lower court to make the placement order; it is not an appeal against the applicant local authority&#8217;s decision to make the application for that order. For the reasons that I have already explained, the challenge on appeal could not be on the basis that the court&#8217;s order was void as a result of a breach of the AAR 2005 by the local authority.

Before the recorder, the local authority had conceded that there had been &#8216;a serious error&#8217; in the agency&#8217;s decision making process. Nevertheless, the court had proceeded to make placement orders, rather than adjourning the case for the decision to be retaken in accordance with the regulations. As with any appeal, the appeal was against the recorder&#8217;s decision; it was not against the adoption agency&#8217;s decision.</p>

There is a clear distinction between a placement order, or an adoption order, made by a court with its eyes wide open to the fact that there has been a serious breach of the regulations, and, on the other hand, orders that are made where the court is in ignorance of any such breach. In this regard the characterisation of &#8216;first actor&#8217; and &#8216;second actor&#8217; is of relevance.

That presupposes that the court that made the order was in ignorance of this failure at the time that it made its order.  That is an altogether different situation from that contemplated by the Recorder, which was that the court, knowing of procedural difficulties, would nonetheless decide to continue with the proceedings.

Further, it is not authority for the proposition that in every case the court will be compelled to set aside an otherwise valid placement order on the grounds of internal procedural error by the agency.

In contested care proceedings, the expert evidence was unanimous that the probable cause of the fractures was child abuse, rather than brittle bone disease. Care orders and freeing for adoption orders were made on all three children, who were later adopted. Subsequently a fourth child was born to the parents. In care proceedings relating to that child the previous fact-finding conclusion concerning the cause of the 2 year old&#8217;s fractures was reopened. Fresh expert opinion was obtained from a number of experts, who all concluded that, rather than physical abuse, the probable cause of the original fractures was scurvy. The care proceedings were discontinued and the fourth child remained in the parents&#8217; care.

It is far too late at each of two levels. The first is the level at which the interests of the three children fall to be considered: almost four years ago they moved into alternative homes which they were told would be permanent and of which they would be full, legal members; and at that time they ceased even to see the applicants. The second is the level which demands recognition of the vast social importance of not undermining the irrevocability of adoption orders.&#8221;</p>

Wall LJ&#8217;s conclusion at paragraph 148 to the effect that, even if Mr and Mrs Webster had proved that the original fractures were the result of scurvy, rather than physical abuse, and they had therefore suffered a serious injustice with the consequence that they have lost three of their children to adoption, the public policy considerations in favour of maintaining those adoption orders would &#8216;simply make it impossible&#8217; for the court to set the orders aside. Whilst it is important &#8216;never to say &#8220;never&#8221;&#8217;, breach of the medical requirements of AAR 2005 would seem to fall a good deal further down the scale of injustice than an erroneous finding of causing fractures to a 2 year old child and it is extremely difficult to contemplate circumstances where breach of the AAR 2005 by an adoption agency could so impact upon the court&#8217;s subsequent decision on adoption to justify setting validly made adoption orders aside.</p>

The aunt and uncle applied for and were granted an adoption order. Neither parent had given formal consent to adoption, or had been given notice of the court hearing. The child had not lived with the adopters for the required statutory period and notice of intention to adopt had not been given correctly to the local authority. The child was not a party to the adoption application and the applicants were not legally represented. No AAR 2005 medical assessments were provided and the local authority failed to evaluate the merits, and de-merits, of adoption. These and other failures led Theis J to hold that the adoption order had not been lawfully or properly made. In addition all parties, including the aunt and uncle, agreed that the adoption order should be set aside and the child returned to the care of the mother.</p>

Where an adoption has taken place, the established authorities indicate that it will only be in wholly exceptional circumstances that an existing adoption order will be set aside. It is difficult, if not impossible, to contemplate circumstances relating to a child&#8217;s health, which were not known to the court when the adoption order was made, being of sufficient weight to meet that very high test.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;Where the agency is seeking to obtain the parent&#8217;s written consent, the agency should emphasise the importance of health information and the central role it plays in anticipating and providing for the child&#8217;s current and future health needs.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The validity of that statement is obvious. Long-term, indeed life-long, plans are being made when a child is being considered for adoption. It is plainly crucial, both for those doing the planning and, in time, for those who are put forward as adopters, to know what, if any, specific health care needs a child may have now or in the future. The same point is made earlier at paragraph 2.35:</p>

It will be for that court to make directions as to how matters should proceed, but, unless to do so would compromise the final hearing date, it is likely that the court will require the breach to be remedied before the final hearing so that all relevant information can be considered. To do otherwise would risk falling into the error of the recorder in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B</span>. Where a final hearing is imminent, it will be for the allocated judge to determine the way forward. In a case where no party, in particular the parents, is aware of any potential health issue that might conceivably impact upon the determination of the placement order application, it may be that the court will proceed with the final hearing but postpone making any final order pending receipt of the required medical information. I should stress that the decision in each case will be a matter for the individual judge, who will have the welfare of the child, the need to avoid delay and the need for a fair trial process fully in focus.</p>
