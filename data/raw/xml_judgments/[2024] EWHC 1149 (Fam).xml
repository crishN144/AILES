K was born on 24 May 2011, so will be turning 13 this month. Following the parties&#8217; separation in 2019, and until September 2021, K had had regular contact with her father, although precisely how much is in dispute. Until September 2021 it is the case that K had always lived in Lithuania. In September 2021 the mother sent K to stay with her own mother in England, without the father&#8217;s knowledge. In January 2022 the father discovered the mother had also moved to England, in November 2021. On 21 December 2021 the mother applied in the Lithuanian courts for an order for K to live with her, to regulate the father&#8217;s contact and for child maintenance. </span></p>

He also contacted the Central Authority who instructed Wilson LLP to make an application in the UK pursuant to the Hague Convention 1980. On 13 July 2022 the mother made an application to amend her application in the Lithuanian proceedings for permission to relocate with K to England. The father&#8217;s Hague Convention 1980 proceedings in England and Wales were then issued on 18 July 2022, already over 9 months after K&#8217;s arrival here. The matter progressed with statements, a Cafcass report and was listed initially for a final hearing in October 2022. </span></p>

They also set the father&#8217;s contact, and awarded child maintenance. Given this determination the parties agreed to adjourn the final hearing in the Hague proceedings listed here on 10 October 2022. Since then, the proceedings in England have remained stayed while domestic court proceedings continued before the family courts of Lithuania. The father appealed the Lithuanian decision twice, first unsuccessfully to their Court of Appeal, and then finally to the Lithuanian Supreme Court. On 27 November 2023, now more than 2 years after K&#8217;s arrival in England,  that court did partly overturn the decision, determining that whilst K&#8217;s place of residence should stay with the mother, they should nevertheless leave the request to allow the mother to take K to the UK to live there permanently without the consent of the father, as &#8216;unexamined.&#8217; </span></p>

Those proceedings have, inevitably, taken time; these Hague proceedings have been stayed by consent for nearly 18 months, having themselves as explained only been initiated 9 months after K&#8217;s arrival in the UK. A further 2&#189; months after the decision of the Supreme Court, the father on 12 February 2024 restored his application under the Hague Convention to court which came before me on 29 February 2024 for directions. The application proceeded to a PTR on 19 April 2024 and to this final hearing.</span></p>

Such an application would take between 6 and 18 months, or more, to be resolved. The expert suggests that it may be possible that, if no return order is made, the Lithuanian court may transfer jurisdiction to this court under the provisions of the 1996 Hague Convention. Professor George suggests that it is by no means certain that the 1996 Convention would actually permit this. He points out that K is, presumptively, habitually resident in England and Wales now, which would suggest that there is no Art.5 habitual residence jurisdiction in Lithuania. However, Lithuania retains primary jurisdiction as the state of former habitual residence under Art.7. </span></p>

It may therefore come to an end at the conclusion of these proceedings. If this is not right, the only answer to this jurisdictional issue may be for the mother to obtain a further relocation order from the Lithuanian court, which it could now consider in the absence of extant Hague proceedings.

I risk the following few examples of how things may play out at the gateway stage, trusting that they will be taken as just that, examples offered to illustrate possible practical applications of the principles. So, one can envisage a situation, for example, where it is apparent that the child is merely parroting the views of a parent and does not personally object at all; in such a case, a relevant objection will not be established. Sometimes, for instance because of age or stage of development, the child will have nowhere near the sort of understanding that would be looked for before reaching a conclusion that the child has a degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of his or her views. Sometimes, the objection may not be an objection to the right thing. Sometimes, it may not be an objection at all, but rather a wish or a preference.</span></p>

She said that she felt very much that K&#8217;s views were her own. She said that the objections to a return expressed related not just to her mother&#8217;s concerns but also to her own life. Whilst Ms Callaghan was clear that her parents&#8217; poor relationship has had an emotional impact for her, she spoke of K growing and developing important relationships with friends here which she does not want to interrupt. Asked by Ms Rayner whether she would easily adapt to a return she replied that she couldn&#8217;t say. But she was clear that K would be angry with her father if he forced her to return to Lithuania against her will. Ms Callaghan was clear that K has very strong views on the subject, having been in the UK for 2 &#189; years. She doesn&#8217;t keep in contact with her Lithuanian friends any more.</span></p>

He raises a concern that the mother has a problem with alcohol, and cites one concerning incident when in 2023 she was picked up the police evidently heavily intoxicated, from the streets of her home town. That incident has been considered by the local authority, who have accepted that it is an isolated incident, and are not investigating further. The father relies on other pieces of evidence to suggest that there may be more to the mother&#8217;s drinking problem than this, and that it may be chronic, including remarks made by the maternal grandmother. However, as I indicated to Ms Rayner, after 2 appeals, the latest in November last year, the order of the Lithuanian Court remains very clearly that K should live with her mother, about whom that court has no concerns as a carer. Further, there are no welfare concerns expressed about K at present from any other source. In this summary process, and without compelling evidence that the previous welfare determination was wrong, it is not open to me to consider what is an underlying welfare issue. That must await what will almost inevitably be the next round of proceedings after the conclusion of this application. </span></p>

Even though these may be proceedings which were commenced less than 12 months after K&#8217;s arrival in England, the fact of the much longer time that has now elapsed and her assimilation into a settled life in this country are highly relevant factors to consider. The reasons for that delay are less important as the child and her interests have always to be the centre of the exercise.</span></p>

The Convention itself has defined when a child must be returned and when she need not be. Thereafter the weight to be given to Convention considerations and to the interests of the child will vary enormously.

The object of securing a swift return to the country of origin cannot be met. It cannot any longer be assumed that that country is the better forum for the resolution of the parental dispute. So the policy of the Convention would not necessarily point towards a return in such cases, quite apart from the comparative strength of the countervailing factors, which may well, as here, include the child's objections as well as her integration in her new community.</span></p>

The Convention itself contains a simple, sensible and carefully thought out balance between various considerations, all aimed at serving the interests of children by deterring and where appropriate remedying international child abduction.</span></p>

In reaching a decision, the court will consider the weight to be attached to all relevant factors, including: the desirability of a swift restorative return of abducted children; the benefits of decisions about children being made in their home country; comity between member states; deterrence of abduction generally; the reasons why the court has a discretion in the individual case; and considerations relating to the child's welfare.</span></p>

These include her being happy with her life in her present home, where she has her mother, wider family, the beach and sea, a school that she likes, settled friendships, and activities like piano, swimming and gym, against what she perceives as her historically difficult relationship with her father, whom she considers to be uninterested in her life;</span></p>

Both parties acknowledge that, following the Lithuanian Supreme Court decision, there will have to be a fresh determination of the mother&#8217;s application to relocate once these proceedings are concluded. It is difficult to see why any different determination would be arrived at from that already reached and initially confirmed on appeal in 2022/3, unless circumstances changed. The father may hope that a summary return order made now would create such a change. Whilst it would probably create a further difficulty in his relationship with K, as explained above, it is right the fact of such a difficult relationship may serve to complicate the court&#8217;s decision. It is very hard however to see how creating that dilemma for a child still aged 12 could be in her best interests. Effectively, she would be brought back against her firmly expressed and long held objections to a country in which she does not want to live and where she has no recent friendships, to rebuild a relationship with a parent which relationship has been made worse by the very fact of that return;</span></p>

The summary process is designed to enable that to happen. In this case, a return order would do the opposite. It would create a new and unwelcome disruption in K&#8217;s life, and propel her into a limbo which would disrupt her currently settled life for a perhaps temporary but potentially lengthy period. It would not, in all probability, serve the purpose of improving relations with her father, as I am sure that he intends it to.</span></p>
