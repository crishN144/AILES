The right in question is that provided by ECHR Article 8 "(1) Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence."

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">However, Article 8 is a qualified right and it is important to note where it is alleged the breaches occurred. There can be no criticism of the fact that there was an assessment in late 2014. Given the outcome, the letter of the 27 March 2015 was inevitable having regard to the provisions of the criminal law. The sex education was a response wholly consistent with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 1(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>. Whilst there may have been legitimate debate about the necessity for the second course in early 2017, it would not be actionable given the advice tendered to the court and the court's <img src="image23.jpg" style="width:0.48pt;height:0.24pt"/>acceptance of it.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">Before turning to the proposed settlement itself one further observation may be ventured. This case is unusual; indeed thus far it may be unique in being applied to a settled, monogamous and exclusive matTied relationship. In those rare cases where the courts have made declarations of incapacity to consent to sexual relations, they have generally been cases of restraining sexual disinhibition to protect from abuse or <img src="image28.jpg" style="width:0.24pt;height:0.48pt"/>the serious likelihood of abuse. However, logically the question of capacity must <img src="image29.jpg" style="width:96.75pt;height:1.2pt"/>apply also to married relations and the criminal law makes no distinction between <img src="image30.jpg" style="width:3.12pt;height:0.72pt"/>settled relations and sexual disinhibition or indeed between sexual relations within or</p>

Secondly, the Local Authority has agreed to pay CH's costs of the Court of Protection proceedings agreed at &#8364;21,600 (inclusive of VAT). Although that order is outside the scope of this approval, it is relevant to it in that it ensures that no recouping of costs against damages will occur under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2012/10/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2012/10" uk:canonical="2012 c. 10" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012</ref>.</p>

For all his disability, CH is psychologically and emotionally resilient for there is no evidence of any long term impact on him. That <img src="image44.jpg" style="width:1.2pt;height:0.96pt"/> said, the impact at the time must have been profound not only for the loss of sexual relations but for two further matters peculiar to him: first, he would have been unable to understand why what was happening should be so, and secondly, in order as she put it, "not to lead him on", WH understandably and forseeably, withdraw to another bedroom and withheld much physical affection.</p>

It might also involve intrusive enquiries into the nature and quality of the couple's sexual relationship for all that was known was that it was 'normal' and that, so far as CH was concerned, 'it made him happy,' as well as now continuing on as satisfactory basis to the couple as had been the case before. <img src="image46.jpg" style="width:1.2pt;height:0.96pt"/></p>

The Official Solicitor will not continue beyond this stage as litigation friend (in accordance with his established practice) and is content that he should be succeeded by CH's sister, SH, who is content to act. &#8364;10,000 will therefore be paid to this account. I authorise an immediate payment out of &#8364;2000 to allow an ensuite bathroom to be added to CH's matrimonial bedroom. Given the modest sum remaining and the highly responsible attitude demonstrated by SH throughout this matter, I would by no means be averse to the whole sum being paid out to her to use (as she would) for CH's benefit; such a course might well save time and expense all round. This, it should be noted, is merely an expression of view; any order is confined to the sum of E2000.</p>
