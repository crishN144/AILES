	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an appeal against a third party costs order made against Peterborough City Council (the Appellant Local Authority) in ongoing private law proceedings brought by K and L as Applicants, to which the Respondent mother (M), and Respondent fathers (N and P) of the four children concerned were parties, whereby the Judge ordered the Local Authority to pay the &#8220;assessed costs of the Applicants to date and the prospective costs of the Applicants and of the Respondent mother, to be assessed at the conclusion of the private law proceedings.&#8221; The K and L had applied for such an order and M had supported the application. The Judge had given an opportunity to the Appellant Local Authority to make representations in opposition. The Judge heard submissions on 22 December 2021 before handing down a reserved written judgment on 14 January 2022 and then making his order on 28 January 2022. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">K and L are now the First and Second Respondent to this appeal but for ease I shall refer to them as the Applicants. In this judgment I set out a chronology of events and of the proceedings in the Family Court, the reasons the Judge gave for his costs order, the relevant law, the parties&#8217; submissions on appeal, and my decision. The Applicants opposed the appeal and appeared in person. The Children&#8217;s Guardian was represented at the appeal hearing but took a neutral position. Otherwise there was no appearance at the appeal by or on behalf of the other Respondents notwithstanding that on granting permission to appeal, Morgan J gave them an opportunity to make representations. </p>

On 28 May 2021, the three youngest children left M&#8217;s care. There is a factual dispute as to the circumstances, to which I shall return later in this judgment. On 16 June 2021 there was an initial child protection conference and the three younger children were placed on the child protection plan. On 30 June 2021, the child protection plan was varied to reflect the fact that the children were in the care of K and L, with the consent of the parents at that time.</p>

It was instrumental in then securing the removal of the children from the mother&#8217;s care. It knew the mother opposed this move. Whether that removal was to the care of the father or the older sister makes no difference. Whether the local authority believed the removal would be temporary or not makes no difference. This is because the local authority was aware within a short period that the children were with the older sister and it is clear that it wished that position to continue in the long-term and not just temporarily. The local authority at that stage believed the threshold criteria were met, and that it would highly probably be instituting care proceedings. It so informed the court.&#8221;</p>

They had been advised by a social worker to collect the children from their schools on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2021 and take them to their home and had later been advised by a social worker to issue private law proceedings.

Plainly in the ordinary run of cases where the party is pursuing or defending the claim for his own benefit through solicitors acting as such there is not usually any justification for making someone else pay the costs. But there will be cases where either or both these two features are absent. In such cases it will be a matter for judgment and the exercise by the judge of his discretion to decide whether the circumstance relied on are such as to make it just to order some non-party to pay the costs.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;A number of points emerge from that case. First, we think it is clear that all three members of the court assumed that the procedure to be adopted for deciding whether a third party should bear all or part of the costs of the litigation should be summary in nature, in the sense that the judge would make an order based on the evidence given and the facts found at trial, together with his assessment of the behaviour of those involved in the proceedings. Second, in order to justify the adoption of a summary procedure the third party must have had a close connection of some kind with the proceedings. Staughton and Balcombe L.JJ. both emphasised that the court should not make an order for costs against a third party unless it is just and fair that he should be bound by the evidence given at trial and the judge's findings of fact. Whether that is so in any given case will depend on the nature and degree of his connection with the proceedings.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Third, we do not think that the court was seeking to do more than provide an indication of the kind of factors that judges should take into account, as appropriate in the particular cases before them, when asked to make an order of this kind. Factors such as failing to join the person concerned as a party to the proceedings or failing to warn him that an application for costs may be made against him may in some cases weigh heavily against adopting a summary procedure, but each case has to be considered on its own merits in order to ascertain whether the third party will suffer an injustice if he is held bound by the evidence and findings at the trial. Decisions made on applications of this kind since Symphony v Hodgson, to many of which we were referred, only serve to illustrate the wide range of circumstances in which orders for costs have been sought and made against third parties.&#8221;</p>

Delay in proceedings and avoidable costs had been caused directly by serious failings by the non-parties. Nevertheless, Ms Duxbury on behalf of the Local Authority, accepts, I think rightly, that whilst unreasonable conduct in the proceedings, or reprehensible behaviour, by a non-party might often constitute exceptional circumstances justifying a non-party costs order, there were other possible circumstances that might also do so. Lady Hale said so in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S (A Child) (Costs: Care Proceedings)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2015/20" uk:canonical="[2015] UKSC 20" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] UKSC 20</ref> at [30] to [32]. Lady Hale also said that Local Authorities should not be in any worse position than private parties in proceedings in relation to costs just because they may have deeper pockets. I can see no reason why the same principles should not apply to costs orders against non-parties, including Local Authorities.</p>

As a matter of public policy, such a stance by the court would render unreasonable the finely balanced judgments many local authorities have to take both before and during children litigation and undermine the general proposition that an order for costs is unusual in such proceedings. &#8221;</p>

In this case the judge made the order, including for prospective costs, before receiving any evidence at all from the parties and having made no determinations on disputed facts.

He also set out a test for the exercise of his discretion which had three elements &#8211; such orders should only be made in exceptional circumstances; the key consideration was the conduct of the non-party; and not only should that be conduct that &#8220;can be criticised&#8221; but it should also have had an impact on the legal costs of the parties in the case.

I would not expect the judge to have set out the relevant authorities or the legal test in fine detail. Nevertheless, key elements of the test that should have been applied were absent.

However, the Local Authority was likewise entitled to make its decision and it has not been suggested that it was an unlawful decision. The Family Court is not given the power to direct a Local Authority to issue public law proceedings. The Local Authority had complied with the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.37</ref> orders (the second order at least). It had completed its investigations and concluded that it should not apply for a care order or supervision order. It had complied with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/37/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.37(3)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> by giving its reasons for so deciding and informing the court of any service or assistance provided or to be provided for the children and their family, and any other action which they had taken or proposed to take with respect to the children. Hence, it seems to me, the failure of the Local Authority to issue public law proceedings could not properly be regarded, in itself, as reprehensible behaviour or unreasonable conduct within the proceedings, and could not, without more, constitute exceptional circumstances justifying the making of a non-party costs order.</p>

The judge did not make a finding to that effect. However, he did appear to proceed on the basis that he had been encouraged to believe that public law proceedings would be issued. He said that he recalled that at the hearing on 12 August 2021 the local authority, by the team manager, had &#8220;impressed upon me&#8221; that care proceedings were &#8220;highly likely&#8221; to follow. However, as the transcript discloses, the social worker from the Local Authority had told the judge at that hearing that &#8220;private law proceedings are more likely to settle the children&#8217;s future.&#8221; The judge&#8217;s recollection appears therefore to have been awry. In any event, there was no undertaking or guarantee offered by the Local Authority that it would issue public law proceedings and it made clear to the court and the parties that it was engaged in a process of deciding whether or not to do so. Therefore, the possibility of there being no public law proceedings was always evident. It was not open to the judge to proceed on the basis that the Local Authority misled the court as to its intentions in respect of public law proceedings. Indeed, as noted, no such finding was made.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A ground for the judge&#8217;s decision to make non-party costs orders was that the Local Authority had been &#8220;instrumental&#8221; in the removal of the children. It is agreed by all parties that the Local Authority did not remove the children. It would have been unlawful for them to do so without a court order. In what sense could it be said that they were &#8220;instrumental&#8221; in the removal of the children? The judge acknowledged that there were factual disputes about the circumstances on 28 May 2021 which he had not resolved. There was a factual dispute as to whether the Local Authority, through its social worker, encouraged the Applicants to remove the children from the mother&#8217;s care, which the Judge recognised. The Applicants&#8217; case was that a Local Authority social worker had told them to pick up the children from their schools and take them to the Applicants&#8217; home for their protection. The Local Authority disputed that account not least because, it maintained, it had expected N to exercise his parental responsibility to protect the children and to look after the children in his own home. There was also disagreement as to whether the Local Authority had instructed or advised the Applicants to issue private law proceedings. The Judge had received no evidence from the Applicants as to these matters in dispute. The judge said that he had not &#8220;tried&#8221; these disputes but that he considered that that  &#8220;does not matter&#8221; because the Local Authority (i) &#8220;was involved&#8221;; (ii) wished the children to be removed; and (iii) would have instigated proceedings to remove them if necessary. Nevertheless there was no finding that the Local Authority had actively participated in the removal of the children or had actively encouraged the Applicants or N to remove them and then to issue private law proceedings. It might well be, as in many other cases, that the Local Authority was involved in providing support to the family, and that family members, other than the mother, and the Local Authority wanted the same outcome &#8211; for the children to leave their mother&#8217;s care &#8211; but a shared desire does not indicate an active involvement in the children&#8217;s removal. Given that the judge had not received any evidence about the circumstances on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2021, and given that he had expressly said that he had not resolved the dispute as to the facts, he was not entitled to find that the Local Authority was instrumental in the removal of the children from their mother&#8217;s care or, as he put it &#8220;the mother has lost care of her children as a result of local authority &#8211; state &#8211; intervention.&#8221; [17].</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is undoubtedly true that private law proceedings would have been unnecessary and, if issued, could have been discontinued, had the Local Authority decided to issue public law proceedings. Likewise, had the children remained with the mother and the Applicants had not taken the steps they did on 28 May 2021, it may well have been the case that the Local Authority would have issued public law proceedings. However, these are not exceptional circumstances. At any stage when the Local Authority is contemplating issuing public family proceedings there may be a tension between, on the one hand, encouraging and supporting a solution within the family and, on the other, seeking a care order or supervision order. Generally, a &#8220;least interventionist&#8221; approach is encouraged, so that support is given to families to try to avoid public law proceedings. As Mr Martignetti, for the Children&#8217;s Guardian, pointed out, family members in a similar position to K and L may feel that they are better supported, financially and otherwise, when decisions about the welfare of the children are made through public law proceedings. That may well be true in this and many other cases. However, it would be contrary to the whole ethos of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, for the state to intervene in family&#8217;s lives by seeking care orders or supervision orders purely as a mechanism to produce financial advantage (or to avoid financial disadvantage) to family members. The fact that family members and a Local Authority may share the same aims of protecting children from harm does not mean that the Local Authority should issue public law proceedings they consider to be unnecessary, let alone that they should do so in order to provide family members with funding for legal representation. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is true that the Applicants have incurred liabilities for legal expenses and, like the Respondent mother, may well incur legal expenses during the remainder of the private law proceedings. The Applicants have taken these apparently vulnerable children into their care and, it seems, have provided a safe and supportive home for them. Nevertheless, Parliament decides what funding should be available at public expenses for advice and representation in private law proceedings. The fact that the Applicants may be commended for their conduct does not entitle them to such funding. The Applicants referred the court to the decision on financial provision of child costs in legal proceedings <span style="font-style:italic">CK v KM</span> [2010] EWHC 1754 <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] FLR 208" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] FLR 208</ref>, but that case has no application to circumstances in the present case or to non-party costs orders.</p>

However, he failed to consider whether the Local Authority had behaved reprehensibly or was guilty of unreasonable conduct within the proceedings. On scrutinising the grounds that the judge seems to have relied upon to make the non-party costs order, they fall well short of justifying a finding that the Local Authority&#8217;s behaviour was reprehensible or their conduct unreasonable. Nor could the grounds reasonably be regarded as constituting exceptional circumstances justifying the making of such an order. Indeed, although the judge directed himself to consider conduct and that non-party costs orders &#8220;are only made in exceptional circumstances&#8221;, he did not address whether the circumstances he had identified were indeed exceptional.</p>

There must be many cases where the families make arrangements, through the court or otherwise, but for which the children would suffer or would be at risk of suffering from significant harm. The principle of &#8220;least intervention&#8221; would be frequently breached if Local Authorities faced adverse costs orders whenever they did not issue proceedings. Local Authorities, other agencies and the courts would have to deal with many more public law applications.</p>

The Respondent mother sought the return of the children to her care. Presumably, that would also have been the case in public law proceedings. Whilst it is true that the Local Authority&#8217;s decision meant that the case proceeded as a private law application rather than a public law application, the costs impact on the Respondent mother was due to funding arrangements for legal advice and representation which were beyond the control of the Local Authority. The same can be said of the position of the Applicants. This was not a case where the Local Authority had acted in a way to waste costs within the existing proceedings.</p>

It could not have been said to have been just in all the circumstances. It was beyond the parameters of the permissible exercise of his discretion to make the order.</p>

Ms Duxbury accepted that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54/section/51" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.51</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54" uk:canonical="1981 c. 54" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Senior Courts Act 1981</ref> was sufficiently widely drawn to permit a court to make an order in respect of future costs. It is certainly the case that at an interlocutory stage, the court may sometimes order that the costs of a future step in the proceedings, for example, the instruction of an expert witness, be borne by a particular party. However, the prospective costs order in this case was much more far-reaching. The judge could have had no idea what the future costs of the private law proceedings would be &#8211; would proceedings resolve with agreement or be robustly contested and protracted, what expert evidence might be required, how many hearings would be needed? There was no estimate of future costs. The judge&#8217;s view that the Local Authority ought to have acted differently so as to avoid the need for any private law proceedings, clearly led him to order that Local Authority should effectively indemnify the parties in respect of their costs liabilities, in proceedings to which the Local Authority was not a party and over which they would have no influence or control. With respect to the judge, he should have stepped back and considered whether the order was just in all the circumstances. Had he done so he could not reasonably have exercised his discretion to make such a draconian and far-reaching costs order.</p>

The non-party costs order was an impermissible device designed to provide a public source of funding for the parties&#8217; legal costs in private family law proceedings. For those reasons I allow the appeal and set aside the non-party costs order in its entirety.</p>
