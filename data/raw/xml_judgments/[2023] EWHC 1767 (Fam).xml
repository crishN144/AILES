The First Respondent is the Mother and the Second Respondent is the Father. The Local Authority (&#8220;LA&#8221;) allege that the Mother, between March and April 2022, deliberately poisoned C with excessive amounts of salt causing her significant harm. The Mother denies this allegation and suggests that the excessive salt may have been as a consequence of one of the medicines C was prescribed (omeprazole). </p>

The Mother, Father, A and C all slept in one room. The maternal grandmother (&#8220;MGM&#8221;) and the (step) maternal grandfather (&#8220;MGF&#8221;) slept downstairs. The evidence was that C was quite a sickly baby who was slow to feed and became constipated easily. The Mother tried to express breastmilk until late January but found this very hard. </p>

There was no evidence of infection. She was given an MRI scan under general anaesthetic, but this revealed no issues. She was discharged on 31 March.

He said that she did not appear to be dehydrated. A sunken fontanelle was not on its own a good indicator of dehydration. Her weight pattern did not support a finding of dehydration as one would have expected her weight to fall when dehydrated and then to go up when rehydrated. However, there was no evidence of this pattern occurring. Further there was no evidence from hospital of her having gastroenteritis, or severe diarrhoea, which are the normal causes of dehydration in small infants. </p>

This was because he would have expected her sodium levels to fall rapidly once she was fed with uncontaminated milk.  However, on 17 March her level went back up, and on 2 May it plateaued rather than fell. It was not possible to tell precisely what happened because the hospital did not take plasma readings at regular points across the entry, but he thought it highly likely that her sodium level on 2 May had fallen and then risen again when she was given salt. </p>

The only reference to a seizure is the Mother&#8217;s interpretation of what one of the carers said, but D said he had no knowledge of a seizure and in any event it might well have been a misinterpretation of a reaction to reflux. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn to the broader canvas of evidence. There is no evidence that would provide a motivation or explanation for the Mother giving C excessive salt. However, the evidence does show that the Mother was under extreme stress during the early months of C&#8217;s life and was receiving very little support. She was at home with a premature baby who was not feeding well. She had two other young children, one of whom A, was plainly a challenging child. She had very limited support with the Father seemingly rather disengaged both from the Mother but also from the care of the baby. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">All of this was happening in a very crowded household. I appreciate that many families, including often those from South Asian communities, live in extended multi-generational families in small dwellings. However, on any basis, this was a very crowded household which provided minimal support for a mother struggling with a tiny baby and her own mental health. </p>

However, the broad canvas in terms of the family background and the Mother&#8217;s history certainly does not point against the Mother giving C excess salt, whatever the motivation. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Mother was C&#8217;s primary carer, and generally fed her. I accept that in hospital there may have been limited opportunity to give her salt given the staff movements and that the nurses often made up the bottles. However, the incidents seem to have been relatively limited and the evidence does not suggest that it would have been very difficult to slip salt into a feed if the Mother so wished. </p>
