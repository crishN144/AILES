	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As has been made clear in previous judgments, this court is regularly faced with applications under the inherent jurisdiction for declarations authorising the deprivation of liberty of children and young people in circumstances where there is an acute shortage of suitable residential therapeutic placements to meet their needs.  A number of those cases have involved children who have been placed, entirely inappropriately, in hospitals for want of any other placement provision.  Within this context, the court is used to dealing with situations that are sub-optimal for the child and with having to consider the extent to which deprivation of liberty in such sub-optimal situations can be said to be in the subject child&#8217;s best interests, at least for a short period whilst more suitable provision is identified.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Used as this court is to dealing with the plight of vulnerable children and young people caught up in the foregoing circumstances, it is difficult to describe the case that comes before the court this morning as anything other than shocking.  It is all the more so because it concerns a 14 year child, ST, who has been known to the local authority, Manchester City Council, for an extended period and, moreover, a child who <span style="font-style:italic">currently</span> has an allocated social worker.  ST is known to the local authority in the context of her diagnosis of Autistic Spectrum Disorder, moderate learning disability and challenging behaviours which include physical violence and damaging property.  She is, on any estimation, an <span style="font-style:italic">acutely</span> vulnerable child with <span style="font-style:italic">highly</span> complex needs.  ST&#8217;s father appears before the court at this hearing in person and her mother appeared before the court in person this afternoon.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The abject situation that has been allowed to arise in this case is perhaps signposted from the outset by the fact that the application for a declaration under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court authorising the deprivation of ST&#8217;s liberty is made not by the local authority that has allocated a social worker to her, and is charged with safeguarding and promoting her welfare, but rather by the NHS Trust responsible for the hospital ward where ST is currently placed.  The Trust is represented by Ms Lucinda Leeming of counsel.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The abject situation in this case is further highlighted by the fact that, despite her characteristically diligent efforts, senior junior counsel appearing on behalf of Manchester City Council, Ms Jane Walker, has been unable, until the matter returned to court this afternoon, to obtain any coherent instructions as to the actions that have been taken by the local authority in respect of ST to date, on ST&#8217;s precise situation or as to the detail of the placement options available for ST moving forward.  As Mr Jones noted on behalf of ST, in the absence of any concrete information, the mantra of Manchester City Council at this hearing in respect of ST has been &#8220;it is understood that&#8221;.  I note that the allocated social worker is on holiday but it was clear, from the difficulties that Ms Walker laboured under in receiving anything like cogent instructions, that the Team Manager who attended the hearing had, at best, only a superficial understanding of ST&#8217;s case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is important to note that in reciting the background for the purposes of this <span style="font-style:italic">ex tempore</span> judgment at an interim hearing, and notwithstanding the extensive involvement of Manchester City Council in this case, there is a paucity of primary evidence before the court to establish the matters that are set out in the various documents prepared by counsel that are likewise before the court.  However, for the purposes of this interim hearing, I am satisfied that it is appropriate to proceed on the basis of the following account of ST&#8217;s current situation in circumstances where no party has sought substantially to dispute the central aspects of that account.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Prior to her admission to hospital, ST lived with her parents and two younger siblings. Within the context of ST&#8217;s complex needs, her parents found it increasingly difficult to manage her challenging behaviours, which have escalated over recent months. ST&#8217;s episodes of dysregulation at the family home led to her siblings locking themselves in their bedrooms for safety and have had a significant impact on her mother&#8217;s mental health.  It unclear at this point what, if any, response was mounted by Manchester City Council in order to support the family during this period.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is clear however, that Manchester City Council were aware that, in respect of ST&#8217;s education, her behaviour had recently caused her school placement to be terminated by reason of the extent of her challenging behaviours. This notwithstanding the presence of an Education and Health Care Plan (hereafter EHCP) which provided for 6:1 support from staff whilst at school. </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It has also apparently been plain to Manchester City Council in circumstances where, again, ST has an allocated social worker, that in addition to ST&#8217;s violent conduct when dysregulated, she is particularly vulnerable in the community and her absconding behaviour gives rise to grave concerns as to her safety in that context. ST makes regular and determined efforts to run away.  At home ST is reported to have made concerted attempts to find keys, sometimes resorting to using screwdrivers, to try to unlock doors and windows in order to abscond, and running away from her family on walks.  ST is said to lack any road sense or stranger danger and was previously found to have entered a stranger&#8217;s house and was found hiding in the bed.  The amended ECHP notes as follows in this context:</p>
	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;ST is demonstrating escalating behaviours and is struggling to self-regulate. She poses a high risk to her own and others safety. ST can present with complex and extreme behaviour &#8211; despite working with a range of agencies, no clear trigger has been identified. This makes planning to manage her safely very difficult. ST&#8217;s behaviour can change very suddenly without any warning &#8211; there can also be big periods of time with no challenging behaviour. When she does become dysregulated there are not obvious external triggers.&#8221;</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_10">
	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within this context, the parents increasingly struggled to care for ST at home.  This much was clear from the palpable distress of the mother when she sought to address the court on ST&#8217;s current situation.  Whilst it is at present unclear what input the allocated social worker had with respect to the family by way of support, information provided by the Trust indicates that ST is supported in the community by the Clinical Service for Children with Disabilities (CSCD) and her prescribed medication is reviewed through the Children and Adult Mental Health Services (CAMHS) by Dr S, Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist. In the community ST is prescribed Risperidone for her challenging behaviours, which she tolerates well. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within the foregoing context, ST&#8217;s behaviour has led to her family presenting her to hospital on at least one occasion prior to her current admission.  On 21st January 2022, following a previous attempt by the family to present ST to the hospital, Dr S advised that ST should not be admitted to hospital unless there was a medical need as &#8220;there is clear risk of harm to her and others if she is admitted and this is not an appropriate place of safety in a crisis&#8221;.  This is entirely unsurprising given ST&#8217;s level of need and the fact that that level of need could not be met even within a school environment involving 6:1 supervision. Notwithstanding this advice, ST was admitted to hospital on 15 February 2022.  On behalf of the NHS Trust, Ms Leeming submits that whilst the Trust was aware of and understood the advice of Dr S, the refusal by the family to take ST home left the Trust with no choice but to admit her to the ward as a place of safety.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">ST was presented at hospital by her father, who reported an inability to care for her at the family home following an escalation in behaviour. Such had been the extent of ST&#8217;s behaviours that her parents had resorted to locking her in the dining room. ST&#8217;s father was noted to be tearful and refused to return ST to the family home.  Once again, it is at present unclear what support was being offered to the family by Manchester City Council and the allocated social worker at this point of obvious crisis for the family.  In particular, the local authority will no doubt explain in due course why it decided at this point <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> to make an application for an interim care order in the circumstances where there were reasonable grounds for believing that ST was suffering, or was likely to suffer, significant harm and that the harm, or likelihood of harm, was attributable to ST being beyond parental control.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within the foregoing context, in the early hours of the morning of 16 February 2022 ST was admitted to a general paediatric ward as a place of safety. It is important to make clear that ST was admitted to the paediatric ward <span style="font-style:italic">solely</span> as a place of safety.  There was, and is, no psychical or psychiatric need for medical treatment for ST, on a paediatric ward of otherwise.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is plain on the information currently before the court that ST was subject to a deprivation of her liberty from the point of being admitted to hospital, and no party seeks seriously to dispute that proposition.  Indeed, following her admission the local authority employed a private company to provide two security guards and two carers in order to supervise ST on a 4:1 basis.  As I will come to, for reasons that will require further investigation, Manchester City Council engaged this company on a five day rolling contract.    The upshot of that approach is that there has been a high turnover of staff supervising ST, resulting in her waking up to unfamiliar adults and being scared by that change, further adversely impacting on her behaviour and wellbeing. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within the foregoing context, ST has been since her admission under continuous supervision and control and is prevented from leaving the ward, which has a locked door.  The information before the court indicates that if ST were to leave the ward but remain on the premises she would be returned to the ward, if safe to do so. If ST were to leave the premises the relevant authorities would be contacted including the police to ensure ST&#8217;s safe return. The lock has been removed from ST&#8217;s ensuite bathroom door and it must be kept ajar when she is using it, including when going to the toilet. Following her admission to hospital, Dr S has prescribed an increase in the dose of Risperidone as a temporary measure to help ST manage her anxiety in the hospital setting. Until the escalation in behaviour in recent days this medication had been considered effective in reducing ST&#8217;s anxiety. The use of physical and oral chemical restraint has been used as a last resort.  </p>

	  <intro>

Further investigation will be required as to the precise circumstances of each incident but the following represents what is currently recorded.

Within the context of secure accommodation, the local authority and the court must each consider whether the proposed placement would safeguard and promote the child's welfare (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (Secure Accommodation Order)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2019/2025" uk:canonical="[2019] EWCA Civ 2025" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] EWCA Civ 2025</ref>).

Where a local authority or a court is placed in a position of having to approve a placement because it is the only option available it is obvious that these cardinal principles will be at risk of being undermined.  Yet this is the situation that local authorities and courts are forced to grapple with everyday up and down the country by the continuing shortage of appropriate resources and as highlighted repeatedly in the authorities that I have referred to above and more widely by the Children&#8217;s Commissioner for England.&#8221;</p>

The answer is that local authority simply must find him an alternative placement. Y is the subject of an interim care order and therefore a looked after child. Within this context, the local authority has a statutory duty to under Part III of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> to provide accommodation for Y and to safeguard and promote his welfare whilst he is in its care. More widely, and again as made clear by Sir James Munby in <span style="font-style:italic">in Re X (No 3) (A Child)</span> [2017] EWHC 2036 at [36], Arts 2, 3 and 8 of the ECHR impose positive obligations on the State, in the form of both the local authority and the State itself. Art 2 contains a positive obligation on the State to take appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those within its jurisdiction where the authorities know or ought to know of the existence of a real and immediate risk to life. Art 3 enshrines a positive obligation on the State to take steps to prevent treatment that is inhuman or degrading. Art 8 embodies a positive obligation on the State to adopt measures designed to secure respect for private and family life.

That answer is that it is not in Y' best interests to authorise his continued deprivation of liberty on a paediatric ward. The court having discharged its duty, the obligation now falls on other arms of the State to take the steps required consequent upon the courts' decision, having regard to mandatory duties imposed on the State by statute and by the international treaties to which the State is a contracting party.&#8221;</p>

Within this context, I am satisfied that not even the necessity of keeping ST safe in circumstances where no alternative placement is available can justify such authorisation, because it simply cannot be said on the evidence before the court that the placement she is in currently <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> keeping her safe.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Trust itself rightly concedes that ST&#8217;s needs are not being met on the ward.  Within the context of ST&#8217;s particular and acute needs arising out of her Autistic Spectrum Disorder and her learning disability they were never going to be. Her current placement is a general paediatric ward.  It is not equipped to manage the behaviours exhibited by ST and was never designed to do so.  It is not equipped to provide ST with the support she requires nor with the privacy she is entitled to whilst being cared for.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within this context, in due course I will require a detailed explanation from the Trust and the local authority as to why the advice of CAMHS given on 21 January 2022, that that ST should not be admitted to hospital unless there was a medical need as &#8216;there is clear risk of harm to her and others if she is admitted and this is not an appropriate place of safety in a crisis&#8217;, was not followed.  In light of ST&#8217;s diagnosed Autistic Spectrum Disorder and learning disability, that advice was self-evidently correct and redundant of argument.  It does not take expert evidence for the court to understand the adverse impact of the current regime, with its uncertainty, its concentration on physical contact and its location in a loud and unfamiliar environment, on a child who is autistic and learning disabled.  What this must be like for ST is hard to contemplate.  Within this context, the failure of Trust and / or the local authority to follow the advice of CAMHS requires an explanation with a greater level of detail than Ms Leeming has been in a position to provide the court with today.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Further, and as I noted in <span style="font-style:italic">Wigan BC v Y (Refusal to Authorise Deprivation of Liberty)</span>, the fact that the hospital ward is a wholly inappropriate venue for the deprivation of ST&#8217;s liberty forces medical staff to step outside the normal safeguards that are put in place in that environment. ST is being prescribed tranquilising medicine orally for the purposes of chemical restraint.  The hospital takes the view that without this chemical sedation ST&#8217;s behaviour would now be unmanageable.   Whilst it is said that this tranquilising medication is being administered in accordance with internal guidance provided by the relevant internal medication protocol, I remain to be convinced that this is an appropriate course of action without authorisation of the court in circumstances where the purpose of the medication is plainly one of restraint, and hence, arguably, the deprivation of ST&#8217;s liberty.  I likewise remain to be convinced that this is not the position simply because the regime of chemical restraint has been in place for only a short period following a deterioration in ST&#8217;s behaviour.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, beyond the hospital ward providing ST with a place to be accommodated, the evidence before the court identifies not a <span style="font-style:italic">single </span>positive for her flowing from her present circumstances.  There is no evidence that her behaviour is being improved by the current regime, no evidence that her educational needs are being appropriately met and no evidence as that there an exit plan being worked towards to minimise the period of time ST must be subjected to this regime.  Within this context, once again, I cannot see how the court can possibly conclude that the authorisation sought by the Trust can, in any sense, be said to be in ST&#8217;s best interests.</p>

In the circumstances, no party seeks seriously to dispute that her current situation constitutes a breach of her rights under Art 5 of the ECHR.  As I have observed in other cases, judgments given by a court should be sober and measured.  Superlatives should be avoided and it is prudent that a judge carefully police a judgment for the presence of adjectives.  However, in the circumstances of this case, I am satisfied that it is not an exaggeration to say that to grant the relief sought by the Trust in this case would be to <span style="font-style:italic">grossly</span> pervert the application of best interests principle.</p>

This is in addition to the wider obligation on the local authority under the rights secured by the ECHR to take appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those within its jurisdiction where the authorities know or ought to know of the existence of a real and immediate risk to life, to take steps to prevent treatment that is inhuman or degrading and adopt measures designed to secure respect for private and family life.

ST has had an allocated social worker from Manchester City Council for an extended period that encompasses her latest admission to hospital.  Ms Walker urged me not to reach definitive conclusions on the conduct of Manchester City Council until there has been an opportunity for the local authority to provide a more detailed explanation of its conduct in respect of this case.  However, I am satisfied that the information presently before the court allows the court to make certain observations at this stage of the proceedings in circumstances where certain of the omissions of Manchester City Council, and indeed of the NHS Trust, are beyond serious dispute.  Ms Walker likewise suggested that it might be appropriate to delay the publication of this judgment, again until Manchester City Council had had the opportunity to further explain its conduct in this case.  In the same context, Ms Walker was instructed to invite the court to anonymise the identity of the local authority.  I am likewise satisfied that it would not be appropriate to delay publication of this judgment or to anonymise the identity of Manchester City Council in circumstances where, again, the omissions that have caused the court immediate concern cannot be the subject of serious dispute.  Subject to the redaction of the identity of the child and the family and the location of her current placement, (which requires, at least for the time being, the anonymisation of the applicant NHS Trust), it would be entirely wrong in my judgment to keep those matters from the public domain.</p>

On the face of the evidence before the court, neither Manchester City Council or the NHS Trust has taken any steps to seek to bring the matter before the court in a timely manner to seek authorisation for the consequent breach of ST&#8217;s Art 5 rights.  With respect to that omission, it is simply not an answer to say that there have been &#8220;multiple meetings&#8221;.  It is likewise not an answer to say that there is a shortage of suitable placements and that &#8220;searches have been ongoing&#8221;.  The bottom line is that ST has, on the evidence currently available to the court, been deprived of her liberty without authorisation in a manifestly unsuitable placement for over a month prior to 18 March 2022, due to the apparent inaction of Manchester City Council and the NHS Trust.</p>
