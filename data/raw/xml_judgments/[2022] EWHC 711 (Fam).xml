On two occasions previous orders of the court have been set aside as a result of the non-disclosure of the husband (&#8220;H&#8221;). Thus, I am in 2022 conducting a hearing when the parties separated as long ago as August 2009 and were divorced the following year.  </p>

Under the terms of its provision, W received the former matrimonial home (&#163;3.25m) and a lump sum of &#163;4m, with &#163;3m being paid within 3 months and the balance by instalments over 8 years.  With the addition of some small other assets retained by her, she exited the marriage with about &#163;6.6m immediately available and &#163;1m to come.</p>

He retained his shares and director&#8217;s loan account in CBA.  The effect of the agreement, as I am told, was that W received approximately 45% of the disclosed assets (although the arithmetic seems to me to produce a figure closer to 40%) and H received the balance, no doubt his greater portion reflecting the risk/liquidity in the business and, perhaps, I know not, the origin of some of the funds.  These figures exclude the value in the two undisclosed trusts. </p>

As Mr Greene has said, valuation is not an exact science. The differential is just over 10% in the value of these assets and less than 5% of the total resources in 2010 excluding the Trusts' assets. Further, once the loan from the husband's father is taken into account, which it would have to be, the total based on Mr Greene's valuations becomes less than the &#163;6 million figure given by the husband in 2010.</span></p>

In doing so he had to consider the relevance of an indicative conditional offer made by a PLC, called for these purposes FED, in September 2015 in the sum of &#163;82.6m net of debt.

Much may remain uncontentious. It may be possible to isolate the issues to which the misrepresentation or non- disclosure relates and deal only with those. A good example of this is Kingdon v Kingdon <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2010/1251" uk:canonical="[2010] EWCA Civ 1251" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWCA Civ 1251</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] 1 FLR 1409" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] 1 FLR 1409</ref>, where all the disclosed assets had been divided equally between the parties but the husband had concealed some shares which he had later sold at a considerable profit.

The same might apply to non-disclosure by a respondent which was so far-reaching as to have led the court to survey the entire financial landscape on a false basis. What I cannot accept is that the exercise will always have to be conducted again. The exercise certainly has to have been conducted. But it has been conducted; and the nature of the defect generated by the non-disclosure may &#8212; or may not &#8212; require the whole order to be set aside and the whole exercise to be conducted again.</span></p>

In the exercise conducted, ultimately by consent, in 2005, what was the nature of the defect generated by the nondisclosure of the shares? The nature of the defect was the omission of a subparagraph in the part of the order which provided for the wife to receive a lump sum, namely of a subparagraph which provided for an extra, deferred, contingent element of lump sum referable to the shares. There is nothing wrong with the order dated 18 April 2005 save that it requires such an addition. There is no need to dismantle it: the need is to add to it. Indeed, in that in November 2006 the contingency arose, there is no further need to express the provision by way of a formula: the husband's net gain on the shares has been precisely quantified and whatever would have been the appropriate percentage expressed in the formula can be translated into a specific sum.</span></p>

The sale contract provided that FED had an option exercisable in or before January 2021 to buy the residue of the shares for &#163;75m, which would result in H receiving a further &#163;61.3m and the trust its proportionate share.</p>
