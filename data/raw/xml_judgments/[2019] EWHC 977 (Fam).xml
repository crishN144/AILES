They reached heads of agreement but fell out as to how the agreement was to be implemented and in particular how the properties were to be divided between them.  This eventually led to a hearing before District Judge Wilkinson in October 2014.   </p>

The District Judge found that might have the effect of forcing upon the parties the obligation either to sell their respective properties or re-mortgage them at unfavourable rates and so he declined to order that there should be a fixed date (paragraph 14(v)) of his judgment) but at paragraph 15 of his judgment he suggested that the transfers of the properties into the sole name of the parties should be achieved by 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2015, namely some 4 months after the date of his judgment.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">It is the husband&#8217;s case that the order and deed provided only for the transfer of the beneficial interest in the properties and not the legal interest.  Mr Bojarski on behalf of the wife describes this submission as surprising.  He rightly points out that it was no part of the husband&#8217;s case when the wife sought to enforce the order in 2016 and Mr Feehan QC, on behalf of the husband, did not demur when I suggested that this argument had not even been considered by his client until his ingenuity alighted upon it.  That does not of course absolve me from having to properly consider the argument.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Paragraph 9 of the order, set out above, is curiously drafted in the sense that it does not use the conventional words of a transfer of property order.  But it is clear, in my judgment, that its intention was to be a property transfer order. It is to be noted that there was no limitation on the extent of the transfer or suggestion that it was a transfer only of a beneficial interest.  If it was intended to provide only for the transfer of beneficial interest then I would expect it to say so. </p>

The parties on the signing of the deed &#8220;hereby&#8221; as beneficial owners transferred by way of exchange the properties set out in the schedule.  Mr Bojarski is right in saying that the beneficial ownership transferred at the latest on the signing of the deed but indeed very probably on the making of the order.   <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Mountney v Treharne </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2002] FLR 930" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] FLR 930</ref> is clear authority that beneficial interests are transferred at the moment when the order takes effect, namely on its making subject only to the decree absolute.  In this case that would have been 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2015, the confusion only being caused by the date of the deed which appears to have been post-dated.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Feehan seeks to argue that the references in the deed to completion refer to completion of the transfer of the beneficial interest only but I regard that as unsustainable.  Not only was it a point not taken until 2018, which is indicative of the parties&#8217; state of understanding, but it runs plainly in the face of the wording of paragraph 2.1 of the deed where completion is provided to take place significantly after the beneficial interest had already been transferred.  Completion can only refer in that context to completion of the transfer of the legal interest.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I do not consider that the references elsewhere in the deed to completion make any difference to this fundamental point and nor am I impressed with the argument that the timescale for completion of the transfer of so many properties would have been too brief to have made compliance possible.  The difficulty with this argument is that, first, the deed had been in existence for a substantial period of time before the order was made and so that the parties were well able to have put the process under way before the order was made and further that the fact that completion of the transfer of the legal interest might have been delayed does not negate the requirement for it to take place.  It is to be noted, and I will return to it, that the wife did transfer all her legal interest in the properties that were going to the husband, albeit not by 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> November 2015. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">This is brought into further focus by the application made by the wife for enforcement of the order which came before Her Honour Judge Redgrave on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2016.  Paragraph 15 of her judgment recites that the wife had re-mortgaged the properties in which the husband was joint mortgagor and which was agreed should be part of her portfolio, thus securing his release from his obligations under the mortgages, and had affected the transfer into her name of the jointly owned properties.  There was no suggestion from the husband that he was not under a similar liability. </p>

Bearing in mind how long ago the parties separated and reached agreement, including a clean break, this is not in my judgment the de minimis point that the husband suggests. </p>

The husband had by then re-mortgaged, principally to buy himself a new home, and had transferred into his sole name 19 of the properties that he did not previously own outright and which were &#8220;his&#8221;. 2 had been sold. He accepted at the hearing that he was liable to deal with the other 42 properties which remained either in the wife&#8217;s name or in joint names. </p>
