	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is my judgment on the applicant wife's claim for ancillary relief. It was allocated to be heard by a High Court Judge by Deputy District Judge Hodson following a failed FDR on 23 May 2014. The reason given in para 3 of the order for the allocation was "because of the complex nature of the income claim made by the applicant". Having heard the case I would not describe that claim as complex. Rather, I would describe it as speculative, experimental and unfeasible. I consider it to be a product of the great bitterness that the wife feels towards the husband. Her section 25 statement is a most unhappy document and seems to have been written with a pen dipped in vitriol. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The wife is aged 39. The husband is aged 40. They commenced cohabitation in 2002 and were married on 2 March 2007. By then they had had their three children: X, born on 30 June 2003 (aged 11);  Y, born on 8 December 2005 (aged 9); and  Z, born on 25 September 2007 (aged 7). All three children are privately educated. The matrimonial home is in south-west London. They separated on 11 May 2013. The husband has since formed a relationship with another woman, with whom he now lives in rented accommodation. She has a child from a prior relationship and is expecting a baby by the husband.   </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Divorce proceedings were commenced by the wife in August 2013. The financial claim was commenced on 29 September 2013. Decree Nisi was pronounced on 26 November 2013. It has yet to be made absolute. As I have said the FDR was held on 23 May 2014. A PTR was held before Holman J on 17 October 2014. The final hearing commenced before me on 26 November 2014 and lasted two days.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband is a banker. He was working for Bank A when the parties met. In November 2010 he was diagnosed with cancer; the cancer is in remission but he still suffers from after-effects. These subject him to great fatigue. In July 2014 he resigned from Bank A as he found the work there too intense, so he told me. On 6 October 2014 he took employment with Bank B where he is in a global managerial role. This is rather less challenging than Bank A. He told me that it was like moving from Manchester United to a club in the Championship. His principal motive, so he told me, was to secure his existing earned compensation and the continuance of his base salary.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The wife ceased work in May 2003 and since then has devoted herself to the care of the children and the family. The husband accepted that she was a fantastic mother. However, and much to her credit (and in sharp contrast to the rancour in her s25 statement) she does not present in a state of helpless dependence, as is sometimes the case. She has obtained part time work on the desk of a gym in Kensington earning &#163;5,000 per annum<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		  <p class="FootnoteText"> After this judgment was delivered in draft I was told that the wife had lost this job. However, I have no doubt that she could soon find alternative part time work paying the modest annual sum of &#163;5,000.</p>
		</authorialNote>. She is training to qualify as a Pilates instructor. Her hope and belief is that in two years she could offer sessions, perhaps some even in her new home, of two one-to-one sessions at &#163;50 per hour and two group sessions at &#163;30 per hour in each day. If she did this 5 days a week for 40 weeks a year (which I think is reasonable) she would gross &#163;32,000, which after necessary professional expenses and tax would net down to &#163;23,500.</p>

They were not capital assets but part of the appellant's income stream upon which he is taxed at top rate. I can see no principled basis upon which the respondent should be awarded 45% of that as though it were a present capital asset. I would delete this element of the judge's award entirely.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is very difficult to understand why a bonus already earned (and particularly earned (at least in part) during the span of the civil partnership or marriage) but which is deferred and the payment of which is conditional on turning up to work (but not to any other performance related condition) should not form part of the divisible pool.  And it is also difficult to understand why the fact that income tax would be payable on the bonus should influence the decision. After all in <span style="font-style:italic">McFarlane v McFarlane, Parlour v Parlour</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2004/872" uk:canonical="[2004] EWCA Civ 872" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWCA Civ 872</ref> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] Fam 171" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] Fam 171</ref>, CA at para 109 Thorpe LJ himself stated: &#8220;the consequence has been the erosion if not the elimination of the hallowed distinction between capital and income. What people spend is money which is likely to be derived from a variety of sources.&#8221; Perhaps there were aspects to that bonus scheme which are not apparent from the judgments. In my judgment there would have to be special features present before money earned but which is "deferred in collection and conditional on performance" is excluded from the divisible pool. Of course, the features of deferral and conditionality would often justify separate treatment of division of those assets. They would be very apt for <span style="font-style:italic">Wells </span>sharing (see <span style="font-style:italic">Wells v Wells</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2002/476" uk:canonical="[2002] EWCA Civ 476" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] EWCA Civ 476</ref>, CA), for example. The feature of a condition of future work may justify a departure from equal sharing.

Thus in the absence of a power to dissolve a marriage the courts, both common law and Ecclesiastical, enforced that duty by making long term maintenance awards.  Prior to the advent of judicial divorce in 1857 a divorce could only be obtained by a private Act of Parliament. The terms of such an Act would invariably require that the husband make some suitable, albeit moderate, provision for his former wife<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="3">

Obviously this is a very sound rationale and it is for this reason that the factors of duration of marriage and the birth of children are so important. It is hard to see how a relationship has generated needs in the case of a short childless marriage, although this is not impossible. But where it can be argued that the relationship has generated hard needs why should meeting them be for longer than, say, the Scottish limit? The answer is best given by Lord Hope at para 118 where he explains why the Scottish limit is so unfair: "the career break which results from concentrating on motherhood and the family in the middle years of their lives comes at a price which in most cases is irrecoverable". For many women the marriage is the defining economic event of their whole lives and the decisions made in it may well reverberate for many years after its ending.</p>

The report recommended at paras 3.88 and 3.89 that the Family Justice Council should prepare guidance as to the meaning of financial needs, which should be addressed primarily to the courts, but which should be produced additionally in a plain English format and made widely available to the public.

How easy is it to enlarge an extendable term? In <span style="font-style:italic">Fleming v Fleming</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2003/1841" uk:canonical="[2003] EWCA Civ 1841" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] EWCA Civ 1841</ref>; [2004] 1FLR 667 at para 12 Thorpe LJ stated that "the exercise of [the] power to extend obligations requires some exceptional justification".

I agree. An application by a payer to discharge and an application by a payee to extend should be decided by reference to the same principles. Charles J points out that "the reasoning behind the earlier order that a party seeks to vary is a relevant circumstance of the case, and therefore on an application to vary it can be assessed whether the purpose of the earlier order has been fulfilled and, if it has, this would be a relevant (and perhaps a decisive) factor in favour of refusing an extension or variation." Therefore, on an extension application an examination would have to be made of whether the implicit premise of the original order of the ability of the payee to achieve independence had been impossible to achieve. Similarly, on a discharge application an examination would have to be made of the assumption that it was just too difficult to predict eventual independence.  This is to state the obvious. However, I believe that if the choice between an extendable term and a joint lives order is finely balanced the statutory steer should militate in favour of the former.</p>

In my judgment, standing back, these are fair amounts and a fair structure. Neither figure reaches the wife's budgetary ambition of &#163;128,328. I am satisfied that she can prune a number of the individual items so that she can live satisfactorily on the lower figure of &#163;75,000 and comfortably on the higher one of &#163;102,000. </p>

His cash-flow position over the seven years, were he to receive no bonus at all, and were he to spend &#163;75,000 per annum, would be that he would have paid off his mortgage in year 5 as the following table shows:</p>

To my mind that is eminently fair. To earn a bonus of &#163;250,000 the husband would have to work exceptionally hard and very successfully; and he should expect to retain a significant part of it for himself. He has to fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds' worth of distance run <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">after this marriage</span> (see <span style="font-style:italic">B v S </span>at para 76).</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment the core spousal maintenance of &#163;30,000 per annum (indexed) should endure for an extendable term which expires when Z is 18, i.e. in 2025, in 11 years time. By then the husband will be 51. On the basis of the evidence I have heard he will have retired by then. By that stage both parties will be looking to their capital to support themselves in the years of retirement. Most people have to accept a reduction in their disposable income in retirement. The wife will have recourse to her retirement fund of &#163;461,684 which will no doubt have grown in the meantime. There will be scope for her to downsize her home and release capital. The husband may or may not have made savings in the meantime. He will have half of the pension and his share of the liquid assets. I am satisfied that both parties should be able to support themselves reasonably in retirement on their capital. However I have made the term extendable in case the wife as the weaker economic party has fallen on hard times which justifies further support from the husband notwithstanding that 12 years will by then have elapsed since the separation. </p>
