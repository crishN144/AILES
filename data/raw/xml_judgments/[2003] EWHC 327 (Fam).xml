The point in common to both applications was that neither of the mothers would agree to provide any form of immunisation for the children who were respectively 10 and 3 years of age.</span></p>

The stress of the situation and the knowledge that she, herself had, as she undoubtedly viewed it, been betrayed, would have undermined her parenting skills as well as her self confidence and self esteem. It is extremely painful for women to face the reality that the natural father of their child or children is no longer committed to them in an affectionate relationship and difficult for them to interpret that the father may, in fact, be committed to the child. Mr P in his discussions with me has pointed out how Norma seemed to have changed from the caring person that he remembered to somebody who is somewhat bitter and lacks warmth.&#8221;</span></p>

The discussion of nits with the school and the fact that such on-going problems have been the reason/excuse Norma B has used in not allowing C to attend school, is all too obvious.&#8221;</span></p>
