	    <p class="NormalWeb">This judgment is being handed down in private on 5 October 2011. It consists of 15 pages and has been signed and dated by the judge. The judge hereby gives leave for it to be reported.</p>

	    <p class="jus" style="margin-left:0.25in">DK (as I shall call him) is 84. Unfortunately, he suffers from dementia, and this judgment is being written on the basis that DK is not able to manage his affairs. He lives in a Nursing Home. LG, who is unrelated to him, and who is the senior partner in a firm of solicitors, is his Deputy for his property and affairs in the Court of Protection (COP). She has acted in that capacity since 15 July 2008.</p>

	    <p class="jus" style="margin-left:0.25in">During the course of looking after his affairs, LG came across a reference to a daughter. She therefore asks the court to decide whether or not it would be in DK's best interests to provide a bodily sample for DNA purposes in order to decide whether or not BJ (as I shall call her) is his daughter. This is the only issue in the proceedings. </p>

That application was not opposed by counsel for LG, and I acceded to it. This judgment explains my reasons for doing so.    </p>

	    <p class="jus" style="margin-left:0.25in">I wish to make it clear at the outset of this judgment that BJ, who is not a party to these proceedings, and who is a married woman in her early fifties with children of her own, is not motivated by any mercenary considerations. She contacted DK prior to the onset of his dementia, but lost touch with him when he became ill. I am entirely satisfied that she wishes to establish that DK is her father so that (1) the fact is established; and (2) so far as is possible, she can maintain a father / daughter relationship with him.  She is, of course, willing to provide a bodily sample for DNA purposes.</p>

	    <p class="jus" style="margin-left:0.25in">For present purposes, these have, in effect, already been stated. One or two matters can, however, be added.  DK is not named on BJ's birth certificate. Her evidence is that her mother and DK had a brief relationship in 1959, as a result of which she was conceived. Her mother is still alive, but does not wish to be involved, and BJ does not wish to upset her. BJ's evidence is that she was brought up to understand that DK was her absent father: indeed, her mother changed her surname by deed poll to K, and when BJ herself married, she gave DK's name as her father on her marriage certificate.  BJ's youngest son also bears the name K as one of his forenames.     </p>

	    <p class="jus" style="margin-left:0.25in">DK has been seen by a consultant in old age psychiatry Dr. C, on a yearly basis since 2003. In October 2007, Dr. C's opinion was that, whilst DK had "significantly impaired intellectual function" and had required an emergency admission to hospital in November 2007,  he nonetheless at that date retained "testamentary capacity" since he was aware of his estate in broad terms and acknowledged that he would like his assets to pass to his family. On 9 February 2011, however, Dr. C assessed DK as unable to decide whether he could give fully informed consent to cooperating with a DNA test.</p>

She added that DK was able furthermore to "retain their implications such that he spontaneously enquired of me how he could &#8211; as he put it &#8211; "make an association with this lady".</p>

However, the Official Solicitor had considerable reservations as to whether it could be said that was necessary that a DNA test be carried out for this purpose: DK, it was clear from Dr. C's evidence, now lacks testamentary capacity, such that it would be possible for a statutory will to be executed. Furthermore, upon an application by LG for the execution of such statutory will, it would be open to the Court to consider that it was in DK's best interests to leave his estate to BJ, whether or not she is his biological daughter.  The evidence suggested that DK did not have close relationships with any other individuals or family members.  </p>

While the genetic information that a DNA test would provide would determine whether BJ was entitled to inherit DK's estate under the intestacy provisions, it was not the sole answer to whether it was in DK's best interests to leave his estate to her.</p>

I recognise that this consideration is essentially a "substituted judgment" for Mrs G. I am also very aware that the test laid down by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> is the test of best interests and not of substituted judgment. However, for the reasons which I have tried to set out earlier, the test of best interests does not exclude respect for what would have been the wishes of Mrs G. A substituted judgment can be subsumed into the consideration of best interests. Accordingly, in this case, respect for what would have been Mrs G's wishes will define what is in her best interests, in the absence of any countervailing factors. There are no such countervailing factors here. I therefore conclude that an order which provides for the continuation of maintenance payments to C is in the best interests of Mrs G."</p>

For the avoidance of doubt, the issues of law canvassed before me were not before Senior Judge Lush, albeit that the Official Solicitor submitted that the decision of Senior Judge Lush was one to which he was entirely entitled to come.</p>

In relation to the latter, the court is both; (a) giving a direction for the taking of a bodily sample; and (b) overriding the otherwise effective and competent consent of the person with care and control of the child. The test to be applied in the latter context is the court's view that the provision of the sample is in the child's best interests.</p>

Having thought anxiously about the matter, I have come to the conclusion that, as a matter of jurisdiction, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/46/section/21/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 21(4)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/46" uk:canonical="1969 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1969 Act</ref> does give the court the power to consent to the taking of a bodily sample from a person lacking capacity notwithstanding the absence of a specific application within the COP proceedings putting the parentage of an individual in issue. </p>
