	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">CX was born in August 2005 and is now 14 years old.  He is part of a loving and tight-knit family group which consists primarily of his mother and two elder sisters.  In 2009, when he was not quite four years old, he was diagnosed with, and successfully treated for, a particular form of lymphatic cancer.  That treatment was successful and he appeared to be in complete remission albeit that he was regularly monitored to ensure that he stayed well and healthy.   </p>

This summer (2019), after experiencing various symptoms, he was taken by his mother to the doctor and referred for various tests.  One of those tests was a biopsy which revealed conclusively that his lymphatic cancer had returned, albeit in a different form, which had progressed to Stage 4.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Since that diagnosis, CX has been treated by a team of consultant paediatric oncologists who have devised an immediate treatment plan which it is hoped will restore him to his previous good health.  The case is made more complex because there are no case reports in the medical literature of a child having these two different forms of lymphatic cancer.  As a result, there are no established treatment pathways, or guidelines / protocols, which those charged with his care can follow.  His treating team has consulted widely both here, in Europe and in the United States of America.   </p>

But for his illness, he leads a full life amongst his family and the close friends he has made at his school.  He will have plans and ambitions as to how he wishes to live his life as he grows into a young man with all the many opportunities which lie ahead.  That neither feels able to provide consent to the full treatment plan speaks much to the strength of the religious convictions which each holds.  Both have said that they will respect the law and any decision reached by the court if it does not accord with their personal religious beliefs. </p>

He decided to confirm the strength of the religious beliefs he had espoused by becoming a baptised Jehovah&#8217;s Witness.  He has taken the time to write me a letter in which he sets out some of his reasons for deciding not to accept blood transfusions as part of his treatment plan.  I do not propose to set out the contents of that personal letter in this judgment but I would wish CX to know that I have read it carefully and have taken all that he has said to me into account in reaching my decision.  What I do regard as important in this context is CX&#8217;s clear statement that this is a decision which he has taken on his own account; he was baptised into his faith after much thought and because he wanted to express his love to his God.  He has made it clear in his letter that, were I to decide to authorise the hospital to carry out the proposed treatment plan including blood transfusions, he would feel angry and upset because I would be forcing upon him something which he did not want.  He has made it clear that he would agree to treatment with blood fractions since that is something which his religion permits.  He queries why the doctors are not prepared to try using blood fractions as an alternative to blood products.  If full blood transfusions are indeed required in order to ensure his survival, he asks that every effort should be made to give him &#8220;as little as possible&#8221;. </p>

It is difficult to be certain, but from our experience of the chemotherapy regimen planned we know that it is very likely that CX&#8217;s blood counts (haemoglobin, platelets and white cells) will be low at certain time points in treatment.  To safely deliver the chemotherapy, we would need to support CX with blood and platelets, if and when needed.  Respecting CX&#8217;s and his family&#8217;s wishes, we will put steps in place to minimise the need for blood product support (sampling minimum amount of blood when sending to the lab, reducing the number of times his blood counts are checked, giving drugs like erythropoietin to stimulate red blood blood cell production and tranexamic acid to reduce mucosal bleeding, setting lower thresholds for transfusion).  While all these steps may reduce the need for blood products, they are unlikely to eliminate it completely. </p>

I have taken his religious views and those of his mother into account as another very important feature of this case.  The tenets of his faith are extremely important to CX, as they are to his mother.  However, they must be balanced against his clearly expressed wish to survive this illness.  He has a mother who loves him dearly and it is difficult to imagine the agony of any mother who must stand by and watch a beloved child suffer as a result of such an illness as this.  However, having listened to the doctors who are caring for him, I am satisfied that this is a situation where any increased suffering which may result from the proposed treatment is likely to lead to a very positive and commensurate benefit.   I am equally satisfied on the basis of the evidence before the court that that ultimate benefit cannot be achieved without the use of full blood products.  The current treatment plan has the unequivocal endorsement of the Guardian and the treating clinicians. All the medical evidence points in one single direction:  without this treatment, it is unlikely that CX will survive.   I have already referred to the strong presumption in favour of taking all steps which are necessary to preserve life.  I do not need in this case to rely on any presumption in relation to this particular patient.  CX himself has given voice to his own human instinct to survive his illness.  He is clearly a courageous individual who has faced his current predicament with both dignity and obvious strength of character.  His doctors are in a position to treat him.  Those very characteristics bode well for optimising the prospects of a successful outcome which will soon see him on the path to recovery.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Thus, notwithstanding my findings in relation to CX&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick </span>competence and his ability to make decisions about many of the aspects of the treatment which is proposed, I have reached a clear conclusion that it is undoubtedly in his best interests to undergo the treatment which has been planned for him.  I accept that to some extent the plan must be flexible and responsive to any clinical presentation which becomes apparent through its course.  I am confident that CX is now in the best medical hands and that whatever support he needs will be provided by those charged with his care.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In the circumstances, I propose to make a declaration that it is both lawful and in CX&#8217;s best interests to receive blood and blood products in the course of the proposed treatment plan.   The applicant is authorised to commence treatment immediately in accordance with whatever final plan has been agreed in the context of a multidisciplinary meeting which I understand was convened late yesterday.  Given the views of both CX and his mother, I am confident that the Trust will consider all alternative forms of management which can be undertaken from time to time by reducing the use of blood products to the lowest level necessary to keep him safe.  In that way, appropriate respect for the views of CX and his mother will be accommodated within the proposed treatment plan.  However, in the event that those responsible for CX conclude that there is no reasonable alternative to the administration of blood and/or blood products, they will be at liberty to administer them without the consent of CX or his mother. </p>
