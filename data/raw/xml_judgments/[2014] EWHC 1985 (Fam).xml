	    <p>This version of a judgment which was delivered in public has been anonymised to protect the child in respect of whom a reporting restriction order (RRO) was sought in relation to a <marker name="tab"/>criminal trial. The judge has given leave for this version to be published. The judge has also given permission for this judgment to be reported, but on condition that any published report ensures the anonymity of the child and her family, although relationships, where given, may be reported. All persons, including representatives of the media, must ensure <marker name="tab"/>strict compliance with these conditions. Failure to do so will be a contempt of court.</p>

It is said that the mother was murdered by the child&#8217;s father, AD.  If that were not tragic enough, the tragedy is compounded by the fact that EI was present when her mother was murdered.  She was taken into police protection and thereafter was placed in foster care where she remains.</span></p>

That application failed because EI did not come within the remit of s.39 of the 1933 Act.  Accordingly, the local authority made an application to me on Tuesday, 6 May for a reporting restrictions order.  Unfortunately - and highly regrettably - the notice of the application was only served on the press and broadcast media via the Copy Direct Service a few hours before the matter came before me.   Accordingly, I adjourned the application to today to enable the press and broadcast media to be represented and/or to make submissions.  I am extremely grateful to Mr. Dodd of the Press Association for attending today and for his full and helpful written submissions.  </span></p>

This is because stories about particular individuals are simply much more attractive to readers than stories about unidentified people. It is just human nature. And this is why, of course, even when reporting major disasters, journalists usually look for a story about how particular individuals are affected. Writing stories which capture the attention of readers is a matter of reporting technique, and the European Court holds that article 10 protects not only the substance of ideas and information but also the form in which they are conveyed &#8230; More succinctly, Lord Hoffmann observed in&#160;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt;color:#000000">Campbell v MGN Ltd&#160;</span><span style="font-size:14pt;color:#000000">[</span><span style="font-size:14pt">2004] 2 AC 457</span><span style="font-size:14pt;color:#000000">, 474, para 59, "judges are not newspaper editors."  &#8230; This is not just a matter of deference to editorial independence. The judges are recognising that editors know best how to present material in a way that will interest the readers of their particular publication and so help them to absorb the information. A requirement to report it in some austere, abstract form, devoid of much of its human interest, could well mean that the report would not be read and the information would not be passed on. Ultimately, such an approach could threaten the viability of newspapers and magazines, which can only inform the public if they attract enough readers and make enough money to survive.</span></p>

Even if I am wrong about that, the risks of further additional harm to EI do not overcome the high hurdle that is required for the granting of a reporting restrictions order.  If one was solely concerned with the welfare best interests of EI it may well be that the court would want to take the course of least harm to EI and, accordingly, would make an order.  That is not the position the court is in.  The court is having to balance the Article 8 rights of EI with the Article 10 rights of the press and broadcast media.  I am not satisfied that the naming of EI and the risks of that to her are so clear or compelling that it justifies placing a restriction upon the press and broadcast media in the manner in which they report the father's trial.   It is submitted on behalf of the local authority that this case is very different from other reported cases because the child was present when her mother was killed.

I endorse his submissions that local authorities, in particular, ought to give very careful thought to alternative means of achieving the aim that they seek when they apply for a reporting restriction order - namely, local authorities should, in future, consider writing to editors of the press and broadcast media, inviting them, for example, not to name a particular child or children in connection with a particular story and setting out clearly, within that letter or e-mail, the reasons in support of such a request.   That, alternatively, could be done by sending a letter or an e-mail to what is now the Press Complaints Commission, which will be replaced by the Independent Press Standards Organisation, who may then be requested to transmit the letter or e-mail more widely to the press and broadcast media.
