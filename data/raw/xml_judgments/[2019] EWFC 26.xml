The letter to the Queen&#8217;s Proctor dated 17 April 2018 which I referred to in <span style="font-style:italic">M v P</span>, para 17, raised five cases for his consideration: one was the case in which I gave judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">M v P</span>; another was what I referred to as &#8216;the Bradford Case&#8217;, which in the event I sent back for final disposal in the Family Court at Bradford; the other three are three of the four which are now before me. They are <span style="font-style:italic">Baron v Baron</span>, SO15D06367, dealt with by the South West Divorce Unit; <span style="font-style:italic">Bird v Bird</span>, SO16D00440, likewise dealt with by the South West Divorce Unit; and <span style="font-style:italic">Checova v Ilyas</span>, BU16D15832, dealt with by the Bury St Edmunds Divorce Unit.

		    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in">I have a great deal of sympathy with Mr Lewis&#8217;s position and that of both his professional client and of his lay client, because as the Queen&#8217;s Proctor, through Mr Holman, has made abundantly clear, there is no suggestion in this particular case of any want of probity on the part of anybody. There is unfortunately, as is submitted by the Queen&#8217;s Proctor, a situation which cannot be put right merely by an order of this court. It cannot render valid a decree which was in fact void by statute and not merely voidable. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in">Mr Lewis argues that although the document is headed amended petition, the addition by the solicitor of the words &#8216;pursuant to MCR12, sub-rule 4&#8217; indicated that he was in fact filing a fresh petition and not merely seeking to file an amended petition. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in">I regret that I am unable to accept that submission. I have sympathy with Mr Lewis, but I regret I cannot accept it. It is clear that unfortunately the position was overlooked that the only petition filed had been filed within 12 months of the celebration of the marriage. The purported amendment made in February 1988 could not constitute a fresh petition. Of course if a fresh petition had been filed at that time, it would not have fallen foul of the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/3/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 3(1)</ref> of the Matrimonial Causes Act of 1973, but that is not the position here. I am satisfied that what occurred was an unfortunate mistake. Nevertheless, no fresh petition was in fact filed.&#8221; </p>

In my judgment, not. I refer to what I said in <span style="font-style:italic">M v P, </span>especially at paras 100 and 103. In my judgment, the decree nisi and decree absolute which followed are not to be treated as nullities; the court&#8217;s administrative error is no ground for setting them aside; with the consequence that the decree absolute made on 14 November 2016 remains valid and in force.

I accept that the inevitable corollary of my order setting aside the decree absolute dated 26 January 2017 is that the petitioner&#8217;s subsequent &#8220;marriage&#8221; is void: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref>(b) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>.

Mr Kumar did not press any application against the Queen&#8217;s Proctor &#8211; who, after all, had succeeded in his application against his client, though very properly was not seeking any order for costs against her &#8211; but submitted that surely, given that his client was the innocent victim of mistakes by the court, she should be able to recover her costs. I can see the force of that point, but so far as I am aware there is in the family justice system no source of central funds such as exists in the criminal justice system. In the circumstances I could only suggest that those instructing him might wish to write to Her Majesty&#8217;s Courts and Tribunals Service.  </p>
