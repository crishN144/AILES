	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">At that point the mother was living in a refuge with C.  On 16 August 2023, the court made an interim care order in favour of the local authority.  That order was made as a result of a change in the mother&#8217;s circumstances.  She had been evicted from the refuge due to alleged aggressive behaviour and alcohol misuse, and was in temporary accommodation.  I have read evidence from the specialist domestic abuse service setting out the reasons for that eviction.  I also understand that her recorded behaviour in the refuge coincided with the tragic loss of her sister, who had committed suicide.  That loss is understandably an ongoing focus of pain for the mother, which may, whilst not excusing her later actions, provide some understanding in respect of them.  It is also a feature of the concern held by the local authority that the impact of that loss has not yet been subject to any sort of therapeutic intervention, the mother not yet having undertaken bereavement counselling.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The plan at that stage was for C to remain in the mother&#8217;s care, but due to the increased risk the court found it necessary to make the interim care order along with an exclusion direction to prevent the father from attending at the mother&#8217;s property.  At the same time, a safety plan was produced and agreed by the parents, dated 18 August 2023.  That safety plan made it clear that the concerns were focussed around the mother&#8217;s alcohol use and C being exposed to the volatility of the parental relationship.  The parents agreed that the father would not attend at the mother&#8217;s property.  Contact would be made by 999 if there was an immediate risk to the mother or C.  If the matter was not urgent, then information was to be shared with the police by way of a call on 101.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.98in">&#8220;The local authority worry that M has not been open and honest previously about her relationship with F, which ultimately resulted in the issuing of proceedings and a further non-molestation order being granted during the current care proceedings due to significant concerns around her ability to care for and protect C.  It is evident that M is not forthcoming in sharing information and this has been evident recently when there was information to suggest that F had breached the non-molestation as raised by M&#8217;s mother.  M failed to raise this with the social worker until it was raised with her, and furthermore denying it happened as reported by her mother, but confirmed that C spotted F who was near her home.  M continues to withhold information.  This could impact how the social worker will be able to work effectively with M to support her so that C continues to remain safe living in her care.&#8221;</p>

She was informed by Harbour of F&#8217;s failure to attend group work and does not feel that he will change his behaviour.

If M recognised the seriousness of F&#8217;s behaviour back in January 2023 the local authority would not have issued proceedings in July 2023 as she would have clearly demonstrated that she could be a protective factor and demonstrate an ability to protect.  However, it is evident that the ongoing concerns around her relationship with F and being dishonest with services and him continuing to stay over at her house, due to this, the local authority&#8217;s main concern is that M would invite F back into her home and potentially resume a relationship with him.  This would mean that C is at risk of future harm while there and thereby she is more aware of domestic abuse between her parents.  She would grow up normalising this behaviour and potentially being harmed if she were to intervene.  It is positive that since care proceedings have been issued that M has been able to end the relationship and cease contact with F.  M&#8217;s support through Harbour has been able to increase her knowledge in respect of the impact of domestic abuse and recognising his behaviours.&#8221;</p>

However, the parenting assessment does not say that the mother&#8217;s excessive alcohol misuse has an impact on the day-to-day care that the mother provides to C.

To summarise, it is evident that M can provide a good level of care and parenting to C and we are not seeing a negative impact in C&#8217;s health, education, emotional and behavioural development currently with M as the sole parent and main carer.  The local authority continues to express their worries around M&#8217;s alcohol consumption and her openness and honesty, and that she is not volunteering information that has been asked of her.  There is currently a non-molestation order in place until the end of care proceedings.  M has advised she would like to have an extension of this order to further ensure her safety, and the local authority would be in support of a further non-molestation order being granted.  However, I am mindful that is only useful as a deterrent and for safety if M ensures she reports any breach of the conditions to the police and to the social worker.&#8221;</p>

Without repeating the evidence of that meeting, which I confirm I have read at length, the children's guardian asked C if there was any time that the father had come to the house.  When I refer to &#8220;the house&#8221;, I mean the family home that C shares with her mother.  C told the children's guardian that the father had brought her a present at Christmas.  The father said he would just sleep one time, but she wanted the father to sleep, she said, &#8220;five times&#8221;.  It was clear that C was very conscious that the information that she was providing might get her mother and/or father into trouble.

The allocated worker from We Are With You had told the local authority that although the mother was attending at her appointments, it did not appear to be meaningful engagement in respect of realistically tackling her alcohol issues.  In fact, the allocated worker was reporting that the mother did not see her alcohol consumption as an issue.  Within that statement the local authority advised that it had changed its care plan.&#160; The local authority were now saying that C could not be safe in her mother&#8217;s long-term care.

As foreshadowed at the start of this judgment, there must be (to borrow a phrase from a different context) an intense focus on the type of risk that is involved,&#160;<span style="font-style:italic">how likely</span>&#160;it is to happen, and what the<span style="font-style:italic">&#160;likely consequences</span>&#160;might then be.  Only by carrying out this exercise is it possible to know what weight to give to the risks before setting them alongside other relevant factors.  So, for example, the risk of further physical harm to a child who has been severely injured by a denying parent is likely to be a factor of predominant weight.  By contrast, to borrow from the evidence in this case, where a mother who untruthfully denies drinking goes to a park at night to drink alone, leaving her baby with its grandmother, the court will view that risk with a sense of proportion.</p>

From that judgment then I remind myself that whilst the children's guardian was required to offer advice to the court, in doing so the guardian becomes a witness subject to the same judicial scrutiny as any other witness.  The children's guardian starts with no special advantages in proceedings as compared to other witnesses and the court, in reaching its decision in respect of the welfare of a child, must consider all of the evidence in the case, including but not limited to the evidence of the children's guardian.  </p>

Although there was only evidence of one breach in the plan since November 2022, the social worker told me that she was considering that breach in the context of the history of the case.  She told me that the mother knew clearly what she was not allowed to do under the safety plan, but that has not prevented the father then from attending the property.  She said that the case must be considered alongside the breaches prior to the issue of proceedings, and of C being caught up in the volatile parental relationship over a number of years.  She told me that C would be at continued risk of harm because the mother simply could not be trusted.  She had lied to professionals about the father visiting at Christmas.  She had suggested that C was at best confused and at worse lying about the visit, and the mother had been dishonest with the court.</p>

In essence, the breach of the safety plan over Christmas was a factor which had to be seen in the context of the other worrying issues in this case.  It was that overall consideration which had shifted, or had resulted in a shift in the social worker&#8217;s assessment as to whether the mother could safely care for C.  </p>

A statement was produced from the maternal grandmother during the final hearing, which I allowed to be entered into evidence.  The maternal grandmother was not available for cross-examination.  I have filtered that into that weight that I can attach to that statement.  I do not, as the local authority solicit I should, simply ignore the contents of that statement.  Overall I consider the evidence from the maternal grandmother as an indicator of a wider family member who is willing to provide ongoing support to the mother, including respite care, and who was clearly not aware of the breach in the safety planning over the Christmas period.  She can provide ongoing assistance and support, but I must view that in the context of her being available to do so before which did not prevent a breach in the safety planning because the mother did not tell anyone about it.</p>

The social worker suggests, quite reasonably, that she is presenting that way because of the uncertainty and confusion that has resulted by the mother telling her to keep secrets.  The social worker told me that she is therefore concerned not just about C's physical safety, but also emotional harm which she may be suffering and, in turn, which she may suffer in the future.</p>

I draw the reasonable inference that the mother was referring to the loss of her sister in August 2023.  She told me that she realised that her sympathy for the father had resulted in a situation where the local authority was not asking the court to approve C&#8217;s permanent removal from her care.

But so far as Mr and Mrs C are concerned there is no evidence that I am aware of that any domestic violence between them or any drinking has had an adverse effect on any children who were in their care at the time when it took place.  The reality is that in this country there must be tens of thousands of children who are cared for in homes where there is a degree of domestic violence (now very widely defined) and where parents on occasion drink more than they should.  I am not condoning that for a moment, but the courts are not in the business of social engineering.  The courts are not in the business of providing children with perfect homes.  If we took into care and placed for adoption every child whose parents had had a domestic spat and every child whose parents on occasion had drunk too much then the care system would be overwhelmed and there would not be enough adoptive parents.  So we have to have a degree of realism about prospective carers who come before the courts.&#8221;</p>

Whilst the evidential picture is murky as to when that relationship ended, the worst case scenario is that it has been some nine months since that relationship ended.

Any risk in that sense arises should the parents decide at some future point to re-establish that relationship.

When there are satellite issues of poor mental health and excessive alcohol consumption in respect of a parent, there remains a real risk that even contact between the parents may result in volatility which C may be exposed to.  But that risk only arises if the parents come into contact and, as such, I must consider the identifiable risk in this case that a similar situation arises in the future, as over last Christmas, whereby the mother allows the father into the property or allows some other form of contact to occur which places C at risk.</p>

Both were consistent in respect of the circumstances of his visit and the local authority has not sought to persuade me as to an alternative version.  It is on that basis that I proceed to consider likelihood.  There is no evidence to suggest that since the commencement of the proceedings that a similar breach or exposure has happened on any other occasion.  There is reference to an occasion where the maternal grandmother has informed the local authority about a form of contact as between the mother, the father and C, but the evidence is limited in respect of that incident and, certainly, the local authority have not invited me to make a welfare finding in respect of that incident.</p>

Sometimes the linkage will be obvious, as where the facts proved establish physical harm.  But the linkage may be very much less obvious where the allegation is only that the child is at risk of suffering emotional harm or, as in the present case, at risk of suffering neglect.  In the present case, as we shall see, an important element of the local authority&#8217;s case was that the father &#8216;lacks honesty with professionals&#8217;, &#8216;minimises matters of importance&#8217; and &#8216;is immature and lacks insight of issues of importance&#8217;.  May be.  But how does this feed through into a conclusion that A is at risk of neglect?  The conclusion does not follow naturally from the premise.&#8221;</p>

Although not specifically submitted, the local authority may say that the fact that lies were told, not only to professionals but also the court, is indicative of their willingness to tell lies about it in the future.  But I am not convinced that that is an argument in respect of likelihood insofar as the harm is concerned.  It is a consequence of the breach rather than a cause.  In line with the observations of Sir James Munby, the fact of the dishonesty does not, of itself, increase the risk of exposure to the volatile parental relationship, especially in the circumstances that I have found the breach was taking place.</p>

It is simply not good enough that this mother has put C in a position where she is being told to lie to professionals.  I am satisfied from the description of C&#8217;s presentations thereafter that the impact of the mother&#8217;s actions has been significant on C&#8217;s emotional wellbeing.

If C were in the mother&#8217;s care, it would be because the court had given her the benefit of the doubt within these proceedings and accepted her evidence.

But ultimately, this is a question inextricably linked to the likelihood of the mother and the father exposing C to the volatility of their relationship in the future.  That is a risk which I have already considered and that I have determined that the risk of them doing so is low.  In essence I consider that the risk is low that a future breach will occur, but if it did there is a high risk that C would be exposed to emotional harm.</p>

Children are impacted and affected by parental domestic abuse in different ways, but it is likely that she would normalise that behaviour and that would have a negative, psychological impact upon the way that she views the world.  She would be robbed of the opportunity of having a normal childhood and her development would be marked by her experiences of her parents&#8217; behaviour.  However, given that C may also be exposed to an incident of abuse within the relationship, she may also be exposed to physical harm.  Whilst not minimising that consequence, I make it clear that the physical harm arises as an exposure to the volatility in the parental relationship rather than any physical harm intentionally perpetrated towards C herself by either parent.</p>

I am alive to the fact that unseen emotional and psychological harm can be just as damaging and longstanding, if not more, than physical harm.  It is often said that the scars inside take longer to heal.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I have already determined that the likelihood of the two primary harms that I have identified is low.  Given a breach to the safety plan has taken place during the proceedings, despite various support from professionals and family members, I do not consider that that low risk could be reduced further.  However, the current level of risk can be maintained by the continued use to the safety plan, specifically involving and including the maternal grandmother.  In my view, the maternal grandmother needs to have a good understanding of what the issues and risks are in this case so that in the future she can be vigilant in identifying any issue that might arise.</p>

But, in my view, it does not decrease that level of risk.  </p>

The issue in this case, in my view, is one of risk and the analysis of that risk in circumstances where the majority of the welfare checklist points to C&#8217;s welfare needs being met in the care of the mother.  It is a question firmly of proportionality.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I have considered side-by-side the two alternative options for C.  There are many positives associated with the mother&#8217;s care and the impact of removal of C from that placement would be significant and emotionally damaging.  But this is also a case where the risks have been clearly identified in respect of that ongoing placement.  The strongest positive for removal from the mother&#8217;s care is the illumination of those specific risks that I have identified.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">However, as I look to the analysis that I have undertaken, I am drawn to the inevitable conclusion that removal from the mother&#8217;s care is not a proportionate response to the harm that I have identified, the likelihood of that harm occurring, and the consequences of that harm on C.  In my determination the risk of harm in removing C from her mother&#8217;s care is disproportionate to the risks of the likelihood of consequences of harm were she to remain in the mother&#8217;s care.  It is my view that C&#8217;s welfare needs are best met, despite the risk identified and associated with that placement, in the mother&#8217;s care.</p>
