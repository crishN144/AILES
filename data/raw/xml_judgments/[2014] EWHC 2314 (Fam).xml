	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I&#160;have to determine what is essentially a&#160;case management issue although it has absorbed an inordinate amount of time which has not been factored into the timetabling of this case.  It arises in the context of a&#160;substantive hearing which is ongoing before me in respect of financial claims arising from divorce proceedings between a&#160;husband and wife. Whilst the hearing is being held in private, it is one at which accredited members of the press have been present, as they are fully entitled to be.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue for determination at this point is the extent to which they should be able to report an account of the proceedings as they unfold on a&#160;daily basis and whether there is any restriction on their ability to do so.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In circumstances to which I&#160;shall come, I&#160;have heard much argument about the issue of what I&#160;have referred to during argument as "the default position". In other words, does the court start from the point that because of the confidential and essentially private nature of these proceedings, nothing can be reported unless and until the press have secured the court's permission to make public such aspects of the proceedings as they might wish to publish (the husband's position); or is the starting point one of unrestricted licence to the press to publish whatever they wish, subject only to the court, either of its own motion or on the application of either party, making a&#160;reporting restriction (the wife's position)?</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue arises in the following context.  Mr.&#160;Martin Pointer QC and Mr.&#160;Geoffrey Kingscote represent the wife in these proceedings.  The husband has an equally distinguished legal team in Mr.&#160;Lewis Marks QC and Ms.&#160;Elizabeth Clarke.  When I&#160;received the papers and began my reading in preparation to hear this case, I&#160;had before me a&#160;significant quantity of material relating to the parties' financial position and detailed and lengthy skeleton arguments from counsel instructed on both sides.  Those skeleton arguments descended into considerable detail in relation to the issues arising in these proceedings as they concern computation and distribution.  In particular, the central issues in the case flowed from arguments about whether a&#160;departure from a&#160;starting point of equality of division was justified on the basis of a&#160;special contribution made by one of the parties, unmatched by the other.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I record those issues here because they have been referred to openly in a&#160;recent judgment handed down by the Court&#160;of&#160;Appeal to which I&#160;shall refer shortly.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">What was not before me at that stage was any reference to issues which might flow from the attendance of the press at the hearing and the fact that aspects of the case were by then, to a&#160;significant extent, within the public domain as a&#160;result of its recent journey to the Court&#160;of&#160;Appeal.  It appears that there had already been significant reporting of the case in the national and international media as a&#160;result of the judgment handed down by the Court&#160;of&#160;Appeal on 18th June 2014, just over a&#160;week before this hearing commenced.  </p>

	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">To set the issue in its proper context I&#160;need to say something at this stage about the individual parties who are involved in this litigation.  The husband is Sir&#160;Christopher Hohn; the wife is Jamie&#160;Cooper-Hohn, the mother of this couple's four children born during the course of a marriage which subsisted for 17 years.  I&#160;am going to refer to the parties in this judgment as "husband" and "wife"; I&#160;do so for reasons of convenience only and intend no disrespect to either.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_10">
	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband has enjoyed a&#160;long career as an extremely successful hedge fund manager.  It is information within&#160;the public domain that very considerable wealth built up during the course of this marriage has been channeled by the parties into a&#160;Foundation which is one of the largest private charities in the world.  It is also a&#160;matter of public record that the assets of the Foundation run to several billions of dollars.  The wife, who describes herself as a&#160;"philanthropist", a&#160;description which appears to me to be wholly apt, has been involved from the outset in the operation of the Foundation.  Throughout the course of the subsistence of the marriage it is common ground that she has immersed herself with the husband in the whole ethos of the Foundation and in the identification of the beneficiaries of the substantial grants it has made.</p>
	  </content>

	<paragraph eId="para_11">
	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is accepted by the parties that the underlying assets of the Foundation are not assets available to them in the context of their financial claims arising on divorce, but their personal wealth is none the less significant. As was recorded in the judgment recently handed down by the Court&#160;of&#160;Appeal, they comprise investments in a&#160;fund worth no less than $1.15 billion, corporate management entities valued by the husband at $109 million exclusive of any value to be attached to their trading activity which, on the wife's case, might have made the underlying shares worth between &#163;513 million and &#163;872 million.  Other investments amount to about $30 million.  Pensions account for about $85 million and properties, a&#160;further $36 million.  Thus, in total, the assets available for distribution have a&#160;value of at least $1.3 billion.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_12">
	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As is further recorded in the Court&#160;of&#160;Appeal's judgment, the wife's position is that an application of the modern law post <span style="font-style:italic">White</span><span style="font-weight:bold"/>and <span style="font-style:italic">Miller</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"/><span style="font-style:italic">and McFarlane</span> should lead to a&#160;position where she, as a&#160;claimant wife, can ordinarily expect to receive one half of the resources built up during the marriage.  The husband's position, as set out in open correspondence referred to in the judgment, is that her award should be restricted to 25% of the total assets on the basis of an assertion that the generation of wealth of this magnitude constitutes a&#160;special contribution which justifies a&#160;departure from what might ordinarily be a&#160;starting point of equality.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_13">
	  <num>13.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Neither of these parties has hitherto attracted any particular press attention outside their roles in relation to the Foundation or its related entities although each is, to some extent, a&#160;public figure as a result of their charitable endeavours.  The husband is, of course, widely acknowledged to have achieved remarkable success in his career to date as an investment manager.  It is common ground that neither has up to this point attracted what might be referred to as "celebrity" status in the media world outside those roles. Such press interest as appears now to be current in these proceedings arises, as far as I&#160;can discern, from the very significant extent of the assets (which exceed any case yet to have reached these courts) and/or from the legal principles which fall to be debated in the context of how the assets should be distributed between them at the conclusion of these proceedings.</p>

It runs to 46 paragraphs over 14 substantive pages and it is entitled: "Respondent's Skeleton Argument on Privacy and Publicity Issues".  It was accompanied by a&#160;bundle which originally contained 16 separate authorities (there are now 20) and a&#160;witness statement from the husband which is also dated, and appears to have been signed on, 30th June 2014. That statement, according to paragraph 1, was made for two separate purposes:  (1) to resist any application made by the wife and/or the media for a&#160;public hearing; and (2) to restrict reporting.</p>

In the final paragraph of that statement he records his acceptance of the right of journalists to attend the proceedings and the fact that he had (and has) no wish to exclude them.  He also accepts that the court will want to give a&#160;public judgment in which he and the wife will be identified.  However, he also "invites the court to prevent publication of confidential commercially sensitive material relating to the business of TCI".</p>

They complained about the fact that the husband's witness statement and the skeleton prepared by Mr.&#160;Vassall-Adams, whilst received just before one o'clock that day, had in their view been prepared some time ago and withheld until the first day of the hearing.  They complained about a&#160;failure to comply with the requirements as to notice set out in the 2010 Family Procedure Rules and concluded that the application by the husband would need to be adjourned and served in accordance with the requirements of the Rules with sufficient particularity of the relief sought.</p>

In anticipation that I&#160;could expect an application on behalf of the media for permission to report the case, Mr.&#160;Vassall-Adams' skeleton argument had been sent to me in order that I&#160;might have some advance notice of the principles to be applied.  Mr.&#160;Marks explained in response to Mr.&#160;Pointer's criticism that there was no obligation on the husband's legal time team to make an application for either a&#160;private hearing or for an order restricting publication.  Since Family Proceedings Rule 27.10 created an expectation that a&#160;private hearing was the default position in the absence of a&#160;specific court direction for a&#160;hearing in public, and none has been made in this case, the media would need to apply to court if it wished to report any details over and above the limited matters permitted by statute or as a&#160;matter of law.</p>

Those provisions were underpinned by section 97(2) of the Children&#160;Act 1989 and section 39(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1993 which prevented publication to the public at large, amongst other matters, of any material which was intended or likely to identify the child who was the subject matter of the proceedings or any material identifying his name, address, school or a&#160;photograph of the child.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">But there are also, as it seems to me, important rights protected by Article&#160;6.  There is -- again there is much Strasbourg and domestic jurisprudence, which there is no need for me to recite in detail -- a&#160;well recognised public interest, an interest of the community as a&#160;whole, in promoting the administration of justice, in maintaining the authority of the judiciary and in maintaining the confidence of the public at large in the courts.  And that public interest is protected by Article&#160;6, quite apart from Article 10.  But that interest typically pulls in two different directions.  Viewed from the perspective of the media, and the market in which the media are serving, that public interest is to be promoted and public confidence in the courts is to be maintained by justice being administered in public, or at least in a&#160;manner which&#160;enables its workings to be properly scrutinised, so that (and this is the modern Convention version of the age-old Benthamite principle) the judges and other participants in the process remain visible and amenable to comment and criticism.  This is the argument that the Article 6 points in the direction of openness, specifically in this context in the direction of the media being permitted to remain in court.</p>

It may be that, because of their public profile, they will not merely be exposed to the publication of facts and matters which they prefer to keep private, but also be exposed to comment of the kind which they would rather not be exposed to.

It is my view that, generally speaking, only if the court is prima facie satisfied that the case will result in proof of inequity in some shape or form, should that starting point be departed from.  As the White Paper put it, 'families need to be confident their privacy will be protected' or in the words of Stanley&#160;Burnton LJ, 'Parties to a&#160;matrimonial dispute who bring before the court the facts and documents relating to their financial affairs may, in general, be assured that the confidentiality of that information will be respected'.  The powerful statements referred to by me at paragraph 17 above warning of the danger of anonymisation leading to a curtailment of right to freedom of expression in the reporting of public civil proceedings do not, in my opinion, militate in favour of a&#160;derogation from the core privacy that attaches to the special class of (officially private) case that is a&#160;claim for financial remedy following divorce.  It would be a&#160;strange thing if the court's undoubted power to anonymise its judgment were to be emasculated by an unfettered right to report fully the proceedings leading to the judgment."</p>

Second, there is <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/16-17/61" uk:canonical="1926 (16 &amp; 17 Geo. 5) c. 61" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1926 Act</ref> about which I&#160;probably need to say little more.

The parties anticipated that they would be ventilating these matters in the context of a&#160;private hearing and at no stage in the case management of this matter has anyone applied for a&#160;public hearing, a&#160;point which Mr.&#160;Pointer was keen to stress to me when he addressed me on some of the perceived shortcomings in the husband's second statement.</p>

Mr.&#160;Vassall-Adams took me to a&#160;number of authorities showing the longevity of the principle.  Such is its universal acceptance in these courts that I&#160;do not need to refer to them in this judgment.

In order to achieve compliance with a disclosure by the party under the obligation to do so, the party seeking the disclosure is required by the court only to use that information for the purposes of the proceedings. It is the protection provided by the court in cases of compulsion. Ancillary relief applications are appropriately heard in private in accordance with the 1991 Rules, see above. The public may not, without leave of the court, hear the evidence given in these applications. It would make a nonsense of the use of an implied undertaking if information about the means of a party, in some cases sensitive information, could be made public as soon as the substantive hearing commenced. Information disclosed under the compulsion of ancillary relief proceedings is, in my judgment, protected by the implied undertaking, before, during and after the proceedings are completed."   </p>

The general practice of the Family Division is for judgments in ancillary relief cases not to be published, or if published to be anonymised.

It relates entirely and solely to restrictions on what the parties can do with documents which have been disclosed to them.  </p>

He does not recognise the distinction which arises as a&#160;result of the court's quasi-inquisitorial obligations to conduct a wide ranging an inquiry into all of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> factors so as to reach a fair result.  </p>

That is the basis for his submission that the only sensible and efficient solution to this problem is for there to be a&#160;specific tailored order which sets out the class or category of information which I&#160;am persuaded should not be the subject of press reporting.  That, he says, can be done very simply and if the media wish to challenge the order, they can.  It removes the uncertainty of the abstract manner in which the husband has approached the argument.</p>

He submits that the crucial point, which I&#160;have to consider is whether or not, if the implied undertaking exists, it operates so as to bind the press.  As a&#160;matter of general law the implied undertakings and ancillary relief proceedings prior to the rule change did not and do not bind third parties in the absence of any express contractual arrangements, such as the confidentiality agreement which the husband has secured against the 18 named individuals, to which I&#160;have already referred.  </p>

There was no practical way they could access the documents and they were not present in court to hear the arguments.  He contends that the only way to prevent reporting by the press before the provision of the rules was to make an injunction.  </p>

This exercise involves the balancing exercise required by the engagement of articles 8 and 10.</p>

I&#160;accept also that whilst the principle of open justice remains as relevant in this Division as it does in others, the courts have consistently recognised that financial remedy cases heard in the Family Division involving, as they do, very real and legitimate expectations of privacy and confidentiality for the family, fall into a&#160;special category.</p>

Quite apart from the practical aspects and the inevitability of these proceedings having to be adjourned off part-heard and possibly for a&#160;significant period of time, I&#160;have come to the clear conclusion that the proposition he advances in terms of the &#8220;blanket&#8221; restriction which he seeks is too wide.  </p>

She specifically held that the principles underlying the recognition of the implied undertakings do not of themselves appear to breach the requirement of Article 10, but she confirmed that both in our domestic law and in compliance with the European Convention, there cannot be a&#160;blanket approach.  It is not without significance that in <span style="font-style:italic">Clibbery</span> itself, the appellant had raised a&#160;blanket objection to publication based on the general premise that the case was heard in private and must consequently remain secret.  That proposition was rejected.  Whilst I&#160;accept that those proceedings were not ancillary relief proceedings, and that very different policy considerations apply here, the President did not seek to retreat from the views she had expressed about the need for a&#160;balance to be struck.</p>

I&#160;am also alive to the possibilities that his evidence may well touch on several areas of highly confidential and commercially sensitive information, which might well be damaging not only to his own business affairs but to the commercial interests of other third parties who have not, and will not have, the opportunity to make representations to secure protection for those interests if the media are automatically entitled, as of right, to report the evidence as they hear it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Nevertheless, I&#160;have to balance against those rights the Article 10 rights of the media.  Parliament has decided that it is appropriate to allow them, as of right, to attend hearings of this nature regardless of whether those hearings are conducted in private or in public.  (The recent decision of Holman&#160;J in <span style="font-style:italic">Luckwell v Limata</span> [2014] EWHC502 is just one example of a judge's entitlement to exercise a discretion to sit in public, albeit that the issues central to the decision in that case were very different from the issues which I&#160;am going to be deciding).  The sums involved in this case may exceed to a&#160;very significant extent the sums involved in any previous divorce hearing in these courts, but that alone, in my view, is not what engages the real public interest in these proceedings.  </p>

My conclusion is that the policy considerations which have been unaffected by the rule changes in 2009 represent an entirely justifiable interference in those rights which is entirely proportionate to the issues at stake.  As I&#160;have already said, those Article 10 rights may, in any event, be met in due course by the handing down of an unanonymised judgment.
