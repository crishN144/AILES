	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The wife is aged 51 (she was born in 1973). She is a medical doctor who currently works as a GP. She was patient, pleasant and intelligent in her presentation and appears to have worked hard over many years in her medical practice and as the primary carer to her children. In giving her evidence, she was careful, measured and precise in what she said, and I have no doubt at all that I can regard her as an honest and reliable witness. It was clear to me that she has sometimes over the years found it difficult to deal with the husband&#8217;s behaviour, but I formed the overall impression that she has done her best to cope with it in an empathetic way.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband is aged 49 (he was born in 1975). He was once an occasional painter and decorator but appears not to have worked very much for quite a long time, including during the marriage and the years after and has had a troubled time in a number of ways. He has had fairly limited and intermittent involvement in his children&#8217;s lives, but my overall impression was that they are happy to see him sometimes in a limited way. He appears to have engaged in gambling over the years, although the full extent of it was difficult to assess. Although the information on this was limited, he acknowledged that he had been involved in fraudulent activity resulting in 5 months in prison in 2017. He has plainly had some mental health issues and I have seen a very brief medical report dated 2022 from a GP which records that he has a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">mixed anxiety and depression disorder</span>&#8221; requiring daily Sertraline tablets. He told me that he had attempted to commit suicide on three occasions and that he had gone through a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">nervous breakdown</span>&#8221;. He is currently assessed by the DWP as having &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">limited capacity for work and work-related activity</span>&#8221; as a result of his mental health. From the DWP he receives Universal Credit (which includes all his rental costs) and Personal Independence Payments. In his evidence, he was sometimes confused, sometimes evasive and sometimes inappropriately vehement and I would not regard him as a wholly reliable witness. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties met in the Summer of 2002 and started a relationship in the Summer of 2003. This became a relationship of cohabitation in late 2003 when the husband moved to live with the wife in her flat (which she had owned since February 2002). They married in 2004.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The relationship appears already to have been in difficulties when, in June or July 2011, the wife (pregnant with the second child) discovered that the husband had been using her credit cards to conduct his gambling habit. She regarded this as the &#8216;last straw&#8217; and asked him to leave her flat and indicated that the marriage was over. He duly moved out and they have been apart ever since. The wife told me that the husband, at this time, told her that if she took responsibility for the debts on her credit cards (then standing at about &#163;34,000) he would not seek anything financially from her in the future. Although it was denied by the husband, I preferred the wife&#8217;s evidence that this conversation took place, and I shall discuss below whether this has any legal significance for my present task. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">After these events, the wife decided to re-arrange her accommodation so that she and the children moved into her mother&#8217;s house, swapping homes so that the wife&#8217;s brother moved out into her flat and she and the children took his place at the wife&#8217;s mother&#8217;s address. This was convenient for the wife because her mother helped with child-care while she was at work as the children grew up and she remains there to this day. The brother continues to live in the wife&#8217;s flat. No rent changes hands in any formal way in either arrangement &#8211; they are simple family arrangements.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">For whatever reason, despite their complete separation in 2011, neither husband nor wife issued divorce proceedings until the wife issued her petition in November 2017. Decree Nisi followed in September 2018 and Decree Absolute in November 2018. At the time of the divorce in 2017-2018, there appears to have been no mention of financial remedies proceedings at all. Neither the wife nor the husband have remarried, and they both remain single.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Amongst the directions made by DJ Davies on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2021 was that a report from an SJE PODE should be obtained to advise on the wife&#8217;s pensions, such report to be produced by 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2022. The parties initially instructed a PODE, Mr Clive Weir, who did produce a provisional report, but he was unable to complete a full report, and the pensions issue rather drifted. As the listed final hearing approached it was realised that there was no PODE report and the problem was raised with the court at a hearing on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2022. At this hearing in Edmonton, DJ Hussain adjourned the final hearing, re-fixing it to commence on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2023, and made a fresh direction for an SJE PODE report and directed that Mathiesons Consulting be appointed, to report by 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2023. The provisional report from Mr Weir was directed to be &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">superseded</span>&#8221;.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Unfortunately, Mathiesons Consulting had a very great difficulty in extracting information from the wife&#8217;s main pensions provider, NHS pensions, and they also were unable to produce a PODE report. It has been quite difficult to identify precisely why this happened, but I have no reason to believe that the wife can in any way be blamed for this and it has not been suggested that Mathiesons Consulting were to blame &#8211; fingers have been pointed at NHS Pensions, but (in fairness to them) I have not heard any explanation by them. It may be that there were reasons for the delay, such as the uncertainties created by the McCloud litigation judgments and/or public sector actuarial assumption changes. In any event, nearly a year on, on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2023 in Edmonton, DJ Hussain dealt with an almost identical adjournment application and again granted it and re-fixed the final hearing to commence in the Central Family Court on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2024, with a PTR in Edmonton on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2024.

This reality left the court with rather inadequate information on pensions; but he decided (in my view correctly) that, on balance, the best course was to move forward to the final hearing without a PODE report because it was depressingly clear that the information would not be available in time and it would not be proportionate to adjourn the final hearing for a third time. The court would just have to do its best without that information &#8211; and this is what I propose to do. I would like to say, however, that this should not be taken as any kind of general endorsement of the proposition that PODE reports are unnecessary &#8211; generally they are helpful to the court and a report would have been helpful here. </p>

		    <p class="NoSpacing" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">Furthermore, (f), the wife's delay in bringing the application appears to be inordinate. She can explain the first 13 years of it: there was no point in pressing financial applications against the husband while he had no money. But what about the delay for the 14 years from say 1997 until 2011, when her application was issued? She says that, for the first several of those years, she did not realise that the husband was becoming wealthy and that, for example, his continued failure to maintain Dane led her to assume that there was no significant change in his financial circumstances. But that point takes the wife to no further than 2001 when, on becoming an adult, Dane went to live with the husband. She points to the legacy of discouragement from seeking financial provision from the husband which arose from the justices' nominal order in 1992, from the agency's nil assessment in 1997 and from unproductive consultations with local solicitors in 1994 and 1996. But there is no explanation for much of the more recent delay. Consistently with the potentially life-long obligations which attend a marriage, there is no time-limit for seeking orders for financial provision or property adjustment for the benefit of a spouse following divorce. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/23/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Sections 23(1)</ref> and 24(1) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref> provide that such orders may be made on granting a decree of divorce "or at any time thereafter". Yet there is a prominent strain of public policy hostile to forensic delay. The court will look critically at explanations for it; and, even irrespective of its effect upon the respondent, will be likely, by reason of it and subject to the potency of other factors, to reduce or even to eliminate its provision for the applicant. Nevertheless it remains important to address its effect upon the respondent. In some cases, albeit not in the present, a respondent can show that he has assumed financial obligations or otherwise arranged his financial affairs in the belief that the applicant would make no claim against him and that he has done so in a way which, even if it were possible, it would not be reasonable for him to put into reverse. Sometimes, instead, he can point to factual issues of which the dimming of memories or the disappearance of witnesses over the period of the delay no longer permits accurate determination. But, were this wife's application to proceed to substantive determination, the need for resolution of factual issues would be slight. All that is said on behalf of the husband in the present case is that the delay has deprived him of the chance of establishing that, around 1992, the wife's financial applications were dismissed; but, as already indicated, a dismissal is so unlikely that it should be entirely discounted. Confronted by the difficulties identified at (a) to (f) in paras 30 and 31 above, what might the wife assert so as to carry her application forward to possible success? It is, standing alone, insufficient that the husband is now so wealthy that (as has readily been agreed) he can meet whatever award, if any, might reasonably be made in her favour and there is no need for any exploration of his financial circumstances. But the wife asserts needs, both for a better home for herself and her family and, in the light of the severe limitations on her earning capacity, for a fund out of which to maintain herself for the rest of her life. These, with questionable forensic wisdom, she quantifies at &#163;0.55m for the home and &#163;1.35m for the fund, and thus at a total of &#163;1.9m. Even at this stage one can say that, in the light of the negatives, an award approaching that size is out of the question. It is a dangerous fallacy, albeit currently propounded by those who favour reform along the lines of the Divorce (Financial Provision) Bill currently before the House of Lords, that the current law always requires rich men to meet the reasonable needs of their ex-wives.

Until 1977 the husband was an undischarged bankrupt and made no financial contribution to the running of the wife's household, which was sustained by state benefits. In 1978 the husband inherited from his father a house worth &#163;19,000 and liquid capital of &#163;15,000. The wife then applied for an order for a lump sum. The Court of Appeal upheld an award to her of a lump sum of &#163;12,000. Ormrod LJ, with whom Orr LJ agreed, said, at p 264, that courts would not encourage applications long after the divorce but that the justice of the case might require an award notwithstanding a lapse of time. He continued: "One has here a husband who has never paid a penny piece for the maintenance of his former wife or his three children since, at the latest, 1969 and it means that the wife has lived in great difficulty on social security with all the responsibilities for bringing up these three girls unaided, all that length of time, so that on the merits, in my judgment, she has a strong case. Her claim on the merits certainly goes a long way to eliminating the contrary factor, the lapse of time."</span></p>

		    <p class="NoSpacing" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">Ormrod LJ added, at p 266: "The husband has never attempted to discharge his obligations in relation to these three children. The whole responsibility has been placed on the wife, whose life must have been made very difficult all these years. Is there any reason whatever why, now that the husband has come into a certain amount of money, she and the children should not have the opportunity of benefiting to some extent from it?" Finally Ormrod LJ held, at p 267, that, in the light of his lack of contribution to the wife's household, the fact that the husband's capital had come to him by inheritance long after the separation was no ground for exempting it from partial redistribution to the wife and that the award gave her "an opportunity of perhaps living in something a little bit better than the poverty which she has been living in all these years". For another example of a short marriage, a substantial contribution on the part of the wife in caring for the children, a 30-year delay in her bringing her application (following an overseas divorce) and a significant capital award, see M v L (Financial Relief After Overseas Divorce)&#160;</span><a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2003/328.html" style="font-style:italic"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2003/328" uk:canonical="[2003] EWHC 328 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] EWHC 328 (Fam)</ref></a><span style="font-style:italic">,&#160;</span><a href="https://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2003/328.html" style="font-style:italic"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 2 FLR 425" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 2 FLR 425</ref></a><span style="font-style:italic">. In my view this court should direct the swift referral of the wife's application to&#8230;a judge of the Family Division...It may however be helpful to suggest that the major issues requiring limited investigation by way of oral evidence seem at this stage to be the wife's delay on the one hand and the disparate contributions to the care of the children on the other. These are, to my mind, the two magnetic factors. They pull in opposite directions and the question may ultimately prove to be whether, in the light also of the five difficulties identified in para 30 above, the wife's delay is so potent a factor as not just to reduce but even to eliminate what might otherwise have been awarded to her by reference to contributions and possibly also to needs. Had it been relevant, as Jackson LJ considered, to ask whether the wife's application had a real prospect of success, my opinion would have been that it had a real prospect of comparatively modest success&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

This is very likely to continue to be the case for the remainder of their respective minorities.

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in"><span class="within-new" style="color:initial">The wife has two NHS Pensions &#8211; one (in the NHS Pension 1995 Scheme) which has accrued value through contributions between 1999 and 2008 and again between 2011 and 2015 (she took time out from the scheme between 2008 and 2011 while working as a locum) and another (in the NHS Pensions 2015 Scheme) which has accrued value through contributions between 2015 and the present day. The latest official CE figures for these pensions were produced in December 2020 at &#163;338,354 and &#163;149,865 respectively. As discussed above, it has proved impossible to extract later figures. Mr Alukpe has suggested that these figures might now be &#163;650,000 and &#163;225,000 respectively, but these were really no more guesses. It is difficult to see how the 1995 Scheme pension could have risen that much in a period where there were no contributions, but it may be that the figure will have gone up a little as a result of changed actuarial assumptions. I can imagine that the 2015 Scheme will have gone up through more than three years of further service and contributions and actuarial assumptions have also changed; but again it is difficult to know what the actual figure is now. Rather than make a guess myself at a precise up to date figure I propose to say that I would expect the figures to have risen to some extent from December 2020 to now; but probably rather less than the figures guessed at by Mr Alukpe, and considerably less in the case of the 1995 scheme.</span></p>

In the meantime, she accrued assets &#8211; if she had known he was considering making a claim she might have brought the matter to a conclusion shortly after the separation before those assets were accrued.
