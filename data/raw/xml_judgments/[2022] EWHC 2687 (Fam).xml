	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">J is a 13 year old girl with complex needs who was made the subject of an interim care order on 20 July 2022 in favour of the Applicant Council/Manchester City Council. The Council has a statutory duty to place J in a placement but for about three months now it has not been able to find any accommodation for her and so she has been living in a hospital. J does not want to live in a hospital. She has no physical or mental health requirement for in-patient treatment and the environment of a hospital is not at all suitable for her needs but the Council has not been able to find any alternative place for her to live. A team of agency care staff funded by the Local Authority attend the hospital to look after her. J&#8217;s presence in the hospital and the attention she requires cause disruption and adversely affect the ability of hospital staff to care for their patients. Resources that should be used to treat someone who requires in-patient care are being used to house a child who does not require in-patient care. All parties in this case agree that J needs to be placed somewhere else but such is the state of provision for children with complex needs in England and Wales that there has been nowhere else for J to go.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">J previously lived at home with her mother and other younger siblings.  She has been diagnosed as having Autistic Spectrum Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. She has problems with attachment. She has difficulties with hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention. She can become agitated very quickly such that her behaviour towards others becomes aggressive. She has assaulted others, including hospital staff, damaged property, she has engaged in risk taking behaviour such as absconding, and she has self-harmed on multiple occasions.  J has received support from the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS), from the Local Authority, and from psychiatric services. Her mother has tried her best to support and care for J but she is unable and unwilling for J to return home unless or until the risk to her and her other children is reduced.</p>

For the purposes of this short judgment it is necessary only to provide a summary. J was referred to the Local Authority&#8217;s social work team on 27 May 2022 having been admitted to hospital following an overdose and self-harming. She absconded from the hospital and threatened to jump off a bridge. She was detained under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/136" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.136</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> and a day later the police invoked their powers of protection and J was placed in foster care. J overdosed again. Her mother agreed to her being returned home but two days later J was readmitted to hospital having deliberately hit her head against a wall. She was an in-patient for six days before being discharged with follow up support from CAMHS. Within hours of being discharged she was readmitted having had suicidal thoughts. She was discharged again but on 10 June she assaulted her mother and self-harmed. The next day she took an overdose and was admitted to hospital. She was discharged on 14 June but absconded. She was back in hospital by 16 June 2022 but absconded on 19 June. She was re-admitted to hospital after an attempted overdose on 21 June 2022. Whilst in the hospital waiting room she assaulted her mother.</p>

Ultimately, however, I recognise that there are cases in which there is absolutely no alternative, and where the child (or someone else) is likely to come to grave harm if the court does not act. I also have to recognise that there are other duties in play, in addition to those which prohibit carrying on or managing an unregistered children&#8217;s home. I gave an idea earlier (see para 30 et seq) of the duties placed upon local authorities to protect and support children. How can a local authority fulfil these duties in the problematic cases with which we are concerned if they cannot obtain authorisation from the High Court to place the child in the only placement that is available, and with the ability to impose such restrictions as are required on the child&#8217;s liberty? It is such imperative considerations of necessity that have led me to conclude that the inherent jurisdiction must be available in these cases. There is presently no alternative that will safeguard the children who require its protection.&#8221;</p>

By Section 27A of the Care Planning, Placement and Case Review (England) Regulations 2010, as amended in 2021, it is lawful for a Local Authority to place a child in a hospital. However, the court has still to be satisfied that it is necessary, proportionate and in J&#8217;s best interests for the authorisation to be given. As <span style="font-style:italic">Re T </span>establishes (see for example the first sentence of [145] above) the court must consider whether to authorise the deprivation of liberty in the setting where the child is being accommodated or is going to be accommodated. </p>

The reason for so concluding, certainly on the three occasions I have done so, has been that there has been no alternative place for J to live and that restrictions amounting to the deprivation of her liberty have been needed to keep her safe whilst living at the hospital. At each hearing, the court has been told that the Local Authority is actively searching for alternative accommodation but, in three months, its searches have been in vain. The court is unable to find alternative placements and so, if the deprivation of a child&#8217;s liberty is authorised, judges are limited to trying to ensure that the child is kept safe and is well cared for, and to cajole others to act to find suitable accommodation and care arrangements. At previous hearings I have insisted on regular review hearings, I have ordered the attendance of the Director of Children&#8217;s Services, and I have directed that details of the case be provided to the Secretary of State for Education and the Children&#8217;s Commissioner.

The package of care required will often involve a team of eight or more carers on a shift pattern. If they are provided by an agency there may be a high turnover of staff caring for the child in the placement.

I have been provided with a proposed multi-agency transition and support plan which is a carefully drafted, structured plan for  J&#8217;s introduction and move to the proposed bespoke placement. The plan should ensure education provision is maintained at J&#8217;s present school, that there is input from the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service, that J is introduced to the new care team whilst she is still at the hospital, that K is involved, and that J is introduced to the new placement and has some input to preparing it for her move there.</p>

Those notices highlight the risk of prosecution. The provider and/or the landlord might then withdraw. The President of the Family Division issued guidance on 12 November 2019 - Practice Guidance: Placements in unregistered children&#8217;s homes in England or unregistered care home services in Wales - together with a later addendum dated 1 December 2020, which must be followed, requiring the Local Authority to inform Ofsted of any order authorising the deprivation of a child&#8217;s liberty in an unregistered children&#8217;s home, and application for registration being made within a prescribed timetable. Whatever monitoring requirements the court might impose on the Local Authority as a condition of authorising deprivation of J&#8217;s liberty in an unregistered placement, the court is not a regulator and cannot replace the level of oversight that a regulator provides. </p>

The goal must be to reduce and then remove the restrictions. The number of incidents logged in the last two to three months, with the restrictions in place, shows that the restrictions do not prevent all incidents of aggressive behaviour, assaults on others, self harm, and absconding attempts. I am aware of the possibility that the very existence of the restrictions can provoke J to react against them. However, having regard to all the evidence, including the nature of the incidents logged, and comparing the actual harm suffered by J and the risk she placed herself in before these restrictions authorised, with the actual harm suffered and level of risk with authorisation, I conclude that without the restrictions J would be at a much greater risk of serious harm and would place others at a greater risk of harm.</p>

She would like to go for walks as and when she can.  She is happy for the walks to be with the support workers at all times.  J does not eat hospital food so she likes to get her own and would like to be able to go to the shops around the hospital at mealtimes to get food.  She would like her curfew to be extended to 10pm. She would like to attend an activity centre where she can access a gym. For the Trust, Ms Hurst has told the court that daily risk assessments are carried out and that J is often given more freedom than would be suggested by the list of permitted restrictions. The authorisation is permissive not directive. For example, J has been on walks out of the hospital for more than the permitted restricted times. The more restrictive measures are reserved for when the risks are assessed as being higher. I am told that physical restraint, whilst permitted in certain circumstances, has not had to be used for some time.</p>

There is no consent to the deprivation of liberty and it is imputable to the state. It is open to the court to refuse to authorise the deprivation of J&#8217;s liberty. The consequence would be either that the restrictions would be removed, in which case J would leave the hospital and would be at a very high risk of coming to harm, or she would remain at the hospital with unauthorised and therefore unlawful restrictions imposed upon her to try to keep her safe. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Had there not been the alternative bespoke placement available within a reasonable time, I would have been unlikely to authorise the continuation of J&#8217;s liberty in a hospital. As it is, I struggle to find that the continuation of the present arrangements even for a relatively short time is in J&#8217;s best interests. A hospital is not a suitable home for this 13 year old girl who has no need for treatment. It is surely harmful to her to spend any more time in hospital than is absolutely necessary. However, due to the national lack of resources to accommodate and care for children with complex needs, that appears to be the only place where she can live until, as is hoped and expected, the Local Authority is able to arrange and have ready the proposed bespoke placement. The redeeming feature of this case is that under the plan put forward, J will be able to continue at her school before the move. Remaining at the hospital during the transition period to the new placement will afford her some stability at least.</p>

Very often the court is told that there is only one place where the child can be accommodated. The court&#8217;s role is therefore very limited. There are no real choices for the court to make. The court cannot direct that placements shall be made available. The court is not a regulator and cannot inspect potential placements or oversee care regimes. On the other hand, even when there are no other placement options, the court does not merely provide a rubber stamp for the restrictions sought, and there are decisions to be made about the extent of the restrictions that are necessary and proportionate and in a child&#8217;s best interests. However, the courts, like the parties, continue to be confined by the consequences of what Lord Stephens called a &#8220;scandalous lack of provision&#8221; for which it appears that there is no end in sight.</p>

It was held that an intense focus on the comparative importance of competing rights under Articles 8 and 10 was required. Neither Article has presumptive weight over the other; the proportionality test must be applied to each. The court should always ask whether there is any less restrictive or more acceptable alternative to a RRO &#8211; see also <span style="font-style:italic">JIH v News Group Newspapers Ltd</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] 1 WLR 1645" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] 1 WLR 1645</ref>.</p>

First, the applicant is a public body and is accountable. Scrutiny of public authorities requires it to be known which authority is doing what. Councillors within the Local Authority area should know what is being done in their name. Voters need to be able to hold their Council to account. Second, it is pertinent that the applicant is a large Local Authority covering a large population. Even with its resources it is struggling to find an alternative placement for this child. It is in the public interest to know the reality of the problems highlighted in this case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The court has to be very mindful of the risk of identification of J. It would be contrary to her best interests for her to be identified as the subject of this case. What is the extent of that risk? Manchester is a large city with a population of over half a million and several hospitals within the Greater Manchester area serving the population of the city of Manchester and beyond. The risk of identification is therefore much lower than it would be if the Local Authority covered a smaller population. To reduce the risk of identification via knowledge of location, I can order that there shall be no information that would identify or be likely to identify the hospitals where J has and is living, the staff working there, or the location of her family home, or the location of the hospitals within Greater Manchester. My RRO of 4 October prohibited identification of the Trust that is responsible for the hospital where J is. No objection is taken to that reporting restriction.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgement, the public interest in knowing the identity of the Applicant Local Authority comfortably outweighs the risk of identification of J by the Applicant Local Authority being identified. That risk is extremely small. As to the suggestion that J herself would be harmed or distressed by knowing that the Council was being identified, I reject that. I don&#8217;t believe that she would consider that identification of the Council would jeopardise her anonymity. That is speculation. It is also very speculative to suggest that potential providers would be put off offering services because the Council was named. I do not believe that that is a realistic suggestion.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> I am aware that there has been a recent Court of Appeal decision allowing an appeal against a decision of HHJ Wildblood KC in a similar case to allow the Local Authority to be named. That judgment has not been published. I do not know when it will be published and I do not know what the facts of that case were. None of the parties have asked me to defer my decision on the application to vary the RRO and I do not consider it necessary to do so. There have been many cases in which Local Authorities have been named even when the identity of the child or children involved have been protected. Cases are fact sensitive. For the reasons given I shall not vary the RRO to prohibit naming Manchester City Council, but I shall vary it to protect the identity of those who have worked with and cared for J and who will do so at the proposed placement. The hospitals where J has lived must not be named but it can be reported that they are in the Greater Manchester area. The full RRO is available on request.</p>
