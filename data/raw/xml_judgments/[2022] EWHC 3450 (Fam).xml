The hearing began on 9 June 2022 and went part-heard to today, 14 July 2022.  The first applicant is D who was the deceased father&#8217;s erstwhile partner, represented by Ms Gomersall of counsel.  The second applicant is E, the paternal aunt, represented by Mr Brindle.  The first respondent is F, the mother, who attended as a litigant in person on the first day but not the second.  The second respondent is the Local Authority, represented by Ms Proctor on the first hearing, and Ms Jones on the second.  The third, fourth and fifth respondents are the children via their Children&#8217;s Guardian, represented by Ms Burns.  </span></p>

The Local Authority temporarily placed the children with the paternal grandmother, J.  Shortly thereafter, the children&#8217;s father, G, applied for a child arrangements order.  The child arrangements proceedings concluded with a lives with order in favour of the children&#8217;s father dated 21 June 2019 made by District Judge Cuddy.  In terms of contact with the mother, the Court ordered:</span></p>

The children discovered their father&#8217;s body.  The oldest child, A, called the paternal grandmother to seek help.  When she could not reach the paternal grandmother, she called the father&#8217;s ex-partner, D, who answered the call and attended upon the children.  Upon the police learning of the father&#8217;s death, they attended at the paternal aunt&#8217;s property and asked whether she would accommodate the children.  The paternal aunt agreed to accommodate the children.  The eldest child, A, however, expressed a wish to remain with D and did so.  Three days later, the Local Authority social worker attended the home of the paternal aunt and spoke to the children.  The social worker informed the paternal aunt that if she was not able and willing to accommodate the children, the Local Authority would place the children with D.</span></p>

The father&#8217;s will contained a clause that the paternal aunt would be the children&#8217;s guardian upon his death if he was the only surviving parent when he died.  Obviously, the children&#8217;s mother is alive and holds parental responsibility for the children, and, therefore, that clause of the father&#8217;s will is not capable of being executed.  Each of the applicants, D and E seek a declaration from the Court that the children for whom they care have been looked after children from the date of the father&#8217;s death.  That will have consequences for funding that is available to them as proposed special guardians.</span></p>

However, it will be a question of fact as to whether that happens in any particular case.  Usually, a private fostering arrangement will come about as a result of discussions between the proposed foster parent and either of the child&#8217;s parents or a person with parental responsibility but we accept there might be occasions when a private arrangement is made without such direct contact.  We accept there might be cases in which the Local Authority plays a part in bringing about such an arrangement.  However, where a local authority takes a major role in making arrangements for a child to be fostered, it is more likely to be concluded that in doing so, it is exercising its powers and duties as a public authority pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 20</ref> and 23.  If an authority wishes to play some role in making a private arrangement, it must make the nature of the arrangement plain to those involved.  If the authority is facilitating a private arrangement, it must make it plain to the proposed foster parent that he or she must look to the parents or person with parental responsibility for financial support.  The authority must explain that any financial assistance from public funds will be entirely a matter for the discretion of the local authority for the area in which the foster parent is living.  Only on receipt of such information, could the foster parent give informed consent to acceptance of the child under a private fostering agreement.  If such matters are left unclear, there is a danger that the foster parent and, subsequently, the Court will conclude that the Local Authority was acting under its statutory powers and duties and that the arrangement was not a private one at all&#8221;.</span></p>

The mother, at the time, was having indirect contact only with the children which had not been consistent.  She could not provide care for the child and was not able to accommodate her.  The mother did not arrange, at any time, or request that the applicant care for the child.  The applicant submits that it was the child who contacted the applicant who, in turn, contacted the Local Authority to inquire as to what should be done in those circumstances.  The Local Authority asked if she would continue to care for the child which is what she did.  Therefore, it is wholly unclear how, in the circumstances, the Local Authority asserts that a private fostering arrangement came into being.

The Local Authority were accommodating the child from this point.  Upon the death of the father, he had not named the applicant as a guardian for the child in his will.  In fact, in his will, he cited E.  He set out that E would be the children&#8217;s guardian in the event of the death of both their parents.  Thereby, a situation arose where all three children needed to be accommodated as the person exercising the parental responsibility had died suddenly.  At a meeting on 13 September 2019 between the social worker and the paternal aunt, E, the child indicated she wished to remain living with the applicant, D and was allowed to remain in her care by the Local Authority social worker.  The applicant, D, was not present for that meeting.  The Court is asked to find that the Local Authority authorised that position by enabling or allowing the continued placement of the child with D, despite the paternal aunt wishing to care for all three children and disputing that the child (A) should continue to live with D given that she was not related to her.</span></p>

It is quite clear, it is argued, from the legislation, that the children could not consent to their own accommodation even if they were mature enough to do so.

However, a failure of the Local Authority to comply with the regulations and go on to undertake an assessment of the paternal aunt does not, it is submitted, detract from the practical realities of the situation.  The paternal aunt was asked by police to accommodate the children, and she obliged.  The paternal aunt, was, on expiry of the police protective measures, asked by the Local Authority to accommodate the children.  The Local Authority, at that point, undertook an assessment of the paternal aunt&#8217;s suitability to accommodate and care for the children.

At no point in time did the mother, who still has PR for the children, although restricted in terms of a court order to indirect contact only, ever seek or request that any of her children be cared for in a looked after capacity.  On the contrary, she agreed to the children remaining within the family with E and D.  The Local Authority argues that it would not intervene in the family&#8217;s arrangements upon the death of a carer unless it was required to do so to protect the children&#8217;s welfare.  In this instance, there was no necessity to interfere, and, instead, it supported the familial placements and encouraged the adults to pursue special guardianship orders.</span></p>

In respect of A and D, it is acknowledged that D, as the ex-partner of G, was under no obligation to step in and care for A but this is what she chose to do.  A did not want to go to her mother&#8217;s care and wanted to be with D.  The Local Authority did not place A with D.

On the day that her father died, 10&#160;September 2019, A had already called D following finding her father.  The request to care for the children came from the police, and not from the Local Authority, and, therefore, the police arranged for the children to go with their family.  The following day, the mother made several enquiries with regards to her children and provided consent for the children to remain with wider family.  There were several family members vying for the care of the children.  It is more likely that due to the number of carers available, the Local Authority would never have been required to apply to the Court for parental responsibility.  The children requested not to go with their mother as they had not seen her for 12 months.  It was the view of the social workers that the children were </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Gillick</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> competent and were given the choice.

The consent needs to be properly informed and fairly obtained.  At no time, has the mother provided consent for A to be cared for in a looked after capacity.  The Local Authority asserts it was a private fostering arrangement.  A fitted the criteria as a privately-fostered child, and it was recommended that D applied for a special guardianship order.  The Local Authority say it is admirable that D has dedicated her time to caring for A.  That is not a justification for the Local Authority to support her decision financially.  In respect of B and C and E, the Local Authority argue that E did not wish to apply for a special guardianship order in respect of the boys but, instead, asked to be assessed as a foster carer.  The Local Authority did not agree to this proposal given the boys went to live with her in a private family arrangement upon the untimely death of her brother, the boys&#8217; father.  It was the right and proper course of action for E to assume the care of the boys.  A Local Authority welfare check revealed no issues, and the Local Authority proposed no stipulations or terms on the arrangements, as the children were not placed with their aunt by the Local Authority.  In the event E had not been able to have offered the boys a home, then, other family members may well have come forward to do so.  Accordingly, to say foster care was the alternative to E is to misrepresent the position.  All three children are beneficiaries of the will, and E, as a trustee and executor of the father&#8217;s estate.</span></p>

Contrary to that, the Local Authority say it set out at an early stage that the aunt would be responsible for the children financially, and advised as to what benefits she could claim.  Indeed, at a very early stage of the children being with the aunt, she asked to be a foster carer for them as she had identified that this status would prompt foster carer allowances.  The aunt was informed on multiple occasions that the Local Authority did not consider the children to be looked after, and they did not consider the aunt to be a foster carer, and, as such, she would not be entitled to this financial support.</span></p>

In this regard, the Local Authority accept that the Court can exercise its inherent jurisdiction to grant a declaration.  However, the Local Authority say that, in doing so, the Court must have regard to the legal principles which govern and determine a child&#8217;s legal status which the Local Authority say are not met in this case in a way which indicates the children are or have been looked after.  At paragraph 28 of D&#8217;s skeleton, which asserts, &#8220;On 12 September 2019, the applicant was asked by the social worker if she was willing to continue to care for the children and the applicant agreed, the Local Authority were accommodating the child from this point&#8221;.  The Local Authority argues that it does not accept that asking an existing carer if they intend to continue with care, amounts to placement rather than &#8220;This is a sensible question to confirm what the arrangements are for placement&#8221;.</span></p>

These entries reflect significant involvement of the Local Authority, it is argued, and a lack of clarity around the situation which points away from the Local Authority establishing the basis of a private arrangement.

I advised that, given the history, I can&#8217;t state, at present, whether she can have the children in her care, informing that I would need to look at the history and court order, if possible and would, firstly, need to check that the children are okay and well-supported.

The Guardian argues that this highlights the lack of clear, agreed plan around the arrangements for the children almost six months after G had passed away.

The social worker confirms F as saying that she will not sign any consent forms that delegate parental responsibility to E.  This is evidence that no one was exercising parental responsibility on a day-to-day basis and that the Local Authority remained pivotal as the point of contact for the adults and professionals involved.  E148, 10 March 2020.  E indicates that she has asked the Local Authority, previously, if A is a looked after child and that she has been told that she is.  The Local Authority say that A is in a privately-fostered arrangement in response.  Six months after G&#8217;s death, E clearly remained unclear about the framework for A&#8217;s placement with her.

There had been no communication between D and E nor between E and F.  The Local Authority had coordinated all steps in respect of the children and been central to making arrangements for them.  It is clear from the evidence, it is argued, that neither applicant had parental responsibility nor could they exercise parental responsibility for the children following the death of G.  The Local Authority logs indicate that whilst F was contacted by the social worker about delegating parental responsibility, she did not do so.

Volume eight deals with private fostering.  In this case, it is submitted that there was no arrangement made between D and F, and whilst it is noted that a private arrangement could come about, with a third party obtaining the agreement of the carer and the consent of the parent, it is not evidenced that it was undertaken in this case.  </span></p>

The police wanted Social Services to do checks on D and J.  At 11.30am the same day, a telephone call was made to D by the social worker.  She was told by D that A had wanted to stay with her and she did.  The boys had gone to E.  There was a court order in place that the mother did not have direct contact with the children but was allowed limited indirect contact.  C was saying that he did not want to go to his mother&#8217;s and the children had not seen their mother for a year.  The children wanted to stay, either with her or the paternal grandmother.  At 11.45 that morning, there was a telephone call to the Local Authority legal department by the social worker.  It was noted that only the mother had parental responsibility:</span></p>

We could look at a care order because somebody has got to exercise parental responsibility.  The mother has no relationship with the children.  They don&#8217;t know her.  They are saying they don&#8217;t want to go with her.  Family arrangements: the Court will direct us to assess if the girlfriend is suitable.  It would need to go before the Court to gain a family arrangement order/residence order.  We could offer financial support.  A legal planning meeting would be beneficial&#8221;.</span></p>

During that conversation, the mother said that she had parental responsibility and would like the children back in her care.  The social worker advised her that, given the history, she could not state, at present, whether she could have the children in her care.  She would need to look at the history and the court order, if possible, and would need to check that &#8220;the children are ok and well-supported&#8221;.  In my judgment, it is clear, at that stage, that the Local Authority had taken upon itself a central role in deciding where the children were to reside.  The only agreements that have been reached in this case is that the Local Authority, individually, have agreed with D to continue caring for A and E to continue to care for the boys.  Ms Jones, very properly, conceded, today, that there had been significant Local Authority involvement.  </span></p>

It did not, in my judgment, make the nature of the arrangement plain to the parties involved.  It did not make it plain to the proposed foster parents that they must look to the parents or person with parental responsibility for financial support.  They did not properly explain that any financial assistance from public funds would be entirely a matter for the discretion of the Local Authority.  D and E did not, therefore, give informed consent to acceptance of A in the care of D and the boys in the case of E under a private fostering agreement or private family arrangement.</span></p>

The Local Authority acted upon A&#8217;s wishes and feelings which were contrary to the views of the family.  I do not accept that it was simply a mistake when the social worker recorded as follows, on 8&#160;October 2019, at B33, &#8220;The actions &#8211; there should be an appeal regarding the child&#8217;s school place as A will be a looked after child&#8221;.  This represented an admission by the social worker of the reality of the situation.  Furthermore, her access to therapy and the Young Person&#8217;s Advisory Service was prioritised in line with the provision for looked after children.  In my judgment, the Local Authority are unable to rely upon a failure to comply with proper <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section&#160;20</ref> procedures to support their case that they did not owe any duty pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 20</ref> of the Children Act.</span></p>

It is clear from the evidence that neither applicant had parental responsibility or could exercise parental responsibility for the children following the death of G.  The Local Authority logs indicate that whilst, F, the mother, was contacted by the social worker about delegating parental responsibility, she did not do so.  [Redacted] School raised concerns that there was no one with parental responsibility for A, and this is noted to have caused difficulties, in parents&#8217; evening being attended to by D or other decisions being made by or on behalf of A.  </span></p>
