	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although in other respects I was content to approve the local authority&#8217;s care plan for MM, in one major, indeed fundamental, respect I was not. The fact was, as Mr Sachdeva on her behalf pointed out, that the local authority was seeking to interfere in &#8211; indeed, control &#8211; MM&#8217;s life by saying where she must live, by placing her on her own somewhere where KM was not even allowed to visit her, and by controlling KM&#8217;s access to her.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In these circumstances, and accepting Mr Sachdeva&#8217;s submission, I held that the local authority was by its own acts creating a situation where, if a breach of Article 8 was to be avoided, the local authority had to take certain positive steps &#8211; specifically, steps to enable MM to continue, in an appropriate and dignified way, her sexual relationship with KM.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;If the local authority seeks to impose on MM a regime which in fact involves a breach of her Article 8 rights &#8211; and that &#8230; is the consequence of imposing on MM a regime which in practical terms prevents her continuing her sexual relationship with KM &#8211; then the local authority in principle has a choice. It must modify the arrangements so that there is no breach of Article 8. And in the circumstances of the present case it can do this either by abandoning its attempt to prescribe where and with whom MM lives or, if it wishes to exercise that control, by taking appropriate positive steps to enable MM to continue her sexual relationship with KM. If it seeks to do the one without shouldering the burden of doing the other, then its intervention in MM&#8217;s life is &#8230; disproportionate. And in my judgment it involves a breach of her rights under Article 8.&#8221;</p>

In order to meet this requirement [KM] is to be allowed to visit [MM] at [the independent supported living placement], during contact periods. [KM] is to be able to access the entrance, corridor, stairs, passage, toilet and [MM]&#8217;s room. This will be subject to condition that he is not under the influence of alcohol, aggressive or abusive to any staff or resident at [the placement]. If these conditions are not met then contact is to be cancelled immediately. If [KM] does not comply with this then the police are to be called.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That recital, however, reflects the fact, which I emphasised at paragraph [155] and which I still regard as crucial, that the direct contact provided for in paragraph 2 of the order, namely once per week for a period of four hours, is the <span style="font-style:italic">minimum</span> that is acceptable. The order appropriately provides that the contact arrangements are to be reviewed every four to six weeks. I regard this as important, just as I believe that the reviews should be very much with a view to seeing whether either the frequency and/or the duration of the contact can be increased. It is important that MM is able to participate in this process appropriately, for her wishes and feelings are very important (see below), just as it is also important that her advocate is able to attend the review meetings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The language of paragraphs 2 and 3 of the order reflects the fact that MM lacks capacity to decide these matters and therefore cannot herself &#8220;agree&#8221; to them. Accordingly any direct contact additional to that provided for by the order will be as &#8220;directed&#8221; by the local authority, though &#8211; and this, I emphasise, is very important &#8211; always having regard to MM&#8217;s wishes and feelings: see paragraphs [121]-[124]. In contrast, the indirect telephone contact, which as I made clear (see paragraphs [54], [156], [167]) does not require to be limited or supervised, is to take place as &#8220;arranged&#8221; by MM and KM.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It will be noted that the Official Solicitor is to remain involved for a further period of six months. I regard this as an important safeguard for MM until it has become clear that the arrangements I have authorised have settled down and are working smoothly. The period of six months is inevitably arbitrary, but bearing in mind all that has happened, and not least that MM has been in her present placement since March 2007 and that the placement seems to be working reasonably well, I think that any problems of the kind which are likely to need the Official Solicitor&#8217;s assistance within the foreseeable future are likely to have manifested themselves well before May 2008. </p>

For that purpose I have included a liberty to apply in the order. In a case of this kind judicial continuity is, I think, very important, so I have reserved any future applications to myself, if available.</p>
