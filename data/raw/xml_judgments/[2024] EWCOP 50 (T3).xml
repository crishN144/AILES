I have been concerned with MC over a number of years in proceedings in the Court of Protection.  He has a range of difficulties, chiefly stemming from attachment and anxiety disorders; he also has a moderate learning disability and a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (&#8220;ADHD&#8221;).  His mother, who is a party to this application, acting in person, has told me that he has relatively recently begun taking medication for his ADHD and, whilst she does not interpret its effect as transformative, nonetheless considers it has made a positive impact on his ability to concentrate and regulate some of his anxiety.</span></p>

I find him to be a striking, rather flamboyant, effervescent personality. For all the time I have known him, he was, if he will forgive me for saying so, quite significantly overweight.  As his mother says, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;for all the wrong reasons&#8221;,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> he no longer is.

He has now started eating again, his ADHD medicine has had some positive effect. He has re-engaged with the professionals around him, including a specialist dietician and has, in recent months, made some encouraging progress.  It is obvious to me that the professionals involved in his care take pleasure, perhaps even a sense of professional accomplishment, in the improvements he has made.  Though the journey, I have been told, will be a long one, there remains a real possibility, perhaps probability, that at some point MC will be able to achieve safe, independent living.</span></p>

It is not difficult to see how an individual supervised to that degree, and necessarily so, might feel he has little control over his day-to-day life.  That strikes me as a fundamentally human reaction.  MC has experienced several traumatic events during the course of his life.  These go some significant way to understanding the difficulties he faces with attachment and consequent anxiety. It is not necessary for me to discuss this further in this judgment.  I have been reminded, properly but consistently, throughout the case, that MC also suffers from </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;extreme night terrors&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">.

The proceedings were stayed and MC was detained for treatment under the aegis of the Mental Health Act 1983 at, a mental health unit in South Wales.  There is no doubt that both MC and his mother found that period, and the months that followed to be extremely distressing.  Both MC&#8217;s sadness and that of his mother is viscerally apparent within the papers, and it has led to MC&#8217;s mother becoming angry, frustrated, and despairing about the quality of treatment available for her son and what she regards as the paucity of resources within the system for people in his situation. Her resolve to help him and others in his situation, I am impressed, is genuine and public-spirited.  In her submissions to me, she told me that if the stories of people like MC are not told and understood, the treatment available in South Wales, which she regards as unsatisfactory, will not change because the issue is not sufficiently on the public radar.  I paraphrase her words but that is the essence of what she said.  It was undoubtedly genuine, and a great many people, probably all the professionals in the court, would have a great deal of sympathy with her views.</span></p>

The BBC applies for the discharge or variation of paragraphs 6(i)(a), (b) and 6(ii) of the Court&#8217;s Transparency Order (the &#8220;Transparency Order&#8221;). These variations are sought to permit the BBC to: (i) identify MC, CD (his adoptive mother), JD (his adoptive father), and CD&#8217;s parents; and (ii) to identify MC&#8217;s current accommodation as a secure specialist mental health unit in Cardiff. The BBC does not seek to name the mental health unit, nor any individual involved directly in MC&#8217;s care (save for PM, a clinical psychologist formerly involved in MC&#8217;s care, with her consent).</span></p>

This is not a steamroller which tramples all before it, in terms of freedom of expression.

An important piece of evidence filed in this application is the statement of Dr R.  She is employed by the Health Board as a Consultant learning disability psychiatrist.  She has been involved with MC&#8217;s care since the commencement of the Mental Health Act proceedings in February 2024.  It is obvious that she has got to know MC well and feels strongly that he should be protected from what she sees as the inevitable intrusion into his life, in consequence of his involvement and profile in the proposed documentary. The Health Boards&#8217; position, articulated succinctly by Mr Jones, is that they oppose the application made by the BBC because of real concern about the potential for adverse impact on MC&#8217;s personal and private life should the application be granted.  In the course of exchanges Mr Jones agreed that the essence of his clients&#8217; case is that there can be no advantage of any kind at all for MC of participating in this programme.  Conversely however, he submits, there is real potential for harm. From this perspective, the Health Board consider that an evaluation of the parallel analysis comes down very heavily against MC&#8217;s participation in the programme. Whilst this is an important analysis, the exercise is wider than that. Even were there to be likely harm to MC in consequence of the BBC&#8217;s programme, I am still required to evaluate any such harm alongside the competing rights and interests under Article 10. This is not solely a welfare issue. </span></p>

Her obvious delight and relief in her son&#8217;s recent improvement, having gone through what have plainly for both been the darkest of hours in some very difficult years, was almost palpable.  In my judgement, the risk of jeopardising that progress, recognising the enormous importance of it in unlocking (almost literally) MC&#8217;s potential to live a more unrestricted life which promotes his autonomy, weighs very heavily when considering his Article 8 rights.

This is despite the assurances within the application and evidence submitted. Please see Appendix 1 below for detail on progress made. MC is a highly vulnerable young man who is acquiescent and suggestible. This is despite his strong determination shown at times of heightened anxiety with him reverting to the use of dysfunctional coping mechanisms and fixating on extreme behaviours in an attempt to have some control on his life, for example his &#8220;peaceful protest&#8221;, requests for physical restraint and more recently his &#8220;hunger strike&#8221;. There is a real potential that MC will expect and see discharge from hospital and a permanent residence because of media attention and not because of the therapeutic gains, he has made. This would halt the therapeutic long-term gains of him consolidating a more secure attachment (what he refers to intuitively as wanting to feel and being kept safe) and an improvement of his comorbid anxiety which are key to optimising the chances of a successful and sustainable discharge to a Community placement that can support his needs. As an example, MC was aware his mother attended a &#8216;homes not hospital&#8217; protest and was advised that &#8216;she was fighting for him&#8217; giving him a perspective that perhaps the MDT are not working toward that goal which was difficult to manage. The MDT have consistently given MC and CD the message that we are all working together with him to help him achieve care within the community and that has been key to the progress that he has made.</span></p>

This is best achieved by providing MC with consistent information, having a united front where he experiences good communication from those supporting him and keeping clear agreed boundaries. Any divide between professionals, staff and family is likely to be detrimental to MC&#8217;s well-being and therapeutic progress. It is possible that varying/discharging the transparency order might have a negative impact on the unity of his supporting MDT acknowledging many of the professionals feel strongly it would not be in his best interest. This is a concern for the clinicians supporting him and which we need to reflect upon continuing to strive to achieve that unity from the whole MDT including his family.</span></p>

The hunger strike is a graphic example of this. Indeed, MC contemplated that he might die. This was not a hunger strike gesture, it was persistent, invasive and could very easily have led to his death. Sometimes his behaviour is frightening and violent, generated by his anxiety. Those witnessing it who did not know about MC&#8217;s experiences and functioning would undoubtedly be critical of him. The behaviour has been described to me as a dysfunctional mechanism intended to assert control over a situation which has spiralled out of his control.  It is this combination of MC&#8217;s gregarious, engaging sociability and his frightening and violent behaviour, when distressed, which makes him so vulnerable. It also requires to be said that MC is very recognisable. He has a consuming interest in dying his hair, which has been a variety of colours in the time I have known him. Mostly, the colours are vibrant, bold and conspicuous. I have no doubt that there is a real risk of him being recognised in his community and that he will be defenceless in protecting his own privacy.</span></p>

However, as Dr R has explained, this term and the thinking that underpins it, is inimical to MC&#8217;s therapeutic progress and wellbeing. MC needs a coordinated, cooperative, multi-disciplinary approach with his mother very much onside and at the fore, working together with the professionals, to build upon his achievements and to maximise his potential. Effectively, she has to do that which is counterintuitive for her, namely, to work with the professionals in a system which she believes does not have the resources to provide a satisfactory standard of care for her son. She has found herself confronted by a terrible paradox in which her desire to help others in MC&#8217;s situation and to campaign for better resources cannot be reconciled with the therapeutic treatment plan for her son. Though she would not express herself in the terms that I have, I have watched her wrestle with these competing thoughts during the hearing. She is devoted to her son and it is a pleasure to see them together. </span></p>

However, in the discussions that followed, it was said that there was a real and not merely fanciful risk that knowledge of MC&#8217;s involvement in the contemplated documentary might impact adversely in the quest to obtain a suitable placement for him.

Ms Overman cautions me not to speculate on an issue of this kind where there is no evidence before the court. As a statement of general principle, Ms Overman is of course correct. However, the Family Court and the Court of Protection encounter such a scenario on a depressingly regular basis. I do consider it forms part of the balancing exercise but for the reasons I have set out above, I do not consider the weight to be afforded to it to be as significant as the risk of disruption to MC&#8217;s therapeutic relationships. </span></p>

I was not sure, for example, having read the papers, whether MC was to be named in full or by his first name only, nor do I think the BBC was either.  I had the distinct impression that the decision to confine the identification to MC&#8217;s first name alone was taken whilst Ms Overman was in fact on her feet. I do not say that to be critical of her but it does illustrate the challenges presented by this application.

It was he who identified the use of MC&#8217;s first name alone, which is why I raised it with Ms Overman, but he also suggested that there could be other mitigations including the use of identifying images of MC and possibly preventing audio recordings.  He further suggested that there should be no inclusion of details of MC in any content shared on social media, as the BBC recognised &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">the heightened risks of abuse on these platforms, where we don&#8217;t have the control that we have on our own</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">.&#8221;</span></p>

Indeed, it emerged that thought was being given to the publication of a voicemail left by MC to his mother.  That strikes me as a very significant intrusion on the rights of MC.  MC can be eloquent and voluble, a little bit like his mother in some respects, if I may say so.  But he is entirely unable to engage in the exercise which I am charged with, that is to say he is unable to weigh and assess the advantages to him, personally, of participation in the contemplated programme and weigh them against any identified disadvantages.  Were he asked, there is no doubt he would agree with alacrity to participate in the programme.  It would doubtless appeal to the gregarious and outgoing side of his personality.  But it would entirely omit any contemplation of the negatives. I am clear that MC&#8217;s treatment is poised at a very delicate stage. His participation, however limited, in a programme which will inevitably and no doubt properly contain criticisms of the mental health system, is fraught with danger for MC. That danger is not confined to his immediate situation but risks having an adverse impact on his whole life. I reiterate the professional aspiration for MC is to afford him the opportunity to develop his potential to the full and achieve some degree of independent living. Jeopardising that opportunity would require me to identify a competing interest that should be afforded greater weight. That has not been established in this case and I am entirely satisfied that MC&#8217;s Article 8 rights are supported by qualitatively greater evidence than that which can be afforded to the Article 10 rights of the BBC. For these reasons, I dismiss the application. </span></p>
