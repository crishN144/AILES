The defendants to the application are Paul McCourt, personal representative of the deceased&#8217;s estate (&#8216;first defendant&#8217;), and Stephen Hooper (&#8216;second defendant&#8217;), the claimants&#8217;  brother and the sole beneficiary under the will.</p>

Prior to probate the claimants had instructed solicitors, provided witness statements setting out their intention to apply for financial provision under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63" uk:canonical="1975 c. 63" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1975 Act</ref>. The parties engaged in mediation and had legal representation. A standstill agreement was entered into in February 2020, whereby the parties agreed not to take any issue regarding the time limits for an application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63" uk:canonical="1975 c. 63" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1975 Act</ref> to enable the parties to continue to engage in mediation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The costs of these proceedings are set out in the trial bundle. The first claimants costs of &#163;145,390, the second claimants are &#163;23,760. Part of the difference may be accounted for by the fact that the solicitor for the first claimant represented both claimants until June 2021and has taken the lead on issues such as service and expert evidence. Even making allowance for those matters the level of legal costs are disproportionately high in relation to the size of the Estate, amounting to over half of the Estate value. Previous judgments (such as Ward LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Shovelar v Lane</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2011/802" uk:canonical="[2011] EWCA Civ 802" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] EWCA Civ 802</ref> [61]) have expressed concern when this sort of situation arises. The Civil Procedure Rule Committee may wish to consider introducing a similar rule to rule 9.27 Family Procedure Rule 2010, which requires the level of costs to be recorded in the recital to the order made at every hearing in financial remedy proceedings. This has the benefit of the court and parties being reminded of the level of costs and how proportionate/disproportionate they are to the matters in issue in the proceedings.</p>

The first defendant informed the court that, in accordance with the provision in the will, a transfer was sent to the second defendant&#8217;s solicitor in 2020. Although it is not known whether the second defendant signed that document, it has been confirmed with the Land Registry that no transfer has been registered and the Office Copy Entries reflect that the property remains unregistered. A letter from the second defendants solicitors dated 28 January 2022 referred to outstanding legal costs owed to them of &#163;42,000.</p>

The expert evidence was from Dr Langstaff, regarding the claimants health and care needs, and Mr Stott, regarding the value of the first claimant&#8217;s property, King Road and likely rental costs. The second claimant&#8217;s application on the same day sought permission to rely on expert evidence.</p>

The second defendant did not attend. The recitals to that order confirmed that the second defendant had been served with notice of the application and hearing by letter dated 4 January 2022, sent to his last known address. Francis J directed the hearing listed on 8 and 9 February 2022 should be listed before him and a letter should be written to the second defendant, to be served on him personally, enclosing a copy of the order, notice of the hearing on 8-9 February 2022 and inquiring whether he can access both a laptop/computer and the internet for the purposes of the remote hearing on 8 and 9 February 2022. The letter should explain that arrangements can be made if he cannot, provided he communicates with the author of the letter by 2 February 2022. Francis J directed both claimants can rely on the expert medical and valuation reports and the claim will be tried on the written evidence alone. In addition, he directed the claimants are to set out and send to all parties open proposals by 24 January 2022 with the second defendant to respond to those proposals by 31 January 2022.</p>

There is nothing in the email to suggest the second defendant is prevented from responding by his health issues (he seems to respond when he chooses to) or taking part in the proceedings. They submit the prejudice for the claimants of any further delay is significant. The first defendant raises the issue of the second defendant&#8217;s mental capacity due to the reference in the email of him feeling harassed and the listing of his various health problems.</p>

The two emails from him are largely coherent and comprehensible. They confirm he has understood what the communications relate to, they confirm his email account is still active and he remains living at the King Road address where everything has been served. Whilst he appears to have some medical issues it is not suggested those have or would have prevented him from engaging with or communicating with the court or the parties in relation to these proceedings.</p>

They set out the detail of the financial support the deceased had provided to her over the years. This included financial support after her divorce from her first husband including payments for food, as well as other household and car related costs. Following her marriage to her second husband, the business they ran together got into financial difficulties and in 2012 the deceased made direct financial payments to them, including a sum of &#163;7,000, to try to keep the business going.</p>

When the property is sold they will save &#163;2,271 pm from their expenses, as they will no longer be servicing the debts, but will need to rent a property, which is estimated to cost about &#163;950 per month. He submits that the claim outlined in her open proposals in January 2022 and in her statement in January 2023 of a lump sum of &#163;117,600 is maintained. The first claimant&#8217;s husband is now 68 years, his life expectancy is limited by his significant health needs. She is younger and even with her health needs has a longer life expectancy. The impact of the loss of her husband&#8217;s income will be significant (about &#163;2,500 pm), and is a financial need she has for her future maintenance.</p>

The second claimant is age 68 years, her husband died in 2018, they had four children, all now adults. Her day to day care needs are supported by her children, in particular the two eldest. She is almost blind and requires help dressing and feeding. In her statement she describes the care and support she gave to the deceased prior to his death, similar to that provided by her sister, the first claimant. Over many years the deceased helped her out with financial support for such matters as household bills (including food), household white goods, funding works required to her property. She estimates the support over the years averaged out at about &#163;100 pm. She provided practical and emotional support to both her parents, and since her mother&#8217;s death in 2011 to the deceased. This included providing daily personal care for them both over the years as their health deteriorated. She describes sharing such tasks with the first claimant, although it is accepted that as she lived nearer she provided the bulk of the day to day support.</p>

He has health needs outlined in his email in September 2022 and the attachments to it, which accords with more generalised earlier references to his health needs, again reflected in his more recent email to the court. What is clear is that despite his non-engagement the emails from him are relatively lucid and clear, as well as attaching some relevant documents. The information the court has is that he remains living at the property and despite the documents having been served on him in different ways, he has failed to properly participate in the proceedings, provide an acknowledgement of service or any effective defence to the claim or updated information regarding his circumstances.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Looking forward her husband is older than she is, has more complex medical needs, with the result that if he does pre-decease her there is a risk her income will reduce. However, I do not consider it will reduce as much as she maintains as there would be no reason why she would not be entitled to any widows pension regarding his work related pensions and/or be able to recalibrate her PIP entitlement in the light of her changed financial circumstances. Having said that I recognise that if her husband does pre-decease her overall income is likely to reduce by more than a nominal amount and will have a financial impact on her. In relation to her list of expenses, I acknowledge there is no allowance for some items such as holidays and entertainment although there is about &#163;345 pm relating to pet/animal expenses. On the first claimant&#8217;s own analysis if the home is sold and they move to rented accommodation, their monthly expenses will be &#163;3,092 pm (&#163;37,104 pa) taking into account the payment of rent, their monthly income remains at &#163;3,353 pm (&#163;40,236 pa) and they will have a capital sum of around &#163;86,000 from the sale of their property. Her husband&#8217;s life expectancy is about 17 years, probably less in the light of his medical position, and the first claimants is about 25 years, again probably less in the light of her medical condition. Assuming there may be a life expectancy gap of about 8 years some years ahead, when the first claimant may have an income shortfall which could be quite significant that will be met, to some extent, by the capital reserves from the sale of the property.</p>

She has no financial security other than her home which she has lived in for many years. Her reasonable needs do include provision of care and assistance and the figure she suggests of 6 hours a day is not unreasonable, her needs are assessed to be more but she recognises the continuing role of her daughter to help her. She assesses the costs of that to be about &#163;21,900 pa, which I accept. This would increase her monthly shortfall to &#163;2,421 pm (&#163;29,052 pa).  She has only limited ways of funding her income shortfall, including a possible equity release scheme, although limited details are provided other than a generalised reference to it in her statement.

She will not need to draw on that capital immediately. The sale of their property will mean in the short term they will largely be able to manage on their joint income. There is a real risk her husband will pre-decease the first claimant and the consequent income risks for her if that happens. At that time, at its highest she will need around an extra &#163;24,000 pa to make up for the loss of her husband&#8217;s income and she could live for up to 8 years longer than him. In addition, if they sell they will need to manage the inherent uncertainty of living in rented accommodation over and above the rental costs and need to have provision to cover the costs of any moves, including the payment of a deposit. I do not regard her income deficit now or in the foreseeable future as being as significant as the second claimant as I consider further savings could be made longer term (such as animal related costs) although I recognise that the second claimant will retain ownership of her home, subject to the risks of any equity release scheme and/or nursing home costs.</p>

Her family provides some support for her care needs, but it is not sustainable for the family to meet all her care needs. Her income shortfall is going to be in the region of &#163;29,000 over the next 7 years. The combination of an equity release scheme and the sum paid as a result of this order will amount to about &#163;190,000 and will provide some security for the financial resources necessary to meet her maintenance needs for the foreseeable future.</p>

It is likely, on the information the court has, that the level of income has been maintained. He has a need for housing now and going forward, that was something the deceased wished to provide for. It is recognised he has been living in the current property for a number of years, although he has lived in other accommodation. The information the court has is that it would be possible to secure rented accommodation for about &#163;695 per month in the same area. The second defendant has health needs that the court does have some information about, although there is nothing to suggest he could not move to live in other accommodation. The sum he will receive, subject to costs, will enable him to live in rented accommodation. He has a life expectancy of about 14 years and the Duxbury sum for someone his age to provide the sum of &#163;10,000 for the rest of his life, about the expected annual cost of rent, is &#163;30,000.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Turning to the question of costs. In their submissions during the hearing both claimants propose that from the proceeds of sale of King Road the lump sums should be paid to the claimants of &#163;117,600 to the first claimant and &#163;114,300 to the second claimant, a lump sum of &#163;10,000 is paid to the second defendant, then the claimants legal costs are paid and if there is any remaining sum after that, it is paid to the second defendant. Lower sums than the claimants sought have been ordered as a result of this judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although Mr Dubbery helpfully submitted generalised information about costs after the hearing, including a reference to CPR r 44, it is right that I give the claimants and first defendant the opportunity to make any written representations about what costs orders they seek in the light of the court&#8217;s conclusions, and whether they seek an order for indemnity costs and, if so, why.</p>
