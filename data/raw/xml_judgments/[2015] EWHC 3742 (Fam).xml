In particular, the obligation to deal with a case &#8220;in ways which are proportionate to the nature, importance and complexity of the issues&#8221;; the obligation of &#8220;saving expense&#8221;; and the obligation to allot to a case &#8220;an appropriate share of the court&#8217;s resources&#8221;.  This can, in part, be demonstrated by the fact that the parties have together spent approximately &#163;50,000 on legal costs in England alone.</span></p>

I have also been taken to the specific provisions both of the Family Procedure Rule 2010 (in Part 6) and the Civil Procedure Rules 1998, also in Part 6.  I do not consider that this case provides an appropriate opportunity for me to address which rules apply to the service of such foreign process.  I would want further enquiries, in particular of the Foreign Process Section and the Senior Queen&#8217;s Bench Master, to take place before I addressed a topic with such potentially far-reaching consequences.  However, a question has clearly been raised, which I will seek to have addressed, namely whether such process should be served in accordance with the CPR, as appears to be the view of the Foreign Process Section, or the FPR.  </span></p>
