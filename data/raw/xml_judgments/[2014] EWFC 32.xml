Thus the school, and also the general practitioner, certainly the Local&#160;Authority and the children should be appraised of that which has transpired and I will endeavour in what I hope will not be too lengthy or clumsy a judgment to outline that which has happened, that which I trust is going to happen hereafter, and perhaps a nod towards the manner in which future cases might be undertaken, or at least the lessons which can be learned from this case.</span></p>

The A&amp;E documentation contains this recital - and I quote - &#8216;Child brought in by foster parent with burns of various degrees.&#8217;  A body map of the child&#8217;s body and the examination is on the papers.  That description is the first, perhaps minor but nonetheless in my judgment telling, divergence from accuracy that this case thereafter found itself plagued with.  The term &#8216;burns of various degrees&#8217; is not a clinical term with which I am wholly familiar, but it suggests to the uninformed observer that there were burns on this child which appeared to be of differing severity, but that each one was, one assumes, severe.  We were to hear in fact in due course from expert clinicians that all the burns that were found on the child were, to use a clinical term, &#8216;superficial&#8217;.  In the main and in short summary those burns were to her forearms, one of her wrists and her tummy.</span></p>

If the house officer is referring to one burn, then I understand his or her grammar, but that one burn is not defined.  If however the house officer is referring to more than one burn, that should be said.  If the child was referring to one burn and pointing to that as being caused by her father, that should have been said, but was not.  What is not made clear by this stage &#8211; and therefore the speed of this retraction is unknown &#8211; is that at some early stage, E had retracted the assertion that she had been locked in a freezer.</span></p>

Father was not present when that occurred.  He came into the kitchen upon hearing screaming and he recorded that he had seen water and eggs and I think also the pan on the floor.  That contradiction, if it is a contradiction at all, appears to have alarmed Dr Evans sufficiently to raise in her mind the fact that there was no or no adequate explanation for the injuries seen.</span></p>

She spent the entire afternoon in the witness box responding to questions and giving evidence via interpreter.  Tellingly, the second of the two interpreters to assist her explained to the court that the Roma language has a far more restricted vocabulary than the Romanian language itself.  This was particularly important, it seemed to me and increasingly to the advocates, when considering the responses in police interview and the apparent contradictions in the responses of the parents.  I anticipate that the interpreters at the police interviews were Romanian rather than Roma speakers.  Indeed, I was to be informed by the Bar at a later stage in these proceedings that it was thought to be virtually impossible to find Roma translators, an assertion which on analysis appeared to be wrong, but indicative of the source of a good deal of the confusion in this case.</span></p>

Considerable time was spent by the Bar in seeking to establish whether or not the child had been scalded by water or fat.  It was unclear to me, and remains unclear, why so much time was spent on that exercise when, once questioning had concluded, the clinician responded to my question that contrary to his assertion in his written report that he could find no injury consistent with splash marks, thus steering him away from water, he conceded that on the photographs of the child&#8217;s torso there is evidence, in his opinion, of splash marks.  That response appeared to wholly contradict his initial assertion that these scalds could not have come from water.  However, he remained consistent in his written view, which had been passed to the police, that the incident occurred on one occasion rather than at different times.

Mr Cousins was extremely helpful and, if I may say so, down to earth.  He made it plain that he was quite satisfied that the scalds came from a single incident, that the incident was likely to have been accidental, that it was highly probable that the offending liquid was water and that he could not entertain any suggestion of inflicted injury.  I was particularly surprised to find that in his letter of instruction no reference had been made to the Local&#160;Authority assertion that the parents should have sought medical attention for the child&#8217;s injuries.  Given that no advocate had sought to establish from Mr Cousins whether or not he had any opinion on that issue, again it was left to me to ask what struck me as an obvious question.  Was it satisfactory, I asked, for the parents to have immediately applied cold water and then a cold compress from a rolled-up T-shirt soaked in water and then obtain from a local pharmacy an ointment which they then applied?  That, Mr Cousins retorted immediately, was entirely appropriate and not, as the Local&#160;Authority had insisted, neglectful.</span></p>

Mr Cousins rejected that assertion out of hand.  He pointed out that the application of cold water was entirely appropriate and may well have lessened the severity of the scalds.  He also pointed out that the burned skin covered less than one per cent of the child&#8217;s body and that the burns were entirely superficial.  The application of water would, he said, have caused an initial increase in the pain experienced by the patient, but thereafter would soothe the wounds.  He made a particularly telling comment that it was quite possible that the temporary increase in pain caused by application of the water could provide an explanation for the little girl&#8217;s assertion that, &#8216;Daddy did it.&#8217;</span></p>

I say that because E was not interviewed until September, two months after the event.  Both of her interviews were wholly unhelpful.  Her grasp of language was extremely poor and her retorts were in the main unintelligible.  Although a delightful little girl, appearing to suffer no physical consequences or indeed emotional consequences whatsoever, she was unable to assist the interviewer with any clear or indeed any description of what had happened either coherently or at all.  She was able on being reminded that her arms were injured (by a photograph being shown to her) just to recall that eggs were involved and that she came into contact with hot water, but the mechanism was quite obviously beyond her or beyond her descriptive powers.  She appeared to be wholly confused by some of the questions put to her and, on my analysis, could well have been talking in the present tense when challenged about cooking and eggs rather than the past.</span></p>

The first of the two interviews with the brother produce a confusing description of the incident since he had been in the garden and appears to be telling the interviewer that he had been undertaking some form of gymnastics on a chair.  As I say, the second interview in which he is said to have made disclosures of physical abuse was unreadable on the court computer.  However, the transcript which I have read is contradictory, asserting for example that when he suffered a nosebleed, on the one hand his father had inflicted it, but on the other hand it was accidental.  None of the vague allegations which he made were accompanied by any form of objective or independent evidence since there was no evidence of any mark which may have been inflicted by, for example, a belt or as a result of kicks or punches; nor was there any evidence that either parent had stamped on the little girl&#8217;s feet.  Marks which had been found on the child&#8217;s feet were attributed immediately by the examiner to marks from her shoes.  At one stage the boy, who responded through a Romanian translator, was even questioned in the form of double negatives, which were not only confusing to me as the reader of the transcript, but no doubt wholly bewildering to the child.  </span></p>

To explain the confusion, rather clumsily I am sure, I should say that at one stage she &#8211; that is D &#8211; was in the room; on another occasion she was not; then her grandfather was; then her father was; then they were not; then they were in the garden where she was.

The Judge, however, is not a forensic ferret. It seems to me that all parties bear a responsibility to highlight issues and contradictions and bring them to the attention of the court as a collaborative exercise at all hearings.

Once the report had come in from both Raynor and Cousins there should, in my view, have been some consideration of a joint meeting between all the clinicians, whether face to face or by telephone conference, to establish common ground and areas of disagreement and reasons.  Instead it was left to the fact finding hearing no less than a year after the incident for those issues to be exposed, rationalised, understood and ultimately dismissed.  The findings by Mr Cousins are so clear, and even to a lesser but nonetheless persuasive extent are those of Mr Raynor, and they contradict the treating clinicians so fundamentally that the parties should, in my view, have considered making immediate application to the court for further directions.  They should in any event have convened an advocates&#8217; meeting and all the advocates should have satisfied themselves that they had seen the ABE interviews, (which at least one advocate had not seen when the case came before me), and were aware of the stark differences of opinion expressed by the court-appointed expert.

I gather that over these last 12 months they have effectively lost much of their understanding of the Roma language and even possibly its culture.  They have been cared for in a loving environment by a committed foster parent, but that environment is entirely alien to their parents and is plainly within a community and within a language which is completely different to that of their ethnic and cultural background and upbringing.  The parents have little grasp of English and their children now have either little or no comprehension of Romanian.  For that reason I have sought with the cooperation of all parties to oversee a rehabilitation plan and supporting services for this family before allowing the Local&#160;Authority to withdraw its case and shed its parental responsibility for the children.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">JUDGE CLEARY:  Anything from you, Mr Watson?</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">MR WATSON:  Nothing, My Lord.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">JUDGE CLEARY:  Mr Vine?</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">MR VINE:  One small logistical matter.  We have Mr Miller&#8217;s draft order.  That is an agreed order.  There is still the thornier issue of how to secure a transcript of this judgment, because it will have to be translated.  Is that to be at public expense?  Is that to be shared between the parties, the public funding, the costs of obtaining it being an appropriate disbursement?  It is a detail, but without it the judgment will not be translated.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">JUDGE CLEARY:  Yes, thank you.  Mr Miller, anything to add?</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">MR MILLER:  No.  Can I just take one moment?</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">JUDGE CLEARY:  Yes.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">MR MILLER:  My Lord, I think we have agreed that we will translate the judgment into Romanian for the parents and indeed Y&#8217;s mother.  That just reminds me.  At the beginning you said &#8216;the parents,&#8217; encompassing the parents of all the children.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">JUDGE CLEARY:  I did and I appreciate that Y in fact is Father&#8217;s son, not Mother&#8217;s.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">MR MILLER:  Yes.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">JUDGE CLEARY:  Mother is his stepmother.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">MR MILLER:  Yes.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">JUDGE CLEARY:  I suppose that &#8211;</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">MR MILLER:  For all intents and purposes they have been the parents.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">JUDGE CLEARY:  Quite.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">MR MILLER:  It is just the factual accuracy of that.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">JUDGE CLEARY:  Factually, I suppose, it is to be delivered to Y&#8217;s mother and she will say, &#8216;How come I am not called Y&#8217;s mother?&#8217;  I trust that she will understand that I am addressing this family as a unit, rather than describing genetics</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">MR MILLER:  My Lord, it may be appropriate for the court to bear that cost.  It is a public document.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">JUDGE CLEARY:  I think from my experience &#8211; and I bow to the Bar if this is wrong &#8211; that habitually it is the court that sees to transcription rather than the parties or the Local&#160;Authority having to fund that transcription themselves.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">MR MILLER:  Yes.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">JUDGE CLEARY:  But, as you say, it will be translated at Local&#160;Authority expense.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">MR MILLER:  Yes.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">JUDGE CLEARY:  Does anyone have any anxiety about that?  No, alright.  Then we will deal with it that way.  I will order, in case there is any doubt about this, that there be a transcription of that judgment at public expense for my approval.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">MR MILLER:  My Lord, I can add that to the order, perhaps under three.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">JUDGE CLEARY:  Thank you.  I dealt with your anxieties rather curtly, Mr George.  It is probably the hour of the day, forgive me.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">MR GEORGE:  My Lord, sometimes simple points for non-lawyers are very helpful, My Lord, but we will explain it.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">JUDGE CLEARY:  Thank you.  If there is nothing else &#8211; I think I have covered everything.  I am sure tonight I will remember things that I should have said but did not and remind myself of things I should not have said and I repeated.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">MR MILLER:  My Lord, could I just formally for the tape ask the court to give the Local&#160;Authority permission to withdraw the proceedings.  Once again &#8211;</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">JUDGE CLEARY:  Is that not in your order?</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">MR MILLER:  It is, but for the purpose of the tape, that it is a &#8211;</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">JUDGE CLEARY:  I see, yes.  I approve the order.  I am sorry, I obviously did not make that plain, but I do.  I have read it and it is in this wash of papers.  I apologise.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">MR MILLER:  My Lord, I will send that through within the next 10 minutes with the amendments for you.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">JUDGE CLEARY:  Alright, thank you very much.  Right, if there is nothing else I will release you all with my thanks for your cooperation.  Forms to be signed?</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">MR GEORGE:  Yes, thank you, My Lord.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">MR MILLER:  My Lord, just we are clear, the parents will need to sign the Section 20 forms after court.  They are with the social worker, Miss Hooper.  That is imperative for this to go forward.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">JUDGE CLEARY:  Do I need to know that?</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">MR MILLER:  No, I think just as a remark for the Bar as well as yourself, My Lord.  It just makes sense with the rehab plan.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">JUDGE CLEARY:  That is not a Parthian shot, I think.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:-0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">MR MILLER:  No, no, no.</span></p>
