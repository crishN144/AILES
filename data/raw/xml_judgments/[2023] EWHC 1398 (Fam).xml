By this application, it seeks to trigger the Court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction to make wardship orders in relation to a number of unaccompanied asylum-seeking (&#8220;UAS&#8221;) children who have gone missing from Home Office run accommodation in Brighton and Hove. Neither the Respondent nor the Interested Party disputed that Article 39 had standing to bring this application.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In recent years, growing numbers of UAS children have arrived on small boats on the south coast of England. The vast majority of UAS children arrive in the area of Kent County Council. To ensure the equitable distribution of responsibilities to UAS children to local authorities, the Home Office introduced a National Transfer Scheme under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2016/19/section/72/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.72(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2016/19" uk:canonical="2016 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Immigration Act 2016</ref>, which allows for the transfer between local authorities of their duties to individual children under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> (&#8220;CA&#8221;). However, despite steps by the Home Office to strengthen the efficiency of the scheme in June 2021, it has been unable to remedy the mounting pressure on Kent County Council, which has now declared itself unable to look after a proportion of the UAS children. </p>

The voluntary scheme could not place all the new arrivals in other participating authorities. The Home Office was forced to place (older) UAS children in hotels pending a solution. That was not sustainable. It is local authorities who must discharge Children Act functions; the Home Office has no functions in relation to the care of UAS children and no infrastructure to provide it. The accommodation of UAS children in hotels, other than on an emergency or short-term basis, with no sustained care support or services, is plainly not a discharge of Children Act responsibilities and not in the children's best interests.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The UAS children at the heart of this application went missing from a hotel in Brighton and Hove where they were being accommodated by the Home Office. Initially, Article 39 suggested that 76 children were identified as &#8220;missing&#8221;. However, a number of these children have since turned 18 or been located. There are currently 23 children still missing. </p>

Therefore, 23 remain &#8220;children&#8221; for the purposes of the CA. Of those 23, 21 are Albanian citizens and all are males. The information included in the Schedule was provided by the UAS children themselves, but there is no obvious reason they would be giving a false nationality or would be saying that they were older than they were. I therefore consider this information likely to be reliable in this regard. </p>

In particular, they are highly vulnerable to trafficking and exploitation. The fact that they have gone missing, with the various State agencies who have responsibilities having no idea where they are, is deeply troubling. </p>

What Article 39 wants to achieve is for the Court to ensure that it has the relevant information about the children and to consider whether it should make further orders in respect of them under its wardship jurisdiction.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">She relies on a witness statement from Ms Willow of Article 39 which sets out the concerns about unaccompanied children being placed by the Home Office in hotels with very little oversight and without the statutory protections that they would have if they had been taken into care by a local authority. She points to the particular consequences of the children not having been made subject to care orders (or being accommodated under s.20 CA) as being the lack of oversight by an Independent Reviewing Officer; lack of access to independent advocates; and the fact that the hotels are not registered as children&#8217;s homes, which would bring regulatory oversight by Ofsted. Effectively, she says, there is no safeguarding regime in respect of these children.</p>

However, it is important that the Court focuses on the issues that are before me. I am not hearing a judicial review of decision making by the Home Office, the local authorities or the police. I am simply determining whether there is any proper basis for making all or some of the cohort wards of court. </p>

At the time of writing this report the status of UASC children remains &#8216;in limbo&#8217;. They do not have looked after children or child in need status with the Local Authority and the Home Office has no statutory responsibility for their care. This creates a significant statutory gap in provision and leaves the child with no corporate parent. Statutory agencies have no specific guidance and the longer a child waits to be placed in the care of a Local Authority via the National Transfer Scheme the greater the risk to them. </span></p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.59in"><span style="font-style:italic">The system that has been introduced has been led by the Home Office who maintain they have no direct statutory provision to deal with the children in these circumstances, but that they have the power to put arrangements in place which are borne out of necessity in the absence of appropriate facilities to house children at the point of entry. Local safeguarding agencies have responded to the situation with advice, training, consultation and full engagement in safeguarding referrals made on a case-by-case basis. The Local Authority have maintained that the primary responsibility for the welfare of the children in the hotel remains that of the Home Office. They are clear that the Local Authority in whose area the Home Office places UASC before they are transferred to care cannot be expected to treat them as looked after children for that period. In the case of Brighton &amp; Hove City Council, at the time of writing this report, were the authority to have triggered duties to accommodate the children under section 20 of the Children Act it would have meant providing accommodation for in the region of 1700 children since July 2021.</span></p>

I merely observe that cases such as this demonstrate the continuing need for a remedy which, despite its antiquity, has shown, is showing and must continue to show a remarkable adaptability to meet the ever emerging needs of an ever changing world. I add that the use of the jurisdiction in cases where the risk to a child is of harm of the type that would engage Articles 2 or 3 of the Convention - risk to life or risk of degrading or inhuman treatment - is surely unproblematic. So wardship is surely an appropriate remedy, even if the child has already left the jurisdiction, in cases where the fear is that a child has been taken abroad for the purposes of a forced marriage (as in Re KR and Re B) or so that she can be subjected to female genital mutilation or (as here) where the fear is that a child has been taken abroad to travel to a dangerous war-zone&#8230;.</span></p>
