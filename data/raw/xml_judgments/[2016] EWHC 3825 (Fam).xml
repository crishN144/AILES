A, the eldest son, 31, and 22-year-old B, the second daughter, were only made the subjects of findings of fact sought very shortly before the August hearing was due to commence.  They had not been able to access legal representation, which is hardly surprising.  I decided not to deal with any aspect of the circumstances of the removal for the reasons I gave at the time.  R, the older daughter, now 24, has not responded to attempts to involve her in the proceedings and I see no point in compelling her to do so.</span></p>

I have not been asked to hear any further evidence now on the adjourned day 3 of the hearing.  I had thought that I might be able to conclude it when sitting in Nottingham, but could not because of the pressure on my list there.  My London list has been crammed full until now.  It is now nearly two months since the October hearing, but I have had an opportunity to re-read my notes and I have had the benefit of extremely helpful written submissions and also oral submissions this morning.  </span></p>

The finding, against B now sought in the finding of fact, is simple, under 15 words.  It is that B assisted in the attempts to take the children to Syria via Holland which she denies.  </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in;border:none"><span style="font-size:14pt">In respect of A, seven findings are sought; (1) A assisted in the attempt to take the children to Syria via Holland, which is denied, (2) A attended a meeting with his father and his two brothers on 10/7/13 when talks were given by known members of ALM.  That finding is inevitable bearing in mind that A accepts it but Ms. Jones submits that it is the only evidence of radicalisation of that nature and thus she says it not only should not be overplayed but it is of no real evidential significance.  She also asks me to reject finding (3) &#8220;Like his father, A is sympathetic to the views of ALM&#8221;; (4) A has posed with a firearm and was photographed in a well-known terrorist pose.  The first half of (4) is accepted although not the second, in that A accepted that he was photographed in that pose.  It has close similarities with other obviously terrorist material that I have before me as I commented in judgment number 1, but A denies that that was his intent.  Again it is submitted to me that it cannot be proved that this is in any way sinister, but innocuous, because it is a one-off.  Allegation (5) is that when stopped at Harwich ferry port on 20</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> March 2015 the mobile phone that A was using at the time contained a gruesome video of men being executed.  That is also accepted, but it is submitted that this again was a one-off, not to be regarded as demonstrating evidence of radicalisation, and that I should accept that this simply came to him unsolicited from a source which he cannot remember.  (6) is that although registered in R&#8217;s name that telephone was being used by him, as he accepts.  (7)  is that the images on this phone suggest an interest in killing/murder/radical views.  Ms. Jones submits to me that this inference cannot be drawn from the specific examples given in prospective findings 2 to 6 above.  </span></p>

As I agree, they come over as two very nice articulate and caring people in court and from the witness box.  I bear this all strongly in mind.</span></p>

I use the word &#8220;charge&#8221; by way of analogy with criminal proceedings, not as a direct correlation to them.  </span></p>

This could not have been R&#8217;s plan alone.  Quite apart from anything else, A was driving the borrowed car which was stopped at Harwich, and he was the driver.  Even outside the jurisdiction of England and Wales, it would have been extremely easy when it was announced or became apparent, that the intention of the journey was to travel onwards from Amsterdam for the whistle to be blown by a non-participator.  A mobile phone call to England could have alerted the authorities, or assistance could have been gained somewhere along the way on the journey east.  Many persons speak English in Europe now and anyone who made a fuss at a service station, including a child, would have been likely to draw attention to the family.  The car was meant to have been returned on the Sunday.  European border posts or police could have been alerted by the owners, or more likely the father asserting child abduction.  I find that if there was a plan it must have been mutual, but perhaps not fully involving the younger children. </span></p>

I was interested to know what was the attraction of the venue in Amsterdam, described in one of the documents submitted to me today as a &#8220;theme park.&#8221;  Having now been provided with a Trip Advisor printout, that rather overstates it.  It is called &#8216;TunFun&#8217; and occupies an underground space off the Visserplein in the centre of Amsterdam on the site of an old subway station.  It is said to be for children from nought to twelve years of age.  There is no actual reference to Go-Karting, which I was told in October was the attraction for the older children, although the website describes something called &#8220;skate car driving&#8221;.  There is also an indoor soccer field, a tower to climb and an area with inflatables.   A lot of the activities are designed around eight-year olds although there are facilities for those who are a little younger and a little older.  There are things for adults to do, Wi-Fi and magazines and coffee and tea are provided, but it is not really designed for anything other than children&#8217; activities, and not for adolescents.  It is open during the day, and the website states that it is intended to provide a degree of respite for young children from what may seem to be the chore of going from museum to museum in Amsterdam. </span></p>

J has also told either the guardian or her representative that as far as she was concerned there was no plan for the family to move on.  I may never hear her evidence.  I keep a completely open mind and cannot put into the balance what she tells me as it is not evidence.  If she did not know what was planned, that is not evidence against there having been a plan.  I have accepted and still accept from my own observation of the father as well as RX&#8217;s evidence that there has been a considerable degree of lack of frankness and even subterfuge in this family.  J may well have known of the plans and been encouraged or decided to try to put surveillance off the scent.    I cannot exclude from my considerations that the online posting was part of what I have described as decoy material.  I am not making a finding about this and I may be unable to come to a conclusion but these pieces of information do not undermine the Local Authority&#8217;s case as to what was intended.</span></p>

The proposition that this was intended to be done, or could be done, has not been tested because the family never got as far as Amsterdam.  I also have no information as to the likelihood of the family sleeping in a hotel as an alternative, as B told me, save that there was no booking, which, even in March, might have made obtaining accommodation rather risky in a popular tourist city, particularly just before the Easter holidays.   It has been stressed to me that the amount of money that the young people had on them was insufficient to travel onwards.  It is not clear that there was sufficient cash for three adults, one almost adult and two children over the age of ten to stay in a hotel, or at least to be certain that they could obtain a hotel room, but there is always the ability to draw cash or pay electronically, and the latter can be done by someone else.  The money questions do not help me.  They may have been intending to sleep in the car on the way East, I cannot say.</span></p>

Even in a strange city, people would not have an almost minute by minute plan.  It is confirmed to me by counsel that R&#8217;s list, which may not have been written by R, was found in her bedroom and B&#8217;s was found in her bedroom, and, therefore, that disassociates B from R&#8217;s list.

That would fit in entirely with the late booking and change of cars and the father&#8217;s absence from the advance party.  There was every possibility that an earlier purchase from an outdoor shop for items on the packing list would have been picked up.

The use of the car with such a strong connection to the father&#8217;s associates gives strong backing to the conclusion that the father was going to join them later.

The reasons for visiting this particular facility in Amsterdam seemed thin on first reading and now, as I have information about the facility itself are, in my view, completely incredible.  I do not accept that any of the adults thought that it was worthwhile financially, educationally or socially, to spend a few hours in a play facility with activities relevant to much younger children, and perhaps to see the canals.

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in;border:none"><span style="font-size:14pt">Then there is B&#8217;s evidence about the equipment.  She told me that the planned trip was to Scotland at Easter.  The father had talked about his pleasure in going to Aviemore as a teenager.  She appeared never to have heard of the Cairngorms when she was asked but perhaps that is not absolutely fatal to her case.  More importantly, Aviemore is a ski resort, is at elevation, and there was likely to be still snow up there.  To suggest that this family planned to sleep in a tent in potentially harsh weather conditions is absolutely fanciful.  The father has diabetes and other health conditions.  He needs to relieve himself frequently.  B told me it was planned that she and the other children would go for long walks and climb a mountain.  There was no suggestion as to what was going to happen to the father, and how he was going to keep up, or how the younger children would cope if they were tired or wet or cold.  I may be wrong in having detected an inconsistency in B&#8217;s evidence as to whether or not they were intending to sleep in different camp sites taking their equipment with them, or whether they were going to stay at the same (unidentified) campsite every night and go for walks during the day.  It is inconceivable that the father either would have subjected himself to such conditions or that he would have been left shivering in a tent whilst the family went on without him. </span></p>

She then said she had climbed one in Leicester recently.  It had been very high and very steep.  Leicester is an extremely flat part of the country.  It is obvious to me that B was making up her evidence as she went along and I am quite satisfied that the Aviemore trip was a smokescreen.  The family cannot even agree for when it was planned.  </span></p>

People tell lies for many reasons and they may do so in order to protect themselves or others, to cover up for embarrassment or mistake or for many other reasons.  But when a lie goes directly to the subject matter of the enquiry or matters upon which it directly impacts, it has very great significance indeed.  </span></p>

The answer is that I cannot.  It all forms part of a very coherent and overwhelmingly convincing picture.  The family reasons were probably primarily politico/religious, but maybe also because they thought it was an adventure, wanted to help or thought there was something they could do, and probably for a mixture of all those reasons.   Perhaps they were na&#239;ve as to what might be involved and underestimated the dangers and the hazards which they might encounter, particularly the danger to the children from persons not benignly disposed to them.  This particular plan very probably was influenced by others within their circle by associates who are right at the heart of the ALM movement, which is in itself dedicated to encouraging its members to make exactly this type of journey for exactly the same type of mixture of reasons.  They are highly likely to have had contacts there already.  </span></p>

None of the matters to which they have referred undermines the unchallenged evidence, nor the inferences, including inherent likelihoods and unlikelihoods, which I am more that entitled to draw from it.  I cannot fail to pay attention to the fact that the background is a family with radical sympathies.  As I have said, it is not necessary for me to make a finding in respect of the degree of radicalisation of either of the adult children or indeed the minor children.  I am satisfied that the father&#8217;s role, as very much the head of this family, his children&#8217;s feelings of responsibility towards him, and their devotion to and support of him, are such that they could not gainsay what he himself had planned. I am satisfied that there is a significant degree of radical sympathy in each, even if it may not be as pronounced as that which I find father to hold, or which R appears to hold.  </span></p>

I am sure each loves these younger family members deeply, but loving children or members of the family and taking unwise decisions in respect of them are, as any family judge knows, not necessarily incompatible.  I keep an open mind, as I have said, as to how far J knew what was happening, as I do indeed in respect of the two boys.  They may had different levels of knowledge.  For the younger three children, particularly for the two boys, to be able to object along the way would have been a far more difficult exercise than for the adults.  So, it may be that the boys in particular, were only going to be informed as to what was happening in due course.  </span></p>
