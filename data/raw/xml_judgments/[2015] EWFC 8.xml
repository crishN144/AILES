The children, then aged 16 and 15, had taken part in some four hours of interviews under the Achieving Best Evidence procedure.  At an early case management hearing, the stepfather applied for what was variously described as a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">&#8220;veracity assessment&#8221;</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> or </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">&#8220;validation exercise&#8221; </span><span style="font-size:12pt">and an assessment of the children&#8217;s ability to give evidence.  That application, which was supported by the other parties, was granted.  The court recorded that the report was necessary because serious allegations had been made by the children and because </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">&#8220;the court requires assistance with regard to the veracity of their detailed ABE interviews and their capacity to give evidence&#8221;.</span><span style="font-size:12pt">  The cost of the report was to be shared equally between the parties, with the children&#8217;s solicitor taking the lead.   </span></p>

His report was a careful piece of work.  It surveyed material arising before the children&#8217;s interviews, gave a detailed analysis of the interviews themselves and made reference to research literature.  The analysis discussed the quality of the investigation, the significance of retractions, the possibility of collusion and other similar matters of interpretation.  The reporter considered and dismissed the possibility that he should interview the children himself.  He concluded: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">&#8220;I have seen nothing to suggest that what these children say requires interpretations by an expert, beyond the accommodation of the factors identified in this report.  I hope that I have set out the significant factors and possibilities in this case in such a way that weight can be placed on relevant factors, including any new information that emerges.&#8221;</span></p>

There will be cases involving young witnesses or witnesses with special characteristics or vulnerabilities where such advice will be important for case management and for ensuring that the witness&#8217;s evidence is fairly received.  Understanding in this field has rapidly advanced in both the criminal and the family courts over recent years.  For example, in the present case, where it was suspected that the mother might have some learning disabilities, a focussed psychological report was of assistance in receiving and assessing her evidence.</span></p>

Here there was ample information already available to the court to safeguard the children&#8217;s interests and the overall fairness of the process.  The children&#8217;s social worker knew them well enough to form a view.  The parties were represented by experienced legal teams, albeit leading counsel had not yet been instructed.  The younger child had a Children&#8217;s Guardian.  With this range of professional involvement, the court was in a good position to identify the needs of the situation.  The instruction of a psychologist on the issue of capacity was unnecessary, at least at that stage, and as such</span><span style="font-family:Consolas;font-size:12pt"/><span style="font-size:12pt">there was no basis for permitting it. </span></p>

It held that expert evidence dealing with issues, including the ultimate issue, was admissible, subject to the overriding requirement of relevance, which, together with questions of weight, was a matter for the judge.  At page 210, Butler-Sloss LJ said:  </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">&#8220;The modern view is to regulate such matters by way of weight, rather than admissibility.  But when the judge is of the opinion that the witness&#8217;s expertise is still required to assist him to answer the ultimate questions (including, where appropriate, credibility) then the judge can safely and gratefully rely on such evidence, while never losing sight of the fact that the final decision is for him.&#8221;</span></p>

While the decision must rest on the facts of the individual case, judicial awareness of these issues has greatly increased, from the Cleveland Inquiry in 1987 to the most recent iteration of the principles of Achieving Best Evidence in 2011.  In the two decades since </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:12pt">Re M and R</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> (above), understanding has naturally moved on.  The process continues to evolve, with the final report of the Children and Vulnerable Witnesses Working Group set up in 2014 by the President of the Family Division expected shortly.  The overall result is that judges have been trained in and are expected to be familiar with the assessment of evidence of this kind.  The court is only likely to be persuaded that it needs expert advice if it concludes that its ability to interpret the evidence might otherwise be inadequate.</span></p>

They are, so far as I am aware, unused in criminal proceedings in this country, and I see strong arguments for imposing restrictions on their use in family cases as well.  &#8230; there is a danger that some courts, faced with these difficult decisions, will subconsciously defer to the apparent expert.  That danger has been recognised in a number of cases in which the courts have emphasised the discrete roles of the expert and the court.  In the case of the veracity expert, the danger is particularly acute.  The ultimate judge of veracity, i.e. where the truth lies, is the judge and the judge alone.  He cannot delegate that decision to any expert.  I acknowledge that a child psychiatrist&#8230; may be able to point out some features of a child's account that add or detract from authenticity...  But, in my experience, many of these features should be obvious to judges in any event.  No expert, however experienced and however well briefed about the case, will be in a position to say where the truth lies.  Only the judge sees and hears all the evidence."</span></p>

I acknowledge that judges, however experienced, benefit from the knowledge that experts bring, but that knowledge can be absorbed through judicial training and awareness of the well-known protocols of good practice; it does not have to be imparted case by case with the attendant expense that is bound to arise.</span></p>

I agree.  In the event, the parties did not refer to the resulting report during the fact-finding hearing, nor did I do so when determining the veracity of the children&#8217;s allegations.</span></p>
