Following non-payment of the Lump Sum by the due date, there was correspondence between the parties, and then on 15 August 2023 the Wife issued a claim for possession of Flat 5A, in reliance on the mortgage. On 6 October 2023, DJ Sterlini sitting at the County Court at Clerkenwell and Shoreditch, ordered the Husband to give the Wife possession of Flat 5A on or before 20 October 2023, and gave judgment in the sum of &#163;1.1 million. The Husband sought, but was refused, permission to appeal that order, and has now abandoned any further attempt to obtain such permission to appeal.</p>

It was an order that the father &#8216;settle&#8217; that sum &#8216;on the mother... for the benefit of the child&#8217;. Such an order is not, in my judgment, an order of the kind to which alone <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1979/53/section/1/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(1)</ref> applies.

Roberts J had transferred the proceedings to the High Court in July 2017, and the proceedings were never re-transferred to the Family Court. The variable headings on the different orders demonstrate, in my judgment, an unfortunate lack of attention to the matter by the parties and their legal representatives, rather than any conscious judicial decision, after July 2017, to re-transfer the proceedings to the Family Court. This means that a number of subsequent orders bore the wrong heading.</p>

In terms of the underlying policy, there are potentially significant differences between enforcement of family financial orders and enforcement of financial orders in the civil sphere. As the Law Commission observed in 2015 in its consultation paper (no.219) &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">Enforcement of Family Financial Orders</span>&#8217; at para 1.24:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;It has been clear to us from the outset, starting with the 2010 consultation response from the Family Law Bar Association, that specific considerations arise in the family law context that are not relevant generally in civil debt collection. Family financial orders are almost always related specifically to financial need; non-payment impacts upon the ability of adults to house themselves and make ends meet and, even more importantly, upon the health and well-being of children. Liability is generated by personal commitment (that is, marriage or having children), even though that commitment may now have been renounced. The amount a person is liable to pay is determined, whether by order or agreement between the parties, in family proceedings in which the parties are obliged to give each other full and frank disclosure of their financial circumstances. And liability has been determined by ability to pay amongst other factors.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">However, at least until 2016, charging orders in family proceedings followed the same procedure as in civil cases, and the same fixed costs regime applied. Until 1 April 2016, FPR 33.25 provided that CPR 73 applied in family proceedings, with certain modifications. Accordingly, if a final charging order was made in family proceedings, it would be made under what was then CPR 73.8. And, if the order was made by the court simply &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">confirming that the charge imposed by the interim charging order shall continue, with or without modification</span>&#8221; &#8211; i.e., under what was then CPR 73.8(2)(a) &#8211; then, by virtue of Table 5 under CPR 45.8, the fixed costs regime would apply. This would be the case whether the interim charging order had originally been made following an application under FPR 33.3(2)(a) specifying this method of enforcement, or under FPR 33.3(2)(b), seeking &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">such method of enforcement as the court may consider appropriate</span>&#8221;.</p>

Instead, the FPR 2010 applied provisions of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (&#8216;the CPR 1998&#8217;) or the predecessor County Court Rules 1984 (which were preserved in Schedule 2 to the CPR 1998) on these matters, with modifications.</p>

Those new provisions are being made in part to reflect the fact that Her Majesty&#8217;s Courts and Tribunals Service (&#8216;HMCTS&#8217;) will be largely centralising its handling of applications for such orders into a limited number of &#8216;County Court Money Claims Centres&#8217;.

These Rules insert new Parts 39 and 40 into the FPR 2010. The new provisions set out how applications should be dealt with in the family court and High Court in family proceedings. Largely, the new Parts reflect the provisions that were in place before these Rules came into force, but the wording of the provisions has been simplified and modernised. The wording has also been modified as appropriate to reflect operational practice in the courts. Where the procedure to be followed under the FPR 2010 is intended to mirror that to be followed under the revised CPR 1998, the wording of the FPR 2010 largely mirrors that used in the revised CPR 1998.&#8221;</p>

Or, was it an oversight that although (i) FPR 28.2 referred to CPR 45.8 and (ii) Table 5 below CPR 45.8 included fixed costs for final charging orders, the rules to which the relevant row of Table 5 referred, being part of CPR 73 and not part of FPR 40, were no longer apt? In my judgment, the latter conclusion is the correct one. There was no intention, by a side-wind, to do away with the fixed costs regime as it applied to final charging orders.</p>

Thus, in appropriate cases, the court retains its discretion to order such costs as are appropriate. That said, the fixed cost regime applies, so to speak, in default if the court does not otherwise order. CPR 45 recognises that many sets of proceedings brought in court will be in the nature of debt collection exercises. Many such claims will not involve the use of independent solicitors but will be handled internally by the claimants in question. In many such cases the claimants will not incur significant costs and may well not want to incur further costs arguing that they are entitled to more than the fixed amounts. CPR 45 applies amounts and formulas to determine what the fixed costs are in any case. Thus, in a claim such as the present, where the value of the claim exceeded &#163;5,000, the fixed cost is &#163;100.</p>

The defendant obviously knew that Glovers were involved and they knew, because they had been so warned, that proceedings could be commenced at any time without further notice, particularly given that its solicitors had put forward a potential defence, and it must or should have appreciated that significant costs could be incurred if High Court proceedings were issued.

If they are right, and the claimant is not entitled to the final order, that is all well and good.

For example, if the application results in a third party debt order being made, do the fixed costs for an application for a third party debt order apply? The current position is unclear. We do not consider it would be fair for the fixed costs for specific methods of enforcement to apply. Those fixed costs are based on the steps required for those specific applications, which will not be replicated on a general enforcement application. The course of a general enforcement application is not easy to predict as a great deal depends on the level of cooperation from the debtor. For example, cross examination may or may not be required, the court may or may not need to exercise its powers to make information requests or information orders. For that reason, we suggest that either no fixed costs apply or a new fixed cost designed for the general enforcement application is provided. However, we consider it likely that the court would often need to depart from any fixed costs scheme on a general enforcement application.&#8221;</p>

He also noted that in family proceedings permission is required if a person seeks to enforce payment of arrears which fell due more than twelve months before proceedings to enforce the payment are begun: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/32" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.32</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref>. That can have the effect of forcing an applicant&#8217;s hand, encouraging them to make an application even when in civil proceedings they might be more patient before incurring the costs of applying to enforce.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">It seems to me that these matters can be relevant to the question whether to &#8216;order otherwise&#8217;, but matters to which I should give only limited weight: I must assume that the usual circumstances of family financial orders were in the draughtsperson&#8217;s mind when deciding that CPR 45.8 (or, now, CPR 45.23) would apply in family proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">Mr Harvey also pointed to the conduct of the Husband since the time the interim charging order was made: the Husband did not concede the application; and did not serve any evidence to oppose it. The Wife&#8217;s solicitors repeatedly wrote to him but &#8211; with the exception of providing some dates to avoid for the final hearing &#8211; the Husband did not engage in their requests that he explain how and when he would pay the sums he owes. However, these points do not seem to me to support the Wife&#8217;s case for an &#8216;order otherwise&#8217;: the Husband&#8217;s inaction did not increase the Wife&#8217;s costs, nor, indeed, does such inaction take this case outside the norm for final charging orders.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">Mr Harvey made the point that, since the enforcement application had begun by way of a general enforcement application, the interim charging order had been made following a hearing, and not &#8211; as would be usual under CPR 73 or FPR 40.4 &#8211; as a without notice application, dealt with by the court on the papers. It seems to me that that is a factor which I can take into account when deciding whether to make an &#8216;order otherwise&#8217;, but only insofar as costs were incurred up to the making of the interim charging order. Where, as here, events since the making of the interim charging order were essentially as straightforward as they can be in any charging order case &#8211; service of the documents on the relevant parties; non-engagement by the debtor, with no evidence served in response; and then a short final hearing &#8211; the mere fact that the process began by way of a general enforcement application would not seem to me to disturb the underlying policy of the fixed costs regime, after the interim order was made.</p>

	      <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.79in">Mr Harvey submitted that this was a case of deliberate non-payment by the Husband. The Husband agreed in December 2018 to pay a lump sum of &#163;1.1 million to the Wife in June 2023. He had 4&#189; years thereafter to arrange his affairs but instead, as I held in my judgment in this case last December, the Husband took commercial risks, including lending significant sums (in excess of the Lump Sum owed) to companies of which he is the 100% shareholder. That was a choice the Husband made, preferring to take the risk over other options available to him (including marketing Flat 5A for sale). Moreover, at the hearing before me last December, the Husband made an open offer to pay &#163;1.1 million to the Wife in February 2024, in full and final settlement. Despite this indication that the Husband could pay, no money has been paid at all &#8211; even by way of part-payment.</p>

This is the third enforcement application the Wife has had to bring. The Wife&#8217;s first application was made on 25 January 2019; that had the desired effect, and Roberts J ordered on 28 February 2019 that it be adjourned with liberty to restore, and that the Husband pay the Wife&#8217;s costs of the application. The Wife&#8217;s second application was issued on 19 May 2020. Again Roberts J ordered that the Husband pay the Wife&#8217;s costs of the application.</p>

In addition to the open offer referred to at sub-paragraph i) above, the Husband had sought to postpone the hearing on 22 April 2024 without any good reason. This risk of unforeseen last-minute complications in the application had justified an unusually long (&#189; a day) time estimate for the present hearing.</p>

He said he had acted honourably, he just needed time to pay. He did not think it fair that he was being asked to pay sums, including for the maintenance of his daughter, when his daughter (now aged 19) had not had contact with him for three years. He suggested that it was really the Wife&#8217;s lawyers driving this enforcement application, and that he objected to paying, indirectly, for their fees. Overall, he submitted that the recoverable costs had been fixed at &#163;110, and that is all that should be awarded.</p>

I ordered that the Wife recover her costs of the application, assessed on the indemnity basis. I accepted the submissions of Mr Harvey that the long history of the Husband&#8217;s obstructive behaviour took this case well outside the norm.</p>
