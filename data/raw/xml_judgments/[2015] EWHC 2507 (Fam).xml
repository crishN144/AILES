	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">Between 27 October and 7 November 2014 I heard evidence over what was intended to be the final 10-day hearing of this long-running financial remedies application by Mrs Nichola Anne Joy (W). Although I had made provisional provision for the application to continue into the following week that was frustrated by the unavoidable commitments of counsel in the case, and their written final submissions orally supplemented could not be concluded until 2 and 3 December.  On 26 February 2015 I distributed this judgment in draft form to Mr and Mrs Joy and by mid-May the process of sifting proposals for revision was completed. I heard further submissions in relation to the form of the order, costs and Mr Joy's appeal permission application on the earliest available dates, 17 and 18 June. My conclusions on those issues are appended to the main judgment which I now hand down. I impose no embargo on publication of this judgment which, I suggest, should for ease of identification be cited as <span style="font-style:italic">Joy v Joy-Morancho and others (No 3) </span>to differentiate it clearly from my two interlocutory judgments in March and April 2014 which have been published respectively as <a class="Hyperlink" href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2015/455.html"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2015/455" uk:canonical="[2015] EWHC 455 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWHC 455 (Fam)</ref></a> and <a class="Hyperlink" href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2014/3769.html"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2014/3769" uk:canonical="[2014] EWHC 3769 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWHC 3769 (Fam)</ref></a>.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">Between December 2014 and February this year I considered carefully the extent of the issues and evidence necessary to establish my conclusions on the principal issue of fact I have to decide. That is whether or not the situation described by Mr Joy (H) is accurate so that he is in truth and in fact able for the foreseeable future to pay only modest periodical payments to W and their three children, but nothing whatever by way of capital award. That proposition and that outcome depend upon whether H really faces the financial ruin he maintains overwhelmed him as a result of what he describes as the day of reckoning imposed on him by the trustees of the New Huerto Trust (NHT). Those trustees now pursue him and all those assets to which he can lay claim (and more), so he will be left without substance. His debts therefore exceed by far any assets available or likely to become available to him. His case is moreover that he has been permanently and irrevocably excluded from any potential future benefits from NHT.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">NHT is a trust H (as settlor) established in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) in December 2002. The trust had until recently as its trustee a Hong Kong based management company Royal Fiduciary Group (RFG) of which Tim Bennett (TB) is a director. RFG has merged with or been acquired by the Third Respondent, another offshore trust corporation of which TB has become a director, but there is no need to distinguish between the two for present purposes. TB does very clearly emerge as the human face and mind of the trustees, taking the lead in speaking for them and in informing and forming RFG's decisions in relation to NHT and H. I do not believe I will in practical terms commit any error if for shorthand I refer to the trustee of NHT either as RFG or as TB: and do not refer again by name to the Third Respondent which has come but latterly on the scene. The protector of the trust is a long-standing Dubai-based friend of H, Mr Richard Smith (RS). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">Only after resolving where I believe the truth lies on that primary issue of fact &#8211; whether H's plight is genuine or a contrived facade - can I proceed to consider the by no means straightforward question what capital provision, if any, in the context of a global award should be made for W; and then how she may be able to receive it if, as seems inevitable in the circumstances of this case, payment is not facilitated by those who may seek to delay or to thwart her.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">The documentation prepared for this hearing was voluminous and extended by its conclusion (including some supplemental bundles from an earlier hearing for which I myself had asked) to over 20 ringbinders. The conduct of the case would have been more comfortable for all if I had required one or even two core bundles to be prepared, and I blame myself for not including a pre-trial direction to that effect. My purpose in mentioning this is not to rail but simply to explain how it is that to make sense of the rival contentions on what I have described as the primary factual question there are many issues which might be construed to point in one direction or the other. But there are others, more limited in their number, which seem to me to be incongruously inconsistent with what might be expected. It is upon the latter that I will concentrate. I will quote rather more extensively from transcripts of evidence and from documents than is normal in a judgment such as this, because so often the flavour of what is written and was spoken has contributed to my overall sense of what is credible and what is not. </p>

As an alternative route to the same destination W at a very late stage of pre-trial preparation (indeed shortly after the pre-trial review in September 2014) applied to set aside pursuant to section 37 of the Matrimonial Causes 1973 what she asserts were dispositions of cars within the Portfolio made in favour of Anthology by H. It was for the purposes of the avoidance of disposition application that the trustees of NHT and the company Anthology were joined as respondents, but neither was represented at the hearing nor actively participated in the proceedings. The value of the Car Portfolio on the open market has not been established, but seems likely to be of the order of &#163;20m. If a section 37 order were made W would then seek orders for the transfer or the sale of the relevant cars; and would give credit against her lump sum award for any proceeds of sale she might realise.</p>

Milner Street was, it seems, acquired in November 1999 and may have a negative equity; George Street was acquired in 2010. The residual value of these two properties might be of the order of &#163;4.5m. No representative of GPH Ltd attended the hearing nor did that company participate in the proceedings.</p>

Both his first childless marriage, his morale and his finances were at a low ebb. Although the state and the extent of H's relationship with his first wife Bobbie (W1) became the subject of some dispute before me in the context of the issue when it was that H and W's relationship became serious enough for marriage to be in contemplation, documents establish that W1 instituted divorce proceedings in England in March 2001 and that decree absolute dissolved their marriage and a clean break financial order was made in October of the same year. </p>

Their home was primarily in Bequia but since about mid-2010 in the South of France. They have 3 sons ranging in age from 9 to 4. H still occupies the ch&#226;teau (Ch&#226;teau T) which was their final matrimonial home, a sumptuous 6-bedroom luxury residence on which much has been expended since its purchase. W lives nearby in rented accommodation, and the children have been spending time with them both as directed by extensive litigation concerning them which has taken place in the French courts, and which continues. </p>

H's response was to challenge the jurisdictional basis on which she relied, namely that they were both at that date domiciled in this jurisdiction. H's case as to his domicile in its final manifestation was that he had acquired a domicile of choice in Spain, and for that purpose it was for him to show by clear and cogent evidence that he had forsaken the country of his domicile of origin, ultimately conceded by him to be England, for Spain. That, if it had been found to be the case, would have deprived the English court of jurisdiction to hear the divorce proceedings and to embark upon the determination of financial remedies. </p>

One of those advising H was TB. He had since some date in the early 90s (and thus for a considerable period before NHT was created) been one of H's tax and trust advisers and was much engaged in and was an active contributor to the discussions which over many years attended H's flexible and fluid rehearsal for presentations of his residence and domicile position to HMRC. </p>

The purchase was made with NHT funds and taken in the name of a St Vincent company, Blue Orchid, wholly-owned by NHT. There appears to have been no formal agreement whereby the family had that property available to them, which they did until H's relationship with TB and the trust became (one would have thought, in the light of TB's actions) terminal in November 2013. TB, H maintains, in effect ordered him to go there for a week over the Christmas period in 2013 to clear the property of what was left of the family's possessions. W suggests that the property is worth US$4m, having been acquired (she maintains) for US2$m. However accurate these figures may be, Alta Vista is clearly a substantial property whether as a primary or (as latterly) just a secondary home. In May 2013 H maintained that he needed the ability to draw &#8364;3,000 per month for expenses related to Bequia.</p>

The funds for this were drawn down by H from a separate EFG facility, again backed by an NHT guarantee in turn supported by the back-to-back deposit of cash and/or securities. The property was purchased in his own name. It cost CHF2.6m. A contract for its sale for CHF2.55m was made on 28 September 2012 but with completion of the transaction ultimately deferred until 31 December 2014. In the events which have happened the entire net proceeds will go to NHT. In order to maintain his Swiss resident status H still retains the tenancy of a 4-bedroom flat in an apartment block at Leukerbad at a monthly rental of CHF2000, about &#163;16,000 annually.

The plan was to hold half that fund to meet contingencies, and to draw down over the anticipated seven years of their French sojourn for the family's day-to-day living expenditure at the rate of &#8364;25,000 per month, the amount transferred to H's French banking account. </p>

This came in part from H's own capital reserves and in part by way of drawdown from the EFG facility. The money spent by H has been treated as an interest-free loan (standing currently at some &#8364;2.5 million) to the SCI for a fixed period till May 2030. When their youngest son was about nine months old, in June 2011, the shareholding of the SCI was varied so that the three children between them own 90% and H only the remaining 10%. W has never held any shares in the SCI. If the property were now to be sold at the value which H attributes to it of &#8364;3.6 million it can be calculated that after the expenses of sale H's 10% would only produce something under &#163;50,000. The amount owed to him by way of loan would he says be swallowed up in the claim which, in the circumstances which have arisen, NHT is pursuing against him and all the assets available to him for the formidable sum of US$7,060,000. And indeed it does seem that very recently Swiss lawyers acting for NHT have confirmed that NHT intends to pursue the entirety of H's (and it would seem also the children's) interest in the property. </p>

H remained a potential beneficiary (with their children) of NHT until the move to France. Fiscal considerations (about which TB amongst others advised H at a time when what he described as the 'French roadmap' was being charted) dictated that he (and indeed the 3 children) should be excluded from benefit, initially for a fixed (although revocable) period until 2017. He and they would thus be temporarily distanced from the trust and so should receive no benefits from NHT while that disentitlement remained operative. Planning for this was on the basis that H's sabbatical would be not for one year in seven, but for a full seven. The family's living costs would ostensibly be covered by monthly payments of &#8364;25,000 into a French banking account. </p>

In December 2011 she moved to live in rented accommodation nearby and the parties have since then not lived under the same roof. In January 2012 divorce proceedings instituted by H in France were stayed by the French court, no doubt to await the outcome of H's challenge to the English jurisdiction. For much of the rest of that year the parties engaged in largely parallel proceedings concerning interim financial provision and provision of legal fees, and the French court ordained that the children should spend equal time with each of them.</p>

The letter pointed out to H that neither he nor RFG had notified the bank of his changed status until 19 August 2013, and in particular that EFG was not informed of it when it entered into a guarantee dated 22 December 2011 whereby RFG guaranteed H's liabilities up to CHF25m nor when it agreed on 20 January 2012 to increase the facility from CHF20m to that higher amount.</p>

RFG, the letter continued "no longer have 'full power and authority' to pledge the assets of NHT for the purposes of lending to you." From this it seems clear that the reasons why at that point EFG saw themselves as entitled to call in the loan were the trustees' failure to notify the bank that H had ceased to be a beneficiary in August 2010, with the necessary consequence that using trust assets to guarantee and support facilities of up to CHF25m to continue to be made available to H would constitute a breach of trust on the part of RFG/TB.</p>

In a later letter of 8 November 2013, in effect on the eve of the next hearing, they relayed that "there have been informal discussions between our client and Mr Stocker of EFG to see if the loan facility can be revived. As a result of the default Mr Stocker does not presently have the authority to restore the facility, however, he has indicated that if the injunction is discharged the bank is likely to reverse its call on the loan and allow drawings to continue to be made." It was H's case at the 11 November hearing that the position remained as stated in that letter, and that no further elucidation or confirmation had been or could that day be obtained. H at no point in the course of that hearing represented it as guaranteed that the previous arrangements would be reinstated.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">It was only some time later that it came to light that the plan to oust H permanently from all benefit from the trust was not rapidly hatched in the immediate aftermath of the EFG foreclosure. In mid-December 2013 Withers ceased to act and at the turn of the year Sears Tooth (ST) agreed to act for W. In March 2014 on the internet ST happened upon a judgment of Bannister J, sitting in the Commercial Division of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court, who, following an application (to which, again, RFG was the only party) heard submissions from counsel for the trustees on 16 October 2013 seeking approval for a proposed deed designed to exclude H permanently and irrevocably from any benefit under NHT. On 8 November 2013 Bannister J refused permission, but his judgment concluded: "If the Trustee considers that the reasoning in this judgment is fallacious, there is nothing to prevent it from executing a deed in the form of the draft and arguing for its effectiveness as against any party concerned to attack it. If it succeeds, no harm will have been done by this Court's refusal of sanction." Within 3 weeks of that determination RFG did just that on 26 November, executing a deed to the same effect but in somewhat amended form from the one of which Bannister J had disapproved.</p>

The motive for that was transparently (and indeed was patently described by TB to H and SDM at that Hong Kong meeting in December) to protect trust assets from any risk of successful attack by W or invasion by English court order. The actions of EFG allowed RFG to go in effect one considerable step further, and for NHT itself pre-emptively to pursue those assets in H's name to protect them from similar attack or invasion.</p>

The counter-indemnity letter describes the Facility as "the banking facility previously granted to me in [EFG's] facility letter dated 30 March 2010." TB's letter gave notice that RFG "will be instructing lawyers in both France and in Switzerland to seek immediate <span style="font-style:italic">saisie conservatoire </span>and to commence formal recovery<span style="font-style:italic"> ('poursuite') </span>proceedings." The enclosed  counter-indemnity bears the date 30 August 2010 which I observe is the day before the date of the deed of appointment (referred to in the preamble to the November 2013 exclusion deed) whereby the Trustees are said to have "revocably declared and appointed that the Settlor [H] (as "Class A Beneficiary") ceased to be eligible to receive benefits from the Trust for the period of seven years from [31 August 2010]." The counter-indemnity could thus plausibly be seen to fit into the rearrangements made to avoid exposure, on the family's move to France, to French wealth tax, the <span style="font-style:italic">imp&#244;t de solidarit&#233; sur la fortune</span>.</p>

But it is on any view impossible, it seems to me, to construe the document as imposing on H liability to pay the trust a sum calculated by the suggested value of assets owned by him but purchased with funds from that source: as were those assets in France and in Switzerland which had become free of encumbrance to EFG as a result of the loan accounts being called in and the facility being discontinued.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">H was able to salvage only &#8364;80,600 from the wreckage at EFG, and transferred those funds to his French banking account. His position was that he would continue so long as he could to pay the &#8364;3600 monthly representing the amount of the French child maintenance order, and the rent on their home. At the end of November 2013 H was said to be "now taking steps to find liquidity and will revisit the issue of maintenance again at that point. Unless your client agrees this interim position our client will have no other option than to make an application for a variation of the MPS order." I observed in passing in a judgment I handed down on 5 March 2014 that, if as H in correspondence and in his most recent filed statement suggested, he was down to his last few euros then it was hard to see how he would be able for long to afford life at Ch&#226;teau T without recourse to extraneous resources. But who can say what TB and NHT will achieve in pursuit of the avowed intent to clear H out, if they can, of the &#163;2.07m which the schedule shows as the combined worth of his 10% share in the SCI and his loan account with the company? As at the end of October 2014 his (negative) asset schedule includes borrowings from friends, acquaintances and family totalling some &#8364;162,000 for whom repayment, on the face of it, would seem far distant if ever to be achieved. </p>

As will be seen H, on the face of it equally indigent in cash flow terms, has been largely able to fund the bulk of his legal fees, certainly in this jurisdiction, although it seems to me that they are likely to have been substantially greater in total than W's. His asset schedule amongst his debts shows &#163;166,000 as his outstanding indebtedness in respect of legal costs at the commencement of the hearing before me. Since the EFG/NHT tap was turned off in November 2013 the only source of significant liquidity available to H of which I am aware has been his 1928 Bentley.

This H maintains was the only motor vehicle of significant value in his personal beneficial ownership as opposed to the significant number of others in the Car Portfolio (many of them of significantly more considerable value) which were just registered in his name but which never belonged to him. He apparently drove the Bentley regularly when at Ch&#226;teau T. I have formed the distinct impression over the course of my dealings with H and this car that it was high in his affections, although not sufficiently in his mind when in May 2013 he failed to include it in a list of his worldwide assets worth more than &#163;100,000, nor in July 2013 when he omitted to mention it in his Form E: an error however soon corrected on his behalf the following month.</p>

The loan was to be secured by the deposit with the bank of the vehicle's registration certificate. This had the effect, while the loan subsisted, of reducing the realisable value of the vehicle to H, or indeed to W were she to seek to enforce any award against it. Yet it would have been open to H simply to make equivalent provision for this contingency from that very US$1m contingency fund which he had explained was covered by his own US$2.1m deposited back-to-back to secure his overdraft at EFG.</p>

Once EFG had called in the loan and repaid itself from NHT assets the full value of the Bentley once more became available to H. That was apparent to Withers who on 28 November sent a fax pointing out that "since we assume that your client's Bentley is no longer pledged to EFG and is a free asset, it is incumbent upon him to take all steps to sell the vehicle. We await hearing from you that this is in hand and by way of moving matters forward will have joint conduct of the sale. Although your client has valued the car at &#163;400,000, we have evidence to suggest that it is worth closer to &#163;1m." This was the same month that for H it had been written that he was "now taking steps to find liquidity." The suggestion was never taken up nor substantive response at that stage provided. That the Bentley was "free" seemed also clear to RFG as it features in the list of to-be-pursued assets referred to in correspondence and at the 3 December meeting. </p>

It matters not whether that arrangement was immediately effective, but on 13 December 2013 it was formalised by a deed between H and Beckmans. None of this was disclosed to W or her solicitors until the existence of the charge was, I must say inappropriately casually, described in a letter dated 31 January 2014.

On its final page TB "reminded SDM that the Trustees had recently secured injunctions in the French Courts (<span style="font-style:italic">saisie conservatoire</span>) over H's assets in France."

In both documents she described her understanding as being that in communications between the lawyers acting in France for H and their counterparts acting for NHT the latter were informed of Beckmans' prior charge. She continued that following that, in August 2014 "I was contacted by TB on behalf of the Trustees who informed me that they had been unaware of my firm's prior charge and therefore they had been actively looking for and have found a buyer for the Bentley at a price that exceeded the market value." Such an assertion as to the duration of TB's and RFG's state of ignorance of the Beckmans' charge would have been untrue, and moreover untrue to the knowledge of SDM, given what TB's own Notes of the April 2014 Hong Kong meeting recorded her as having then told him.</p>

At that stage the negotiations related to the price at which RFG would buy out Beckmans' charge, but they became tripartite and H was necessarily involved when it emerged that the trustees were saying they had a buyer to whom they could sell on the vehicle and still make a profit over and above the ultimately agreed effective price &#163;650,000. SDM in her affidavit said that the trustees were not prepared to disclose exactly how much they had been offered for the Bentley, and that she does not know the identity of the purchaser or the selling price. None of this was probed with SDM in oral evidence at the hearing, I should make it clear. The documentation in relation to the purchase by NHT was concluded on 10 September.  </p>

The previous day as appears from a copy invoice from Anthology the Bentley was sold to a purchaser in New Jersey for US$1.06m, which may have provided the trust with some minimal profit. That document (and others previously withheld by TB) only became available at the beginning of December on the day before final submissions were to be made. The financial outturn for H and his solicitors was that Beckmans were able to take payment for outstanding liabilities from H amounting to over &#163;192,000; to pay disbursements to counsel and others of just under &#163;340,000; and to remit just under &#163;17,000 to H. He does however have the additional benefit of knowing that he owes NHT &#163;100,000 less than he otherwise might.</p>

The holding order agreed after the 6 February hearing provides that H may use the airplane to discharge existing contractual obligations and that he may enter into negotiations with the prospective purchaser in relation to its sale provided (i) no concluded agreement for its sale is made by him without either W's written consent or further order and (ii) H shall keep W informed of any offers made in respect of the airplane and of the gist of any negotiations for its sale.

In April H acceded to RFG's suggestion that the claim be referred to arbitration and on 13 October, 2 weeks before the commencement of the final hearing in London, the arbitration award became available requiring H to pay the amount claimed, plus interest from 6 December 2013, and costs. The advocate for the trust thereupon applied to seize the Zermatt land and it is likely by now, if as predicted the sale was completed at the end of the year, that the proceeds will have passed to RFG. H gave as his reasons for agreeing to arbitration that the process would be speedier, and cheaper, than being pursued through the courts.</p>

This first emerges from the way in which the claim is formulated at paragraph 10 of the document, not only for that amount and interest, but that H "should also, in this regard, be expressly liable to continue paying additional claims." The same words appear at paragraphs 2 and 44, and it is clear from paragraph 86 and from the even more recent letter from the Swiss lawyers dated 17 November 2014 (see below at paragraph 80) that RFG did and do indeed contemplate making further claims. </p>

Until this letter only the value of H's 10% shareholding in the Ch&#226;teau T SCI (but not the children's 90%) was being pursued. One can only speculate how H has reacted to what he must necessarily regard as a further stab in the back from TB, bearing in mind his hope to be able to retain that property long-term as a home for the children. I must of course ask myself which is more likely: further evidence of H being sidelined, or window-dressing.</p>

H on the other hand says that for his part he did not regard their relationship as potentially enduring until at least two years later after Easter 2003 (when together they visited his parents who were then staying in Miami) and after he says they commenced living together on a regular basis from (he puts it at) September 2003. They did not in fact marry until February 2006. The significance to each of them of this particular area of contention is twofold. W's prospects of establishing that NHT is an ante-nuptial settlement susceptible to variation in these proceedings might be enhanced if marriage was truly in contemplation when the trust was incorporated in December 2002; whereas if H is correct that proposition becomes less tenable. Furthermore, W must apprehend her case to share in the wealth produced by H is greater (were I to find that it is indeed wealth to which I can have regard in these proceedings) on her presentation of the relationship's history, whereas conversely he might hope to demonstrate that she was not for him a significant adult in the early stages of his wealth generation once LCAL, incorporated in June 2004, started business towards the end of that year.</p>

What she says must be subjected to close scrutiny and approached with a degree of scepticism having regard to the many extravagant and often inconsistent observations to which she committed herself. That of course is not to say that a great deal of what she told me was not true, or that it may not have contained some substance however exaggerated. Nor, self-evidently, does it follow that whenever H gave a different account I should take it as accurate.

I do not believe that she believes that a loan she made to H of &#163;5000 in 2002, which he repaid with interest, contributed in any way to the start-up of LCAL. I do not accept that many of the inconsistencies she betrayed resulted from losses in translation or from the fact that the subject of a line of questioning happened a long time ago. The topics in question ranged from what she was told by H and/or what she believed to be the progress of his divorce from W1;  the year in which she became first aware of the existence of NHT; who threatened whom on a particular occasion and whether with a knife (large or small), a corkscrew or nothing at all; and whether or not, and then (having admitted it was not never) how often, she had abstracted emails or other documents online or from his computer which found their way into the French proceedings. I bear in mind (as part of the evidence in the domicile proceedings) her surreal presentation of an email exchange involving H and a woman he says was an innocent acquaintance as erotic when there was nothing remotely erotic to be read out of it, and the frenzy to which that belief drove her.</p>

It was represented to me that there might be questions as to the admissibility of that evidence in the French proceedings, and I was anxious to do nothing which might by a side wind prejudice the French Court's investigation of any such objection. Furthermore I came to the view that neither in relation to my evaluation of W's financial entitlements nor in relation to credit would I be additionally assisted by reaching a conclusion on the issues raised by the recordings.

W repeatedly replied that she was at a loss to establish dates and durations, that she could not say or that she could not remember. She describes them as going on extended boat trips shortly after they first met at which point matrimony was already in the air even though references to it may have been more flirtatious than serious. H says that the sailing trips which she describes took place in 2003 rather than in 2001, and denies that he ever suggested that as captain of the boat he was in a position to celebrate their marriage at sea. I think it unlikely that he did so, but if indeed he did then at the stage of their acquaintance at which W places it I would not treat this as contributing any scintilla of nuptial element to the trust. But I am not persuaded either that for a period of about four months in 2002, after his divorce from W1 and its financial consequences had been resolved, he and W1 resumed cohabitation in Bequia to see whether they might restore their relationship, a proposition which he advanced for the first time only a fortnight before the final hearing and which (although she had not been on the island at that time) did seem to be the first which W had heard of it.</p>

As neither of his parents is French he did not at birth acquire French citizenship. As both of them were born outside England and as the law then stood he did not at birth acquire English citizenship. He was stateless, and the marriage of his parents was one of the steps they had to take in order to be able to bring him to England. His British passport was issued the day after their marriage.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">The information available about NHT is limited because of the stance taken by TB/RFG and authorised by Bannister J's order of 28 June 2013, that RFG has no obligation to provide any information to H. That has not however seemed an obstacle which has prevented TB from releasing documentation when he regarded it as helpful to NHT to do so. Indeed he went so far, in his Note of the 3 December 2013 Hong Kong meeting, as to say that:</p>

The flow has been sporadic and incomplete. This has particularly been the case in relation to the very late disclosure, effectively on the eve of the hearing and indeed at its conclusion, of documentation which has made clear the structure of the Car Portfolio with which I shall deal as the next topic. Mr Pointer's complaint that the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37</ref> application was in itself so late instituted does not meet this point, although he is it seems to me correct in asserting that until then the focus had primarily been upon the extent to which the vehicles constituted an available resource for H. The Special Agency Agreements (described from paragraph 128 below onwards), for instance, were documents only available at a very late stage which were key to an understanding of the arrangements documented between H and Anthology. Even before the fall-back <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37</ref> application was instituted it was very evident that these arrangements and their effect were the subject of probing and pertinent scrutiny.</p>

Whereas one might have expected that letters of wishes from H to RFG (although not of course binding the trustees in the exercise of their discretion) might have supported various of the otherwise unsupported propositions upon which they have relied from time to time as to H's long-term intentions regarding the trust he had settled, reference is only made in passing to one of them, said to be the most recent, dated 18 October 2011 whereby H apparently notified RFG formally (although it is inconceivable that he had not told them earlier) of the divorce proceedings which W had commenced the previous July. One would suppose that something must have been changed in that expression of H's wishes by comparison with what they had been previously, but their latest version is said by TB to have reflected no change, and H maintained he did not know what was in the document he signed (as to which I do not believe him).</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.2in">It is of course the case that trustees' duty is to their beneficiaries and that they may be entitled and even obliged (or at least as in this case authorised) to withhold information and documentation in situations such as this. They are also of course entitled and sometimes obliged to avoid involvement in proceedings such as these, conducted in what for the trust is an alien and must sometimes appear a hostile environment. NHT and its trustees have been entirely entitled to decline to submit in any way to this court's jurisdiction, and TB was free to decline (as he did) this court's invitation that he attend the hearing. But the fact that those duties and obligations, and the choice whether or not to attend, do exist does not render the trustees or TB immune from the court's findings drawn from such evidence as it does have available. Nor should a court shrink from drawing justifiable conclusions from that evidence which the trustees or TB may find unpalatable, nor abstain from expressing them because the distance they have kept from the enquiry entails that if they are criticised the trustees and TB were not here to speak in their own defence.

That trust was preceded by another trust, the Huerto Trust (HT) settled by H in 1988 (or it may be in 1998). Little is known about HT except that it most likely contained within its structure GPH Ltd (the company which in 1999 acquired the Milner Street property). In 2001 TB/RFG took over as trustees of HT. H in his past written and oral evidence has been inconsistent in his assertions about the role which HT may have played in protecting assets from W1 at the time of their marriage breakdown. At times H has denied that HT fulfilled this function, whereas at others he accepted in his evidence what one of his professional advisers had noted to be the case some years ago, that HT did play such a defensive or deflective role.</p>

He had been involved in at least two punishing sets of arduous litigation arising from his commercial activities. He had retreated and withdrawn to live in Bequia at the end of 2000. After his financial settlement with W1 was finalised he was, he maintains, without capital or income. He was living a very simple life supported financially in part by his parents and (as it were) licking his wounds, recharging his batteries and on the lookout for fresh entrepreneurial inspiration.</p>

He was paid a salary, H said, starting in about September 2007 and ending with the payment in January 2010. His starting salary was US$20,000 per month, and in addition he received bonuses from LCAL. H maintains that the business was not initially hugely profitable but that it became so from about 2008 onwards. It would seem to follow that the US$2.1m which H deposited with EFG on his own back-to-back arrangement with the bank from and upon which he intended to finance family expenditure in France for up to 7 years was accumulated from late 2007 onwards but predominantly in the last two or so years before the move to France in 2010. Given the amount of H's salary and the limited period of about 2 1/2 years during which it seems it was paid it would seem again to follow that the bonuses he was awarded were prodigious.</p>

The evidence I have heard and read falls short of establishing that matters stood thus between the parties in December 2002. Despite the breadth and diversity of arrangements which have been held to fall within the meaning of a nuptial settlement for the purposes of this provision, there must always be some nuptial element.

He argues that from the passage commencing on page 15 of <span style="font-style:italic">Burnett </span>(quoted below) is derived the proposition that the settlement under consideration for the purposes of establishing its susceptibility to adjustment at the time of the divorce must at the time of its inception (in the case of an ante-nuptial settlement) have been in contemplation of that marriage, between those spouses. Ergo if the marriage in question was not at that time in contemplation, that is to say not looked forward to, then looking back at it cannot retrospectively change the settlement's characterisation from non-nuptial to nuptial. And that certainly was the view taken in the later case of <span style="font-style:italic">K v K </span>which, for Mr Bates to succeed, I would need to find was wrongly concluded. In <span style="font-style:italic">K v K </span>the conclusion (at [79] and [82]) was that <span style="font-style:italic">Burnett</span> "clearly establishes that a non-nuptial settlement cannot become a nuptial one."</p>

I think that this is so, but in my view the Court has no jurisdiction under s.192 of the Judicature Act, 1925, to vary an appointment in such a way that in the result the principal settlement is also varied although that settlement is not within s.192."</span></p>

Were it to be otherwise every truly dynastic settlement, bereft of nuptial character at the outset but providing benefits for an individual who subsequently becomes either a husband or a wife, would arguably become variable under section 24(1)(c) as soon as that individual, once married, received any benefits. I am satisfied that that is not the law, notwithstanding the breadth of attribution historically afforded to settlements treated as nuptial.</p>

The question does arise whether that route to variability is open in the case of an asset held within a company, having regard to the impact of the Supreme Court decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd &amp; Ors</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2013/34" uk:canonical="[2013] UKSC 34" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] UKSC 34</ref>, <a class="Hyperlink" href="https://shop.iclr.co.uk/Subscr/welcome.aspx?docId=XAC2013-2-415"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2013] 2 AC 415" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] 2 AC 415</ref></a>]. But it is not a question which I need resolve for present purposes. In <span style="font-style:italic">Ben Hashem</span> the element of the property which was arguably a nuptial settlement that was settled was not the property itself but only the husband's revocable right to occupy it. That as I have outlined earlier in this judgment seems also to be the only basis of H's ability to use this trust property as the family's principal and later its secondary home. The likelihood is that NHT's trustees have already terminated that licence, but even if not they have the ability to do so with relatively short-term and conclusive effect. No contemplable variation of settlement in relation to that (at best) transient and distant interest would hold realisable value for W even if firewall provisions in section 83A(13) and (19) of the (BVI) Trustee Ordinance did not frustrate the intent of any such order by restricting enforcement of foreign judgments arising out of matrimonial proceedings (as is the effect of those provisions according to Mr Pointer's final submissions).</p>

But there was never on the evidence any way in which either property could be said to have benefitted the parties qua spouses. I can see no avenue for making any order from which W might derive benefit from these properties and thus rule that no jurisdictional basis has been established for me to charge them with payment of any lump sum awarded to her, one of the suggestions made on her behalf. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">It is clear from his evidence and from documentation gleaned from the internet that H is an extremely enthusiastic participant, both as a wheeler and a dealer, at each season's Grand Prix and Concours d'El&#233;gance meetings in Europe and elsewhere. He is usually accompanied by a selection of wheels from the collection, and he prospects to find both potential sellers of desirable vehicles and possible purchasers at the right price of those which are for sale.  He was until it was closed in a position via the EFG facility to put down deposits or to conclude transactions. It is also very clear that, even if not exclusively, he is the person who largely organised car movements, maintenance and the logistics of their necessary paperwork. Ch&#226;teau T is at least from time to time the arrival departure and storage point of vehicles on their way to and from their destinations. He is absolutely without a doubt centrally involved in this multi-million pound activity, or has been until recently (by which I mean to include much of the period since his November 2013 permanent exclusion from trust benefits). Indeed it is unclear to me how many of the transactions necessary for this business to continue could be taken over by someone else.</p>

H has always maintained that he does not have in his possession or have access to trust documentation, and asserts that he has been astute to have nothing available, even via his computer, in France which might link him with the trust or its assets. However, I have been shown documents put in evidence in the French proceedings some of which may well have been prepared before the move to France imposed such precautions.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Dating from December 2010 is an insurance schedule addressed to H at his Swiss residence. It lists 34 vehicles of which most but not all are within the Car Portfolio, the few others being those which H accepts belong to the family, including the Bentley. The insured value of all these vehicles together comes to some CHF24m. There is no reference to the trust or to any company on the document.  H is described as the "Besitzer''of the vehicles, which I take in this context to signify no more than that he has an insurable interest in them. On the assumption that this document was issued on renewal of the insurance in October 2010 one would have expected some differentiation at least in the attribution as between H and NHT of the premium, bearing in mind that at this point neither he nor the children were entitled to benefit from the trust. This would be so whether or not the premium was paid from the EFG facility standing to H's credit. The amount due from H in respect of family vehicles would not have been inconsiderable, totalling roughly CHF1500.</p>

If a distinction was ever going to be drawn between the use made by H of the EFG accounts backed by the NHT guarantee/deposit arrangements which was for the benefit of the trust on one hand; and those funds drawn down against that facility which were used for Joy family acquisitions or expenditure: then one would have expected that as a matter of internal accounting an audit trail would have been established to maintain what in effect would have been the state of account as between H the individual, and H the special agent disbursing funds on behalf of and for the benefit of NHT. </span></p>

The apportionment issue just described had been discussed and, in my judgment, H's evidence had not been at all effective in dispelling the mystery of how that amount was arrived at. TB proved willing and able to provide through SDM documentation which has indeed been helpful in support of the case presented as to ownership of the Car Portfolio. In view of the documents which were produced as to car ownership I do not regard it as an adequate explanation for the failure to disclose anything to establish the extent of H's liability that RFG were entitled to produce nothing as a result of the order made by Bannister J. It would have been very much in the interests of the trust to demonstrate propriety and accuracy in relation to the claims it has pursued against H which have had the effect of leaving him bereft of capital.</span></p>

H during the course of evidence regularly referred when questioned on this topic to a schedule of assets he had produced back in May 2013.

He suggested that the cost of purchases for the Car Portfolio made up ''the bulk'' of the US$18.9m which TB said was the extent of the loss sustained by NHT when EFG enforced its guarantee. Asked to estimate how much that component of the loss was, he replied about US$12m, and then agreed that he had arrived at that amount by deducting 7 from 19. He also claimed that at the December Hong Kong meeting he had been shown some paperwork demonstrating how the amount claimed from him was calculated, but that he had not paid attention to it. He was, I have to say, surprisingly relaxed about the way in which what was said to be his liability had been established both as to the method and as to the amount. RFG, he said, were very good at maintaining records. He was unable to say whether amounts other than for car purchases expended by him on or in connection with the Car Portfolio had been taken into account, but seemed to wave that aside on the basis it would only amount to some $5000 or so.</p>

This was because Mr Pointer in re-examination of H on 26 March 2014 had afforded him an earlier opportunity to explain how the US$7.06m was composed, which it must be said H similarly lamentably failed to clarify. Nor could he explain to Mr Leech how a number of very obviously car-related and large debits to the account secured against the deposit of his own funds were treated, if at all, by any process of accounting, other than to say he thought that "some of the items [and individual items totalling more than &#163;250,000 had been identified] ought to be invoiced back to the trust." It was therefore obvious to all in court that H recognised that he should be given credit at some point against what he might otherwise owe in relation to the NHT-backed accounts. I asked him "how am I to know how much the trust owes you in relation to these huge amounts of money that they have never repaid you?" To which he replied "You could require me to do an exercise for you, my Lord, of analysis." But analysis came there none.</p>

It was put to him that the reality was that he had never had any genuine expectation that he would have to repay whatever amount he ended up borrowing, in effect from the trust via the EFG facility. When it was suggested to him that but for EFG's actions and financial claims a time would have come when the loans were one way or the other discharged other than by repayment, he denied that. He said that he would have expected to be able to repay from earnings and commission working as Anthology's special agent. And indeed no doubt if the salary and bonuses were large enough they might be employed to wipe out the debt, as payments to an employee by a company within a trust might be made legitimately even though advances of capital to discharge a loan should not be possible without breach of trust.</p>

In the meantime, as I have said, he hopes that the trustees would not force him and thus the children to leave their home at Ch&#226;teau T. </p>

Their youngest son will be just 5 next October. He proved wholly unable to advance any reason why he could not commence employment while living in France, resolutely relying upon his privilege to avoid explaining what advice he had been given on this topic by lawyers in Monaco. So I am left in the dark about that, and assume that potentially wider adverse tax consequences may be the reason. It is very clear that H orders his life and does not make a move without very full consideration of the tax implications, and that he and TB share two at least of the same horrors: paying anything that cannot be avoided to fiscal authorities, or to W.</p>

Their active involvement has at times has been quite intense, for instance during the course of protracted IR enquiries which involved the preparation and consideration of spurious scenarios considered for presentation to the tax authorities. H has clearly come to rely on TB not only for the financial and fiscal and trust advice which is his speciality, but also for guidance in how he should approach what he and TB by June 2010 had come to see as a troubled relationship between H and W. There is no doubt whose side TB took, and the note of a lunchtime meeting at Ch&#226;teau T in June 2010 which he prepared evinces his clear dislike for her (sentiments which, I should say, she clearly reciprocated).</p>

He made the reluctant concession (fully supported however by contemporaneous notes of what he told her made by another of his professional advisers much nearer the time) that HT played a defensive part in the arrangements he made at the end of that marriage. It is also clear that since the establishment by H of NHT in 2002 TB has played a leading role in its management. He has thus been there to manage the trust and to advise and assist H throughout the wealth accrual years of LCAL when (according to the evidence of H) something like US$100m accrued to NHT.</p>

But the venture was also firmly founded and grounded on personal attributes of H which were available to NHT once LCAL ceased air chartering operations and H embarked upon what he expected to be a sabbatical of seven or so years duration, with the shift of residence from Bequia first proposed as Switzerland but then translated to France. H has a passion for collecting these vehicles, driving them, and for parading with them on their own fashionable international circuit. He undoubtedly regarded them as his collection.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">The investment has proved lucrative for its owner. The example of the sale of one particular Alfa, purchased for US$2m and sold for US$5.8m, on its own establishes that. H let slip a comment in his evidence which I have highlighted in one of the extracts above (at paragraph 152) but was not picked up at the time: ''If ten cars were sold, the debt outstanding to EFG may be less." Car sales would however only reduce <span style="font-weight:bold">NHT</span>'s guarantee liability if their proceeds were paid to EFG in reduction of overdraft balances on the relevant accounts &#8211; which there was no evidence to suggest had ever occurred, and was an eventuality which had never been previously mentioned as part of the scheme of things. If H meant that car sale proceeds would have reduced <span style="font-weight:bold">his</span> overall debt to NHT then that suggests some profit-sharing or commission arrangement &#8211; which might possibly become payable via Anthology once H can resume his activities on a paid basis when these proceedings are behind him and he has sufficient time to do the job as TB would expect and require. It begs the question whether during his years in France, not able to be paid since he took up French fiscal residence in September 2010, he has built up any reserves of unpaid commission, for instance on the US$3.8m profit realised on that Alfa, sold in March 2013, to a man from Texas who conceived an instant desire to own that car when he saw it, with H beside it, at a race meeting.</p>

That period in fact covers virtually the whole lifetime of the Portfolio as, as H recounts it, it was only in 2009 that acquisition of the collection got underway. So one can understand how during this period he would have received no formal remuneration notwithstanding the enormous contribution he made to the selection, negotiation of purchase or sale and day-to-day management and administration of assets worth over, and possibly well over, US$20m. I have to ask myself whether and when H's day of reckoning with NHT for that, but for W's claims, would have arrived, and by what method he would have been recompensed.</p>

His and H's case is that he embarked on that without consultation with and without informing his long-term client and the settlor of NHT, the person who had made such valuable contributions to the development not only of the trust's first US$100m but also to the profits made through the Car Portfolio. It is clear on the evidence that this plan was hatched before and was independent of the EFG account closure (for instance having regard to the fact that the application for sanction of the proposed deed reached Bannister J in mid-October 2013). In the judgment he gave in November he recorded that the application "is designed to ensure that the assets of the Trust are not available to the Court in the English proceedings."</p>

He showed only intermittent anxiety about becoming dependent, again, on TB of whom at one point he said: ''My Lord, I&#8217;d just been deceived.

She invites me to conclude that what has been produced and presented is a stage-managed and crafted but fictional drama which has the underlying and collusive sub-text that H will when the dust settles return to a position where he has access, direct or indirect, to trust assets and to their value to meet his income and capital needs. She points to the hint in the 3 December meeting notes which suggest that when the time is ripe H may be taken on as an employee of the Trust or one of its businesses and paid a salary. She may have been surprised at the suggestion in those notes that were the children to be educated in England the embargo on their benefits from the Trust might be lifted so that funds could flow in their direction free from the ravages of at least French taxation. She might wonder what scope there may be, at a convenient time, for resettling this Trust in another which might more easily be able to meet H's needs. And she might remember that this ''New'' Trust itself replaced an earlier one to meet contingencies not yet fully made clear, but which prevailed at about the time of H's divorce and financial separation from his first wife.</span></p>

Their position is an elaborate charade, the stage management of which has been conducted ruthlessly and without regard to cost. I do not need to speculate how TB plans to re-establish the access H enjoyed to capital and income which previously was his albeit via elaborate financial arrangements designed no doubt initially for fiscal purposes to distance him from their source. I do not need to consider whether the exclusion deed could or could not be upset, nor whether the undisclosed opinions taken from leading Chancery counsel on the topic by H are soundly based if, consistent with H's case, he could not even have made the trust deed available for their consideration. I am confident that when the time is ripe and there is the will to get H out of this impasse where seemingly he is stuck in what on any realistic view would be inextricable penury, TB will find a way. </p>

Nor indeed need I, even if safely I felt that I should or could, try to form a view on the question whether Bannister J in his BVI Court might have reached a different conclusion in November 2013 if he had had the benefit of the submissions as to English trust law made to me, far less as to whether he might have approved the deed in the form in which it was so shortly thereafter executed. </p>

In bypassing their contribution for the reasons I have described I of course make no findings at all about whether any contrary view of the law might have been expressed if the time available had allowed Mr Bates and those assisting him to give detailed consideration to their propositions. It may well be that there would have been no contest, I do not know, but I do know that the propositions they state do not affect my conclusions about the underlying realities of H's case.</p>

He spoke of earning &#163;120,000 a year at the point, until the beginning of 2010, when he embarked upon his sabbatical. TB clearly values him highly as a potential employee of Anthology. The Car Portfolio appears to have fared prodigiously well under his tutelage. The commercial worth to that business of his knowledge, his contacts, his experience and his enthusiasm must in my judgment be at least &#163;200,000 a year at this stage, plus the prospect of whatever bonus arrangement is arrived at. I take his earning capacity at that figure as its minimum. [In the light of the application made by Mr Pointer at the June hearing for permission to appeal against the order for periodical payments, referred to below, it occurs to me that this last sentence lacks precision. H's earning capacity in Anthology's employ, the faculty upon which I have based that order, includes what I anticipate will be substantial bonuses: as to which, historically, see [99] above.]</p>

She envisaged continuing to rent, and in current circumstances will have no alternative but to do so. Her attempts to establish a budget are now out of date. So the best I can do without anything much by way of evidence to go on is to fix on a figure which it would be very reasonable for W to have available to meet her living costs, and those of the children while in her care. The order will be for H to pay W maintenance pending suit until decree absolute and thereafter periodical payments at the annual rate of &#163;120,000 per annum, payable monthly in advance during joint lives until she remarries or further order. H should continue to have credit for actual payments made in respect of her rent, if that is the system which still operates.</p>

I have already given reasons why a similar outcome precludes a final determination of W's outstanding claims at this stage, and I intend similarly to impose a supervisory regime in an attempt to achieve some balance of fairness between the parties. I have drafted provisions of the order to cover this aspect which I hope will prove workable, without imposing too onerous a reporting obligation on H. I do so on what I hope will prove to be understood as a requirement that unless only for reasonable clarification this is not intended to encourage W to embark upon any further full-scale investigation, unless of course that is directed by the court in the light of the available information.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.24in;text-indent:0.12in">The Piper aircraft similarly provoked full debate, and in particular as to the appropriateness if at all of what is designed, in the event of its sale, to prevent W from having a fair opportunity as against other contenders (primarily, of course, NHT) to have determined the merits of any claim she might make to receive or to participate in the distribution of the proceeds. No one at that June hearing dissented from the proposition that the court would have power to regulate dealings with the aircraft and with its proceeds in the context of a costs order against H, if made, which remained unsatisfied in whole or in part. I will explain below the basis upon which I do indeed propose to make such an order, and indeed to supplement it with an order for payment on account to give rise to an immediate liability which, in all the circumstances of this case, I do indeed think it appropriate to protect by means of such restraints. Although in the course of the hearing I indicated that this was an issue which we might discuss on another day if I did indeed make such a costs order, I think that the reality is that it was accepted on behalf of H that I have that power. I am extremely reluctant to envisage the need for a further hearing. If the situation arises where competing interests fall for determination, then of course it is possible that some priority demand or some consideration of fairness may require that the funds in question should go to some third party or indeed to H, rather than to W: but the intermediate restraint appears to me to be not only reasonable but fully justified in the circumstances of this case. I have drafted the paragraph of the order which deals with this, and which includes provision for anyone affected to make application to the court.</p>

But in fact that does not include the costs he incurred and has presumably paid when instructing his previous solicitors. So it would not be unreasonable to suppose that his costs of the financial proceedings come to about &#163;1 million, of which &#163;690,600 has been paid (&#163;650,000 of which it will be recalled from payments made direct to Beckmans in discharge of their charge over the Bentley), leaving &#163;178,500 still outstanding. Mr Pointer made it clear that H seeks no order for costs against W.

But, in overall terms, he concludes and submits that in relation to elements of the dispute for which W's costs come to &#163;170,680 the order made was "no order as to costs", behind which neither party can now seek to go.

Whether or not they incur that expenditure from their own separate sources the money ultimately comes from family resources, in the ordinary case, which may well fall for division. Thus, it is hoped, profligate expense will be less frequent. It has to be said that a number of cases in recent years indicate that this objective is often flagrantly not achieved, and this is indeed such a case. A peculiarity here however is that on the face of it a large proportion of the monies spent is said not to be available to either party: if one took his case at face value H's solicitors might well conclude there was little prospect of him being able to pay them that &#163;178,500 which on their figures he already owes them, without even taking into account the prospective costs of the appeal against these orders which he has expressed the wish to pursue.</p>

But what started the ball rolling down what became an increasingly slippery slope was, in my view, H's case designed to establish that the English court would have no jurisdiction to entertain the divorce, and in particular of course W's financial applications, because of his domicile in Spain alleged originally to be of origin, and subsequently of choice. Although in the circumstances of his acceptance that I should dismiss that challenge I delivered no judgment, I believe that within <span style="font-style:italic">this</span> judgment there are passages which clearly show what I concluded: that H with TB was engaged over a number of years in investigating how best an imaginative but fundamentally contrived and false case on his domicile could be made initially to the English tax authorities, and subsequently persisted in the in-court domicile enquiry. Such an attitude and an endeavour pursued with such vigour and at such expense inevitably provoke suspicion, so that it is hardly surprising that W's advisers and W herself did react. Slippery manoeuvres just as much as slippery slopes can be expected to bring out the truth of Newton's third law of motion: <span style="font-style:italic">For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction</span>.</p>

Freezing orders were entirely appropriate protection for W's advisers to seek on her behalf in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of H's disingenuous assault on jurisdiction. They incorporated limitations on H's spending from the EFG facility, and it would be entirely normal as a matter of practice for the bank to be served with the orders. I have already explained why in my view it was when the bank found out that the trustees had not been entitled to make loans to H after he had ceased, albeit temporarily, to be a potential beneficiary in advance of the family's move to France (which they discovered only when they conducted a review of the facility, that review admittedly prompted by service of the order), rather than the service of the order <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span>, which led ultimately to the withdrawal of the facility. So the repeated attempt to blame her for the ultimate collapse of the facility upon which the family's finances were engineered fails, in my view, and what really happened it is impossible to ascertain without knowing quite what part TB played (as to which see [37 to 40] above). </p>

But the true analysis is that it has not been until the final hearing that upon all the evidence I have been able satisfactorily to conclude that in fact H will in the future have funds from the trust by way of salary and bonuses as an employee rather than as a beneficiary made available to him as he has in the past, and as to which what would have been proper disclosure has never been made. The conclusions which underlie my finding that H has the ability to tap into this source and thus the faculty to pay the maintenance I have ordered were not conclusions which it was open to me to make at interim stages of the proceedings. </p>

This was a very long shot, as evidenced by the great difficulty W and her advisers placed in formulating a basis for the proposition. I have found there to be no such basis, and that plank of W's case therefore sank. Moreover I have made plain my assessment of W's credibility in the section to that effect from [86] onwards, and it is correct that in general terms I preferred what H had to say about the development of their relationship towards marriage, relevant as that was to the  settlement issue. </p>

H does still submit that TB's actions were not his responsibility and that they should not count against him when costs are considered: but again that ignores my finding that they were collaborators in the joint endeavour to do W down. This set aside application, and the associated alternative formulation that the Portfolio should be declared to be H's, both smack to me of the sort of reaction I have referred to above as to be expected if a wife (or a husband for that matter) is faced with a false presentation as gross as was here perpetrated.</p>

W has failed in a number of the specific applications she has made, but in light of my findings it is perhaps to be anticipated that in the overall balance it is H who may face a substantive costs order. I would like at this stage simply to observe that impecuniosity is no shield against the making of an order." That last was too unnuanced a statement, particularly (in situations to which FPR 28.3 applies) having regard to the requirement of rule 28.3(7)(f) that the court must have regard to the financial effect on the parties of any costs order. And so, it was submitted, that as W has failed to identify any source of funds with which to meet a costs award it would be plainly wrong to make an order against H, and moreover illogical and inconsistent having regard to my earlier observation [at 174] that to make a lump sum order against H would not encourage TB and the trust corporation to make the necessary funds available to him with which to me that obligation. The distinction is however that I have found that the flow of a salary and substantial bonuses will be reinstated (or another way found) so that H may maintain his living standards and meet whatever are his genuine liabilities, which as well as his costs liabilities to W will no doubt include those to his own lawyers. In short the requirement to have regard to the financial effect of a costs order on the parties has little if any impact in a case where the facts are found as here they have been. At least equal consideration, it seems to me, should in any event be given to the consequences, and the manifest unfairness, for W were I to accede to H's aspiration that I should make no order.</p>

Where one party hatches a wholly deceptive presentation, pursues it persistently to the conclusion, and is found to have done precisely all of that, then he or she should expect no quarter from the court when it comes to costs. Such conduct unravels all and can and should in an extreme case where the conclusions are clear have clear costs condemnation meted out as the court's response. Such cases are relatively few in number but this is such a case. Such cases should be fewer in number, and may become so if the costs outcome for such reprehensible conduct is clearly in prospective focus from the off.</p>

I impose it in this case because it is what I believe to be the fair, just and deserved order.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:-0.04in;text-indent:0.12in">I have not in this case had the opportunity (as I did in <span style="font-style:italic">Thiry</span>) of considering a full and detailed breakdown of the costs incurred by W, and therefore feel obliged to leave open the option of what no doubt would be a lengthy, complicated and fully contested assessment. But I can, I believe fairly, diminish the prospects that time (not least court time) and expense will be taken up in such a venture by adopting the following approach. Having regard to the very considerable disparity between the costs liability incurred by H with his lawyers in the English finance-related proceedings (and recognising that they his team were more numerous than those employed by W) of about &#163;870,000 overall, I will take the &#163;588,500 estimate for the bill run up by W, and within it Mr Bates' sum of &#163;417,829 for the ''costs at large'', as fair figures upon which to base my order. I take the view (which can only be impressionistic, but then in many ways that is of the essence of the broad and entirely fact-sensitive discretionary exercise which costs awards in this sort of situation must be) that H would be unlikely to achieve as much as a 20% reduction on detailed assessment, bearing in mind that the onus will be on him to establish unreasonableness rather than for W to surmount the test of proportionality.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:-0.04in;text-indent:0.12in">I will therefore adopt 80% of &#163;417,829 as the measure of the on account award I will make. This comes out as &#163;334,263. I have decided against allocating the &#163;70,000 received by Withers pursuant to the <span style="font-style:italic">A v A</span> order so as to set it off against this cost award. The order will therefore require H to pay &#163;334,263 to W within 14 days of this judgment <span style="color:#042939">being finally handed down. Interest at judgment debt rate will accrue from the date of the order, that is to say from the date of the costs award, pursuant to the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Vict/1-2/110/section/17" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 17</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Vict/1-2/110" uk:canonical="1838 (1 &amp; 2 Vict.) c. 110" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Judgments Act 1838</ref>.</span></p>

As to the periodical payments order, he referred to H as having no income as a reason why no order should have been made, and would like the Court of Appeal also to deal with the question whether in any event &#163;120,000 per annum (with credit for sums actually paid in relation to the French child maintenance order, and in respect of W's rent) is excessive. He also raised as a ground of appeal the disregard which he rightly anticipated I would apply to his arguments based upon FPR 28.3(7) and what he terms the illogicality of a costs order when seen in the light of what in the main judgment I have said about the unlikelihood of TB making money available to H for the purpose of paying it over to W.</p>

In it propositions were ventured which it was said the NHT trustees considered would assist to clarify misapprehensions in the draft judgment (effectively as far as [184] in this final version). I did not allow Mr Pointer to refer to or rely upon anything in the letter which I effectively therefore ruled inadmissible at that stage of the proceedings.</p>
