	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">In this matter I am concerned with the welfare of Z, born on 9 March 2013, aged three years-old.  The mother of Z is W, a citizen of a Member State of the EU.  The father of Z is Y.  Z is a party to these proceedings and is represented through a Children&#8217;s Guardian.  At present the father has supervised contact with Z at a contact centre.</p>

	  <num>2.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The substantive applications before the Court comprise an application by the father for a Child Arrangements Order and Prohibited Steps Order in respect of Z, issued on 18 September 2014 and an application by the mother for a Child Arrangements Order and an Order permitting her to remove Z temporarily from the jurisdiction.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_3">
	  <num>3.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">On the first day of this hearing I dismissed an application by the father for permission to withdraw his applications in respect of Z.  My reasons for dismissing that application are set out in a separate <span style="font-style:italic">ex tempore</span> judgment given on that date.  In short, I was not satisfied that it was in Z&#8217;s best interests to permit the father to withdraw his application in respect of his child.</p>
	  </content>

	<paragraph eId="para_4">
	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">That decision was taken within the context of this matter having been listed this week for a finding of fact hearing to determine the truth or otherwise of an allegation against the father that is relevant to his applications before the Court.  In summary, that allegation is that in 2000 the father perpetrated sexual abuse against X, the five-year-old daughter of the father&#8217;s then partner, N.  The father is not the father of X.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_5">
	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The father vehemently denies being the perpetrator of the sexual abuse endured by X, although, as I have said, immediately prior to the hearing listed to determine the truth or otherwise of that allegation, and immediately after the receipt of the expert report of Dr&#160;Rogstad (Consultant Physician and Honorary Senior Lecturer in Genitourinary Medicine) which I shall come to, the father sought to withdraw his application and to seek no orders in respect of Z, notwithstanding that he has been pressing for the same for well over a year.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in">I have at this hearing had the benefit of statements, and heard oral evidence from N (by video link), the father and the mother.  I have had the benefit of seeing the transcript of the video interview of X.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_7">
	  <num>7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">In circumstances where X was aged five at the time of the alleged sexual abuse sixteen years ago, in circumstances where she did not speak about abuse in her ABE video interview and in circumstances where all parties accept that she was the victim of sexual abuse, no party sought her attendance for cross-examination.  Further, no party disputes the evidence of Dr Rogstad or the evidence of the other expert instructed in this case, Dr&#160;Gavin.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">I have been very careful at all times to bear in mind that the lay witnesses who have given evidence to this Court regarding the allegations in question (specifically N and the father), are being asked to recall events that took place sixteen years-ago.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The age of the relevant allegations in this case has presented challenges in securing disclosure of relevant evidence. However, through the work of the parties, assisted by orders of the Court, substantial (although not complete) disclosure has been achieved.  In the circumstances, I have seen disclosure concerning the allegations of sexual abuse that has been secured from the social services of the relevant local authority.  The papers relating to the criminal proceedings have not been retained by the Police, or the Crown Prosecution Service, although it has been possible to obtain copies of certain of those papers from alternative sources (namely the retired Forensic Physician who examined X on behalf of the Police, Dr E) and I have considered these.  Finally, X consented to the disclosure of certain of her medical and mental health records into these proceedings. </p>

	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">I have been very careful through the course of this hearing to bear in mind that disclosure obtained in this case is not, by reason of the passage of time, entirely complete.  In particular, I have borne in mind that the Court does not have a comprehensive picture of the circumstances in which the charge of rape against the father, arising from the events concerning of X in 2000, was discontinued by the Crown Prosecution Service.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">In addition to the issue of sexual abuse, the mother also alleges that the father was verbally abusive to her during the course of their relationship.   These allegations are denied by the father.  At the outset of the hearing the mother sought certain findings in this regard.  However, having regard to the principles set out in FPR 2010 PD12J, and <span style="font-style:italic">Re L (Contact: Domestic Violence), Re V (Contact: Domestic Violence), Re M (Contact: Domestic Violence), and Re H (Contact: Domestic Violence) </span>[2000] FLR 134, it was agreed by all parties that it was not necessary for the Court to examine and determine those allegations at this hearing.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">I am grateful to all counsel and their instructing solicitors for the efficient and diligent manner in which they have prepared and presented a case considerably complicated by the historic nature of the allegations with which the Court is concerned.  I am also grateful to the relevant local authority for the assistance rendered to the Court by way of the provision of documents and liaison with X regarding the sensitive issue of disclosure in this case.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The survey of the background to this matter must begin in 2000.  At that time the father was in a relationship with N, which relationship had begun in 1998.  N contends that the father is the father of two of her children, a fact that the father contends he was unaware of prior to these proceedings, but now appears to accept.  When pressed on this issue in cross-examination, the father claimed that he had asked N to abort the pregnancy of the first child, as he was concerned about the level of responsibility in the context of a causal relationship, and that he had not thought to ask about the paternity of the second child.</p>

Within this context I note that in the Social Services document record on 25 February 2000, N indicated that X often asked for the father following his arrest.

The Social Services records indicate that the CPS disclosed into the criminal proceedings historic research conducted in the mid-1960s that indicated that it was possible that gonorrhoea could be transmitted through the shared use of towels.  The Social Services records indicate that this development led, eventually, to the case against the father being discontinued.

She said had she been told she would never have lived with him, or planned a family with him.  Her extreme distress at the consequences of her having ordered her life and her plans to build a family without this knowledge was palpable and compelling during her evidence.

Dr Rogstad makes clear that this is not a robust bacteria and is unable to survive outside the body for more than a very short period.  It is a sexually transmitted infection in adults and is passed on by direct contact of mucus membranes with infected secretions.  It causes an infection in the vagina and cervix of women, and the urethra of men and women.

Dr Rogstad notes that currently good evidence exists only for infection at birth, or infection due to sexual transmission.  Dr Rogstad states that gonorrhoea is rare in children.

In respect of the specific question of whether fomite transmission could occur through the shared use of a towel, Dr Rogstad highlights a review article published in 2007 (Goodyear-Smith F, <span style="font-style:italic">What is the evidence for non-sexual transmission of gonorrhoea in children after the neonatal period?  A systemic review</span> [2007] Journal of Forensic Medicine Vol 14 (8) 489-502).

Dr Rogstad further points out that most of the papers on non-sexual transmission of gonorrhoea in children date to when child sexual abuse as a cause was rarely considered and, where it was, this was not the result of a full assessment using a multi-professional approach.  In addition, some of the papers used questionable testing methodology.  Finally, Dr Rogstad cites a recent report on non-sexual transmission (Dayan L, <span style="font-style:italic">Transmission of Neissseria gonorrhoeae from a toilet seat</span> (2003) Journal of Sexually Transmitted Infections) in specific and unusual circumstances where the child demonstrated no other behavioural or physical indicators to suggest child sexual abuse.</p>

Where the laceration is complete (i.e. a laceration extending through the whole width of the hymen to its base) the laceration will usually heal to leave a discontinuity in the full width of the hymen, absent surgical repair.</p>

Finally, Dr Gavin opines that gentle insertion of a hysteroscope under direct vision through the hymen does not usually result in injury to children with normal sized hymenal orifices, although iatrogenic injury is a possible complication, depending on the experience and skill of the operator.</p>

Dr Gavin notes that Dr E recorded the estimated diameter of X&#8217;s hymenal orifice as approximately 8 millimetres.  Whilst accounting for the fact that measurements of hymenal width are often inaccurate, Dr Gavin considers that this finding indicates at least that X&#8217;s hymenal orifice was not abnormally small, and that therefore, a 6&#160;millimetre hysteroscope inserted under direct vision would not normally expect to cause injury to the hymen.  Further, Dr Gavin notes that this procedure was performed on X under general anaesthetic, which would have resulted in the tissues being very relaxed.  In addition, Dr N records in her Police statement, that the procedure was totally atraumatic with no post-operative bleeding.  In all these circumstances, Dr Gavin considers it very unlikely that the examination of Dr N caused the damage to X&#8217;s hymen, although the possibility cannot be completely excluded.  Dr Gavin opines that it is extremely unlikely that X caused the hymenal damage to herself.</p>

The father&#8217;s assertion that over the course of his two-year relationship with N, he had no unsupervised contact whatsoever with her children, including X, is highly unlikely, in my judgment, to be true.  This is particularly the case where the father himself conceded in evidence that the task of caring for three children when pregnant with a fourth would have been an onerous task for N, and that in circumstances where S and T were of similar ages and had similar routines, X would stay up whilst N put the other two children to bed.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">I am satisfied that the father has been untruthful on a number of occasions in respect of the events of 2000.  Within the foregoing context I am satisfied that he is not telling the truth when he seeks to assert vehemently that he on no occasion had unsupervised contact with N&#8217;s children, including X.  I am further satisfied that he gave an untruthful account of the events of 2000, when speaking to CAFCASS on 22 October 2015 during the initial Safeguarding Procedure in this case and giving an inaccurate and utterly sanitised account of those events.  Finally, I am satisfied that the father gave an untruthful account of the events of 2000, in his statement, when asserting that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;The child was forensically examined and there was no evidence at all of a sexual nature&#8221;</span>.</p>

I recognise that the father could have difficulty remembering accurately events that occurred sixteen years ago.  However, I also bear in mind that the father was the subject of criminal proceedings in respect of those events, and was represented during the same.  In the circumstances, he would have been assisted to understand the evidence against him.  In addition, in seeking to establish that he told the mother of the events of 2000, the father asserts that he has <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;always been open&#8221;</span> with his partners, suggesting that he had cause to recollect these events in the years following 2000, thereby refreshing his memory.  I also bear in mind that a parent who is seeking contact with their child may be tempted to sanitise their history for fear that the truth may adversely impact on their case.  Finally, it is important to note that a person may have more than one motivation for not telling the truth.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Looking at the evidence as a whole, and on balance, I am satisfied that at least part of the motivation behind the father telling the lies he did to CAFCASS, and to the Court was an attempt to avoid the discovery of an episode of abuse that he knew he had committed.  In the circumstances, I have taken account of the lies the father has told in reaching my conclusion that he perpetrated the abuse suffered by X.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">In reaching my conclusions I have also borne in mind that X has herself made statements implicating the father as her abuser.  I accept the evidence of N that X told her that the father had <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;touched her in the bath&#8221;</span>, and that she did not like it, and made statements to N to the effect that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;it wouldn&#8217;t have happened if you had not gone out&#8221;</span>.  I further note the entries in the CAMHS records that X drew inappropriate sexualised pictures, and intimated that the father had abused her, stating on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2002 <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;You know that Y that did that thing to me, he&#8217;s ugly, he lives in </span>[location given]<span style="font-style:italic"> now with </span>[identity given]<span style="font-style:italic">&#8221;</span>.  Whilst I have been very careful to bear in mind N&#8217;s concession that following the father&#8217;s arrest, she told X in response to X asking where the father was, that he had <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;been naughty&#8221; </span>and was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;in prison&#8221;</span>.  In my judgment, this does not substantially change my analysis of the significance of the statements made by X. </p>

Whilst that behaviour is likely to be the result of the sexual abuse that all parties accept was perpetrated against X, it seems to me that it does not assist the Court in determining <span style="font-style:italic">who</span> perpetrated that abuse, save where X made explicit statements in that regard.</p>

I further accept Miss Sammon&#8217;s submission that the father has never been seen to behave inappropriately towards his own daughter or other children.
