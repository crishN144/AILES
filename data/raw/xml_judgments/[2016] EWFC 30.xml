He was removed by the police from his mother&#8217;s care when she arrived back in the UK from Syria in early 2015 and she was arrested by officers of the Counter Terrorism Unit. He was the subject of protective measures for 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2015 when taken from his mother by the police. He has been the subject of an interim care order since 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2015. At first he was placed with foster carers then moved and placed with another foster family in June 2015 and there was some delay in the local authority carrying out assessments. </p>

The conviction of T for terrorism offence led to a curtailment of that part of the trial which had been set aside for consideration of her &#8220;radicalisation&#8221;, the extent of her support for Daesh/ISIS, her encouragement of others to participate in terrorism and the harmful effects on Y of being taken to Syria by his mother.</p>

The decision that I am making is not intended to provide for reunification with his mother at some unspecified date in the future.</p>

The child was not subjects of these proceedings. The findings sought by the local authority were proved for reasons set out in the full judgement handed down in private on the 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2016. M&#8217;s conduct was taken into account by the court as part of its consideration of Y&#8217;s welfare.</p>

M said he has &#8220;married&#8221; both T and another woman in this way and appears to have had a casual approach to his commitments to his partners and to his children from the evidence he gave to this court. He has another daughter by a third woman. T cited M travelling to Yemen shortly after their relationship ended, which effectively left her alone with their son, as part of her motivation for travelling to Syria to join Daesh and start a new life there. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">T and M lived together from February 2011 until they separated in July 2014. T complained of domestic abuse and the police were called on several occasions during the time that they were co-habiting. T complained of M&#8217;s drinking alcohol and using cannabis and because of his behaviour they separated in February 2014 and &#8220;divorced&#8221; on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2014. There is no evidence of the divorce before the court. Prior to their separation they had, according to T, planned to go to Yemen, and it would seem that M went to Yemen himself in 2014 from June for a period of at least three months, having told T that he was to be there for three weeks.</p>

He failed to mention his use of cannabis and from the analysis made of his hair samples during these proceedings it became apparent that he is a heavy user of cannabis. This evidence was not challenged. It is in that same statement that M betrays his cavalier attitude to his son and his son&#8217;s mother; saying that he had become &#8220;a<span style="font-style:italic"> little bit annoyed that she was wanting to know my whereabouts and what I was doing all the time. I was happy that [Y] was safe with her and said that she did not need to know all of my movements and what I was doing and when I was doing it if we were no longer in a relationship. Looking back on it perhaps this was a little petty as she could have just been wanting to know when I was back as this could be when [Y] could see me</span>.&#8221;  </p>

In these statements she purported to give a detailed account of her journey to Syria, her stay in Raqqa and her flight from Syria back to Turkey, however she retracted much of what she had said in her first two statements and accepted that they were full of lies. T gave oral evidence but it was and remains unclear from both her written and oral evidence to this court what went on in Syria. In her written evidence she did not accept that she <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;lost sight completely of [Y&#8217;s] basic need for physical and emotional safety although I do accept that I exposed him to extreme danger at times during the period arising for the need to escape from IS.&#8221;</span></p>

She had left letters for her family saying that she did not intend to return. In the sentencing remarks of the Recorder of Birmingham, His Honour Judge Melbourne Inman QC, said <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Exactly what occurred in Raqqa is far from clear. You told lie after lie to the Police and to the Court between February and November 2015 including that you were kidnapped, were not responsible for any tweets and any incriminating photographs were staged against your will. You pleaded not guilty and told more lies to the jury which they have understandably rejected.&#8221;</span></p>

This is certainly true of her written evidence, her first two statements had so much removed from them by way of retraction that they ceased to be coherent and the narrative that remained was piecemeal at best. Much of what she had retracted was not dealt with later in her oral evidence; thus she had given a wholly factious (on her own account) description of how she had met a man on a beach in Turkey who had inveigled her into travelling to Syria.

She, and she alone, placed him at risk of great physical danger and even death. In what Ms Deirdre Fottrell QC, counsel for the local authority, describes as distorted thinking, T apparently sought to assert that she had saved the child (Y) by returning to the UK but did not acknowledge that it was she who placed him at risk in the first place. It is axiomatic that the risk of harm to Y was foreseeable and clear that, at best, T chose to ignore it. It is more likely that she deliberately disregarded it as part of given her own plans to join Daesh. </p>

There is a considerable disparity between the evidence (not least in the many messages sent by T both before she went to Turkey and from Syria itself) which formed the basis of her criminal conviction, her action in going there in the first place and the way in which she has sought to portray herself as an innocent victim of propaganda in her oral evidence to this court.

It was striking that although T referred to her own fear for herself and her own safety she did not, at any time, reflect on or acknowledge how her own anxiety, fear and distress must have had an impact on Y or how fearful he must have been as a result.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to the pictures taken of Y, T not only attempted dismiss their significance as a propaganda tool for Daesh she tried to claim both that the picture had been faked <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> it was taken without her knowledge. This was a further contradiction in her evidence as she said she had always been with Y and cared for him. This latter claim forms the basis of her case that the child did not suffer any harm while in Syria, the implication being that as he was always with his mother he could not have suffered in any way. T went on, however, to say that Y had not been present when she had been photographing other women posing with guns. It cannot be true that he simultaneously never left her side but was not there when she took those pictures and that she was not there when pictures were taken of Y. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is a matter of common sense that Y was likely to have suffered significant emotional and psychological harm during the three months when he was in Raqqa and that it would have been as a consequence of living in conditions where, not only was his mother in fear and crying during the night, but the house they lived in was in an area that was constantly being attacked and bombed. Before I go on to consider the evidence of the frequency of the bombing, the lack of any real concern displayed or voiced by T that Y might have been affected by his experience is, in itself, worrying. If she remains unable or unwilling to think about the effects of her actions in the future, the risk of future harm to Y will remain.  </p>

T said of Y that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;he never cries, on one occasion it startled him but [he] never cried.  It made him jump once&#8221;</span>.  This was in stark contrast to her evidence about the effects on her; when 30 bombs fell she said that the missiles <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;sounded like when a firework goes off&#8230;its very scary&#8230;the most scared I have been in my life.&#8221; </span>Moreover, I find that it is most unlikely that Y did not wake up and that he stayed asleep as bombs fell all night and the house shook around them as T suggested in her evidence to me.</p>

When taken as a whole it is T&#8217;s own evidence that she, and therefore Y too, had lived in situation of heightened anxiety and fear, which was also experienced by the other families and children around them. This must have had an emotional impact on Y that was harmful, exposed as he was to frequent bombing, noise, anxiety and the panicked reaction of the other children and their mothers; and, most significantly, given his tender years, the fear and anxiety of his own mother. He was present when, as she told me, she was fearful for her own life. I have little doubt that he suffered emotional harm as a result. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The emotional harm would have been compounded by the fact that his mother had taken him away from all that was safe and familiar to him, and from the rest of his family. T severed those relationships and placed him in what was, on her own account, a harsh, restrictive and punitive atmosphere where he was kept imprisoned in a house full of total strangers. It would be quite remarkable if he was unaffected psychologically. T has never given any evidence, description or detail of how she manged to ameliorate this situation to the extent that Y remained unaffected; at the very least he would have suffered harm as a result of being taken away from home, family and safe and familiar surroundings; when one adds the bombing, fear, panic, restriction and threatening atmosphere along with the effects of fear on his mother it is not credible to suggest that he did not suffer significant emotional harm.</p>

The bombing meant that the other people in the house, adults and children alike, were repeatedly panicked, scared and anxious, that Y, too, would have been frightened at the time of the bombing and that afterwards he would have been anxious about it all happening again. He would have been worried, anxious, distressed and frightened by his mother&#8217;s fear and panic.

T&#8217;s explanations in her evidence for the photographs were confused and evasive. T had told me that she had something of a celebrity status in the house in Raqqa because of the activity she had been party to online before leaving the UK and because of the notoriety her case had attracted in the media when members of her family had spoken about her after she left.

Self-evidently the risk of physical harm or even death is high in such a situation. The court had before it numerous images of T and others with guns, including images of T next to a firearm, images of T and other women posing with guns on the balcony. In one such picture there is an image of a child in the foreground which is more likely than not to be Y. There were numerous images of T and other women posing with guns. On the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2014 she sent a message to M &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I have a gun&#8221;</span> followed by 11 images of a gun in which a female hand is seen holding the gun and that person is wearing a garment in which T was frequently photographed.

In one instance T claimed that she had taken a picture of a woman holding a gun rather than accept that she was the woman in the image herself. She had frequently said that Y was not present while insisting in her evidence that Y was always with her and then, finally, said, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">not sure if Y would know what a gun is&#8221;. </span>The evidence of the social worker is that Y is all too aware of what a gun is and becomes over-excited by the suggestion of guns and shooting, and runs around mimicking shooting and makes noises of gunfire.</p>
