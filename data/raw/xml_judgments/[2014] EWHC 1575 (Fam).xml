This is that, the longer the determination of any jurisdictional issue, including under Article 15, is delayed, the more established the child&#8217;s situation becomes.  The more established the child becomes in one jurisdiction, the more that fact in itself will gain in weight and significance.  At one extreme, it might, of itself, become determinative.  This is in addition to the general principle that delay in the determination of proceedings is likely to prejudice the welfare of the child.  </span></p>

Such cases will frequently necessitate information and evidence being sought from that other Member State.  It is my experience, as demonstrated in part by the present case, that such enquiries are often not pursued in a structured way which has regard to the framework created by the relevant regulations, in particular BIIR.  This case demonstrates the need for a more structured approach when information or evidence is being sought from another jurisdiction and when local authorities, courts, or others are communicating with, or seeking to obtain the cooperation of, the relevant authorities in another Member State.  </span></p>

Nevertheless, I agreed to three further questions being sent to the Hungarian Central Authority, namely, in summary, (a) how long might an Article 15 request take to be determined; (b) what immediate arrangements for DS&#8217;s care would be provided in Hungary in the event of an Article 15 request being accepted; and (c) is it permissible under Hungarian law for an English social worker to conduct a professional assessment in Hungary.  No reply has yet been received to those questions.  However, given my previous experience, I am satisfied that, if the court does make a request under Article 15, it would be likely to be determined expeditiously.
