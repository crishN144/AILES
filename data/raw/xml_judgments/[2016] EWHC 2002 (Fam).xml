The costs incurred by the mother in relation to her application amount, to date, to some &#163;22,800.  In the circumstances, the parties have, collectively, spent well over &#163;60,000 arguing about a question the answer to which could not have been any more legally straightforward from the outset.</p>

The mother has disclosed an attendance note of that conference.  It is plain from that note that junior counsel advised the mother in the strongest terms that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">any attempt to enforce the 2013 order would be thrown out by the English court as a result of Art 53(2)</span>&#8221;.  Within this context, the mother was advised by her lawyers that she should make a further application in the Russian court for an order which could be registered.

That letter addressed the advice received by the mother from the Russian lawyers on 25 April 2016 regarding the relevant date for the purposes of Art 53(2) of the 1996 Hague Convention and reiterated in clear terms junior counsel&#8217;s advice.  Namely, that the relevant date was the date the Convention came into force as between the United Kingdom and the Russian Federation and that, accordingly, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the order of April 2013 is not capable of being registered or indeed enforced</span>&#8221; and that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Any application to the English court (outside of the &#8217;96 Convention) is doomed to fail</span>&#8221;.  Whilst the mother&#8217;s then solicitor stated that they were willing to run an argument based on the Russian advice, the solicitor reiterated that there would be &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">a very real risk</span>&#8221; of a costs order, the risk being &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">relatively high&#8230;if we pursued enforcement of the April 2013 order on an unsound legal basis</span>&#8221;.</p>

The mother&#8217;s solicitors informed her that they &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">could bluster as much as possible</span>&#8221; but again warned the mother in clear terms regarding the merits of her application.

Junior counsel clearly explained to the mother why the advice of her Russian lawyers was incorrect having regard to the terms of Art 53(2) of the Convention.  It is clear that the mother was extremely reluctant to accept this advice and requested a consultation with leading counsel.  This took place on 18 May 2016.   Leading counsel re-iterated that the order could not be registered by the English court and that the position was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">unambiguous</span>&#8221;.</p>

It is clear from further documents disclosed by the mother that she continued to believe that the Russian order of 18 April 2013 could be registered in the English court.

Within this context, Miss Renton contends that the fact that the mother issued the wrong type of enforcement application against the father on legal advice should not result in a costs order against her.  Further, Miss Renton further contends that a cost order against the mother would not be just in circumstances where there is a disparity of means between the mother and the father.  Overall, Miss Renton submits that the award of costs against the mother in circumstances where she contends that the father remains in breach of the Russian order would, against the overall history of the case, be &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">wholly unjust and unfair</span>&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I accept that on 12 February 2016 the mother received erroneous advice from her then solicitor that led her to give instructions to issue her application.  However, from 15 April 2016 the mother was placed on notice by correspondence from the father that her application plainly had no merit having regard to the clear legal position.  Further, from 22 April 2016 the mother had the repeated benefit from highly specialist and experienced junior counsel that her application had no prospect of success.  Whilst I accept that the mother had had conflicting advice from her Russian lawyers, she was litigating in this jurisdiction and had twice had extremely clear advice from specialist junior counsel that her application <span style="font-style:italic">could not </span>succeed.   This advice was ignored by the mother, leading to the father issuing his Notice of Appeal.  Thereafter the mother received further advice as to the hopelessness of her application from highly specialist and experienced leading counsel.  Still it took the mother nearly a month to concede.  Thereafter the mother refused to compromise on the issue of costs notwithstanding the position I have outlined.  Within this context, I am satisfied that the mother acted unreasonably in the conduct of her application and I am satisfied that, in circumstances where the father has been successful in his appeal, the justice of the case requires that this be reflected in an order for costs.</p>

There is no cogent evidence before the court in support of either parents&#8217; argument on this issue.  Further, whilst the mother prays in aid a disparity between her financial position and that of the father, it is clear from the documents disclosed by the mother that, as at 20 June 2016, she had informed her then solicitors immediately prior to the consultation with leading counsel on 18 May 2016 that she &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">had plenty of funds to deal with the expense</span>&#8221;.  I am likewise not persuaded that the mother can escape a costs order on the basis that, on occasion, she received erroneous legal advice.  Finally, I am not satisfied that the wider merits of the parties respective cases regarding D&#8217;s welfare fall to be considered.  There remains a fierce dispute between the parties in respect of the welfare issues, which dispute has yet to be determined.  In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate to the wider merits of the welfare issues between the parties when considering the issue of costs on this appeal.</p>

Whilst I accept that this case involves a specialist area of the law, that reasonable efforts were required on the part of those representing the father in an attempt to resolve the issue in question and that those attempts were rebuffed and that it was necessary to institute an appeal, the costs claimed by the father do not bear a reasonable relationship to the level of complexity of the subject litigation and the amount of work reasonably required to conduct and present the father&#8217;s case proficiently having regard to all the relevant circumstances.  </p>

The point was as unassailable as it was straightforward.  It could, in fact, be articulated in six words, namely &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the English court had no jurisdiction</span>&#8221;.  The submission that it required in total &#163;38,813 of costs to inform the mother&#8217;s then solicitors in correspondence of this single, irrefutable point, to draft a Notice of Appeal setting out this single, irrefutable point once the mother had declined to abandon her application and to attend court to argue this single, irrefutable point on appeal is one that, I am afraid, is not realistic and does not reflect the straightforward and indisputable nature of the sole legal point in this matter.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">With respect to attendance on opponents I am likewise not satisfied, given the simple and singular nature of the point in issue, that it was proportionate to expend 13.3 hours on letters and emails out and telephone calls.   It was plainly necessary for certain letters to be sent setting out the father&#8217;s case before an appeal was issued, chasing the mother for a response and notifying the mother that the appeal had been issued and corresponding in respect of the impending appeal hearing.  Whilst the first of these would have taken some time, the remainder would have taken very little.   I am prepared to allow 1 hour for the Grade A fee earner and 0.5 hours for the Grade C fee earner, amounting to &#163;425 as against a claimed sum of &#163;3,997.</p>

There is no schedule attached to the Statement of Costs enumerating in any way the work claimed in this regard.  Further, and in any event, given the simple and singular nature of the point in issue, where the letters required to be written to the other side are dealt with elsewhere and where counsel drafted Notice of Appeal and documents for the hearing, there was in my judgment no requirement to spend significant periods of time working on documentation.  I am prepared to allow 1 hour for the Grade A fee earner, amounting to &#163;325 as against a claimed figure of &#163;9,352.</p>

In the circumstances, I take the view that it was reasonable and proportionate for counsel to be attended by a Grade D fee earner.  I am prepared to allow 4.4 hours attendance amounting to &#163;550 as against the claimed sum of &#163;2,680 (Mr Devereux having already made certain concessions in respect of the figure for attendance).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The stringent test of proportionality in relation to costs incurred applies with equal force in family proceedings.  It is remarkable that such a significant sum of money has been spent by these two parents arguing over a single question the answer to which was indisputable from the outset. The costs incurred in this case were disproportionate to the single issue at hand.  I again observe that the single question in the case was entirely straightforward in nature and answered by one unassailable legal submission.  </p>
