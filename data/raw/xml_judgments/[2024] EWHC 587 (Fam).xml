This involves a detailed review of the donor&#8217;s medical history and blood screening for blood born viruses and cystic fibrosis. These are standard tests undertaken as required by every HFEA clinic licence. In addition, although not a requirement of their HFEA licence, the Clinic carries out karyotyping for chromosomal abnormalities for all donors.</p>

Such testing is of assistance not only in the scenario where AH is found to suffer from an autosomal recessive condition inherited from her father and Donor A, it is also of benefit in excluding a genetic condition as the cause of AH&#8217;s health difficulties or confirming that AH has a new dominant condition, not inherited from her father or Donor A.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A clinical diagnosis would greatly assist the diagnosis and treatment of AH&#8217;s condition. In the event of a diagnosis, it would allow for use of particular educational interventions, targeted treatments or allow certain medications to be excluded or indicated. In her evidence, Professor Lucassen states that there is a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;small but definite chance</span>&#8217;<span style="font-style:italic"/>that treatment will be indicated as part of a diagnosis that would not otherwise be available. She gave brief oral evidence when she confirmed trio testing was first used between 2013 &#8211; 2015 although mainly as a research exercise at that time and was not launched in the NHS until 2018. She was clear that if Donor A stated she did not want to be informed about any genetic disease there would be <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;no chance&#8217;</span> she would be. As she stated, the purpose of the DNA sample is to rule out matters for AH, stating <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;we need to weed out rare variants, the sample is acting as a control rather than diagnostic test&#8217;.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In her written evidence, Dr Ingamells expresses her concern about the impact on Donor A of such contact. In her view, Donor A has consistently expressed the view that she did not wish to be informed if the Clinic learns through the birth of an affected child that she has a previously unsuspected genetic disease, or is the carrier of a harmful inherited condition. Contacting Donor A in the circumstances suggested is likely to disclose the existence, if not the details, of AH&#8217;s condition. It is also recognised that even if contacted, Donor A may not agree to provide the DNA sample. This has to be balanced with the possibility that if the DNA sample were provided by Donor A, it may result in diagnosis and treatment for AH, and may be relevant to those who have conceived or may conceive in the future using Donor A&#8217;s eggs. Having balanced these considerations, Dr Ingamells concludes that Donor A should be contacted and there is justification for acting contrary to her stated wishes.</p>

In his report, he concludes that obtaining a DNA sample from Donor A would increase the possibility of achieving a genetic diagnosis for AH. He recognises that there is a small chance that information of medical significance for Donor A would be uncovered. He recommends that if Donor A is contacted she should be offered genetic counselling.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Barnsley confirms that the DCN was notified about this case on behalf of the Clinic as they were conscious that the person at the centre of this case, Donor A, had no one representing her possible thoughts and feelings and the DCN may be able to provide some helpful context from that perspective. Ms Barnsley makes it clear the DCN is neutral as to the claim itself and can only provide information as to generic issues that face donors in general. Although a payment of &#163;750 is made to donors, Ms Barnsley considers that most, if not all, donors are altruistic with a range of motivations to donate. Equally there is a range of feelings that donors have around donating, from simply donating a cell they do not need to having a stronger feeling about their gametes and any genetic connection with a child. As Ms Barnsley sets out, it is difficult to say definitively what a donor would want or expect from donation, in terms of privacy or otherwise, as donors vary enormously.</p>

As a consequence, do they owe a duty to Donor A not to inform her of information about her health against her express wishes and, if so, he asks whether contacting her to ask her to give a DNA sample for the purpose of genetic analysis would breach that duty? Mr Mant submits there is no established case law that addresses this particular issue but in considering this the court would need to consider the foreseeability of damage, the proximity of the relationship between the Clinic, its staff and Donor A and whether it is fair, just and reasonable to impose an extended duty of care on the Clinic and its staff.</p>

The request for a DNA sample in itself would not communicate that Donor A has an unsuspected genetic disease or is the carrier of a harmful inherited condition. This is because it is not known whether AH&#8217;s difficulties are genetic and, if they are, whether they are attributable to either of her biological parents. Dr Ingamells makes the point that there is a real possibility that the request for a DNA sample will lead to Donor A being informed that a child conceived using her donated egg has a congenital disorder and that it is likely Donor A will infer from this that she has a genetic disease, or is the carrier of a harmful genetic condition.</p>

Mr Mant submits that the Clinic and its staff may owe a duty to Donor A not to contact her to request a DNA sample as that may inform her indirectly that there is a risk that she has a previously unsuspected genetic disease or is a carrier of a harmful inherited condition, contrary to her wish not to be so informed. If that analysis is correct, Mr Mant submits that duty is not absolute and the Clinic staff may form the view that there is justification for providing information to Donor A contrary to her express wishes. For example, where avoidance of harm to another would outweigh Donor A&#8217;s wishes and any risk of harm to Donor A can reasonably be addressed through sensitive communication and the offer of counselling. </p>

Whilst the evidence does not suggest that AH will suffer serious harm if a genetic analysis is not possible, there is the possibility that such testing will yield health benefits leading to the possibility of a diagnosis and/or provision of better treatment and care. Additionally, Donor A's wish not to be informed in the event that a child born using her donated eggs has a congenital disability is not guaranteed. When a child turns 18 they are legally entitled to identifying information about the donor. In those circumstances AH would be entitled, assuming she is aware she is donor conceived and able to make such a request, to be informed of Donor A&#8217;s identity, to contact her and make the request directly. Consequently, the statutory regime, in certain limited circumstances, overrides a gamete donor&#8217;s expressed wish not to be provided with information about a child conceived using a donated egg.</p>

What Donor A was saying in the consents she signed is she did not want to be contacted in circumstances where it was discovered she had a previously unsuspected genetic disease or that she is the carrier of a harmful inherited condition. That is not the situation here, as it is unknown whether Donor A has a genetic condition in the same way that it is not known whether AH has.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The court separately needs to consider whether the processing of Donor A&#8217;s personal data is lawful under the GDPR. It is clear the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;legitimate interest&#8217;</span> under article 6(1)(f) is to enable trio testing to increase the chances of a diagnosis for AH and/or the provision of the correct treatment. Whilst it is recognised Donor A may not consent to providing DNA there is still a need to request it and all other steps short of making the request have been undertaken.</p>

Professor Lucassen&#8217;s evidence is clear about the benefits of trio testing, such a request will be made by a health professional under obligation of secrecy. The request will not be incompatible with the purposes for which the details were collected, namely to enable the Clinic to contact Donor A as and when required, which would include in accordance with any declarations made by this Court.</p>
