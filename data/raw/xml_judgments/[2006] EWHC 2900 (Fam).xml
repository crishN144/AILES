	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">This is an application made by NA (to whom, for ease of reference, I shall refer as the Wife) for full ancillary relief after the breakdown of her marriage to MA (the Husband). These parties were married on the 20th June 1998 having cohabited for some 6 years prior to that date. The Wife filed (but did not serve) her petition for divorce on the 12th May 2005. The Husband filed his petition on the 27th May 2005. The divorce proceeded on his petition based on the Wife's adultery. Their relationship lasted some 12&#189; years. They have two children. E who was born on the 27th May 2000 (6 years old) and N who was born on the 21st May 2002 (4 years old). The children have their main base with their mother and have regular contact with their father. </p>

	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">This litigation has been hard fought and it is obvious to me that much bitterness has been engendered by the disintegration of this relationship, perhaps because these parties were once so close and enmeshed with each other. The cause of much vituperation has been the Wife's adultery with the Husband's best friend which occurred in the latter stages of the marriage. The Husband, perhaps unsurprisingly, has been unable to forgive the Wife for this betrayal. Nevertheless, I believe that this factor has coloured his view of her entitlement for financial relief under the Law.</p>

	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">The costs of this case total some &#163;1.2 million and, whilst I have no doubt that these parties can afford this level of expenditure, it is a great pity that so much of the family assets has had to be expended in this way. It was sad to see these parties effectively flayed through cross examination. I hope that the experience will have a cathartic effect, for the parties need to put this chapter behind them and concentrate upon their future role as parents. Whilst the children remain young, these parties must be able to co-operate for the benefit of E and N. I would hate to think that the children will effectively be made to suffer for the past, perceived sins of their parents. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">The bitterness that I have described above has spilled into the litigation and the trial. Mr Mostyn QC for the Husband described it "as the most demanding case in which he had ever been involved". Mr Posnansky QC for the Wife described it as "brutal litigation". No quarter was given and, at times, there seemed to be a lack of basic co-operation to enable the smooth running of the trial. These cases are difficult enough for the parties without additional niggles being caused in this way. For example, I expect Counsel in all cases to co-operate by producing new documents in good time so that opponents can consider them. In other words not produce them with a flourish in Court. I also expect them to meet outside Court each morning (for example at least 15 minutes before the start of the day) to discuss and co-operate about "housekeeping" matters or arrange some other fail safe method. Arriving at Court with a minute to spare and no time to discuss matters can be tactical and I do not approve of the practice as it delays matters. </p>

	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">The original time estimate of this case was 5 &#8211; 7 days. In fact, it lasted some 9 days in Court without, as things turned out, allowing any time for Judgment writing. In the main the additional time was required because, during the trial, very serious allegations were made against the Wife's solicitors. Mr Posnansky has described them as a "diversionary tactic" and, whilst this may be an overstatement, the allegations took a great deal of time to unfold and analyse. As my findings will make clear they assumed much more significance than was appropriate. They first surfaced in any clear way during the Wife's cross examination. Indeed, as it was originally put that "the Wife and her lawyers had entered into a strategy", I thought that the allegation was tantamount to some form of conspiracy. I felt it necessary to intervene in order to clarify the level at which the allegations were being put. The Bar Code of Conduct is clear and I did not want Mr Mostyn QC to find himself in any form of personal difficulty. Therefore, I called for the allegations to be put into writing. This led to a clarification of the precise level of accusation. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">A central issue in this case is whether the Wife should be held to the terms of what has been referred to as a post nuptial agreement. In essence, it was asserted that the solicitors acting for her at the date of signature had a strategy and had deliberately entered into a course of conduct that would give her an exit route. Some of their actions were not characterised as improper but, as detailed in the written document, some were stated to be "a lapse of professional duty". I deal with the precise allegations below and set out my findings. It is clear, therefore, as Mr Mostyn QC accepted in his final submissions, that the most serious allegations are tantamount to fraud. </p>

	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">I feel that the concentration on this issue (which took at least 2 days of Court time) meant that the parties' advisers began to lose sight of the central issues which are (i) should the agreement be upheld and (ii) if not, what is the level of fair award. I note, for example, that no detailed figures were given in Mr Mostyn's written final submissions: in his, Mr Posnansky referred to and adopted those in his written Opening </p>

	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">It is an accepted fact that an agreement entered into between Husband and Wife does not oust the jurisdiction of this Court. For many years, agreements between spouses were considered void for public policy reasons but this is no longer the case. In fact over the years, pre nuptial "contracts" have become increasingly common place and are, I accept, much more likely to be accepted by these Courts as governing what should occur between the parties when the prospective marriage comes to an end. That is, of course, subject to the discretion of the Court and the application of a test of fairness/manifest unfairness. It may well be that Parliament will provide legislation but, until that occurs, current Authority makes it clear that the agreements are not enforceable per se although they can be persuasive (or definitive) depending upon the precise circumstances that lead to their completion.</p>

		<p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">"To decide what weight should be given in order to reach a just result, to a prior agreement not to claim a lump sum, regard must be had to the conduct of both parties, leading up to the prior agreement, and to their subsequent conduct, in consequence of it. It is not necessary in this connection to think in formal legal terms, such as misrepresentation or estoppel, all the circumstances as they affect each of two human beings must be considered in the complex relationship of marriage. So, the circumstances surrounding the making of the agreement are relevant. Undue pressure by one side, exploitation of a dominant position to secure an unreasonable advantage, inadequate knowledge, possibly bad legal advice, an important change of circumstances, unforeseen or overlooked at the time of making the agreement, are all relevant to the question of justice between the parties. Important too is the general proposition that, formal agreements, properly and fairly arrived at with competent legal advice, should not be displaced unless there are good and substantial grounds for concluding that an injustice will be done by holding the parties to the terms of their agreement. There may well be other considerations which affect the justice of this case; the above list is not intended to be an exclusive catalogue." </p>

		<p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">[6] The issues raised by these appeals make it necessary to go back to first principles. Undue influence is one of the grounds of relief developed by the courts of equity as a court of conscience.<span style="font-weight:bold"> The objective is to ensure that the influence of one person over another is not abused</span>. In everyday life people constantly seek to influence the decisions of others. They seek to persuade those with whom they are dealing to enter into transactions, whether great or small. The law has set limits to the means properly employable for this purpose. To this end the common law developed a principle of duress. Originally this was narrow in its scope, restricted to the more blatant forms of physical coercion, such as personal violence. </p>
	      </content>
	    </subparagraph>
	    <subparagraph>
	      <content>
		<p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">[7] Here, as elsewhere in the law, equity supplemented the common law. Equity extended the reach of the law to other unacceptable forms of persuasion. The law will investigate the manner in which the intention to enter into the transaction was secured: 'how the intention was produced', in the oft repeated words of Lord Eldon LC, from as long ago as 1807 (<span style="font-style:italic">Huguenin v Baseley</span> (1807) 14 Ves 273, 300). <span style="font-weight:bold">If the intention was produced by an unacceptable means, the law will not permit the transaction to stand. The means used is regarded as an exercise of improper or 'undue' influence, and hence unacceptable, whenever the consent thus procured ought not fairly to be treated as the expression of a person's free will</span>. It is impossible to be more precise or definitive. The circumstances in which one person acquires influence over another, and the manner in which influence may be exercised, vary too widely to permit of any more specific criterion.

However, in a case involving a Husband and Wife where it is clear that interdependence and mutual influence are the basis of the relationship, I consider that the Court has to take special care when assessing the manner in which each party's conduct affected the other. For example, if a wife has been accustomed to placing reliance upon her husband's decisions she might be much more easily influenced than an individual in a commercial transaction. </p>

		<p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">"[8] Equity identified broadly two forms of unacceptable conduct. The first comprises overt acts of improper pressure or coercion such as unlawful threats. Today there is much overlap with the principle of duress as this principle has subsequently developed. The second form arises out of a relationship between two persons where one has acquired over another a measure of influence, or ascendancy, of which the ascendant person then takes unfair advantage&#8230;.</p>

		<p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">[9] In cases of this latter nature the influence one person has over another provides scope for misuse without any specific overt acts of persuasion. The relationship between two individuals may be such that, without more, one of them is disposed to agree a course of action proposed by the other. Typically this occurs when one person places trust in another to look after his affairs and interests, and the latter betrays this trust by preferring his own interests. He abuses the influence he has acquired&#8230;&#8230; </p>

		<p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">[10] The law has long recognised the need to prevent abuse of influence in these 'relationship' cases despite the absence of evidence of overt acts of persuasive conduct.

		<p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">[11] Even this test is not comprehensive. The principle is not confined to cases of abuse of trust and confidence. It also includes, for instance, cases where a vulnerable person has been exploited. Indeed, there is no single touchstone for determining whether the principle is applicable. Several expressions have been used in an endeavour to encapsulate the essence: trust and confidence, reliance, dependence or vulnerability on the one hand and ascendancy, domination or control on the other. None of these descriptions is perfect. None is all embracing. Each has its proper place. </p>

		<p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">It is not essential that the transaction should be disadvantageous to the pressurised or influenced person, either in financial terms or in any other way. However, in the nature of things, questions of undue influence will not usually arise, and the exercise of undue influence is unlikely to occur, where the transaction is innocuous. The issue is likely to arise only when, in some respect, the transaction was disadvantageous either from the outset or as matters turned out. </p>

		<p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">[13] Whether a transaction was brought about by the exercise of undue influence is a question of fact. Here, as elsewhere, the general principle is that he who asserts a wrong has been committed must prove it. The burden of proving an allegation of undue influence rests upon the person who claims to have been wronged. This is the general rule. The evidence required to discharge the burden of proof depends on the nature of the alleged undue influence, the personality of the parties, their relationship, the extent to which the transaction cannot readily be accounted for by the ordinary motives of ordinary persons in that relationship, and all the circumstances of the case. </p>

		<p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">[14] Proof that the complainant placed trust and confidence in the other party in relation to the management of the complainant's financial affairs, coupled with a transaction which calls for explanation, will normally be sufficient, failing satisfactory evidence to the contrary, to discharge the burden of proof. On proof of these two matters the stage is set for the court to infer that, in the absence of a satisfactory explanation, the transaction can only have been procured by undue influence. In other words, proof of these two facts is prima facie evidence that the defendant abused the influence he acquired in the parties' relationship. He preferred his own interests. He did not behave fairly to the other. So the evidential burden then shifts to him. It is for him to produce evidence to counter the inference which otherwise should be drawn."</p>

Despite this, the group remained successful. It seems clear that the continued prosperity of the business was dependent upon the skill of AA. In 1999 the companies produced a profit of US$2.1 million (which in itself was a reduction) but by 2000 the losses totalled US$9.1 million and by 2001 the losses were US$23.6 million. </p>

The Husband's brother, L, encouraged by his uncle, JA, tried to seize control in order to effect a favourable division of the assets. Proceedings were issued in Liechtenstein and London and, per a letter from the Husband's commercial solicitor, Mr DS, "open warfare broke out between the various factions within AAC who were either loyal to BA, the Husband or L. The business became paralysed and the financial situation worsened considerably". </heading>

	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">It soon became apparent that high scale losses could not be maintained. It was therefore decided that the business should be managed by a professional team and groomed for sale. In order to make this possible the group was divided into 5 Guernsey companies which, for ease of reference, are referred to as the BDCs. Eventually, the most profitable parts of AAC were sold for approximately US$400 million of which some 84.8% was due to AAF. The Foundations terms, as I have already stated, were to the effect that its assets should be divided as 20% to the widow and 40% to each son. However, shortly before his death, AA wrote a letter of wishes to the effect that, if the businesses were sold, then the first &#163;105 million should be divided as to one third to his widow and the remainder between his sons. In effect, this produced an equal division of that sum. The figures meant that the widow received about $14 million more than her original entitlement. Her sons were angry that she should benefit in this way. The Husband informed me that this issue meant that his mother has been disposed to "lend" this sum (i.e. $7 million) to each son. However, in the light of the history and the evidence that I have heard I believe that "loans" at this level will be forgiven. Apparently, L has already received "his" $7 million.</p>

Despite these ifficulties, it seems that the Husband and Wife continued to operate as a very successful team until the birth of their first child, E, who was born in May 2000. It is the Wife's case that their relationship began to deteriorate from this time onwards because she felt increasingly isolated and unappreciated. Of course, the birth of children can often lead to new strains within a marriage. But in this case those troubles were coupled with business problems and difficult extended family dynamics of epic proportions. </p>

This included some &#163;337,000 on staff; &#163;18,000 on flowers; &#163;44,500 on food (apart from restaurants); &#163;36,800 on travel; &#163;118,000 on credit cards and &#163;450,000 on "miscellaneous". In the context of their wealth (even though it was then in excess of &#163;60 million) this was unbridled extravagance. I note that they had 2 housekeepers, 2 cooks, 2 drivers and a nanny. Food was flown in from abroad to cater for their individual needs. They travelled on private jets, holidayed in the best hotels and, in short, had the best that money could buy. I expect that this simply marked the continuation of the type of life that had been enjoyed when AA was alive. However, he was a successful entrepreneur with a multi-national business which created substantial profits. He may have been able to afford an amazing level of luxury but the same was not true for this Husband or Wife. I do not seek to criticize this couple for the way in which they lived; I simply consider that it was rather short sighted and immature. It does not seem to me that it could be afforded in the long term (unless the Husband's business ventures proved to be a great success). Therefore it was, as I find, inevitable that this type of life would have had to be moderated in time.</p>

Unfortunately, the underlying messages went unheeded. I am not ascribing culpability to the Husband because I do not believe that he was emotionally equipped to sympathise or empathise with her. But there was a failure of understanding and a crisis was looming. In the summer 2004, the Wife went to see Dr B (whom she also regarded as a trusted friend and confidant) and revealed her level of unhappiness to him. She indicated to him that she was considering a separation. It does not seem that the level of her distress was communicated to the Husband by him.</p>

I accept that he went to a shop in Kilburn Lane and paid &#163;450 for a device with which to "bug" the household telephone. He then placed it on line 5 (the "default" outside line on the home exchange) and, as a result, recorded numerous compromising calls between the Wife and Mr Y.

I do not accept his evidence on this point. I believe that he was a crucial part of the team and a valued adviser.

If this description is correct, and I have no reason to doubt it, the figures put forward did not represent any careful consideration of what might be appropriate or needed. They only represented what the Husband was prepared to pay. It was that simple.

She felt very guilty and I have no doubt that her guilt was used against her on a regular basis. The Husband has accepted and, I so find, that he regularly brought up the subject in arguments.

I am clear that the Wife had no real knowledge of finances. She was simply accustomed to spending as she chose and she did not know what it would cost to run her own life. As far as she was concerned she trusted her Husband on financial matters. She had never had to budget or consider the detail of any financial package. Both the Husband and Dr B have given evidence that she said that the financial deal was "generous" and that she said that she "did not want the Husband's money". I accept that she may have said these things even though no clear date has been put upon her utterances. However, it is obvious to me that she had no idea what she needed and I therefore discount the reliability of her perception of the terms as actually being generous. I do not think that she had the information or knowledge to judge. Moreover, she was unable to concentrate upon such matters as her state of mind was in such flux. </p>

I have no doubt that it was said to the Wife very regularly and she was made to feel that signing the agreement would be an act of good faith but this was not the true meaning of the phrase. I come to the conclusion that it only makes sense from the Husband's perspective, when consideration is given to his mind set and his knowledge that it substantially limited his financial liability to her. From the Husband's point of view, there was no point in having a financial agreement unless it confined the wife's claims particularly given his view that he did not want Mr Y to have access to his capital. It also had the advantage that it subjected her to a measure of continued control through the payment of maintenance if the marriage did break down. The Wife probably saw the phrase in terms of putting her trust in the Husband to be fair but, in that, she was sadly mistaken.</p>

Dr B said he felt it was too early to ask the Husband to deal with this type of issue. He may be correct in that analysis. Nevertheless it is a graphic illustration of the fact that the Husband would countenance no viewpoint but his own. If he was prepared to walk out of a professional meeting (which was attempting to further the reconciliation process) I am clear that his behaviour at home was likely to be much more petulant if matters were raised that he did not like. He was accustomed to having his own way and I accept the Wife's version of their home life during this period to the effect that he was absolutely insistent that the agreement be signed and would not listen to her view point on various issues. </p>

Given his position in the family as friend and counsellor over the years she probably trusted him more than her own solicitors (with whom she had little acquaintance and who had been chosen for her by her husband). The doctor's comments were incorrect and he was, as I have already found, the Husband's man. I am convinced that the doctor's words would have reassured the Wife that there was little real disadvantage in signing the agreement, whilst there was a lot to be gained given that the marriage might then continue. </p>

He diagnosed mild to moderate depressions and his reports states "The precipitating factor appears to be her marital problems. Other elements of aetiological significance are her unsettled upbringing with frequent moves and the unhappiness she experienced as a result of her parent's marital problems, which in turn seems to have contributed to the development of an anxious and possibly co-dependant personality, with a tendency to self-criticism, a low self-confidence and poor self-esteem". Having observed her in the witness box this description seems to me to be both insightful and accurate. It is now clear that her depression was building over the months =prior to this referral. Having reviewed the evidence it is probable that she was suffering from mild depression by early March. </p>

He said "My recollection is that there was a finality about the situation, that although my advice had been "don't sign" and I think if Mrs A had been with me I would have tried to have a conversation with her and go through the issues again. This was a brief conversation for two reasons: One I was not in position to have a long conversation and secondly, something had happened, a decision had been made and Mrs A felt she had to sign the document and I had to provide the means for it to be signed that night". He described the call as "Pretty awful. It was a very distressed call. My experience is that many clients at the time when something is going seriously wrong in the marriage or immediately after the breakdown are very stressed and you can tell from the tone of their voice and the look on their face, which is often very drawn and white, that they are going through turmoil and are in a bad way and I certainly already had prior experience of that in Mrs A's case. This call I would regard and I regarded at the time and I regard now as a desperate call". I accept that description as being entirely accurate.</p>

She repeated that she was going to sign because she had promised the Respondent. After the end of the conversation she recovered quickly and talked to a friend about a social engagement". This version seeks to give the impression that in some way the Wife was faking her distress. I discount this entirely. In fact, I found Mr Az a most unsatisfactory witness. He is clearly in the Husband's pay and his loyalty lies only to him. At certain times in his evidence he appeared very uncomfortable and at the end he made eye contact with his employer (the Husband) and received a nod of approval from the latter. I am clear that the Wife was in a dreadful emotional state.</p>

Even allowing for the fact that her experience of clients was limited, I accept her description of the level of the Wife's distress. It has been submitted that the Wife's anguish was only a manifestation of her moral dilemma because she knew that she had committed adultery with Mr Y the previous day. I accept that this might have been part of her torment. Indeed, a passage of the original attendance note that was omitted from the final version (and which has caused so much angst in relation to the solicitor's alleged misconduct) reads as follows "You said that you wanted to be in good faith to your Husband and you did not know if you wanted to be in your marriage any longer, your husband wanted you to love him". Others have had difficulty in interpreting what this means (and I can understand that, given the solicitors did not know that the Wife had been with Mr Y on the 8th March). However, I am clear that it expresses the Wife's wish to act in good faith and establishes her not being sure if she really wanted a reconciliation. If this was her state of mind, as I find it was, then the only reason she can have signed the agreement on that night was due to the fact that she felt she had no alternative. This is supportive of (and not contradictory to) my express finding that she was acting under undue pressure or, expressed another way, as a result of the undue influence of her Husband. </p>

I repeat I am clear and so find that the Wife's free will was overborne as a direct result of the threats that the Husband had made to her over the previous 24 &#8211; 48 hours and his course of conduct since the 9th December. By acting as she did, the Wife bought herself a breathing space but had manifestly acted to her disadvantage whilst under duress. </p>

He made it clear that, if she did not, there would be no reconciliation. As the Husband knew that she wanted above all else to save the marriage, felt overwhelmingly guilty and did not want her affair to destroy her or children's lives, his ultimatum about the agreement being a pre-requisite to the marriage continuing put her under severe, undue and unacceptable pressure. I find that she was given no effective choice and her free will was overborne. I am absolutely satisfied that the Husband made his position abundantly clear to her whenever the matter was raised. He used his dominant position both emotional and financial (in the sense that he knew she had no financial independence) to ensure that she felt that she had no alternative but to sign the agreement. On the 8th and 9th March he told her that she could not come home unless she signed it. She signed the agreement at about 8 pm on the 9th March only because she knew that he meant it and she had no realistic alternative if she wanted to return to her home (to be with her children) and to give the marriage a further chance.</heading>

This is supposedly confirmed by the fact that, during discussions between the Wife and her advisers on that date, it was pointed out to her that this type of agreement would be binding unless there was inadequate disclosure, no proper negotiation or she was subject to undue pressure or duress. It is not now suggested that this "strategy" was improper although "it might be thought by the man in the street as unprincipled". </p>

Counsel must clearly set out the detail in writing before any witness falls to be cross- examined. Mr Mostyn QC had not taken this latter course and that is why I directed that he must effectively plead his case. At the time this written document came into being, his allegations were based only upon the type written attendance notes and the manuscript note "make as bad as poss". In fact, he made it clear that, had it not been for the latter phrase, an active strategy might not have been suggested. This seems to me to have been slim evidence upon which to make very serious allegations. I accept that the Husband and his team were always entitled to investigate the various inconsistencies between the documents, being the hand written notes, typed attendance notes and affidavits. I am also clear that those words required a full and proper explanation. But I consider that it would have been much more prudent for Counsel to reserve his position, to investigate and to highlight concerns rather than to impugn professional integrity as the effective starting point, particularly given the evidence upon which the allegations were based. </p>

She was clear that it was a pre-requisite to the marriage continuing and that she wanted to effect a reconciliation. At the first meeting (which lasted some 2 hours) neither the Wife nor the solicitors present (Mr V and his assistant GG) knew the precise terms of the deal on offer but they did know that the Husband wanted (i) shared custody with a proviso that the Wife would not to leave the UK and (ii) a requirement that she would not claim against his business and would accept monthly maintenance. The solicitors' record (only a hand written attendance note) indicates that the Husband wanted an agreement drawn up so that the Wife would not take "his &#163; or the children". There is a note "not sure that he treats W as his equal". The Wife reported that her husband was "angry, sad, verbally abusive since the affair. He was not v. popular, v. protective &#8211;not allowed anywhere without a driver/bodyguard". Later the record notes "you have admitted that [you were] wrong but can't be subject to conditions and be berated for evermore". The note states that "H wants an agreement signed before Xmas". I consider that that is an accurate record of what the Wife told the solicitors at that meeting. It is confirmatory of my own findings after hearing the parties' oral testimony on these relevant events.</p>

Strongest possible advice for you [i.e. the Wife] and for Husband not to do this now. It will destroy the marriage and then you [i.e. the Wife] are prejudicing your position on divorce".

That said, she was correct in her statement about the various possible ways that an agreement might be overturned. I am clear that GG was not seeking to advise the client to take those steps. Mr V immediately stated that it would be a "risky strategy" only because he was discouraging the use of this type of scenario. He explained that the Law had moved on. It is well known within the profession (and I take judicial notice of this) that the Courts have in recent times placed increasing weight on agreements made between parties after proper disclosure and full legal advice. Far from being the commencement of a strategy, I accept the solicitors' evidence, that it was a proper explanation of possible ways in which an agreement could be overturned.

It reads as follows "Attending Mr Z on his telephoning when he said that your husband was going to be adamant about you singing the Post nuptial agreement. He appreciated that you wanted a clean break but the provision offered would not stop that happening" [emphasis added]. As I have already noted by this Mr Z must have envisaged this occurring through the capitalisation of a periodical payments order.</p>

Mr V accepted that this is a stance which can be taken in the context of pre- nuptial agreements. But I did not understand him to accept that that was his course of action in this case. In fact, I do not consider that there was any real or effective room for financial investigation or negotiation in this case. On the 15th February 2005 Mr V wrote a letter to Mr Z in which he asked a series of mild questions (see above). The Husband's reaction to that letter as reported by the Wife and her consequent reaction meant that there was little that these solicitors could do to advance disclosure. Far from there being the implementation of a strategy of no negotiation or discovery, these solicitors had tried to discover further details of the Husband's means and were thwarted. They soon appreciated that in the light of the Husband's stance and its effect upon their client there was, in reality, no possibility of true negotiation. The mild questions they had asked had, as I have already found, provoked an unacceptable outburst from the Husband. </p>

Ms M and Mr V were recalled to give yet further oral evidence on this point. I do not share Mr Mostyn's surprise or scepticism. I accept that Ms M may have been mistaken in her earlier assumptions but these notes were prepared 20 months ago. I am clear she made assumptions as to what had occurred. GG also thought it probable that she had made changes to the document. It may be that she did make some amendments as she shared the office with Mr V. I do not consider that any witness gave me deliberately false evidence on this point. If Ms M in her original oral testimony told me that she believed that GG had made the amendments that is because that is what she genuinely thought had happened. GG said that she made corrections because this was the firm's habitual routine. Once Ms M was informed that the document might have been amended by Mr V she was honest enough to tell me that she might have been mistaken. I doubt that the partner, Mr V, dealt directly with her and she was probably wholly unaware who had made the changes.

Hence, he asserts, its deliberate omission is a clear demonstration of wrongdoing by solicitors. I do not agree with his points. As I have already decided, this phrase does not mean that the Wife was accepting of the fact that she was acting in good faith. In order to procure his construction Mr Mostyn QC had to transpose the 3 parts of the phrase. In his submissions he kept using the phrase "You said that you wanted to be in good faith to your Husband and your husband wanted you to love him, you did not know if you wanted to be in your marriage any longer". Obviously this construction alters the meaning and was never included in any draft. Interpreting the phrase in the correct order, it is not possible to place his construction upon it. On the contrary, as I find, it is supportive of the fact that the Wife was under pressure. I do not believe that it was omitted for any sinister reason and I accept Mr V's explanation that it was removed because it was not understood. I acquit him of any wrong doing. GG has not been re-questioned on this aspect of the case and I do not think it necessary. If she was responsible for its omission I would not consider her guilty of any wrong doing.</p>

They did not engage in any strategy or plan to give their client an exit route. Mr V and GG did their best to advise her in very difficult circumstances when she was clearly under (that which I have found to be unacceptable) pressure and, in the final analysis, they followed her instructions. The solicitors appreciated that these attendance notes might be seen in the context of later proceedings but I accept that they did not prepare them with that in mind. GG said that she wanted the attendance note of the meeting of the 9th March to be detailed and graphic because she was concerned that the client might complain at a later stage. It was put to her that she should have made the client sign a letter of exoneration. As a counsel of perfection, I agree that she should, but the agreement was signed at about 8 pm and I expect that all concerned wanted to leave the office. If there had been a plan to present a slanted version of what occurred I doubt that a young trainee would have been entrusted to undertake the drafting (which was not greatly altered). On the basis of the evidence that I heard and the documents that have been placed before me, I am absolutely clear that none of the allegations raised by Mr Mostyn QC are made out. </p>

I pointed out that I had also been instructed by his solicitors. I have no personal friendships with anyone in the legal teams in this case.

Dealing with these allegations has taken at least 2 days of Court time, hours of my time and some 16 pages of this Judgment.

The reconciliation was produced on the 17th January 2006. It was prepared by a Mr R (Husband's accountant) and KQ, a trusted employee of the Husband. That reconciliation produced a figure of &#163;47,516,676. The document showed the differences in presentation between the figures given in the previous 2 asset schedules. In the main, the differences related to omissions in the Form E, including the value of wine (&#163;11.7m), indirect interests in family trusts (&#163;11.2m), a reduced valuation for some Lebanese Land (&#163;2.1m) and a reduction in cash (&#163;16.1 million). The notes pointed out that although some funds had been included there was $9.6 million in an indemnity fund in MA No 1 Trust and that the total ignored the fact that there was JAF litigation. The reconciliation took into account the continuing funding costs of the business since the post nuptial agreement (about 1 year). The running costs of some &#163;5 million were noted through an increase in Bank overdraft, provision referred to as ZZZ group financial requirements and a loan from BA of &#163;560,000 odd. This presentation would suggest the business was causing a monthly loss of some &#163;400,000. As I have already pointed out several different figures emerge from the various papers as to the precise level of loss. However I take this reconciliation as providing a reasonable indication. </p>

I fear that I am partially to blame for this situation having occurred, because I agreed to a reduced time estimate in order to secure a Judge with great expertise for the FDR. However, I am now convinced that cases such as this need a full day. In the event, no proper thought was given to Directions and no provision was made for any further case management.

He pointed to the case of Irvine v Irvine 2006 EWHC 583 (Ch). However, although the Husband has a minority holding, in most cases the other owners are his mother and brother. The Husband told me and I accept that the family wished "to get out of Lebanon" as soon as possible. Although relationships in the family are (and always have been) strained they have always acted in concert when it comes to realising assets. I am satisfied that, in financial matters, they act for their mutual, group benefit. Accordingly, I do not consider that any application of a minority discount is appropriate for the properties held by the family. This approach accords with the recent decision by Coleridge J in Charman v Charman <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2006/1879" uk:canonical="[2006] EWHC 1879 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWHC 1879 (Fam)</ref>.

Of this sum, &#163;7.68 million relates to the expected proceeds of sale from the realisation of remaining assets by June 2008. The remainder due is already held in cash. Mr N reduces this sum by a factor of 50% for two reasons (i) The ongoing litigation with JAF and (ii) the uncertainty and risk that future sales will not materialise. I note that the Husband is no longer a party to the JAF litigation as the personal claim against him has been struck out (subject to appeal). I consider that a 50% deduction for these points is unwarranted. In similar fashion, I consider Mr G is too bullish in allowing no discount. There are some risks involved and there is a time lag to 2008 in respect of 72% of the value of the fund. No satisfactory evidence of other discounts was led and so doing the best I can I consider that 20% is the appropriate deduction for the level of risk involved.</p>

Of course, the business will have a continuing need for cash in the short term if it is to survive whilst it is being rationalised and sales are being effected. I have no doubt that rationalisation must begin immediately and the Husband should not delay in the hope of improvement. Having heard all the evidence, I do not consider that liquidity will cause insuperable problems in this case and I am willing to hear further submissions on dates for payments once this Judgment has been absorbed by the parties.</p>

	      <p class="ind" style="margin-left:1in">"Self-evidently, fairness requires the court to take into account all the circumstances of the case. Indeed, the statute so provides. It is also self-evident that the circumstances in which the statutory powers have to be exercised vary widely. As Butler-Sloss LJ said in Dart v Dart <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1996] 2 FLR 286" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">[1996] 2 FLR 286</ref>, 303, the statutory jurisdiction provides for all applications for ancillary financial relief, from the poverty stricken to the multi-millionaire. But there is one principle of universal application which can be stated with confidence. In seeking to achieve a fair outcome, there is no place for discrimination between husband and wife and their respective roles. Typically, a husband and wife share the activities of earning money, running their home and caring for their children. Traditionally, the husband earned the money, and the wife looked after the home and the children. This traditional division of labour is no longer the order of the day. Frequently both parents work. Sometimes it is the wife who is the money-earner, and the husband runs the home and cares for the children during the day. But whatever the division of labour chosen by the husband and wife, or forced upon them by circumstances, fairness requires that this should not prejudice or advantage either party when considering para (f), relating to the parties' contributions. This is implicit in the very language of para (f): '&#8230; the contribution which each has made or is likely &#8230; to make to the welfare of the family, including any contribution by looking after the home or caring for the family'. If, in their different spheres, each contributed equally to the family, then in principle it matters not which of them earned the money and built up the assets. There should be no bias in favour of the money-earner and against the home-maker and the child-carer."</p>

	  <paragraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ind" style="margin-left:1in">"A practical consideration follows from this. Sometimes, having carried out the statutory exercise, the judge's conclusion involves a more or less equal division of the available assets. More often, this is not so. More often, having looked at all the circumstances, the judge's decision means that one party will receive a bigger share than the other. Before reaching a firm conclusion and making an order along these lines, a judge would always be well advised to check his tentative views against the yardstick of equality of division. As a general guide, equality should be departed from only if, and to the extent that, there is good reason for doing so. The need to consider and articulate reasons for departing from equality would help the parties and the court to focus on the need to ensure the absence of discrimination"</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">I am clear that this is not a case where there should be an equal division of assets. This relationship which began as cohabitation and led subsequently to marriage lasted some 12 &#189; years. There was no marital acquest which falls to be divided. In fact, the assets have diminished substantially over the last 5 years. Moreover, all the assets in this case were inherited by the Husband and that is another factor which is of central relevance. All these factors convince me that an equal division would not be appropriate and it would not be discriminatory to the Wife if she received less than half. </p>

In this case the assets fall into the bracket known as "Non matrimonial" because they all derive from the Husband's inheritance in 1998. Therefore, I must give proper weight to their origin and I accept that they should not be invaded unnecessarily. However, in this case, there is little marital property (as it has now been defined) and so the award will have to be made from the Husband's inheritance. I have no doubt that the Court is entitled so to do, for this was made clear per Lord Nichols in <span style="font-style:italic">White</span>. </p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">As has been clear for a number of years, I must take into account the parties' contributions both financial and non financial to the welfare of the family and their needs. I must also consider whether the claimant is to be compensated, per Baroness Hale, for "relationship generated disadvantage". At paragraph 138, Baroness Hale said:</p>
	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">"The most common rationale is that the relationship has generated needs which it is right that the other party should meet. In the great majority of cases, the court is trying to ensure that each party and their children have enough to supply their needs, set at a level as close as possible to the standard of living which they enjoyed during the marriage (note that the House did not adopt a restrictive view of needs in White: see pp 608g to 609a). This is a perfectly sound rationale where the needs are the consequence of the parties' relationship, as they usually are. The most common source of need is the presence of children, whose welfare is always the first consideration, or of other dependent relatives, such as elderly parents. But another source of need is having had to look after children or other family members in the past. Many parents have seriously compromised their ability to attain self-sufficiency as a result of past family responsibilities. Even if they do their best to re-enter the employment market, it will often be at a lesser level than before, and they will hardly ever be able to make up what they have lost in pension entitlements. A further source of need may be the way in which the parties chose to run their life together. Even dual career families are difficult to manage with completely equal opportunity for both. Compromises often have to be made by one so that the other can get ahead. All couples throughout their lives together have to make choices about who will do what, sometimes forced upon them by circumstances such as redundancy or low pay, sometimes freely made in the interests of them both. The needs generated by such choices are a perfectly sound rationale for adjusting the parties' respective resources in compensation."</p>

I do not accept these figures, they are too high. Having looked at the Estate Agents particulars included in the bundle and assessed the Wife's evidence on the cost of housing, I consider that she needs a house costing some &#163;4 million, plus stamp duty of &#163;160,000 and moving costs of &#163;10,000. This will provide a property with a garden in a good area, close to the children's schools. It also reflects the fact that the former matrimonial home sold for in excess of &#163;8 million.

Therefore, I will do my best to assess what I consider would be fair taking into account the lavish lifestyle that the parties lived, the current asset base and what I consider can and should be afforded in the future. I consider that a total housing fund of &#163;4.5 million is appropriate.

I would not normally expect a case such as this to be resolved by a Fournier type approach. I accept that a Duxbury calculation would not provide the entire answer because the Wife is young and the relationship is of medium length. However, I would have expected at least some bespoke calculations of the sort that were approved in the case of F v F 1995 2 FLR 45. Mr Mostyn QC produced no final written submissions in relation to this aspect of the case. In fact, until I invited him to do so he made no submissions. It is never prudent to run a case upon the basis that there is only one outcome. His brief submission was to the effect that if the maintenance was capitalised the Wife should receive &#163;240,000 for 12 years being &#163;2.88 - &#163;3 million. During the last year the Wife has apparently spent about &#163;100,000 more than the interim maintenance which I awarded her (which was in line with the agreement). There was no proper assessment of the figure of &#163;240,000 and I do not think that &#163;450,000 can be justified. Overall I consider that a total fund of &#163;4.5 million is appropriate. On a very simplistic basis, this could produce &#163;250,000 per annum for 18 years (which equates broadly to future years of mothering until tertiary education is complete) or &#163;300,000 per annum for 15 years or &#163;375,000 for 12 years. I note that the children are only 6 and 4 years old with the result that there are many years of child care ahead and I consider that the Wife would be very foolish to spend at these rates. If this sum is husbanded properly it will last much longer.</p>
