Thereafter, he was in the primary care of M in Russia, although he maintained contact and a relationship with his father (&#8220;F&#8221;). The post separation relationship between the parents seems to have been reasonably good. In 2019, F formed a relationship with a new partner, whom he married in May 2019. At about that time, they relocated to England under the EU Settlement scheme and have lived in London ever since. </p>

There is no doubt that M did not oppose Z travelling to England with F. The question is whether it was for a short, temporary trip of 2 months or so, ending on or about 31 August 2021 (as M asserts) or a relocation with F for a period of 3 years (as F asserts). Central to the issue is a notarised document dated 15 April 2021 pursuant to which, so F submits but M denies, M agreed to Z leaving Russia to live with F in England until 1 June 2024. </p>

It is therefore important to recognise that the nature of the relief which is granted under the 1980 Convention is essentially of an interim, procedural nature. It does no more than to return the child to the home country for the courts of that country to determine his or her long-term future. The relief granted under the Convention does not make any long-term substantive welfare decisions in relation to the subject child. If one were to draw an analogy with a financial dispute the relief is akin to a freezing order coupled with a direction that the assets the subject of the dispute be placed within the jurisdiction of the </span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I have to say that I have been appalled by the sheer weight of documentation in what are supposed to be summary proceedings. M has filed 6 statements, F 4. Some of the statements were served unreasonably late; one working day before the hearing, M provided a 92 paragraph statement with numerous exhibits. The bundle far exceeds that which was permitted by case management orders or the Practice Direction. My admittedly relatively limited experience on the bench of Hague Convention cases is that they are becoming increasingly unwieldy and unfocused, with lengthy statements far beyond that which is proportionate (and not subject to any specific court orders, guidance, or practice direction to impose page limits), and an increasing reliance on oral evidence. It cannot be right for proceedings, which should be determined summarily within a matter of weeks, to become bogged down by apparently unlimited witness evidence, written and oral, where every minute detail is advanced. The effect is that cases requiring swift disposal are treated as if they are full blown fact-finding and/or welfare hearings, but shoehorned into inadequate time estimates. Practitioners in this specialist field should adopt a more limited and targeted approach to the case. My personal view is that Hague Convention cases would benefit from updated practice guidance, limiting the length of narrative statements and position statements, addressing the use of oral evidence, and reinforcing bundle limits. </p>

I understand that the decision has attracted some controversy, but I agree with Mostyn J. Conventionally, no oral evidence is received in cases where Article 13(b) is pleaded. As Mostyn J said, there is no obvious reason why that defence generally proceeds without oral evidence, but other defences, including consent, proceed with oral evidence. Nowadays, there is usually placed before the court a plethora of emails, text messages, WhatsApps and the like which enable the judge to see real-time documentation, in chronological form. When the court is required to exercise its summary jurisdiction within the set criteria of the Hague Convention, it seems to me that usually such material (and any other written evidence supplied) will enable the court to do so. Contemporaneous documentation of this nature is likely to be the most valuable evidence for the court. I am confident that in this case, had I not received oral evidence but confined myself to the written narrative evidence, documentation, and oral submissions, I would have reached the same decision.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">On 28 September 2021, M made accusations to the police (based on what she has allegedly been told by Z) that F had been responsible for physical abuse against Z, including locking him in a loft. A social services assessment dated 17 December 2021 concluded that Z may be being &#8220;coached&#8221; by M and there was nothing concrete during work carried out with Z to explore the disclosures further. No major concerns were raised about F&#8217;s care of Z. I cannot make any findings about this matter, which in any event is largely irrelevant to the determination which I must make. For the avoidance of doubt, these allegations do not affect my view of the case. A Cafcass Officer, Ms Demery, prepared a report for the court although I am not entirely clear why she was asked to do so, given that child objections form no part of F&#8217;s defence to the 1980 Hague Convention application. Ms Demery referred to the possibility of Z being influenced by his mother, and it is not possible to conclude that his wishes and feelings are his own. The impression I have of this young child is that he is, unfortunately, caught up in the middle of parental conflict which is highly detrimental to his welfare. </p>

There is much force in F&#8217;s complaints, although they do not directly affect the issues of consent and acquiescence, and I take the view that they were borne of anger and frustration at what she perceived as being thwarted in her entitlement to take Z back to Russia. If anything, arguably, her actions were inconsistent with the suggestion that she had acquiesced in the manner asserted by F. </p>

There is also a choice to be made as to the depth into which the judge will go in investigating the merits of the case before making that choice. One size does not fit all. The judge may well find it convenient to start from the proposition that it is likely to be better for a child to return to his home country for any disputes about his future to be decided there. A case against his doing so has to be made. But the weight to be given to that factor and to all the other relevant factors, some of which are canvassed in </span>

These policy considerations include, not only the swift return of abducted children, but also comity between the Contracting States and respect for one another's judicial processes. Furthermore, the Convention is there, not only to secure the prompt return of abducted children, but also to deter abduction in the first place. The message should go out to potential abductors that there are no safe havens among the Contracting States.</span>

 <span style="font-size:11pt;color:#000000">43. My Lords, in cases where a discretion arises from the terms of the Convention itself, it seems to me that the discretion is at large. The court is entitled to take into account the various aspects of the Convention policy, alongside the circumstances which gave the court a discretion in the first place and the wider considerations of the child's rights and welfare. I would, therefore, respectfully agree with Thorpe LJ in the passage quoted in para 32 above, save for the word "overriding" if it suggests that the Convention objectives should always be given more weight than the other considerations. Sometimes they should and sometimes they should not.</span>

As is clear from the earlier discussion, the Convention was the product of prolonged discussions in which some careful balances were struck and fine distinctions drawn. The underlying purpose is to protect the interests of children by securing the swift return of those who have been wrongfully removed or retained. The Convention itself has defined when a child must be returned and when she need not be. Thereafter the weight to be given to Convention considerations and to the interests of the child will vary enormously. The extent to which it will be appropriate to investigate those welfare considerations will also vary. But the further away one gets from the speedy return envisaged by the Convention, the less weighty those general Convention considerations must be."</span>

 <span style="font-size:11pt;color:#000000">, para 55, "it is inconceivable that a court which reached the conclusion that there was a grave risk that the child's return would expose him to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place him in an intolerable situation would nevertheless return him to face that fate." It was not the policy of the Convention that children should be put at serious risk of harm or placed in intolerable situations. In consent or acquiescence cases, on the other hand, general considerations of comity and confidence, particular considerations relating to the speed of legal proceedings and approach to relocation in the home country, and individual considerations relating to the particular child might point to a speedy return so that her future can be decided in her home country."</span>

This is something to which the courts attach the greatest possible importance. We all want children to be returned as soon as possible to the place from which they have been wrongfully removed. The reasons why the Convention exists to secure this are partly that it is bad for children to be uprooted from one jurisdiction to another and partly to fulfil the obvious proposition that if there is a dispute between parents as to the future of their child it is better dealt with in the courts of the country where the child has hitherto been habitually resident because that is where the best information lies.</span>

Miss Jakens, on the other hand, might say that the spirit of the Convention is always an important factor in the discretionary exercise; that the spirit of the Convention is that wrongfully abducted children should be returned to the country of their habitual residence; and that, where there has been consent to the removal, then, in effect, the abduction is not wrongful, with the result, that the spirit of the Convention a less potent a factor in favour of return than in other cases under Art 13."</span>

The French court was obviously the more convenient court to decide contentious welfare issues that existed in France and a refusal to return the children would conflict with a French order and make contact impossible.</span>

 <span style="font-size:11pt;color:#000000">To sum up, the exercise of the discretion under the Convention is acutely case-specific within a framework of policy and welfare considerations. In reaching a decision, the court will consider the weight to be attached to all relevant factors, including: the desirability of a swift restorative return of abducted children; the benefits of decisions about children being made in their home country; comity between member states; deterrence of abduction generally; the reasons why the court has a discretion in the individual case; and considerations relating to the child's welfare.</span>

 <span style="font-size:11pt;color:#000000">In a consent case, the better view is that the weight to be given to the policy considerations of counteracting wrongful removal and deterring abduction may be relatively slight, while the weight to be attached to home-based decision-making and comity will depend critically on the facts of the case and the view that the court takes of the effect of a summary return on the child's welfare.&#8221;</span>

 <span style="font-size:11pt;color:#333333">1. For the purposes of Article 13 of the Convention, the question whether the wronged parent has "acquiesced" in the removal or retention of the child depends upon his actual state of mind. As Neill L.J. said in </span>

She told me that if M had indeed sought Z&#8217;s return in early August (a matter of days after he had arrived in England), F would surely have agreed. In fact, as we now know, he did not agree. This reinforced a view of F which I had formed during his oral evidence, that from the moment Z arrived in this country, he had no intention of returning Z either to Russia or to M&#8217;s care. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I am unpersuaded that, prior to Z arriving in England on 24 July 2021, M consented to Z relocating to live here with F for a period of 3 years. Such consent must be demonstrably clear and unequivocal; it was neither.

In fact, in my judgment, one can see from the text messages that M did <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">not</span> consent in the terms alleged by F, although from time to time, during their discussions, various different arrangements were posited. My sense is that F chose to listen to, or read, that which suited what he wanted, in the hope and expectation that matters would turn out as he wished. He probably persuaded himself that M had agreed to relocation, when in fact she had not.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The starting point is that Z had lived in Russia all his life. He had never before been to England. M had been his primary carer. This was not a case of shared care and regular international travel. Accordingly, it seems to me that for Z to have relocated, to a new country and to live with a different parent, would have been a very considerable step for M to have agreed to, and must be judged in that context. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">There is no doubt that in February 2021, M was having difficulties in her life with a relationship breakdown, job, and money issues. There is equally no doubt that she turned to F to help her with Z. The question is whether she decided (and F agreed) that Z should go to live with F in London for 3 years. F, consistently in his written evidence, says that agreement to that effect was reached at that time (although in oral evidence he said mid March 2021, rather than February 2021), and nothing thereafter caused him to doubt that agreement had been reached. He did not even refer in his written evidence to discussions from February onwards. I did not find that persuasive. The messages from February onwards plainly show ongoing, fluid discussion and debate about a variety of issues over several months. F himself accepted that M would change her mind, but this did not seem to have affected his view of the agreement allegedly reached in February 2021. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In my judgment, these text messages demonstrate (particularly in the early days) unhappiness, heightened emotion, and a degree of confusion in M&#8217;s mind. The parties were in discussion, and there was no obvious agreement of meeting of minds. As M told me, no concrete decision was made; dates, length of stay and other such important practical matters constantly changed. On one thing M was consistent, that the problem in their discussions was &#8220;custody&#8221; which I take to mean the notion of Z living with F. When searching for clear and unequivocal consent to Z relocating to England, to my mind the highest the case can be put, by this stage, was that M had on 17 February 2021 suggested that Z could go to F for &#8220;half a year&#8221; which would suggest an end point of 17 August 2021. That, however, was overtaken by M&#8217;s text of 28 March 2021 explicitly referring to July and August. It seems to me, therefore, that the document of 15 April 2021 must be seen against a background where (i) no clear agreement was reached and (ii) M was talking, during somewhat freeform discussions, of a summer trip lasting 2 months. I am confident, having heard her, that M had in mind nothing more extensive than a trip during the holidays (and possibly similar trips in the future), whereupon Z would return to attend school in Russia. </p>

F asserts that it means M consented to Z going to England to live with him until 1 June 2024. M says that the document does no more than allow Z to travel back and forth between Russia and England. M told me, and I accept, that the intention was for each of them to do mirror consents at the same time; that is evidenced by a message from M to F on 15 April 2021 saying, &#8220;Have you drawn up the consent?&#8221; to which F replied, &#8220;I have not yet had time&#8221;. F told me in evidence that he envisaged two different types of consent (for him, facilitating relocation, whereas for M permitting holiday trips with Z) but nothing in the messages supported this. </p>

She sent details of the SKOLA Regent&#8217;s Park summer school to F on 15 April 2021 and talked of private tutors on 16 May 2021. Having read these exchanges about schooling carefully, I am not satisfied that M, prior to Z leaving for England, was unequivocally committing to schooling in England, beyond something temporary in nature, during school holidays when she thought he could travel from Russia to England. </p>

I am satisfied that they do not demonstrate clear and unequivocal consent to Z leaving Russia permanently (or at any rate for 3 years) to live with F in London. They are emotional and changeable. They show that M anticipated a short period of travel, enabling Z to receive education in London during that period. Time and again M said that she did not agree to &#8220;custody&#8221; which is surely what relocation with F for a number of years would have been. The evidence points to this having been a temporary arrangement, as M says, and not a near permanent relocation, as F says. Put another way, the evidence does not demonstrate clear and unequivocal consent, whatever F may have misinterpreted or chosen to believe. Such consent was not explicit, nor can it be inferred, or imputed to M. </p>

He was in the care of his mother as primary carer. A school place in Russia was arranged. His wider family and previous friends are in Russia. The trip to England, as I find it, was for a temporary visit. Habitual residence did not in that time switch from Russia to England.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It follows that the Article 3 requirements are established, and the Article 13(a) defences fail. I therefore will make an order for return of Z to Russia. It will be for that jurisdiction to determine welfare arrangements, including contact arrangements and any application by F for Z to live with him in England. </p>
