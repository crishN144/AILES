He was born as a result of a previous relationship by her with a Mr CG. D has lived with his maternal grandmother since June 1998. On 16 July 1999 Suffolk County Council, (&#8220;the local authority&#8221;), commenced care proceedings in respect of D. On 2 March 2000 D was made the subject of a care order by the East Suffolk Family Proceedings Court (&#8220;the court&#8221;).</p>

She subsequently summarised her concerns at a child protection conference as follows. He was not included in the family circle. He was disciplined differently from the other children. He was smacked by his parents that at times left marks on his body. He was persistently criticised. He was socially isolated until he started nursery.</p>

The reason for adjourning the case in relation to the other 4 children was to see whether there was a chance of them remaining together and at home. Without going into the details further, there was some prospect that the other children against whom there had been no rejection might remain with their parents. JH had already suffered and was suffering significant harm when he was, rightly in my judgment, removed in January 2002.</p>

Reliance is placed on the therapy recommended by Miss Simpson in March 2002 which had not begun. It was quite apparent by the date of the hearing that the pre-condition for such therapy to begin, namely an acknowledgement of what had gone wrong, had not started as the Justices found. The point therefore did not arise. The Justices&#8217; conclusions on this were clear and plainly justified.</p>
