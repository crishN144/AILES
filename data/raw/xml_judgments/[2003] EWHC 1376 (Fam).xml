Though it is strongly recommended by doctors and widely taken up, it is not a legal requirement.  The fathers wish their daughters to receive a range of immunisation appropriate to their age.  The mothers oppose that course.  There is therefore a dispute between the parents involving the welfare of their child.</p>

The fathers have so applied.  This is believed to be the first time that the question of immunisation has arisen for determination. Other disputes involving for instance medical treatment, choice of schools, and change of name quite frequently arise.</p>

If it is in their best interests, the court has next to consider whether there are good reasons why that declaration should not be made.  Such reasons might arise if making the declaration would so affect the mother that her ability to care for the child would be impaired, or it would be otherwise adverse to the child&#8217;s best interests.</p>

Those risks are however heavily outweighed by the benefit for a child of a full immunisation policy.  If that is established, there are no good reasons why the policy should not be implemented.  To go against the mothers wishes, though upsetting for them, is not such as should deter the court from making the declaration sought.</p>

The bacteria can be detected in people who have no symptoms but can pass it on to others.  The infection causes an acute inflammatory reaction of the superficial tissues and a diphtheria membrane is formed usually in the throat.  It can affect the heart, kidneys and nerves.  It can be fatal.</p>

It should certainly not be disregarded or lightly set aside.  But the role of the court is to exercise an independent and objective judgment.  If that judgment is in accord with that of the devoted and responsible parent, well and good.  If it is not, then it is the duty of the court, after giving due weight to the view of the devoted and responsible parent, to give effect to its own judgment.  That is what it is there for.  Its judgment may of course be wrong.  So may that of the parent.  But once the jurisdiction of the court is invoked its clear duty is to reach and express the best judgment it can.&#8217;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;All these cases depend on their own facts and render generalisations &#8211; tempting though they may be to the legal or social analyst &#8211; wholly out of place.  It can only be said safely that there is a scale, at one end of which lies the clear case where parental opposition to medical intervention is prompted by scruple or dogma of a kind which is patently irreconcilable with principles of child health and welfare widely accepted by the generality of mankind; and that at the other end lie highly problematic cases where there is genuine scope for a difference of view between parent and judge.  In both situations it is the duty of the judge to allow the court&#8217;s own opinion to prevail in the perceived paramount interests of the child concerned, but in cases at the latter end of the scale, there must be a likelihood (though never of course a certainty) that the greater the scope for genuine debate between one view and another the stronger will be the inclination of the court to be influenced by a reflection that in the last analysis the best interests of every child include an expectation that difficult decisions affecting the length and quality of its life will be taken for it by the parent to whom its care has been entrusted by nature.&#8221;</p>
