He justifies this on the basis that he has a need, following each hearing, to be able to revisit the issues discussed in court, and that he cannot be expected to take handwritten notes alongside making full representation before the court as a litigant in person.  In a further COP9 application purportedly issued on the morning of the hearing (15 January 2021), TA requested further and specific permission to audio and visually record the hearing before me.

I have reviewed the orders made in this case since that time, and am satisfied that such orders have indeed from time to time been made and repeated.

The Operations Manager observes that TA routinely challenges the competence of HMCTS staff, and he is known often to accuse the staff of colluding with the Local Authority against him.

It is easy to see how those working in the Court of Proceedings court office could have felt easily overwhelmed by the communications from TA.  His contact with the court office is and has been wholly disproportionate to the issues in the linked cases; the time taken for the hard-pressed staff to manage this correspondence (and his phone calls) will doubtless have materially distracted them from dealing with the many other Court of Protection cases which require their attention.   </p>

The refusal of either party to accept any ruling or decision of the court has meant that the court staff and judge have been inundated with emails, which they have had to deal with as best they could, with limited time and even more limited resources.

It includes the regulation of the manner in which the court process may in general be utilised. It is of course well established that the High Court may, in appropriate circumstances, grant an injunction to restrain an anticipated interference with the administration of justice, amounting to a contempt (<span style="font-style:italic">Attorney&#8722;General v Times Newspapers Ltd</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1974] AC 273" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1974">[1974] AC 273</ref>, 293G&#8722;294A, 306B).

While this is undoubtedly an exceptional order, it is in my judgment entirely justified by the facts of the case; there is a substantial risk that the process of the court will continue to be seriously abused, and that the proper administration of justice in the future will be seriously impeded by TA unless I intervene now with appropriate injunctive relief.  In my judgment the order represents a proportionate restriction on TA&#8217;s ability to communicate with the court office; he <span style="font-style:italic">may</span> continue (should he have the <span style="font-style:italic">need</span> to do so) by sending letters to the court office through the agency of Royal Mail.  TA should note, however, my direction that he cannot expect a response from anyone in the court office (which may in fact be by e-mail <span style="font-style:italic">from</span> the court office if they choose) to his correspondence, if his correspondence with the court office is abusive.  While Brooke LJ contemplated that this jurisdiction could or would be exercised by the High Court deploying its inherent jurisdiction, I propose to use the power invested in me by <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/47/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 47(1)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref></span>, given that the order is made &#8220;in connection with&#8221; the exercise of my wider jurisdiction within the Court of Protection. I propose to attach a penal notice to that injunction, so that it may be enforced, if a breach is proved to the required standard, by committal to prison if necessary.  </p>
