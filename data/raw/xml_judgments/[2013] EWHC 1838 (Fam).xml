	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The background to these proceedings is long and inevitably sad.&#160; Despite care and placement orders being made on 15 January 2008, an adoptive placement had not been found for P-M by September of the following year.&#160; In that circumstance, his mother was given leave on 25 September 2009 to apply to revoke the placement order.&#160;&#160; Ms JP's circumstances then changed with the consequence that she was granted permission to withdraw her application on 19 February 2010.&#160; At the same hearing P-M's maternal grandmother was granted leave to apply to revoke the placement order and became the applicant in the proceedings.&#160; Within those proceedings the paternal aunt and uncle had been positively assessed as kinship or family and friend carers and on 27 August 2010 all parties then involved, including the paternal aunt and uncle who were joined as parties, agreed to the placement of P-M with them.&#160; P-M moved to his paternal aunt and uncle on 7 October 2010 and two weeks later on 21 October 2010 the placement order was revoked.&#160; The care plan then in place (because P-M remained subject to the care order in favour of the LB of Brent) was for a long term placement with the paternal aunt and uncle with the intention that 12 months after placement, the paternal aunt and uncle would apply for an adoption or special guardianship order to secure P-M's future.</span></p>

Despite her support for the adoption order, Ms F wants everyone to be a member of one happy family.&#160; In my judgment, that is unrealistic.&#160; It cuts across the expressed reasons why Ms F recognises that P-M needs to be adopted.&#160; I understand and sympathise with her genuine intentions but the implied threat was there in the evidence she gave to me: "[P-M] is my grandson &#8211; he will see that I have never stopped wanting or caring for him &#8211; he will get a new Mum but he will not lose his grandmother".&#160; There remains a resentment and a distrust which will take time to resolve.&#160; Ms F is able to see how that resolution could occur but it is for the moment on her terms, particularly on the question of the frequency of contact.&#160; </span></p>

She was equally clear that three contact visits a year was insufficient for P-M.&#160; She came to her conclusion about the frequency of contact by considering a hierarchy of needs within which stability and permanence come first.&#160; My only disagreement with the impressive analysis that the Guardian provided was in her rationale for the nature and extent of any contact order, if granted.&#160; She felt it would act to reassure Ms D whereas I have come to the conclusion having seen Ms D and Ms F in evidence that unless the court is very careful, an order could generate an anxiety of its own that could be antithetic to the hierarchy of needs that the Guardian rightly identified which is the very reason for an adoption order.</span></p>

Ms F for very understandable reasons is not in a position to care for another child.&#160; Indeed, a placement with her would expose P-M to circumstances which may pose at least a risk of emotional harm.&#160; In fairness, Ms F does not seek that, instead she strongly supports the placement with Ms D and agrees to an adoption order.&#160; It is at least arguable that P-M would suffer emotional harm if the relationship with his maternal grandmother and sister were to cease.</span></p>

The key issue will be who exercises sole parental responsibility and which order(s) is/are best able to provide for the child's particular needs having regard to the effect on him during his life of ceasing to be a member of his birth family.</span></p>

A contact order could tend to be antagonistic to the rationale for the adoption order that I intend to make and everyone agrees that nothing must be allowed to put at risk the placement that P-M has with Ms D.&#160; On the other hand, Ms D must understand that it is my firm view that provided circumstances do not change for the worse, the contact that I have set out is in P-M's best interests and I expect him to be afforded the benefit of it.&#160; In particular, the contact between P-M and his sister is necessary for his welfare to be safeguarded throughout his life i.e. in the long term. </span></p>
