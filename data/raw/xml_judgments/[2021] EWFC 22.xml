The hypoxic ischaemic injury to the brain was clearly explainable by the prolonged period of cardiorespiratory arrest and resuscitation. The final important issue he concluded would be the pathology results, in particular if there was evidence of extra-axial bleeding or any evidence of traumatic brain injury. It appeared therefore that further opinion would have to await the results from Dr Cary&#8217;s requested postmortem tests. </p>

He emphasised that complete assessment of the cause of death should await the full report of Dr Cary. However, he considered a number of possible causes of death, most of which would be death from natural causes, but without finding evidence of their involvement. In relation to smothering or strangulation he deferred to Dr Cary (although Dr Cary has to date not raised evidence of these issues and found no signs of assault or restraint). His concluding assessment of the current situation was that the clinical history was suggestive of asphyxia as the cause for P collapsing. The clinical course is consistent with cardio-respiratory collapse secondary to asphyxia, occurring shortly before P was found at about 1am on 5/7/20. No alternative cause for her collapse was found by treating clinicians. The retinal haemorrhages were most likely secondary to the profound cardio-respiratory collapse. The evidence now available makes it not likely that P sustained an inflicted head injury. He perceived it to be no more likely that P&#8217;s death was unnatural then in any infant dying suddenly and unexpectedly. He reiterated that he found no inflicted injury. </p>

Standing back, I have concluded overall that it is.  This family were previously unknown to the authorities, it is perfectly obvious that they are a close and decent family, where the children were and  are lovingly and attentively cared for, and who have behaved appropriately at all times in unimaginably distressing circumstances. Whilst the local authority could not possibly be criticised for the steps which they have taken, indeed quite the reverse, all the evidence now so clearly points in one direction, that this was a tragic accident, that it is appropriate that I should exonerate the parents, and I do so.   </p>
