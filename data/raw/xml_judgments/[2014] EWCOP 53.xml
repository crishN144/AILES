			<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">&#8220;It is my opinion that TB suffers from a moderate mental retardation, almost certainly genetic in aetiology.  Mental retardation is better known in the United Kingdom as &#8216;learning disability&#8217; or &#8216;intellectual disability&#8217; and this describes a permanent condition affecting the brain/mind arising in childhood and resulting in an impaired ability to learn or acquire new or complex skills, accompanied by a significant impairment of adaptive functioning in some or all of the following domains:  communication, self-care, home living, social interpersonal skills, self-direction, functional academic skills, work, leisure, health and safety.  A Moderate Learning Disability is a significant and permanent impairment of the functioning of his mind.  This is a mental disorder that satisfies the requirement of the first stage of the two-stage capacity test as set out in the Mental Capacity Act.  An adult with a moderate learning disability would possess a range of cognitive skills and abilities typically found in a child between the age of 4 to 8 years.  A learning disability is a lifelong condition for which there is no known cure, although the impact of cognitive impairment may be significantly lessened with specific therapeutic intervention and support so as to improve adaptive functioning.&#8221;</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">At all events, the parties began in 1999 or 2000 their married life, this man and this incapacitated woman, and they had four children:  STH, born on 1 October 2001, a girl; STM, born on 17 March 2003, a girl; SSM, born on 7 January 2009, a boy; and SHT, born on 22 January 2010, a boy.  All these children were the subject of care proceedings mounted by the London Borough of Tower Hamlets against this mother and this father.  Those proceedings were heard over many days and many occasions by Judge O&#8217;Dwyer and resulted in a fact finding judgment on 29 January 2010 and two further judgments on 20 July 2010 and 17 January 2011.  The consequence of those three judgments were that all the children were removed permanently from these parents and have been placed for adoption, if not already adopted.  In the course of his first judgment on 29&#160;January 2010, the judge made what he described as grave findings against both parents but principally against the father, he having recognised in relation to the mother that she had disability, was unable to represent herself, that she has always lacked capacity to care for her children, and she is in receipt of a great deal of support from the local authority.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>In his fact finding judgment the judge made, by reference to a schedule produced by the local authority, numerous findings, but for my purposes what is relevant are the findings in relation to allegation 1 made by the local authority, which was that the relationship between the parents was and at all times has been volatile.  In that regard, the volatility was expressed by numerous instances, according to the allegation, of domestic violence meted out to the mother at the hands of the father.  That case was proved by the testimony of a witness, Ms.&#160;B, whose evidence was accepted as being generally truthful by the judge.  As a result, a number of instances of domestic violence were found proved.  I&#160;refer to para.87 of the judgement where Judge O&#8217;Dwyer made the findings clear.  He said, by reference to the assaults which he found proved:</p>

		    <subparagraph>
		      <content>
			<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">&#8220;I&#160;am satisfied that the assaults and the evidence of Ms.&#160;B establishes the local authority a case that there is a volatility in the relationship between TB and the father.  He is very fond of his wife, but he is under immense strain.  He does lose his temper.  It is also the case that he has much affection for his wife.  I&#160;could see that, as he gave evidence before me, the strain of living with somebody in the position of TB cannot be underestimated.  Although there is much input from the local authority and practical help, nonetheless, there are many aspects of emotional, day-to-day care that are very difficult.  SA feels a very strong sense of duty, but the pressure upon him and the lack of support from any network of friends and family in this country, partly no doubt as a result of his own character, leads him at times to lose his temper and to resort to physical and verbal abuse.&#8221;</p>

She returned to a regime whereby there is 24-hour, 7 day a week, 52 week a year care in 9 Emerald Mansions, which is but a two-bedroom housing association property.  So the position that endured from that point onwards was that the husband and wife were living in the property but that the carers were present in the living room 24 hours a day helping with the care of the severely incapacitated TB.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">To add to the complications, in the summer of 2011, as I&#160;have mentioned, SA married his first cousin SSB.  She was initially refused leave to enter this country by the entry clearance officer in Dhaka, but an appeal against that decision allowed her to enter for a strict six-month period on her representation that she would be financially independent and that she would assuredly leave at the end of the six-month period.  As so often happens, those promises have turned out to be false and she remains in this country.  Shortly after their marriage, she fell pregnant, and nine weeks ago the child I&#160;have mentioned, YSY, was born.  So YSY is TB&#8217;s first cousin, once removed, as well as being her stepdaughter, and the husband and both of his wives are all first cousins.</p>

By virtue of the order Bodey J. made, I&#160;think, in May, the issues were defined as to whether it was in TB&#8217;s best interests to live in 9 Emerald Mansions; if it was in her best interests to leave, where it was in her best interests to go; if she should remain, whether it is in her best interests to reside there with her husband and/or with her husband and his second wife; and whether an order should be made under s.33 of the Family Law Act requiring SA and SSB to leave and not return.  So since the early part of this year this local authority has been advancing a case that a separation was needed between this husband and this wife.</p>

They have both been consistent in their advices they have given - they have each filed more than one report - that there should be a separation between this man and this woman in her best interests in circumstances where she is incapacitated.  Both gave evidence at some considerable length before me.  Mr.&#160;Watkins described a life which he described as extremely impoverished, lived by TB at 9&#160;Emerald Mansions.  He described it to me as being a wholly oppressive environment where there is a sense of containment and monotony, where her life generally revolved only about -- by watching television.  It was a life which was obviously one where she was wholly subservient to her husband and, as Judge O&#8217;Dwyer has found, where from time to time that subservience would nonetheless result in the meting out to her of domestic violence.  He described how she would lie in bed all morning, that there was nothing in her life apart from watching TV and having care done to her by the carers.  There were no skills being developed.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">As to this empty life that she was leading, the husband, SA, places the responsibility for that squarely at the door of the local authority and the caring agency to which they have delegated her care.  Although the opinion of the independent social worker and the psychiatrist have been, consistently, there should be a separation, it is fair, as Mr.&#160;McKendrick has demonstrated through his skilful, if somewhat lengthy, cross-examination, that the wishes and feelings of TB have varied and seem to be the product of the environment in which she is presently sited.  This is perhaps not altogether surprising, bearing in mind that she has, to use shorthand, a mental age of between 4 and 8, even if that is perhaps a somewhat inaccurate way of describing her general capacity because, of course, she is 39 years old and has life experiences far longer than a child of 4 to 8 years old.  But it is perfectly true that from time to time, as Mr.&#160;McKendrick&#8217;s schedule has demonstrated, her views have varied between expressing a wish to live with her husband, sometimes expressing a wish to live with her co-wife and her co-wife&#8217;s child, to the present time when she is, now that she has been separated in circumstances which I&#160;have described, expressing very strongly the view that she wishes to live alone in her own independent accommodation and not to have contact with, let alone to cohabit with, her husband SA.</p>

The statement of Carol Nicholson that on 23 July this assault had taken place and that she had been hit on the head was not actually disputed, although I&#160;am not fixing either SA or Mr.&#160;McKendrick with an acceptance that the events there described happened.  But, at all events, the consequence of the <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte</span> application and the order made by me was that on 27 July, I&#160;having made the order that day, she was removed." </p>

SA accepted in evidence that from childhood TB has had very serious problems; he put it down to a bout of malaria (which is unlikely to be the case). Almost from the moment of her arrival here TB has needed intensive professional support. Suzanne Wilson, a clinical psychologist, told me that she had worked with her since 2001 since the birth of STH. She told me that she was always concerned for her emotional wellbeing and mental health. She was invariably very withdrawn and very unhappy. Her quality of family life was poor and it was riven with tension.  </p>

She has not prospered there as much as everyone hoped. She seems to lead a rather isolated and lonely life, spending hours lying on the sofa watching TV. Although there are common rooms she does not mingle much with other residents. Dr Joyce, the jointly instructed clinical psychologist, who was an excellent witness, considers that she ought to move to a more focussed supported placement where she is not isolated in her own flat and where she is positively helped to socialise and to undertake everyday human activities. If this is not possible then there ought to be a change in the caring team so that the carers more proactively seek to get her to engage with the other residents and with worldly activities. </p>

It has not in fact happened as often as that. The LA has suggested that at the contact SA has behaved inappropriately, and certainly on at least one occasion it ended with TB in tears. Further, there have been occasions where SA has criticised the translators who attend the sessions. However I take the view that generally the contact has been worthwhile for TB and certainly it has been important to SA who has, after all, been married to her for 18 years. There is nothing untoward in him showing her photographs of their four children on his telephone or for that matter in him showing her photographs of YSY and ISS. However he sails close to the wind when he says to TB, as he admits, that they should pray that their children are returned to them and that he will be able to take her on holiday to Bangladesh. Prayer for a person like TB is not the abstract mystery that people of full capacity understand it to be. For her I think that these suggestions come close to an inducement and I judge it to be a contributing if not the dominant factor why she has recently said that she wishes to return "home" to 9 Emerald Mansions.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For my part I do not find it necessary to make findings as to Mr McGuire's points (c), (f) and (g). The other points are amply proved by the evidence I have heard and taken together point inexorably to my determining that it is in TB's best interests that she  should not return to live with SA at 9 Emerald Mansions. This is notwithstanding that she has expressed a wish to return "home" and notwithstanding that in one sense it involves an interference with her family life. The right to family life is a qualified right and the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that it is in her best interests that she should live apart from SA. For this reason also it is necessary that SA's right to a family life is compromised. </p>

The task of the court is to apply the statutory provisions, paying close heed to the language of the statute. Nevertheless, as judges tread their way through this treacherous terrain, it is helpful to look sideways and see how the courts have applied those statutory provisions to other factual scenarios. This has nothing to do with either the doctrine of precedent or the principles of statutory interpretation. The purpose is simply to see how other judicial decisions have exposed the issues or attempted to reconcile the irreconcilable."</p>

At para 42 I concluded that that sexual capacity requires an understanding and awareness of (i) the mechanics of the act; (ii) that there are health risks involved, particularly the acquisition of sexually transmitted and sexually transmissible infections; and (iii) that sex between a man and a woman may result in the woman becoming pregnant. At paras 39 &#8211; 41 I did not accept the evidence of Dr Hall that the relevant information should extend to an awareness that both (or all) parties to the act need to consent to it. Further, as to the third criterion (pregnancy) I accepted that this would arguably not apply to sexual practices other than heterosexual vaginal sex: see para 43. </p>

In this case Mr McKendrick argues that because TB has had an IUD inserted she is in an equivalent position. The argument became increasingly far-fetched. We discussed a man who has had a vasectomy. A woman who is beyond childbearing. A man wearing a condom. Mr McGuire QC rightly captured the unreality of this debate in his final submissions when he said:</p>

Rather it should be subsumed into the second which should simply be expressed as: "that there are health risks involved". All sexual activity has some health risks. The most obvious ones are pregnancy or STDs. But over-robust sexual activity can cause wounding or bruising, external or internal. Any sexual activity can cause psychological harm. A simple criterion as I have suggested would resolve the dilemma I expressed in para 43 of <span style="font-style:italic">D Borough Council v AB </span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2011/101" uk:canonical="[2011] EWCOP 101" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] EWCOP 101</ref>, which on reflection came perilously close to introducing a <span style="font-style:italic">quoad hunc/hanc</span> dimension when I had been at pains to repudiate that. </p>

It remains in my view an important, some might argue the most important, component; certainly it is the source of the greatest damage when sexual relations are abused. The act of intercourse is often understood as having an element of self-giving qualitatively different from any other human contact. Nevertheless, the challenge remains: can it be articulated into a workable test? Again I have thought long and hard about this and acknowledge the difficulty inherent in the task. In my judgment one can do no more than this: does the person whose capacity is in question understand that they do have a choice and that they can refuse? That seems to me an important aspect of capacity and is as far as it is really possible to go over and above an understanding of the physical component. &#8221;</p>

She was unable to link sex to pregnancy. Indeed she had virtually no idea how her babies came to be in her tummy (as she put it). Although she found sex enjoyable and comfortable she had no idea that she had a choice and could refuse. Indeed the attitude of SA, based, as he told me on his culture and religion, was that he had a right to seek sex from her and that it was her duty to submit. The evidence clearly showed that TB comprehensively failed the second and third criteria as formulated by me.  Specifically she is unable to understand that information or to use or to weigh it as part of the process of making the decision.</p>

He argues that not enough practical steps have been taken. He accepts that the notion of practicability encompasses reasonableness. Therefore he argues that the furthest I can go is to make an interim declaration under section 48 rather than a "final" one under section 15. Of course a declaration under section 15 is not final in the sense that it cannot be revisited if circumstances change. He argues that TB should receive more sex education and the matter should be reviewed in a few months at yet another publicly funded hearing. He points out that I made just such an order in <span style="font-style:italic">D Borough Council v AB. </span> I firmly disagree that I should adopt such a course here. The evidence here, which I do not need to spell out in detail, clearly shows that much effort has been made to enlighten TB about the relevant information.

I agree with Suzanne Wilson that it is doubtful that TB has ever had the capacity to decide to have sex, notwithstanding that she has had four children. </p>

With that sentiment I naturally wholeheartedly agree. Discrimination is found where like cases are not treated alike. However, when making Lord Kerr's comparison you do not have two like cases. You are comparing, on the one hand, a case where an 18 year old does not need protection and, on the other, a case where the 18 year old does. They are fundamentally dissimilar. The dissimilarity justifies differential treatment in the nature of protective measures. For me, it is simply impossible to see how such protective measures can linguistically be characterised as a "deprivation of liberty". The protected person is, as Mill says, merely "in a state to require being taken care of by others, [and] must be protected against their own actions as well as against external injury". And nothing more than that.

It is a core value of the common law, long pre-dating the Convention and the Charter. The invocation of the dignity of the patient in the form of declaration habitually used when the court is exercising its inherent declaratory jurisdiction in relation to the gravely ill or dying is not some meaningless incantation designed to comfort the living or to assuage the consciences of those involved in making life and death decisions: it is a solemn affirmation of the law's and of society's recognition of our humanity and of human dignity as something fundamental. Not surprisingly, human dignity is extolled in article 1 of the Charter, just as it is in article 1 of the Universal Declaration. And the latter's call to us to "act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood" is nothing new. It reflects the fourth Earl of Chesterfield's injunction, "Do as you would be done by" and, for the Christian, the biblical call (Matthew ch 7, v 12): "all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets". &#8221;</p>

Moreover, the positive obligation of the State to take reasonable and appropriate measures to secure the rights of the disabled under article 8 of the Convention (and, I would add, under articles 1, 3(1), 7 and 26 of the Charter) and, in particular, the positive obligation of the State to secure their essential human dignity, calls for human empathy and humane concern as society, in Judge Greve's words, seeks to try to ameliorate and <span style="font-style:italic">compensate</span> for the disabilities faced by persons in A and B's situation (my emphasis). &#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is exactly the point I was trying to make in para 17 of the Rochdale case although, unsurprisingly, Munby J puts it very much better than I did (or could). The state is obliged to secure the human dignity of the disabled by recognising that "their situation is significantly different from that of the able-bodied". Thus measures should be taken "to ameliorate and compensate for [those] disabilities."</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">But to characterise those measures as state detention is to my mind unreal. I referred to the historical context in which Article 5 of the ECHR 1950 came to be formulated. It followed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 10 December 1948 which in its preamble referred to "the disregard and contempt for human rights [which] have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind"; which in article 3 guaranteed liberty; and which in article 9 proscribed "arbitrary arrest, detention or exile." It was aimed at the midnight knock on the door; the sudden disappearance; the prolonged detention. Article 5 was not aimed at Katherine, seriously physically and mentally disabled, who is  living in her own home and cared for round the clock by carers paid for by an organ of the state. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case TB will not be cared for at a place which she understands to be her home. Further, she has the motor functions to achieve a departure in a meaningful sense. She will be monitored round the clock and were she to leave to try to go "home" she would be brought back. Her situation is therefore very different to Katherine's, and the acid test is met. Although I personally cannot see that her situation amounts to state detention in any sense other than by reference to the term of art devised by the majority in the Supreme Court, I must loyally follow that decision. I therefore declare that TB's care regime does involve detention under Article 5. Accordingly there must be at least six-monthly reviews by this Court, no doubt at some considerable expense to the public purse. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At para 1 of my decision in <span class="Emphasis">Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council v KW</span> I referred to the very serious resource implications to local authorities and the state generally if periodical court reviews are required in such cases. Notwithstanding the arrival of the streamlined procedure recently promulgated by the Court of Protection Practice Direction 10AA there will still be tens if not hundreds of thousands of such cases and hundreds of thousands if not millions of documents to be processed. The streamlined procedure itself requires the deployment of much man and womanpower in order to identify, monitor and process the cases. Plainly all this will cost huge sums, sums which I would respectfully suggest are better spent on the front line rather than on lawyers. </p>
