The statement is clearly drafted by a solicitor: H and W both speak English but they are not fluent and it is not possible in my view that H could have written any part of it himself (as W at one point sought to suggest). Most importantly, the witness statement is entirely consistent with the judgment of the immigration Judge in the First-tier Tribunal, which summarises the oral and written evidence which W gave in those proceedings. I am satisfied that although the copy I have is unsigned, this document was prepared by W&#8217;s then solicitors on her instructions and used in those proceedings. </p>

There is no credible evidence to support that account. Following the marriage H had remained in Pakistan for three years while waiting for his visa to be granted. W spent the majority of this period in the UK and so the parties were not physically in the same place, although they of course communicated. The bundle includes a considerable amount of evidence which sheds light on the relationship between the parties, including emails and messages passing between them. I am satisfied that certainly in 2010 W was not in fear of H, and that he was not behaving in a controlling manner towards her. </p>

However W was adamant that this child was born in 2009: she said she had discovered this at the time through family members and H had told her this was not his child but the child of another man with whom his first wife had had a relationship. On this one narrow issue I find that W was telling the truth. If she had been seeking to mislead, it would have been much easier to adopt the 2010 date on the official records. However W supported H&#8217;s case that for whatever reason it is common in Pakistan to record a child&#8217;s date of birth as later, and therefore to show the child as younger, than is actually the case.

Like H&#8217;s own divorce decree, this document was produced within the immigration proceedings and relied on by the First-tier Tribunal. I note in passing that the wording of both divorce decrees is almost identical, down to the paragraphs summarising each defendant&#8217;s absence from the proceedings and the attempts at service. I also note that the grounds of divorce in both documents refer to &#8216;incurable hatred&#8217;, although this is not a term I can find anywhere in the Divorce Act 1869. Although I am anxious not to place too much weight on these observations, they perhaps support the suggestion that, as W says, H caused both to be created at the same time, as forged documents in support of his visa application. </p>

W&#8217;s oral evidence about the production of this document was unconvincing. She had no plausible explanation for the fact that the affidavit contained no detail about DE&#8217;s current whereabouts or how he might be contacted, and although at the outset of the trial she said that he would be available to give oral evidence she subsequently told me during the course of her evidence that she had just received news that he had died. In the circumstances, I can give no weight to this document. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in">I must have regard to the inherent probabilities. W had a clear and obvious motivation to lie in the immigration proceedings, because she wanted to secure H&#8217;s entry into the UK as her husband. She has had, in my view, less of a motivation to lie about this particular issue in these proceedings: her primary case is not that the marriage is void (and, as I recorded at the case management hearing, she has deliberately chosen not to issue a nullity petition) but that no marriage exists at all because the ceremony was a sham. Even if she loses on that point, it is open to her to rely on H&#8217;s previous marriage in support of a finding that the marriage was void. The allegation that her own first marriage was also subsisting in May 2008 would, if untrue, have been an unnecessary embellishment. </p>

It has not been possible in the time allocated to this hearing to hear extensive oral evidence on these issues. What is very clear from the evidence is that by the date of the petition, if not well before, both parties were clear that their marriage was an end and neither wished to continue to live with the other. The marriage had by then broken down irretrievably. Neither party at this hearing has suggested otherwise.</p>

She was (and remains) very angry at him because of his behaviour in, as she saw it, resuming his relationship with his first wife. </p>
