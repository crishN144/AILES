P is currently in a foster care placement and has regular supervised contact with both her parents. P&#8217;s proceedings started  very shortly after she was born and therefore, P and her family have been waiting her whole life for decisions to be made about her future. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">P&#8217;s mother is in her thirties. She had a very traumatic and abusive  childhood which has impacted on her mental health and functioning and she has been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, with elements of PTSD. She is currently being assessed for ADHD. P is her third child. Her older children, I will refer to as L and M, are aged 10 and 6. They are living with L&#8217;s father following care proceedings that concluded in February 2023. The mother has supervised contact with L and M. Within those proceedings the local authority concluded that the mother was not able to meet L and M&#8217;s needs and they would not be safe in her care. Whilst the mother did not accept this conclusion, she did not challenge the plan for L and M not to return to her care, accepting that they were settled with L&#8217;s father. By the end of those proceedings the mother was pregnant with P and, no doubt, focused on her wish to be able to care for her new baby. Just a few weeks before the final hearing for L and M there was a violent incident between P&#8217;s parents involving the police which, the mother reported to L and M&#8217;s Guardian, left her </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">struggling to cope</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">. The mother asserts she is now stable and drug free and she wishes to resume care of P immediately. The mother attended days 1 to 3 of this final hearing in person and was provided with special measures by way of a secure entrance and waiting area and screening in court, to ensure she did not come into contact with the father. This was in light of the past volatility in their relationship and cross allegations of abuse and harassment. The mother did not attend the final day in person, stating she was unwell; however she did attend by way of video link and there was no application to delay the proceedings for her attendance in person. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">P&#8217;s father is in his late twenties; P is his first child. His paternity was confirmed by DNA testing within the proceedings. Prior to his relationship with the mother, he had no involvement with child protection agencies; however, he was involved in assessments concerning L and M given his relationship with the mother.  In 2020 he experienced psychosis  as  a result of illicit drug use and was detained under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.2</ref>  of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>.   He   did not engage with the intervention plan following his release and was discharged from mental health services. In March 2024 he  was  again detained in hospital following a deterioration in his mental health and presenting with delusions; he remained in hospital for two weeks and  was discharged upon improvement, having taken his prescribed medication.  There was  a further deterioration in his  mental health in May 2024 which resulted in the originally listed final hearing  having to be adjourned to  enable a capacity assessment to be undertaken.  The father  wishes to be further assessed to care for P. He  has made an application for a residential assessment  at Jamma Umoja which would take 12 weeks to complete. As an alternative he has proposed that he move into P&#8217;s current foster placement in order that there can be an assessment of his capacity to care for P. He has not presented a positive case that P should move to his care now. The father was supported by his sister throughout the final hearing. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">The  local authority  have concluded that P  would not be safe in the care of either of her parents, for reasons I will expand on later in this judgment. Given P&#8217;s young age the local authority therefore ask the court to approve a plan of adoption  for P in order that she can be placed with adopters  who, in due course, can become her legal family and  care for her throughout her life.   P&#8217;s Guardian has reached the same conclusion and supports the plan of adoption. </span></p>

Within assessments relating to L and M  the mother reported that this relationship was positive and there was no domestic abuse. Both parents were clear that they wanted to co-parent P together, once born, and were committed to stopping their use of illicit drugs and alcohol, which were a feature of their relationship. However, in February 2023  there was an incident which resulted in the police attending  the  father&#8217;s home address. The mother was located in  an intoxicated and highly distressed state; at the time she was 15 weeks pregnant with P and had been drinking excessively and using cannabis. The parents have made cross allegations that the other was violent and aggressive that night; both accept that there was a physical altercation between them and the mother ended up hurt and on the floor and she was taken to hospital. </span></p>

In May 2023 the police attended her home in response to an allegation that she was harassing the father. The police describe the home as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">filthy with clear signs of cannabis and alcohol being consumed. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">The mother told the police she was using cannabis, despite being pregnant with P. During a meeting with social workers in June 2023 she reported having stopped using cannabis in March 2023. However,  when a sample of her hair was taken for drug testing a few weeks later she reported using cannabis daily. She also reported not having used cocaine since November 2022. The analysis of her hair sample was positive for the active use of cannabis between March and April 2023 and the possibility of later ongoing use could not be excluded or confirmed. Testing was not carried out for cocaine use at that stage. </span></p>

The test results were supportive of a conclusion that there had been active cocaine use between April and June 2023. The testing company acknowledged that the positive results may be supportive of a reduction in use and a recent cessation. </span></p>

The local authority acknowledged that this plan was high risk, give the mother&#8217;s previous parenting of L and M. However, the local authority did not consider it was proportionate to seek to separate P from her mother and acknowledged the progress that the mother had made in the period leading up to P&#8217;s birth, in particular she had maintained some improvement in the home conditions, engaged with professional support services and was reporting full abstinence from illicit drugs and alcohol. </span></p>

The Guardian was not supportive of the initial care plan, given the risk that P would not be safe in her mother&#8217;s care in the community. The Guardian had visited the mother at home a few days before and was concerned that the home conditions had deteriorated and that the mother has been </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">emotional, upset and shouted </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">following a recent incident involving the father speaking to her friend on the phone. Having heard submissions, the judge was in agreement with the Guardian&#8217;s analysis and urged the local authority to identify a parent and child foster placement where the mother&#8217;s care of P could be supervised and supported. </span></p>

They remained in this placement until 13 November when they moved back into the community. During the mother&#8217;s time in placement she was loving and caring towards P and able to meet her needs for feeding, bathing, stimulation and warmth. There were however concerns about the mother&#8217;s ability to ensure a routine and to organise her life in a way that was compatible with parenting a young baby. The mother was encouraged to return to her home each day and to work with professionals to remove the clutter and improve the home conditions. The mother was repeatedly late returning to the foster care placement, reporting difficulties with public transport and time management. </span></p>

This assessment concluded that the mother had shown commitment to P and working with professionals to make changes to enable her to care appropriately for P. The report recommended that the mother and P return to live at the mother&#8217;s home address and further assessment take place of the parents&#8217; individual abilities to care safely for P. The report again acknowledged that this plan had </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">very significant potential risks, </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">in particular: conflict between the parents, potential for ongoing and concealed drug use and lack of progress addressing the clutter in the mother&#8217;s home address. </span></p>

Central to these agreements were the following points: P&#8217;s needs to remain the focus of both parents, no use of drugs or alcohol, full engagement with professionals, including substance misuse services, no contact between the parents, including no messaging, and P&#8217;s contact with her father to be arranged and supervised by the local authority contact team, progress to be made on clearing the home. The mother signed up to these expectations, which also included a commitment to being honest at all times. In December the agreement was updated to allow for the father to have contact with P supported by his family members and for there to be limited contact between the parents, solely in relation to the arrangements for P. </span></p>

Within a week of the mother and P returning to the community, the father stayed overnight with the mother and P, at the mother&#8217;s home, The parents accept they resumed a sexual relationship over this period and the father was spending time with P. There is a dispute between the parents as to how frequently this contact took place, however it was concealed by both parents until January 2024.</span></p>

During the period from November 2023 to January 2024, when the mother was caring for P at home, she repeatedly did not attend sessions at POCAR (16-week substance support course) stating she was unwell or missing appointments due to running late. Between December 2023 and June 2024 her attendance was only 50%. </span></p>

The mother challenged the accuracy of those results, maintaining that she ceased cocaine use in November 2022 and had only consumed minimal amounts of alcohol. Further questions were asked of the testing company who were clear in their response that the hair strand test results were not consistent with the mother&#8217;s assertions. I will return to these test results later in my judgment. </span></p>

The report states that the father&#8217;s mental state had deteriorated over the last 4 months, resulting in him repeatedly presenting at A&amp;E in early March with the support of his sister. The report sets out that the father has a diagnosis of Bipolar Affective Disorder and was suffering from a manic episode with psychotic features (reporting he was a prophet, the son of God, could control the weather and could take people&#8217;s breath away), lacked insight into his illness and was refusing medication (other than medication to assist with sleep). </span></p>

As a result of his ill health the father was not able to attend contact with P for 5 weeks and this was upsetting for him as contact is a positive experience for both P and her father. Contact resumed in April 2024 and went well for P; however the father expressed some further delusional beliefs during contact time, stating he had  missed contact as he was engaged with military training. During a  contact session in early May, which was observed by P&#8217;s Guardian, the father switched from being engaged and focused on P, to expressing delusional beliefs relating to working for the secret service, being the King and having magic powers. </span></p>

The father met with Dr Iyer, consultant psychiatrist, in person. Dr Iyer concluded that the father continued to have capacity to instruct his legal representatives and did understand the nature of these proceedings and the potential options for P. When asked about his behaviour in contact the father told Dr Iyer that he did not recall this. The report also set out that the father does not agree to take medication, however he was willing to engage with psychological therapy. Dr Iyer advised that the father is no longer psychotic, however he does present with low grade paranoia and suspiciousness and there is a high chance of relapse were he to return to illicit drug use in the future. </span></p>

The purpose of this assessment was to explore the harm suffered by L and M and identify the support the mother would need to enable her to care for P. Twelve parenting sessions were undertaken with the mother before P was born to try and address the local authority concerns. The assessment concluded that the mother expressed commitment to parent P, however she struggled to accept responsibility for the significant neglect of L and M. The father was not assessed before P was born, as he was querying paternity and wanted a DNA test before he committed to the baby. The assessment report noted ongoing conflict between the parents and a high level of abusive texts and phone messages between them, despite both reporting a separation. </span></p>

That included visits to her in placement, at home and sessions in the community. Mr Heritage was concerned that throughout his sessions the mother was distracted by issues relating to the father and ongoing conflict with him; he explained that there would be a succession of crises   between the parents and ongoing cross allegations of harassment, which dominated his work with both parents. In his words he was constantly trying to </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">put out the fires </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">rather than focusing on P and the changes the parents needed to make to provide her with appropriate care. </span></p>

This was despite the mother being offered professional support to address the issue and having support from L&#8217;s father and purporting to have support from her brother.  Mr Heritage was also concerned that the mother was evicted from her home in January 2024 and had been served with an eviction notice, but failed to inform the social work team about this until the last minute. This prevented  the local authority from planning to support the mother  in housing P and Mr Heritage considered this was a continuation of the pattern of the mother living in chaos and not being open with professionals about her needs for support. </span></p>

He rightly acknowledged the love they have for P and their ability to show P affection and ensure her contact time is positive. Fundamentally however, he was clear that P would not be safe in the care of either parent. I am satisfied he worked exceptionally hard to facilitate change in their capacity to safely parent P and to reduce the conflict in the parental relationship. However, the work he was doing with the parents was wholly undermined by their dishonesty in relation to resuming contact with each other in November 2023. I was struck by Mr Heritage&#8217;s evidence as to the father&#8217;s duplicity  in  complaining  angrily about not being allowed to care for P overnight, at the same time he was secretly staying with P and the mother  in breach of the written agreement. </span></p>

It was on 10 January during a planned visit that the father told Mr Heritage about these injuries and showed him photographs that he had been taking since 18 December. I accept Mr Heritage&#8217;s evidence that, such was his level of concern, that had he seen the injuries in person at the time he would have arranged a Child Protection medical for P the same day. He tried to explore with the father the reasons why he did not take P for medical attention, or report his concerns to any professional; the father&#8217;s response was that he did not trust the social worker as she was </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">a</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"/><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">liar</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.

The social work team tried to mediate between the parents and encourage them to focus on P and not the issues they had with each other. I accept that the written agreements were clear and am satisfied that the parents both knew that they were not to have contact with each other, other than for planned handovers for contact time from December onwards. I agree with Mr Heritage that the significant dishonesty of the parents, in spending time together (including overnights) in breach of the safety plan, undermined the work he was doing with them and highlighted their lack of insight into the risks the volatility in their relationship presents to P. </span></p>

He was clear that the father has the ability to provide basic care to P and has positive support from his family. A residential assessment will not address the fundamental issues of his mental health and his dishonesty  with professionals.  Mr Heritage acknowledged that the father&#8217;s mental health crises do not, in and off themselves, rule him out as a carer for P, however he was concerned that the father was not engaging with his treatment plan and lacked insight into the impact this may have on his parenting of P.</span></p>

However, there was a home visit in early January 2024 which noted that the mother&#8217;s home smelt of cannabis. Ms Gander also noted a possible link between the mother&#8217;s chaos in placement, in terms of poor time keeping, lack of planning and constant need to borrow money from the carer, to her ongoing purchase and use of cocaine as suggested by the repeat drug test results. </span></p>

Ms Gander explained that P had many changes in her life between birth and November and, whilst the social work team were open to progressing to P staying overnight with her father, they felt this needed to be taken slowly. Whilst acknowledging the father&#8217;s frustration Ms Gander was clear that his decision to visit the mother&#8217;s home and stay overnight with P and the mother was not justified. Ms Gander was concerned that neither parent thought about the risk this presented, either to themselves or to P. Ms Gander confirmed that the mother only told her about the breach of the written agreement in response to the father making allegations about injuries to P. When the father spoke to Ms Gander concerning these injuries, he stated he was </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">collecting evidence </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">against the mother. These concerns were shared with the mother and the next day the mother told Ms Gander the father had stayed at her address on two consecutive nights and showed her a photo of the father asleep in her bed with P. </span></p>

She stated he came for the day and then stayed for the weekend. She stated the weekend ended badly as he told her he was having unprotected sex with other women. The mother showed no insight into the risks to herself or P from having the father in her home for a weekend; this is despite claiming he attacked her in February 2023, when she was pregnant, and that he had harassed her and made false allegations since their separation. The mother denied the father&#8217;s assertion that he had stayed over at her home on many other occasions during the time she and P were in the community. She did accept that she again breached the written agreement by asking the father to care for P in December when she had a meeting with her drug support worker, as she did not want to use the creche facility. </span></p>

He explained that he and the mother discussed it and had an agreement to </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">keep quiet; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">although he knew this was </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">not a good idea</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">, he </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">went along with it</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">. He claimed to have been to the mother&#8217;s home on seven separate occasions to see P, including the weekend where he stayed over. He stated that the parents had sex on some of those visits, both over the weekend and on other visits. </span></p>

The Guardian was, in my judgment, rightly concerned that the father&#8217;s unwillingness to share this information was indicative of his inability to work openly with professionals. </span></p>

Having listened to the evidence, the Guardian&#8217;s recommendation remained that P would not be safe in the care of her parents and the plan of adoption was in her best interests. The Guardian stressed that P urgently needs a decision as to her future placement and she did not support any delay for further assessment of the father. The Guardian highlighted that P is receiving physio as she is developmentally delayed in her gross motor skills. The Guardian also provided information from P&#8217;s foster carer that, in her opinion, P had regressed in her period she was in the mother&#8217;s care in the community and the carer was concerned that P had not been properly stimulated in the mother&#8217;s care. </span></p>

Despite the planning put in to secure a place for the mother, she was not able to take up this opportunity as she did not pack up her belongings in time.

An example of this is the incident in February 2023, when the police attended the father&#8217;s home address. Both parents allege the other was aggressive and abusive; the father was arrested and issued with a Domestic Violence Prevention Notice; however the mother was not willing to support a criminal prosecution. Both parents accept their relationship was unhealthy and volatile and presented a risk of harm to P. Both parents acknowledge that they breached the written agreement, contacted each other, met up and stayed overnight with each other, despite their previous allegations of abuse and harassment. It is these factors that present a  risk of future harm to P, rather than which of the parents is at fault for the events that took place in February 2023. </span></p>

I acknowledge that there were likely to be ongoing and intense feelings and emotions, both as ex partners and as P&#8217;s parents. However, throughout the period from P&#8217;s birth to December 2023 both parents were working with the assessing social worker and were expressing certainty that their relationship was over and repeatedly complaining about the other&#8217;s actions. I have no doubt that both parents understood the terms of the written agreements and the implications for breaching those and the very serious repercussions in terms of their working relationship with the social work team and their wish to care for their daughter. </span></p>

They had made repeated allegations against each other since their separation, including the father alleging that the mother continued to use cocaine whilst pregnant with P and made threats to his life. The mother was aware that domestic abuse was a significant concern for the social work team, as she had been referred for domestic abuse support in proceedings for L and M, and again following her separation from the father. Having listened carefully to their evidence it is apparent that neither parent considered the likelihood of them arguing, or the possibility of a further physical altercation, thereby exposing P to the harmful atmosphere of domestic abuse. </span></p>

The hair strand test results from two different companies are consistent with each other in terms of their general findings, which do not support the mother&#8217;s assertion that she has not used cocaine since November 2022. I note there are very limited professional reports of her using drugs or being under the influence after P&#8217;s birth, however the mother had ample opportunity to both purchase and use drugs, as she had many hours each day in the community when she was in the foster care placement.

I also note that in May 2023 the police attended her home and described it as being filthy, full of clutter, with evidence of drugs and alcohol being used.  When the social worker was able to gain access to the property  in late July it remained  cluttered, although the description suggests it had improved since May.  Whilst I accept the mother may have had some valid reasons for missing some of the home visits, in my judgment it is likely that she avoided visits and concocted reasons as she was trying to hide the neglectful state of her home, which had been an ongoing issue for many years. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">The matter first came before me on 26 February  2024; it was listed for an Issues Resolution Hearing (IRH). The 26-week time statutory limit to conclude public law cases had already passed. I was informed that the case would not be ready for final hearing until May, as the local authority needed to present the case to their Agency Decision Maker to consider the plan of adoption and the parents needed time to respond thereto. At the time I was concerned about the delay for P and the lack of parallel planning which would have avoided some of the significant delay to the timetable.  The father repeated his request to be assessed to care for P in a residential placement, however no formal application had been made and there was no information as to availability. I therefore  placed a time limit of 2 weeks on the father making such an application and gave him permission to disclose the case papers to suitable placements. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Shortly thereafter the father was admitted to hospital, following the deterioration in his mental health,  and therefore no such application was made. At the adjourned IRH on 26 April I extended the time for the father to make any such application to 13 May, but directed that full information relating to the father&#8217;s recent episode of psychosis be provided to any proposed residential placements.   After this hearing there was a concern that the father had lost capacity and his solicitors were not able to obtain instructions to progress this application. As such, no application was made for a residential assessment of the father until 12 July, 5 months after the original direction was made. I listed the matter for determination at the final hearing. </span></p>

The cost of the assessment would be in excess of &#163;40,000.

There is no information provided by Jamma Umoja as to whether they have undertaken a risk assessment in relation to the father&#8217;s mental health or the support they would have in place to manage any periods of psychosis or symptoms of his bipolar disorder. </span></p>

I also have sufficient evidence about the father&#8217;s ability to provide for P&#8217;s basic care needs, his love for P and wish to care for her. There are some cases where a residential assessment is necessary to inform the court about the relationship between the parent and child or about the parents&#8217; ability to respond appropriately to the child&#8217;s physical and/or emotional needs. None of this information is disputed in respect of P and her father.</span></p>

The decision making for P was rightly delayed from May to July to ensure that the father could properly engage in the proceedings, instruct his legal team and challenge the care plan of adoption. </span></p>

Like many adopted children she is likely to question why she could not be brought up by her family and this will need to be carefully explained to her through life story work. To permanently remove a child from her birth family is a very significant matter for that child and will result in the loss of their parents and wider family members. Should P move to an adoptive placement this is likely to be unsettling for her, as she has built an attachment to her foster carer and is showing separation anxiety when her carer is out of sight. Any future adoptive carers will be supported to manage the transition. Were P to move to the care of either of her parents, they are familiar to her through contact and this is likely to be an easier transition. P has contact with L and M and they enjoy spending time together. All 3 children could maintain sibling relationships were P to be cared for by her mother. The relationship between the father and L and M&#8217;s carer is hostile and sibling contact is likely to be a difficult and emotive subject for both fathers. L&#8217;s father has expressed his willingness to meet any adopters for P and support post adoption sibling contact if this was proposed in the future. </span></p>

Given P&#8217;s parents have both suffered with long term addiction and mental health issues, there is a risk that P may also face challenges with her mental health in the future. It is likely that P will need some emotional or therapeutic support in the future, particularly in light of the disrupted start to her life. P has a complex and rich heritage, as her maternal family are from Africa and her paternal family have Native American roots.

The parents need to meaningfully engage with skilled professionals to address these issues before they could safely care for a child.

In the proceedings for L and M the mother breached a safety plan designed to ensure her children were not exposed to the risk of violence from M&#8217;s father. Just a week after she returned home with P, in November 2023, she breached the safety plan designed to protect P from conflict in her parents&#8217; relationship and was dishonest about this to the social work team and minimised the breaches in her evidence to the court.

She has not yet reached a stage in her work to address her addiction problems where she is able to be truly open with support services; this honesty is needed to overcome her past traumas and bring about the changes needed to enable her to safely parent her children. I understand the offer of a place in rehab may still be available in the future, and I very much hope this is something she will be able to take up. For now, P needs a carer who can provide her with a high level of care and attention to help her feel settle and secure. She needs a carer who is committed to attending all necessary appointments, such as physio. Unfortunately, the mother&#8217;s life remains chaotic and, in my judgment, were P to return to her care she would likely be neglected in the same way as L and M. I accept that the mother would not intend this, however her long standing addiction issues, the instability caused by conflict in her relationships and her inability to work openly with professionals make this outcome almost inevitable. </span></p>

However, I do not agree with the assertion in his final statement that he has not been given a chance to care for his daughter.  I accept that the father has made significant changes to his life, in terms of ceasing his use of illicit drugs. However, he was abstinent from cocaine for nearly a year from November 2022 until September 2023 and then relapsed when he was experiencing a period of stress relating to P and these proceedings. In my judgment he therefore remains vulnerable to future drug use at periods of stress. Whilst he states that his life will not be stressful if he is caring for P, I cannot accept this. Caring for a young child who has experienced a disrupted start to her life, and who will need to transition from her primary attachment figure, will be stressful and a very different parenting experience to the relaxed and fun time the father and P spend together in contact. Given the father&#8217;s previous dishonesty with professionals, I have no confidence he would report any feelings of stress in himself or distress in P, for fear it would result in P being removed from his care. I consider it likely that the father would seek to manage this situation himself and this would place him under further stress and likely impact on the care he would provide P.</span></p>

Having carefully considered all the evidence on this issue I am concerned as to the lack of insight the father has into his mental health difficulties and the potential impact this has on his parenting of P. A mental health diagnosis does not render a parent unable to safely parent their child, however it does present vulnerabilities and it is crucial that the parent has insight into their emotional wellbeing, their mental health diagnoses and prognosis and is receptive to professional advice and support. The father&#8217;s presentation, when he is unwell, presents a risk of harm to P; both in terms of emotional harm from the father&#8217;s delusional beliefs and also potential physical harm from any aggressive behaviour he displays. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-family:Garamond;color:#000000">The father has very significant mental health difficulties that have presented with periods of delusion and psychosis. When unwell the father is recorded to have acted in an aggressive and threatening manner, that he claims not to recall. He was clear in his oral evidence that he does not consider there is a risk of future relapses. This statement, combined with the facts that the father professed not to be aware of his own diagnosis of Bipolar, had not read the letter from his treating psychiatrist, Dr Iyer&#8217;s report or the mental health risk assessment, leaves me concurring with the conclusion of his treating mental health team that he </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond;color:#000000">lacks insight into his illness. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;color:#000000">The father has been clear that he is not willing to take prescribed medication to stabilise his mental health. Whilst a competent adult has the freedom to choose whether to take prescribed medication, a parent who wishes to be the primary carer for a vulnerable young child has the responsibility to be fully informed of their mental health diagnoses and work with support services to maintain stability. Unfortunately, the father has not demonstrated a willingness or commitment to take these steps. Whilst I accept the father&#8217;s evidence that he is on a waiting list for therapy through his GP, I have no evidence as to the timescales involved, how this will assist to manage his bipolar disorder or prevent the reoccurrence of psychotic episodes in the future. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-family:Garamond;color:#000000">The father&#8217;s conduct since P has been born evidences that he is not able to prioritise P and keep her safe. His decision making is skewed and is focused on his own needs, rather than those of his young daughter. His actions in breaching the written agreement and spending time with the mother and P, in the mother&#8217;s home, and his dishonesty about this serious matter, highlight that he was unable or unwilling to consider the potential consequences for P. Further, his failure to seek medical attention for P, or to inform any professional about possible injuries to her whilst in her mother&#8217;s care, demonstrates that his primary focus remains on his ongoing conflict with the mother, rather than ensuring P&#8217;s safety and wellbeing. I accept the father&#8217;s regret at these decisions is genuine, however  I have no confidence that he would act differently in the future. </span></p>

However, that support has been available throughout and has not prevented the deterioration in the father&#8217;s mental health or his assisted in his understanding and acceptance of his diagnoses. I also note that the father lied to his sister in relation to his whereabouts and actions when he was staying with the mother last autumn, and therefore I am not reassured that the father would be open with his sister in relation to the levels of support he would need in the future. </span></p>

Any future support under a Supervision Order or Child in Need plan would depend on the parents being able to be open and honest about their difficulties and accepting of support. </span></p>

Having considered all the advantages and disadvantages of adoption and a placement in her family I am clear that it is only an adoptive placement that will meet P&#8217;s needs. In short nothing but adoption will do. I am acutely conscious of the break this will cause in family relationships; however, I am clear that being in a secure permanent placement must take priority for P.

As she grows up it is important that she is aware of the love her parents have for her and their wish that she could remain within her birth family. I very much hope that the parents can meet her adopters, in due course, and maintain a relationship with P throughout her childhood. In my judgment, however, the sibling relationship between L and M and P must be given priority in future planning for P&#8217;s contact post adoption. </span></p>
