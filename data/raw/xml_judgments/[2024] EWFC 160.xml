Disclosure was ordered in relation to a trust of which the husband was trustee as well as a beneficiary. Income and capital from the trust had been routinely used to support the family&#8217;s lifestyle including a loan from the trust which had funded and was secured against the family home.</p>

The husband&#8217;s case was that the trust assets were not available for distribution. Parker J held that the husband had been guilty of &#8216;misrepresentation&#8217;, &#8216;obfuscation&#8217; and &#8216;distraction&#8217;<span style="font-style:italic">&#160;</span>and made an order for payment of &#163;3m to the wife<span style="font-style:italic">&#160;</span>on a needs&#8217; basis. She assessed the assets as amounting to at least &#163;9m, this included the husband&#8217;s interest in the trust assets which she held to be an available resource.</p>

I granted permission to appeal. In December 2018, in advance of the hearing of the appeal, the wife had applied to Level for a loan to enable her to clear her outstanding costs due to her former solicitors under a &#8216;Sears Tooth&#8217; agreement and which would also allow her to be represented in both the appeal and in the ongoing contested proceedings in relation to the children. In the usual way, prior to lending the wife the sums she needed, Level obtained a written opinion from the wife&#8217;s then Queen&#8217;s Counsel (&#8216;QC&#8217;) seeking advice as to the likely outcome of future financial remedy proceedings in the event that the appeal was allowed.</p>

Subsequently on 20 June 2019, Level advanced a further &#163;100,000 and, on 27 September 2019, an additional &#163;30,000 was advanced to enable the wife to make an application for a legal services provision order. Altogether this amounted to a total of &#163;630,000. By February 2021 the figure with interest was &#163;865,828. Interest has continued to accrue in the intervening two plus years at 19%.</p>

The husband agreed to provide &#163;45,000 to cover the costs of a private Financial Dispute Resolution Appointment (&#8216;the FDR&#8217;).

Under the terms of the agreement, the wife was to receive a life interest in a residential property to be purchased for a figure of &#163;1m by the husband&#8217;s trust which trust would thereafter own the property absolutely; the wife was to receive no free capital or income in settlement of her claim. Given that the wife had and has no capital of her own, it followed that a consequence of the agreement was that she would have no funds with which to repay any part of the Level loan. A draft consent order reflecting the agreement was signed by the husband and the wife.</p>

Level, on learning of the proposed settlement, wrote to the court on 15 February 2021 copying in the wife&#8217;s solicitors, the husband&#8217;s solicitors and Mr Todd KC, who has throughout represented the husband. In their communication to the court Level said that they urgently requested being joined to the proceedings prior to the approval of any order. They continued: &#8216;A formal application will follow, but in the meantime, we urgently request that no order is sealed in relation to this case and that we are heard in relation to any order which is presented&#8217;.</p>

Although Level had not specifically sought an&#160;<span style="font-style:italic">ex parte</span>&#160;hearing, Newton J dealt with the matter on paper the same day and granted the application.

The letter indicated that a stay of Newton J&#8217;s order would be sought pending an application to set aside the order joining Level to the proceedings. Unhappily, the husband&#8217;s solicitors did not notify the judge or his barrister&#8217;s clerk of these developments, nor did they inform the court that a draft order had been sent to the judge at his chambers to approve rather than by way of formal application through the court.</p>

In my view the defence significantly overstates the significance of the grant of permission to appeal which simply said: &#8216;the appeal has a real prospect of success for the reasons set out in the skeleton argument&#8217;. Contrary to para 15.4.1 of the defence, it is not correct to say that such permission is &#8216;very rarely given&#8217;. Permission to appeal is not given unless there is a real prospect of success and to grant it by reference to the skeleton argument is a convenient shorthand commonly used. Further it is absolutely not the case, as stated at para 18 of the defence, that the Court of Appeal had &#8216;already indicated that the appeal would succeed&#8217;.</p>

It cannot make a distributive order upon application by Level so as to require H to pay W such sum as Level is entitled to. </p>

Nor does H. Whatever their reasons for this, I cannot force them to apply for orders, whether by consent or otherwise. As the Court of Appeal pointed out at paras 61 and 62 of their judgment (supra), and as acknowledged by Level&#8217;s leading counsel, if W and H, for their own reasons, elect not to pursue financial remedy proceedings, there is precious little that Level can do about it. </p>

Should either W or H wish to make an application for financial remedies in the future, it must be issued afresh. If such an application is made, Level is to be automatically joined as Intervener, and the application must be served on them. The court will consider at the first available opportunity thereafter whether Level should remain as Interveners, and, if so, the scope of the intervention. For the avoidance of doubt, neither this order nor judgment are in any sense a substantive determination on the merits of the financial remedies application issued all those years ago by W.
