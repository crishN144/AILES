They arrived here from Slovakia with their mother, M in December 2015 for what she said was a holiday, in circumstances where she had made no reliable or practical arrangements for them to stay anywhere. She left her older child, C, age 7, in Slovakia in the care of her father, S. For the next four weeks their accommodation here was very unsatisfactory, including spending time staying overnight in a car. They came to the attention of the authorities when they presented at an A&amp;E department in late January 2016. Both the mother and the 4 year old had suffered significant injuries, which some four months later there is still no clarity as to how they were caused, and by whom. </span></p>

They have known each other since they were teenagers and have been in a volatile relationship for the last eight years. They have three children; C born in 2009, A born in 2010 and B born in 2012.  That relationship has been marked by frequent separation and alleged violence. The father has been largely based in this country and the mother has come here and then fled back to Slovakia, usually after alleged violence towards her at the hands of the father. The father has, on occasion, returned back to Slovakia and again there have been allegations of violence there too, when he has fled back to this jurisdiction.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">According to the information from the Slovak Central Authority court orders made by the Slovakian court in January 2011 determined the parental rights in relation to C were entrusted to his maternal grandfather, S. This is reported to be due to the neglect of C&#8217;s care by both parents. Then maternal grandfather was imprisoned in October 2011, his wife sought the care of C, which the mother did not agree to. In May 2012C&#8217;s care was entrusted to the Crisis Centre. In August 2012 both A and B joined C in the Crisis Centre, due to orders made by the court in Slovakia. The main reason for that decision was because the mother had escaped the household due to an alleged physical attack from the father, he had robbed her and made threats to the children. The mother lived with relatives and the father returned to the UK. By orders made in September 2012 C was placed back in the care of his mother, A and B returned to their mother&#8217;s care by court orders made in December 2012. Since that time the family have received support from the social services office and the family have been supported by the maternal grandfather. The current position is C is cared for by his maternal grandfather, whose wife has died. The grandfather currently lives with his partner, who is a widow too. She has two children and there is a child born in 2015 whose parents are the grandfather and his partner. C is at school. The Slovak Central Authority report that the mother received parental benefit in May 2015, and since July 2015 monthly payments have been made to her as specified in the report. The report continues </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;From the statement of grandfather it is clear he did not agree with the departure of mother to UK. After the previous experience he has reasonable concerns of minor children&#8217;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> The report continued that he would put himself forward to care for the two younger children and, if required, was willing to travel to the UK and be questioned by the UK authorities.</span></p>

In 2009 the mother alleged the father had physically abused her and threatened to kill her, two weeks later there is a report that the mother had returned to Slovakia. In 2010 there was a referral by a midwife about the mother due to concerns about allegations of domestic abuse against the father. Shortly afterwards the mother withdraws the allegations to the midwife. A month later the LA are contacted by a health visitor who reports the mother&#8217;s allegations about domestic abuse and control by the father and his family. Three days later the LA supported the mother returning back to Slovakia. In August 2011 there is a referral that the family are homeless and living in a car. A was very young and they request support to return back to Slovakia. In February 2012 the mother reports the father had returned to Slovakia and his violent behavior resulted in the police being involved, and he has since fled back to the UK.</span></p>

They had come on single flight tickets and had nowhere to stay. The mother has given varying accounts of why she came here; ranging from visiting for a two week holiday to possibly looking for work.
