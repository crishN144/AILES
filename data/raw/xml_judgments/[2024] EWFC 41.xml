That order included provision for indirect contact between N and Mr and Mrs P six times a year via Skype, with presents at Christmas, Easter and N&#8217;s birthday. In accordance with the order, Mr and Mrs J sent updates to Mr and Mrs P about N just prior to each period of indirect contact. According to Mr and Mrs J, as N got older it became increasingly difficult to get him to engage with the indirect contact, although there is no dispute he was always available for that contact. Mr P suggests in his statement that if there were any difficulties it was because Mr J was present during such contact.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A remote hearing was convened on short notice on 16 February 2024, to consider the issues raised in the Annex A report about Mr and Mrs P engaging in the proceedings and being unable to attend the hearing in person, due to Mr P&#8217;s health and their caring commitments. Mr P attended that hearing remotely and was able to fully engage with the proceedings. Arrangements had been put in place for legal representation, if Mr and Mrs P wanted it. The court is very grateful to Ms Gartland and her solicitor, Ms Shah, in being able to take this case on. Mrs P informed Ms Gartland&#8217;s solicitor that she did not wish to participate in the proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the start of this hearing Ms Gartland raised the issue of Mr P&#8217;s participation, including his ability to give evidence due to his health without special measures being in place under Part 3 Family Procedure Rules 2010 (&#8216;FPR 2010&#8217;), such as Mr P only being able to answer questions from the court. Following further discussion, Mr P was content for questions to be put by the advocates. He was able to give his evidence clearly and participate fully by joining the hearing remotely, as he had done when he was unrepresented at the earlier directions hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Gartland also raised the question of whether the Secretary of State for the Department of Health and Social Care should be given the opportunity to intervene due to the public policy issues in this case. She submitted that was because of the context of this adoption application, being made where there was a background of a disputed surrogacy arrangement. I refused that application. The statutory framework that governs adoption applications is clearly set out. No party was suggesting that the court could not, in principle, make an adoption order. The issues centred, as they so often do, on the particular facts of the case and whether the child&#8217;s lifelong welfare needs (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref>) are met by an adoption order being made.

The child arrangements order was time limited, has expired and when effective Mr and Mrs J exercised all aspects of parental responsibility. N is Mr J&#8217;s genetic child. The legal relationship that exists between Mr and Mrs P and N does not reflect N&#8217;s day to day life and the legal and practical consequences for N if an adoption order is not made are real and stark e.g. the impact on inheritance rights. Due to the care taken by Mr and Mrs J, N is fully aware of his origins and his own background.</p>

She submits N&#8217;s welfare does not require the consent to be dispensed with. N was born as a result of a surrogacy arrangement with him having two sets of parents who wished to bring him up. Mr P believes N&#8217;s welfare needs are met if his legal relationship with Mr and Mrs P is maintained and considers it could have been enhanced if there had been more contact between N and Mr and Mrs P. Ms Gartland relies on the observation made by Mr Egan in the Annex A report when he states <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;It is unfortunate that the law does not allow for Mr and Mrs J to be recognised as N&#8217;s legal parents without removing that privilege from his birth mother, and her husband.

To their credit, Ms Gartland submits, Mr and Mrs P have not sought to undermine N&#8217;s placement with Mr and Mrs J and do not suggest that N&#8217;s living arrangements going forward should be changed. Ms Gartland submits all four adults could be considered as N&#8217;s parents in accordance with the observations made by Baroness Hale in <span style="font-style:italic">Re G</span> [UKHL 43 at [33] where she set out the three ways a person can become a parents, namely a genetic parent, a gestational parent and a social/psychological parent.

Mr and Mrs J are his de facto, social and psychological parents but he now has no legal tie with them. Mrs P is his genetic and gestational mother who he has not seen for fourteen years. Mr and Mrs P are his legal parents who N has exercised his choice not to have a relationship with either of them.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">What is so striking about the facts of this case is the disconnect between N&#8217;s factual and legal position. In his compelling and articulate oral evidence, which the court accepts, N said that he had always considered himself a member of the J family, yet everything (such as his birth certificate) says the surname P. He described how a big part of his life is his identity and as he so accurately described <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;Things don&#8217;t add up for me at the minute&#8217;.</span> He said his relationship with Mr and Mrs J is important, he considers them his only parents and wants them to be his legal parents. As regards his relationship with his brother, A, he said, whilst recognising that Mr and Mrs J had always treated him and A equally, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;I want to be able to legally say I am his brother for the rest of my life&#8217;.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">N expressed his concern that despite having made his wishes and feelings clear to Mr and Mrs P they have ignored them and struggles to understand how they can say that they love him but then shut him down. He had sincerely hoped they would be supportive of what he wants.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the written and oral evidence it appears that Mr and Mrs P remain locked in what they consider are the injustices of the past. Although Mrs P did not take any active part in these proceedings, Mr P confirmed he had discussed what he set out in his statement with her. That replicates what happened in September 2023 when he sent a message setting out Mrs P&#8217;s views about opposing the adoption. What was so noticeable about Mr P&#8217;s statement and his oral evidence was the sole focus by him only on his and his wife&#8217;s position. At no stage was he able to consider the issues from N&#8217;s perspective or how it must feel for him, now age 18 years. That also reflected what he said about notice of these proceedings, he clearly had known of them since September 2023.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The difficult factual background to this case is a reality but it should not distract the court when considering this application under the relevant statutory framework in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref>, where the court is required to consider the lifelong welfare needs of the child in considering this adoption application. It is within that context that the consent of Mr and Mrs P and the relevance of any other public policy considerations are to be evaluated.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The context in which that is being considered is relevant. In particular, the strong family ties that exist between Mr and Mrs J and N. N has lived with them for the last sixteen years, he regards them as his parents and A as his brother. They are his family in every sense of the word. N is very clear he wants those important relationships to be secured in a legal and lifelong way, which an adoption order would do. Mr and Mrs P remain his legal parents but have had only limited indirect contact with N, which ceased in 2021, with only intermittent indirect contact since then. The evidence demonstrates that they are unable to properly consider N&#8217;s welfare needs, remaining focussed only on their own needs with, sadly, absolutely no insight into the impact of that position on N.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">N is now 18 years of age, an adult. He was described by Mr Egan as an intelligent and articulate young man. I agree with that description. In his oral evidence he displayed a maturity about these difficult issues that was beyond his years. He was able to explain why this order is so important to his identity and how deeply upsetting it would be for him if the order was not granted. The reality in this case is the loss of his legal relationship with Mr and Mrs P and their wider family is a relatively low interference in their family life due to the history, their limited involvement with N and the situation on the ground is unlikely to change. Due to the care taken by Mr and Mrs J N is clear about the position of Mr and Mrs P in relation to his background.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the other side it would, in my judgment, be a significant interference in N and Mr and Mrs J family life if this order was not granted. It would mean the disconnect between the factual and legal position would remain, it would adversely impact on the lifelong stability and security of N due to the continued uncertainty regarding the important and lifelong relationships in his life and it would be against his express and carefully considered wishes. Whilst such wishes are not determinative on their own, in this case the court does and is entitled to attach significant weight to them due to N&#8217;s age, maturity and the rational and measured way he expresses them.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">An adoption order would secure his lifelong legal relationship with the key people in his life, Mr and Mrs J and A.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The lodestar that governs this decision remains the lifelong welfare needs of N. In my judgment, the evidence overwhelmingly establishes that N&#8217;s welfare needs require an adoption order to be made, and, in those circumstances, Mr and Mrs P&#8217;s consent should be dispensed with.</p>
