	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Prior to the case management hearing a psychological assessment of the mother was carried out by Dr. North who found that her IQ was 61, placing her in the mild learning disability range. Dr. North identified that the mother had a number of problems with cognitive functioning. She found it difficult to express herself further, or provide instructions to other people, or understand verbally presented material, non-verbal reasoning, and verbal memory and thinking quickly.  She was able to understand verbally presented material provided it was present in a simple format. Dr. North recommended a number of measures be taken to help the mother cope with these difficulties including the provision of a Latvian interpreter at all times and furthermore a consistent interpreter because the mother finds it difficult to cope with uncertainty. Dr. North recommended that information be presented to the mother as simply as possible in a concrete, calm and non-stressful environment.  A stressful environment would have an adverse effect on mother&#8217;s cognitive abilities. Dr. North further recommended regular breaks in all interactions with the mother. Because of the mother&#8217;s history of mental health difficulties Dr. North was concerned that were her mental health to deteriorate that would inevitably have an adverse effect on her cognitive ability and her capacity.</p>

He therefore concluded that she had the capacity to instruct lawyers for the purpose of these proceedings. He warned that any deterioration in her mental health may result in her losing capacity.</p>

We hereby inform you that so far the Riga Orphans Court has not received any complaints about violations within IB&#8217;s family and has not passed any resolution about removing the risks of custody from IB&#8217;s parents. Based on the information received from the Embassy it can be included that I has been residing in the United Kingdom since 2007. Having regard to the above mentioned and according to Article 8(i) of [Brussels II Revised] the Riga Orphans Court finds that in order to guarantee the best possible protection of IB&#8217;s rights for the United Kingdom the matters concerning the custody of IB are within the jurisdiction of the authorities of the United Kingdom.&#8221;</p>

Since I and my relatives and friends, and the relatives and friends of my wife, the mother of I, all live in Latvia, and can help us in matters relating to the education of the child, I join the request of my wife and ask you to refer the custody case to Latvia for further review.  We have no relatives in the United Kingdom. I have a permanent place of residence and job in Latvia so I believe my daughter and I should be together.  There is a school and a medical facility not far away from my place of residence. I asked the school if they could enrol my daughter in the classes. I also contacted the medical facility and they assured me that my daughter would be registered with a family doctor as soon as she arrived and she would be provided with whatever medical services might be required.  I am very sorry there was a delay to appeal but I was notified about the matter by the Latvian authorities very belatedly. I hereby request the honourable Court to refer the custody case of my daughter, I, to the Latvian authorities for review.&#8221;</p>

He submits first that the Latvian Court would be better because the mother&#8217;s psychological difficulties coupled with her language difficulties will make it difficult for her to engage in these proceedings. The Latvian Court would therefore be a more appropriate Court in order to ensure that the mother is able to participate in the process. Furthermore, he submits that the Latvian Court will be better equipped to carry out such assessment of possible kinship placements as may be required in this case. He acknowledges that the evidence as to threshold is based in this country but submits that such evidence as is required to recall on threshold matters can be dealt with via interpreters within the Latvian Court process. Finally, in contrast to other cases he submits that judicial continuity is not yet a material factor in this case as Judge Black has hitherto only been involved in giving case management decisions and has not conducted any substantive hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Local Authority and the Guardian are, in my view, on much stronger ground when they contend, as they do, that this Court is plainly better placed to determine the question of threshold.  The family has been living here for seven years.  Thus I has been here for the vast majority of her life to date. The history of alleged neglect and emotional abuse on which the care proceedings are founded derives entirely from events said to have occurred in this country as does the evidence of the mother&#8217;s mental health problems. The witnesses of events in the years leading up to the start of proceedings, involving no doubt those matters concerning not merely recent events, but also matters relating to the earlier referrals of I to social services, are all in this country. It is true that the options for a family placement, if I cannot be returned to the care of her mother, and/or father, are based in Latvia.   Assessments of those options will undoubtedly have to be considered in these proceedings if the threshold criteria under section 31 are found to be satisfied. The English court is required to carry out a rigorous and holistic analysis of all the realistic options for I&#8217;s long term future, having regard to the principles emanating from the Supreme Court decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2013/33" uk:canonical="[2013] UKSC 33" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] UKSC 33</ref> and the Court of Appeal in the line of 2013 authorities culminating in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B-S </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/1146" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 1146" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 1146</ref>.</p>

Latvia is an EU country and a properly drafted application for information under Article 55 of the Brussels II Revised, or for evidence under the Evidence Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) 1206/2001), ought to equip the English court so that it has all the information about the Latvian options before making any final decision.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother has listed possible family members who could care for I in Latvia.  The Local Authority has approached two of those people, each of whom has been unable to help. The others so far have not been contacted because contact details are not available.  I do not consider it an insuperable problem to obtain those details.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Article 15 should not be interpreted as meaning that any case where the options of family placements are in another country should normally be transferred to that country. Article 15 is, as the Court of Appeal has reminded us, an exception to the general rule.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A further point of some importance is that this issue is being considered 14 weeks after the start of proceedings and only less than three weeks before the issues resolutions hearing.  An Article 15 request will inevitably cause considerable delay. That seems to me to be an important factor to be taken into account in this application.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have carefully considered Mr. Bartlett&#8217;s arguments that his client, by reason of her psychological and language difficulties, will be more likely to engage with a Court process in Latvia. It is possible that this will be the case but I am far from convinced that her participation in the proceedings in Latvia will be more effective. Furthermore, I consider that by adhering to the advice given by Dr. North it ought to be possible for this mother to participate in the English proceedings, although I can see there will doubtless be difficulties for those who represent her.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">To my mind the arguments advanced by Mr. Bartlett are plainly outweighed by all the other factors in this case.  In particular, I conclude that whichever Court conducts these proceedings will require some evidence from the other country which will of course have to be interpreted. It cannot be said that the Latvian Court is better placed to determine all the issues in the case having regard to the range of issues still at large.  Furthermore, although I is of course by background and heritage a Latvian child she has been living here for seven years. She is plainly settled here.  She speaks good English but little Latvian. In those circumstances I do not consider that it can be said to be in her best interests to transfer this case to Latvia.</p>

It is true that he does not there refer at all to Article 15 but, for my part, if he was of the view that an application under Article 15 should be made, I would have expected him to have said so in that letter.  </p>

That option is undoubtedly one which has to be considered in these proceedings and I am confident that Judge Black will consider it as part of her rigorous analysis of all the options in the event that she finds that the criteria under section 31 is satisfied.</p>
