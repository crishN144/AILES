	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Z was aged 46 years at the time of my decision. He married Y in August 2014, the couple having been in a relationship for about four years before their marriage. Y gave birth to their son in January 2016. The couple had always wanted a brother or sister for their son and tried for a further pregnancy as quickly as they could after his birth. Unfortunately, they were unable to conceive naturally and in September 2017 they decided to investigate assisted conception with the help of their GP. Initial medical tests on the couple were reassuring and so they were referred for a fertility clinic appointment. Prior to that appointment, Z provided a sperm sample for the purpose of sperm analysis.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Prior to attending for their fertility clinic appointment in May 2018, the couple completed a large number of forms, a small portion of which were appended to Y&#8217;s statement. Y recalled that the forms asked the couple which types of fertility treatment they wished to undertake, including collection of Y&#8217;s eggs and Z&#8217;s sperm, their storage and use in fertility treatment. It was clear from the contents of Y&#8217;s statement that the couple discussed the storage of their genetic material and the uses to which this material might be put, including the creation of embryos and the ethics of discarding the same. Additionally, the couple talked specifically about what would happen if one of them were to die. Y&#8217;s statement recorded that Z had talked about the storage of his sperm and what would happen if he died, her recollection being that this issue had been raised specifically in the clinic form which he had to complete. Y recalled asking Z specifically what they would do if he died whilst they were having fertility treatment on the evening that they completed the clinic consent forms. Z told Y that he was happy for her to do it - that is, have the treatment - if it was what she wanted. Y said to Z that she would want to go ahead with treatment because she wanted their son to have a brother or sister and she recalled Z being in complete agreement with her about this issue.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The couple attended for their fertility clinic appointment in May 2018 and it was recommended that they begin in vitro fertilisation [&#8220;IVF&#8221;], subject to one medical test on Y being clear. As the couple already had a child, they were not eligible for IVF treatment and thus opted to pay privately for this. During their clinic appointment they did not discuss the forms they had completed with their consultant. Y attended for her medical test later that month and the result was clear. The couple were due to see their consultant on 16 July 2018 in order to begin IVF treatment.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following their clinic appointment in May 2018, the couple discussed IVF treatment on a number of occasions. They were excited about being able to embark on this process as all the relevant medical tests were clear and there seemed to be a good prospect of success. They discussed how many embryos they wished to implant and debated how they felt about keeping unused embryos. They also discussed putting them into storage and deferring a decision but, because they could not afford too many rounds of private treatment, they decided that they would implant more embryos than one. They also had discussions about these issues with friends and family.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 5 July 2018 Z was travelling to work on his motorcycle when he was struck by a van. He sustained a catastrophic brain injury together with massive internal abdominal injuries. Imaging of Z&#8217;s brain revealed that the damage from the initial trauma and consequent lack of oxygen meant that he would never recover any function or awareness or indeed regain consciousness. Z would also be unable to breathe on his own. Given that bleak prognosis, Z&#8217;s clinical team recommended that, once all the medication had been flushed from Z&#8217;s body, they would undertake brainstem testing. If no brain activity was identified, Z would be pronounced dead and taken off life support for organ donation.</p>

It was extremely important to her that Z&#8217;s death would not have been in vain and she was extremely worried that any flaw in the paperwork they had completed for their fertility treatment might mean that she was unable to conceive a further child with her husband&#8217;s sperm. She told me in her statement that this &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">would leave an irreplaceable hole</span>&#8221; in her life, the life of her son and the lives of their family.</p>

In addition, the court was invited to declare that it would be lawful for a suitable qualified clinician to retrieve Z&#8217;s sperm and that it would be lawful for those sperm to be stored both before and after his death.

These did not include the forms completed by the couple prior to their clinic appointment or any consents by Z for the storage and use of his sperm.

I have also taken account of what Z would choose to do about this issue if he knew that he was catastrophically injured, was being kept alive by means of life-support and was on the point of that medical treatment being withdrawn resulting in his death. It seems to me that Z would have chosen to allow clinicians to retrieve his sperm so that it might be stored and then used after his death so that his little boy might be able to have a brother or sister. That choice was entirely consistent with the evidence before me and consistent with what I had learned about Z&#8217;s hopes and dreams for a family life with Y and children of their own. I was also satisfied that Z had contemplated what might happen if he died and that family life might not include him in person but might, however, include a child conceived by Y after his death using his sperm. Standing back and applying the law to the facts of this case, I am in no doubt that the decisions I have taken on Z&#8217;s behalf were in his best interests even though his death was imminent.</p>

In discussion with counsel, I queried why I was only being asked to approve authority for the consent of the storage of Z&#8217;s sperm and not also consent for the use of that material and any embryos formed from that material. Given my findings of fact, it seemed to me that Z would want his sperm not only to be stored but also to be used. Storage and then use were essential parts of a process which Z had embarked upon in the hope of providing his son with a brother or sister. Furthermore, if the consent to use was not executed before Z died, I was told by counsel that, given the strict provisions of sub-paragraph 1(2) of Schedule 3 of the HFE Act, there might be real obstacles to the use of Z&#8217;s stored sperm after death in the absence of a valid pre-death consent. Further legal proceedings might well be required. It seemed to me that the last thing Z would have wanted for Y was that the fertility treatment they both had embarked upon might be put at risk or delayed by the outcome of further legal proceedings.</p>

Mr Mylonas QC on behalf of Y agreed as did the hospital trust. The Official Solicitor had not considered this matter prior to it being raised by me and, having had no time to investigate this issue, adopted a neutral position on the authorisation of consent for the use of Z&#8217;s sperm.  Notwithstanding the position of the Official Solicitor, I was satisfied that I should exercise my powers to direct the execution of a consent for both the storage and the use of Z&#8217;s sperm.</p>

I also declared that the court was satisfied that the requirements of Schedule 3 to the HFE Act in relation to consent were met in those circumstances.
