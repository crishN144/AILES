	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this appeal, a 48 year old woman, hereafter referred to as &#8220;GW&#8221;, suffering from Huntington&#8217;s Disease (hereafter &#8220;HD&#8221;) appeals against a decision of His Honour Judge Marston sitting in the Court of Protection. The notice of appeal raised two principal issues: (1) whether the learned judge erred in law in concluding that GW lacks capacity to leave and return to her residence unescorted and to make decisions concerning her care and residence and (2) whether the learned judge erred in refusing permission to appeal against an earlier decision by a district judge to make an interim order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/48" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 48</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> which had the effect of depriving GW of her liberty. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This latter question potentially raised fundamental questions concerning the interpretation of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/48" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 48</ref> &#8211; namely whether the practice of the Court of Protection in continuing or instigating a deprivation of liberty under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/48" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 48</ref> is lawful under the statutory scheme set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> and the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (&#8220;DOLS&#8221;) in Schedule A1 to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> and/or is compliant with Article 5 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The fact that this point had been raised was a material consideration in my decision to grant permission to appeal against Judge Marston&#8217;s order. In their response to this appeal, the first respondent, the local authority for the area where GW lives, being the supervisory body for the purposes of the DOLS, and the second respondent, (&#8220;B Ltd&#8221;) the owners and managers of the residential home where GW is currently living, contended that this proposed appeal amounted in effect to a second appeal following the decision of the district judge. Under rule 182 of the Court of Protection Rules 2007, &#8220;a decision of a judge of the court which was itself made on appeal from a judge of the court may only be appealed further to the Court of Appeal&#8221;. At the outset of the hearing before me, Miss Weston on behalf of the appellant (who did not appear at first instance) conceded that this provision ruled out my consideration of the proposed further appeal. Accordingly, the only question for this court to determine is the appeal on the issue of capacity. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The background can be summarised as follows. In March 2010, GW, a married woman with two children, was diagnosed as suffering from HD. Very sadly, a number of members of her family had previously suffered from this condition and GW herself had been actively involved in charitable work concerning the disease. In July 2011, GW was referred to the community mental health team because of concerns about her lack of insight and irrational behaviour. In September of that year, her husband and children left the family home. On 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2011, GW was detained in a psychiatric hospital under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>. She was discharged in the following January but subsequently detained again under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. In February 2012, she was transferred to another unit in Bristol.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In November 2012, GW moved to a unit in a residential home specialising in caring for persons suffering from HD. On 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2013, GW was formally placed at the unit under a guardianship order under section 7 of the Mental Health Act. In May 2013, an urgent authorisation was granted to prevent GW leaving the property without supervision and support. The second respondent requested a standard authorisation from the first respondent, the local authority for the area. On 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May, a consultant psychiatrist, Dr J, concluded that GW lacked the capacity to decide about leaving the unit. On 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May, an application was made to the Court of Protection on behalf of GW under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/21" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.21</ref>A of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> seeking to challenge the urgent authorisation. On 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May, the urgent authorisation was extended to 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May, District Judge Jackson sitting in the Court of Protection declared, pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/48" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 48</ref>, that the court had reason to believe that GW lacked capacity to decide whether and when to leave the care home unescorted. She further ordered that it was lawful and in GW&#8217;s best interests <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span> to be escorted by an employee or agent of the second respondent whilst on any trips out of the unit. She further ordered that it was lawful and in GW&#8217;s interests, in the event that she sought to leave the unit without the consent of the manager, or sought to abscond from escorted supervision while outside the unit, to be returned back to the unit with the use of reasonable and proportional physical contact if necessary. On 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> July 2013, GW filed a notice of appeal against the order of 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May. The principal issue raised was the extent to which the Court of Protection can and should use its powers under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/48" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 48</ref> to authorise a deprivation of liberty. It was contended that these powers are contrary to the purpose of the statutory framework and incompatible with Article 5(4) of ECHR and further that the interim order made in this case was unlawful because there was no extant authority for a deprivation of liberty and no proper or adequate consideration of GW&#8217;s best interests. </p>

Trial counsel submitted that &#8220;the (presumably unintentional) impression given by the judgment overall is one of lack of consideration bordering on disregard for the Appellant as the subject of proceedings. The errors suggest that the judge did not approach his judgment with the care and thoughtfulness which the case warranted.&#8221;</p>

No one reading the judgment could doubt that he approached his task with due care and thoughtfulness. It is true that there are a number of typographical errors. That is true of many judgments &#8211; certainly it is true of mine. It must be remembered that a circuit judge has no personal assistant nor any secretarial support. The demands on circuit judges are increasing. The requirement to publish judgments as a result of the recent guidance given by the President has added to their burdens. It is the practice in the High Court to send out draft judgments for checking by counsel. Invariably, errors are picked up, although not by all counsel. Circuit judges do not always adopt this practice and it might be advisable for them to do so. Had Judge Marston adopted this practice in this case, the typographical errors would (presumably) have been picked up. In any event, the typographical errors here were not of a degree to call into question the reliability of Judge Marston&#8217;s judgment</p>

Both the diagnostic and the functional test must be met before a person can be held to lack capacity.

Even with prompting, she demonstrated a lack of insight as to the cognitive impact of her illness. She appeared to underestimate and minimise the physical impact of her disease.

A little later in the judgment, when dealing with the best interests decision, he cited a number of examples as to the difficulties that had occurred, citing in particular points drawn to his attention in SR&#8217;s accounts &#8211; stopping in the middle of the road to look at a cat; not responding to an oncoming cyclist; walking with her head down looking at the ground. He observed that generally in the evidence a picture emerged of someone putting themselves at risk. He concluded: </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">From my reading of the judge&#8217;s assessment, I conclude that, far from simply carrying out a review approach, the judge carried his own analysis of whether the functional test was satisfied. He explained how he had performed the same task as the experts and come to the same conclusion. In addition, he observed later in his judgment that GW had in her written and oral evidence tried to explain or minimize her problems. Although this is undoubtedly a brief reference, it demonstrates to my satisfaction that Judge Marston did indeed consider GW&#8217;s evidence on this issue. Miss Weston submitted that the judge&#8217;s reasoning in relation to capacity makes it unclear why he rejected the appellant&#8217;s evidence in preference of that given by Drs Moore and P.  I disagree. The judge&#8217;s reason for rejecting GW&#8217;s evidence was that in her written and oral evidence she tried to explain or minimize her problems. It could be argued that he should have put this earlier in the judgment, but I find that he did provide sufficient explanation of why he preferred the professionals&#8217; evidence. I reject the submission that Judge Marston &#8220;abdicated his decision&#8221;. Having referred to the opinions of the professionals, he then &#8220;performed the same task&#8221; and came to the same conclusion on the &#8220;overwhelming&#8221; weight of evidence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Weston relied on the transcript of GW&#8217;s evidence, in particular the lengthy re-examination when she was asked a series of questions relating to safety issues. It seems to me however that only limited weight could properly be attached to this evidence. As Dr. Moore observed, quizzing GW about road safety was not a valuable exercise, in contrast to the practical assessment carried out by the occupational therapist. It is not surprising that GW was able to recall some safety issues in oral evidence, or to describe the route she took into town. The question was whether in practice she had the ability to apply insight and understanding about road safety when she was out and about. Every time someone walks into town, it is a different experience, no matter how well they know the route. The question is whether GW has an appreciation of the risks that may arise every time she steps out of the front door. The preponderance of the evidence was that she does not.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Weston submitted that the judge wrongly conflated the diagnostic test with the functional test. She argued that this was a central issue because both Dr Moore and Dr P had relied on cognitive tests as conclusive evidence that GW lacked capacity. I do not accept this characterisation of the approach given by those two experts, or that the judge conflated the two elements. Both Dr. Moore and Dr P were aware of, and properly reliant on, the evidence of other professionals, in particular in Dr. Moore&#8217;s case the evidence of the occupational therapist. As quoted above, the judge recorded the evidence given by Dr. Moore and Dr P that the cognitive deficit was caused by the HD which amounted to an impairment or disturbance in the functioning of the mind or brain and which caused real risk to her when she was out because of the effect it had on her ability to process all the information required for her safety and the safety of others. On behalf of the second respondent, B Ltd, Mr Hallin submitted that this was an entirely proper application of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss 2</ref> and 3 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> to the decision in question. The &#8220;information relevant to the decision&#8221; for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 3</ref> included the fact that GW, as a result of her significant cognitive deficit, was exposed to a risk of harm if she left the unit unescorted. In other words, submitted Mr Hallin, this is a case where her lack of insight into the risk was itself caused by the disturbance in the functioning of the mind. He submitted that this finding was soundly based on evidence. I agree with Mr. Hallin&#8217;s submission. It is not correct to suggest that either Dr Moore or Dr P suggested that the cognitive impairment was itself conclusive of a lack of capacity. Although the two elements of a lack of capacity &#8211; the diagnostic element and the functional element &#8211; were interlinked, they were not conflated, either by the two experts or by the judge.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Weston submits that the judge failed to have regard to the statutory principles in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 1 (3)</ref> and (4) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. So far as <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 1(3)</ref> is concerned, I do not accept that Judge Marston did not have in mind the principle that a person is not to be treated as lacking capacity unless all practicable steps have been taken to help her exercise capacity without success. The evidence at the trial included many examples of how professionals have considered how GW could be assisted to make decisions about unescorted leave. There was plenty of  evidence about occasions when GW had been accompanied and assisted when walking in the town, including those alluded to above, in particular the trial assessment carried out by the occupational therapist. As mentioned above, Dr Moore referred to various steps that had been taken to help her in a letter to GW herself. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Furthermore, I do not accept that the judge failed to consider the principle in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1(4)</ref> that a person is not to be treated as lacking capacity simply because she makes an unwise decision. In the course of his judgment, he observed that GW had a reduced awareness of risk and how her difficulties with problem solving may place her in danger at times. To my mind, this illustrates that Judge Marston had the distinction identified in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(4)</ref> firmly in mind. There is a difference between someone who has an appreciation of risk and yet goes on to take the risk &#8211; albeit unwisely &#8211; and someone who, as Judge Marston found in this case, lacked awareness of the risk and sufficient problem-solving ability. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Weston submitted that the judge failed to consider and give appropriate weight to the risk of following the &#8220;protection imperative&#8221;. Again, I disagree. As set out above, Judge Marston expressly considered and rejected the submission that the assessments were somehow influenced by a &#8220;risk averse attitude&#8221; on the part of professionals working with GW. He also cited the well-known dictum of Munby J (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re MM</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2007/2003" uk:canonical="[2007] EWHC 2003 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] EWHC 2003 (Fam)</ref> &#8211; &#8220;what good is it making someone safe if it merely makes them miserable?&#8221; This famous dictum is the most succinct reminder of the importance of avoiding the protection imperative. But road safety involves not only one&#8217;s own safety but also the safety of others. The evidence suggests that GW would be a danger to other road users. Because of her cognitive deficiencies, she does not appreciate this risk. </p>

In my judgment, however, no criticism could properly be levelled at Judge Marston&#8217;s evaluation of her capacity to make decisions as to her care and residence. In this respect, as with his evaluation of her capacity to make decisions about leaving the property unescorted, his decision was both just and right. </p>
