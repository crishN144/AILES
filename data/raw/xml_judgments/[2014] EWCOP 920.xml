	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A, the young person with whom I am concerned, will be 16 years old in June of this year.  At the time I am hearing this application, brought by an NHS Foundation Trust, A weighs just 5 &#189; stones and has been in hospital for 10 months.  She has been confined to a bed now for several weeks.  Since she was transferred to the Y Children&#8217;s Hospital on the 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2013  A has undergone a battery of tests to identify the cause of the persistent vomiting which has led to her dramatic weight loss.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr B, the Consultant Paediatric Gastroenterologist, who has overall responsibility for A&#8217;s clinical care, has prepared a report for the court dated the 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2014.  Annexed to that report is an exhibit headed &#8216;Patient Investigation and Treatment Summary&#8217;.  That document reveals that A has had in the region of 95 blood tests (which have been largely stable), allergy tests (all normal), ultrasound scan, dexa scan and barium studies. All show results within the normal range.  Some of these tests have been highly intrusive and A has required general anaesthetic for the purposes of testing on two occasions.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following oral intake A vomits up to thirty times per day.  However, an unusual feature of the history, and one which cannot be reconciled with any known clinical pattern, is that A does not vomit at all during the night.  It is her habit, apparently, to sleep quite soundly from around midnight until approximately 8.30am.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr C, a consultant Paediatrician at the Y Children&#8217;s Hospital concluded that there was no organic cause or malignant pathology for these symptoms.  This was a view that neither A nor her mother were prepared to accept.  Accordingly it was thought that it might be helpful to obtain a second opinion.  One was obtained from a Dr D, a Consultant Gastroenterologist.  He agreed that there was no organic cause for the symptoms and in the absence of a diagnosis he settled upon the neutral conclusion that this might be regarded generally as &#8216;a disorder of rumination&#8217;.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A and her mother remained unconvinced and out of an abundance of caution but also to bring a fresh pair of eyes from a different hospital, a third opinion was sought.  Dr David Campbell was selected, a Consultant Gastroenterologist from the Sheffield&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Hospital and he provided an analysis which has been reduced to written format.  In that document he considered three diagnoses which had been considered by Dr E and Dr B.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">He discounted rumination syndrome on the basis that A was regurgitating watery liquid and not food.  He discounted a post viral gastro paresis on the basis that it was not consistent with the gastric emptying which had been a consistent history, and he discounted gastro oesophageal reflux disease (GORD).  The latter was wholly inconsistent, in Dr Campbell&#8217;s view, with the fact that the patient did not vomit at all whilst sleeping and had no history of sleep disorder. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_7">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Campbell considered two more possibilities, one a disorder of the neutrophil counts known as neutropenia, which had been further pursued by Dr B and discounted both by him and Dr Campbell by the time of this hearing, and chronic intestinal pseudo obstruction (CIPO) which was comprehensively discounted in the absence of abdominal distension and the two normal barium study tests.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Campbell suggested a number of further medical investigations in order fully to discount gastroenterological causation, all of which had been completed by the time of this hearing and enabled Dr B to conclude to a high degree of certainty that there is no gastroenterological cause for A&#8217;s vomiting.  That is the view of every doctor with relevant expertise who has considered the medical history of this case.  It continues however to be refuted by both the mother and A.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Surveying the background as comprehensively as he did caused Dr Campbell to consider other areas that can loosely be categorised under the heading of &#8216;illness behaviour and obstruction to medical care&#8217;.  It has not been necessary for me during the course of this hearing to investigate those alternatives or to draw any conclusions in respect of them.  It is likely they will be subject to scrutiny during the course of the Children Act proceedings.  I merely record his conclusions that &#8216;I have grave concerns that A is suffering under a form of fabricated and induced illness (the extent to which A is colluding with the mother remains to be seen).  I would suggest that this goes beyond exaggerated illness behaviour&#8230;. By removing the child from a potentially harmful parent it would then be possible to see to what extent the child would benefit from less invasive care&#8217;. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Issues of this complexity are rarely determined on the medical evidence alone.  People sometimes react in an idiosyncratic manner to medical treatment.  They sometimes have their own views as to what is best for them which may not always accord with a recommendation of their doctors.  It is self evident that treatment to which a patient is committed and supportive of the objectives of the doctors is far more likely to be successful.  What seems the most obvious course medically may not necessarily be right for the patient, this simple truth is confronted by doctors everyday in hospital and in general practice.  </p>

In order that I was best placed to evaluate those wishes and feelings she has been represented by a guardian, solicitor and counsel.  All the parties agreed that in the light of A&#8217;s presentation not withstanding her age (approaching 16 years), an assessment should be made of her capacity to understand the issues that fall for consideration in this case and in her treatment.  I start from the premise that a competent young person under the age of 16 years, who is able to understand all the relevant advice and the consequences of that advice, is to be treated as an autonomous individual and respected as such.  That of course would not mean her views would be determinative, but they would be given great weight:-</p>

Were she an adult and were I applying the criteria of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (which I am not) the psychiatric opinion would lead me to the conclusion that A lacks the capacity to take these medical treatment decisions pursuant to section 2 (the diagnostic test) and section 3 (the functional test) of that Act. It is here relevant to how I evaluate A&#8217;s expressed wishes and feelings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Summarising the core views as articulated by Dr G , one of the consultant Child and Adolescents Psychiatrists who undertook capacity assessment, it was concluded that A struggled to make decisions about her own care and presently suffered from a disorder of mind or brain (within the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1987 and 2007); she presented as a child with a complex somatising condition who has at very least a disordered relationship with food.  In Dr G &#8217;s analysis there was no evidence that any further time would alleviate the problem or effectively assist in aiding A&#8217;s understanding. In any event Dr G recognised, as do I, for the reason I will come to in due course, that the treating team simply did not have time to wait to achieve some improvement in A&#8217;s understanding.  I agree with Dr G that A&#8217;s instinctive stance when presented with any suggestion about treatment by her doctors was to say &#8216;no&#8217;.</p>

I heard too from Dr G and indeed from a number of witnesses that A gives the impression of being a great deal younger than her chronological age and whose language, I detect, is that of a much younger, somewhat petulant child.  Notwithstanding the psychiatric evidence as to A&#8217;s lack of competence to participate meaningfully in her own medical treatment decisions, I have nonetheless given very considerable weight to her strongly expressed resistance and have also evaluated with care the options she has expressed a preference for.  Over the course of two days I heard evidence from Dr G, Dr B, Ms H (dietician), F (A&#8217;s sister) and A&#8217;s Mother.</p>

She is, he said, at high risk of &#8216;Refeeding Syndrome&#8217; which as I understand it is essentially derangement of biochemistry, specifically sodium, calcium, phosphate, magnesium and potassium.   The consequence of these deficiencies leads the patient to become weak and lethargic if unmonitored and if not managed properly the consequences are fatal.  In order to avoid this Refeeding Syndrome Dr B  told me it is essential that A&#8217;s future food and fluid intake is managed correctly and supervised closely.  For that reason it is unwise for A to take food orally, particularly if she refuses to comply with dietary limitations.  There is no doubt that she has in the past failed to comply with dietary limitations.  In addition all feeds were likely to induce vomiting, and that would further and adversely impact upon her physiological state.  What in Dr B&#8217;s opinion was the most suitable course was to insert an NJ tube which will bypass the stomach altogether and would therefore be far less likely to induce vomiting and thus give A a real opportunity to increase her weight and stabilise her condition.  </p>

He told me that he had spent some time trying to persuade both A and her mother to accept this advice.  Firstly, because if he managed to achieve a commitment to it, it was far more likely to be successful and, secondly, because the practical realities of imposing the treatment require overriding patient autonomy and potentially using reasonable force to ensure compliance.  The Trust&#8217;s application was filed on the 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, by that stage Dr B was alarmed that A&#8217;s body had already begun to shut down.

Dr B&#8217;s dilemma is a common one.  Where, for what ever reason, patients or families object to a course of treatment, time and care should always be spent exploring the possibilities of an agreed way forward in a patient&#8217;s best interest.  I have sometimes felt that Trusts resort to litigation too quickly, for a variety of reasons.  Equally though, as I believe this case highlights, crucial time can sometimes be lost trying to secure acquiescence.  For the reason articulated by Dr G I do not believe that either the mother or A was ever likely to agree to a way forward in this case.  There are occasions when it is simply the right course to go to the court directly, for the court to take the decision whether that be the Family Division in the case of a child or the Court of Protection in the case of an incapacitous adult.  </p>

The tube is inserted via the nostrils, it is passed down into the oesophagus, into the stomach, into the jejunum.  The proposal is that food will be introduced along with fluids through the tube.  Initially A would be fed day and night.  Once her situation had stabilised the plan is that she would be transferred to a unit where she could be involved in their day time programme and her feeding would then be undertaken almost exclusively over night.   </p>

This it was thought would probably last for several weeks after the initial stabilisation period depending on how well and how quickly A progressed.  Self evidently the first two weeks are crucial.  The mechanism to be deployed involves inserting the NJ tube with a numbing spray down the nose perhaps with an oral sedative. Often neither is required and in the past A has cooperated with the insertion of an NJ tube.  I pause there to interpose that the graphs of her weight whilst in hospital on the occasion she previously agreed to feeding by NJ tube showed a significant improvement in her weight.  </p>

Predictably, perhaps inevitably, her weight began to decline when the NJ tube was displaced.

The wider proposal is that during NJ feeding A would have her IV fluids and intravenous medication gradually weaned as all of her fluids and nutritional food and medication would be administered to her via the NJ tube.  It follows that if the NJ tube became dislodged for whatever reason it would have to be repassed as it would in effect be the only source of nutrition and hydration for A.   It is also important that no oral foods or fluids are taken whilst A is being feed by NJ tube.  I&#8217;m satisfied that in the past that has not been complied with.</p>

Firstly, it creates the illusion of a balancing exercise where there is to my mind, no real balance to be struck: the scales are entirely one sided.

He told me that he did not support this as a form of treatment at all, predominately, because it is a treatment that is reserved for patients in extremis, usually where the gut is very seriously damaged and is unable to absorb food and nutrients.  In those circumstances the options are very limited.  A, however, has a perfectly normal gut which has been proven to absorb food and nutrients in the previous NJ feeding regime.  He considered that as A was at risk in relation to the removal of lines which are inserted there is a risk that she might try to remove the central venous line which goes into the Vena Cava, which in such circumstances could lead to massive haemorrhage or death.  </p>

By contrast, the NJ feeding used long term and in a perfectly safe way has only a low risk of slight gastric erosion caused by the tube and potentially some discomfort falling short of pain during feeding, which if necessary, could be managed with mild analgesia.  The balance of the two options is strikingly clear.</p>

I firmly hope it is unnecessary but it seems to me that A&#8217;s situation is so extreme that I must do all I can to ensure that she has the best attempt of survival.  I have also sanctioned sedation, if necessary.  The Trust has requested that I grant an order permitting them to use reasonable force to prevent A leaving the hospital.  I signalled in strong terms there was no prospect of such an application succeeding.  There was no evidential basis for it, at the moment, and in the weeks ahead it is unlikely that A will even be able to walk unaided.  That kind of order on a young person, indeed on any autonomous adult should, in my judgment, always require compelling and cogent evidence.  Sensibly, the Trust withdrew its request.  In all circumstances therefore I make the declarations set out and annexed to this judgment. </p>
