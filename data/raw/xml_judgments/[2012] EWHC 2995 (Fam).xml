	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I will endeavour to express the relevant facts as shortly as I can. H and W were married in 2003. At that time H was with ED the owner of an investment management company called XYZ. This had been established in 1998. The business was very successful, but in 2006 a financial regulatory authority (&#8220;Regulator&#8221;) served notice of an investigation by them into alleged market abuses. Notwithstanding that bad news the fund continued to trade and was very successful both for its investors and its managers. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">NI was an investor in the fund and a friend of H&#8217;s. He says that in 2007 he decided to withdraw into academic studies and wished to convert his investments into securities which were less exposed to risk. He and H say that in November 2007 they discussed entering into what has been described in a &#8220;Phantom Swap Agreement&#8221; or a &#8220;Cap and Collar Agreement&#8221;. Essentially the idea was that NI would buy 2,465.177 shares in the A B C Fund for &#163;7,766,959. If the value of the fund went up NI would receive the first 5%, and any profit above that would be shared equally by H and NI. But if the fund went down H would guarantee all the losses apart from &#163;100,000.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the latter part of March 2008 the Regulator announced that it had concluded its investigations and would file a complaint against XYZ imminently. H says this news came out of the blue. Other than the notices served in 2006 he had no inkling that this step would be taken. As a result the funds were suspended. The complaint was filed   in early April 2008 and very heavy litigation ensued. Eventually  the Court in the Regulator&#8217;s country gave judgment in early 2012. It found the complaint partly proved and ordered XYZ and ED to disgorge their illegitimate pecuniary gains of over $30m and imposed a civil penalty in the same amount. XYZ was then placed into administration a few months later in 2012.</p>

Her position is (or rather, again, was) that while she does not dispute that NI purchased the shares, the agreement is a fraudulent construct. It was not entered into in 2008, when the parties were reasonably happily married, but rather in 2010, when the marriage had broken down. She petitioned for divorce in July 2010. She says that the H and NI have conspired to create this construct which will have the effect of removing the great majority (about three-quarters) of their fortune from the powers of the court. When the dust has settled she says that NI will return all or most of the money to H.</p>

It is possible forensically to examine paper and to discover when it was manufactured. But H says that his original version has disappeared from some papers kept in his bedroom and accuses W of having taken it. NI says that he sent the original to his solicitors but it was lost in the post. Faced with such a striking coincidence W has asked to examine NI&#8217;s computer on which the agreement was prepared, as the file would be on the hard drive embedded with its date of creation. But NI says that he threw the computer away last summer as it was outdated. </p>

That is a form of oral discovery designed to test the strengths and weaknesses of the parties&#8217; cases under cross-examination, so that an effective FDR can take place. The parties&#8217; position statements were polarised. H asserted that the judgment debt was completely valid and the money irretrievably lost. W asserted that the judgment debt was a fraudulent sham. By then the judgment debt had risen with interest to &#163;7,302,005. Given that the assets of the parties comprise about &#163;10m it can be seen that a lot rode on their respective positions.</p>

He has to accept that it is a valid agreement. However, he says that the default judgment says nothing about when the agreement was actually formed, nor is it necessary for its validity that should do so. It would be, absent proof of fraud, equally valid whether it was formed in 2008 or 2010, whatever H&#8217;s motives may have been if his theory that it was formed in 2010 is right. But Mr Cusworth QC argues that his case on add-back is very substantially strengthened if he can prove that it was formed in 2010 when the marriage was over. Mr Pointer QC says that this is absolutely impermissible not only because of the default Chancery judgment but also because of the order which will be entered as a term of the compromise <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">dismissing </span>W&#8217;s application to set it aside.</p>

This is a generic term which in modern law includes two species. The first species, which I will call 'cause of action estoppel,' is that which prevents a party to an action from asserting or denying, as against the other party, the existence of a particular cause of action, the non-existence or existence of which has been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in previous litigation between the same parties. If the cause of action was determined to exist, ie judgment was given upon it, it is said to be merged in the judgment, or, for those who prefer Latin, transit in rem judicatam. If it was determined not to exist, the unsuccessful plaintiff can no longer assert that it does; he is estopped per rem judicatam. This is simply an application of the rule of public policy expressed in the Latin maxim 'Nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa.' In this application of the maxim 'causa' bears its literal Latin meaning." </p>

But <span style="font-style:italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> abuse of process, as now understood, although separate and distinct from cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel, has much in common with them. The underlying public interest is the same: that there should be finality in litigation and that a party should not be twice vexed in the same matter. This public interest is reinforced by the current emphasis on efficiency and economy in the conduct of litigation, in the interests of the parties and the public as a whole. The bringing of a claim or the raising of a defence in later proceedings may, without more, amount to abuse if the court is satisfied (the onus being on the party alleging abuse) that the claim or defence should have been raised in the earlier proceedings if it was to be raised at all. I would not accept that it is necessary, before abuse may be found, to identify any additional element such as a collateral attack on a previous decision or some dishonesty, but where those elements are present the later proceedings will be much more obviously abusive, and there will rarely be a finding of abuse unless the later proceeding involves what the court regards as unjust harassment of a party. It is, however, wrong to hold that because a matter could have been raised in early proceedings it should have been, so as to render the raising of it in later proceedings necessarily abusive. That is to adopt too dogmatic an approach to what should in my opinion be a broad, merits-based judgment which takes account of the public and private interests involved and also takes account of all the facts of the case, focusing attention on the crucial question whether, in all the circumstances, a party is misusing or abusing the process of the court by seeking to raise before it the issue which could have been raised before. As one cannot comprehensively list all possible forms of abuse, so one cannot formulate any hard and fast rule to determine whether, on given facts, abuse is to be found or not. Thus while I would accept that lack of funds would not ordinarily excuse a failure to raise in earlier proceedings an issue which could and should have been raised then, I would not regard it as necessarily irrelevant, particularly if it appears that the lack of funds has been caused by the party against whom it is sought to claim. While the result may often be the same, it is in my view preferable to ask whether in all the circumstances a party's conduct is an abuse than to ask whether the conduct is an abuse and then, if it is, to ask whether the abuse is excused or justified by special circumstances. Properly applied, and whatever the legitimacy of its descent, the rule has in my view a valuable part to play in protecting the interests of justice.&#8221;</p>

As Lord Bingham says I have to conduct an un-dogmatic merits-based exercise. In my view it is simply absurd to argue that H would be the subject of abusive harassment were W to be allowed to put forward her case. On any view this compromise is hugely beneficial to H as well as W. </p>

Similarly, where there is 'clear evidence of dissipation (in which there is a wanton element)' then the dissipated sums can be added back or re-attributed (see <span style="font-style:italic">Vaughan v Vaughan</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 1 FLR 11" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 1 FLR 11</ref> at para&#160;[14]).

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">Although intellectually pure, the problem with this technique is that it does not re-create any actual money. It is in truth a process of penalisation. In my judgment it should be applied very cautiously indeed and only where the dissipation is demonstrably wanton. I am not satisfied that here the gifts to C are to be characterised in this way. True, the timing is suspicious, but other than that there was no evidence that the gifts were anything other than bona fide. They would represent sensible IHT planning anyway. I therefore decline to add the gifts back. Generally speaking, I suggest that it would be altogether better where a reversal of a transaction is sought, that it is made pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s37</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref>, where the disponee can be heard and where strict statutory criteria must be met. </p>

That was a judgment which I delivered at first instance but which was considered on appeal and upheld. It is not necessary to do more than to reiterate the comment made by my Lord that the circumstances in that case were entirely different to those arising in this case. Mr Pointer submitted that such was the conduct of the husband on one occasion in causing a loss of some &#163;5,000 a substantial figure when compared with the total value of the assets at that time, that it ought to be, as it were, hung round his neck when the final distribution of the assets was reached on the breakdown of the marriage.

Why should it make any difference if the husband had lost a vast sum gambling a month before separation as opposed to a month after it?

It was a gamble of the utmost folly when the difficulties faced by XYZ were surely well known. If it was formed in 2008 there will have to be a close examination of the assertion that the Regulator&#8217;s actions in late March 2008 came out of the blue. If it was formed in 2010 when the marriage was on the rocks then Mr Cusworth QC would argue that the case is almost open and shut given the great size of the losses.

If it is clear that the party withdrawing is not intending to abandon the claim or issue that is being withdrawn, then he or she will not be barred from raising the point in subsequent proceedings unless it would be an abuse of process to permit that to occur. On the facts of the present case, it is clear that Ms Ako did not intend to abandon her claim. Nor would it be unjust or unfair as between the parties to permit her to start again: no abuse of process is involved here. &#8221;</p>
