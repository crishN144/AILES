	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is my judgment following the final hearing of the application for financial remedies made by the Applicant Wife (GW) against the Respondent Husband (GH).  The parties began cohabiting in 2003.  They married in 2009.  They have two children: A and B.  The parties separated in 2021, following 18 years of cohabitation through into marriage.  The petition for divorce was in June 2022.  The Form A was in August that year; decree nisi in December 2022.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The First Directions Appointment was held before Her Honour Judge Ellis in December 2022.  Her order records that the Applicant's legal costs at that time were &#163;48,406; were recorded another &#163;44,274 to FDR.  The Respondent's legal costs at that time were recorded as &#163;2,700, with another &#163;4,800 to FDR.  Her Honour directed that the Children Act arbitration awards be removed from the Court file, which they have been, but otherwise made standard directions for the FDR.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The FDR itself was then held in April before Deputy District Judge Loughbridge.  The Applicant's legal costs at that time were recorded as having risen to &#163;103,554, with an estimated &#163;36,000 to final hearing.  The Respondent's legal costs were recorded as being &#163;8,156, rising by another &#163;30,000 if there had to be a final hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There was an open offer ordered from the Respondent in response to the Applicant's post-FDR open offer.  It came a few days after the FDR, but it was recorded that the Respondent was intending to make an open offer within 14 days.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_5">
	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Permission was given at that time for Dr Z to give expert evidence, but that was in relation to the Applicant's poor health, in relation to her medical health.  Other relatively standard directions were given.  DDJ Loughbridge did not debar the parties from raising conduct, but equally he did not permit it to be addressed in the section 25 statements.  These statements, and the third party witness statements that were envisaged, were ordered four weeks before the final hearing, with a bundle to be filed seven days before the final hearing.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In June 2023, the Court listed the hearing to begin in October.  That made the last date for the exchange of statements 12 September 2023, with the deadline for the bundle to be 3 October 2023.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In October 2023, there was the directions hearing before me to decide an application for participation directions, which was granted by consent due to the Applicant's difficult medical situation.  The parties also confirmed generally they were ready for trial.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Pursuant to those directions, the final hearing has taken place remotely by way of Microsoft Teams over two days for the taking of evidence and submissions.  The Applicant gave evidence throughout the first day, with regular breaks, the Respondent giving evidence in the morning of the second day, with submissions that afternoon.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I will record here, as I said to the Applicant at the close of her evidence, that I was fully satisfied that I had clearly understood all of her evidence to the Court.  I know she was very concerned that, due to her condition, she had not been able to explain her points or answer some of the questions that were put to her.  Whilst it was noticeable that she did become more tired throughout the day, as was predicted, with regular breaks and the breaking-down of questioning, I am satisfied she has had a fair hearing, and at no point in this case am I left unsure about what her evidence actually has been.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Overall, notwithstanding this has been a remote three-day final hearing, which inevitably takes its toll on all those involved, I am satisfied that the hearing has been fair to all parties.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The first application at the start of the hearing was to firstly admit the Applicant's father's witness statement as hearsay evidence, and permit him not to be called due to his inability to attend, because he was caring for his wife who is recovering in hospital.  Secondly, there was an application to permit the Applicant's sister to be called as a witness in lieu of her father.  I will not repeat here my reasons for dismissing the application.  Having heard the final hearing now, I am fortified in my conclusions for not permitting a late change of evidence under the overriding objective.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">The third application at the start of the second day was for five different pieces of late evidence to be admitted.  They were, first, evidence that the Applicant had no critical illness cover; second, the final signed page of a loan agreement that was already in evidence in unsigned form; third, the bank statements that underpinned the loan agreement; fourth, emails between the Applicant and her father from 2010; and fifth, the judgment of Peel J when he made the child arrangements order following the arbitration before Mr Norton KC.</p>

The rates, once VAT is added, are nowhere near 3 per cent and, on my calculation, are all less than 1.5 per cent.  I accept there will be legal fees to add on top.  Therefore, a reasonable cost of sale to be applied to all properties except Property C, is 2 per cent.

They say they are mindful of their legal duty to apply trust funds fairly as between all the beneficiaries of the trust.  Given the number of beneficiaries between which the trust assets are shared, even if not shared equally, the Trustees say they are uncertain as to precisely for what purpose distributions will be made in the future.  They say that support for housing may be the best use of trust funds to support the beneficiaries, and that using funds to pay for school fees would unreasonably favour two beneficiaries over the others.</p>

The Applicant has been the main earner throughout that period, and the Respondent has always earned markedly less.  He has very little pension provision to his name, almost none.  Fairness ordinarily demands a pension sharing order, to equalise, in the case of defined contribution pensions, the pension capital.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Applicant says a pension sharing order should not be made because she may need to access the ill health provisions of her pension and draw down early.  There is no certainty at the moment because, as discussed already, the Court does not know the Applicant's final prognosis.  She is being treated with curative intent, but equally she has had to have frank conversations with her consultant.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is very little evidence on this point before the Court.  It is within the Court's knowledge that those who are unable to work due to a physical or medical condition can usually access their pension savings earlier than 55.  Usually HMRC will recognise two situations: (1) ill health, where you cannot do your job for ill health reasons and (2) and serious ill health where there is a life expectancy of less than 12 months.  The pension scheme rules in each case will have their own rules about accessing early retirement, and they can set their own criteria.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am not persuaded it is fair to say to the Respondent that because of an unknown situation with unknown pension scheme rules, he should be left with only &#163;1,000 of pensions after 18 years together.  Equally, a 50:50 sharing order leaves the Applicant in too precarious a position.  Weighing up all the factors, I consider that the fairest approach is to transfer the Hargreaves Lansdown pension in the sum of &#163;71,406 to the Respondent.  That leaves a split of pension capital of around 25% to him.  I consider that is fair because he has another 10 to 15 working years of life ahead of him, on a conservative basis, and he is now of course able to live mortgage free, and on his own evidence will be returning to full employment.  75% for the Applicant is a fair balance between the unknowns of her situation and the likelihood that, even if she returns to work, she may have to retire earlier than is necessary.</p>
