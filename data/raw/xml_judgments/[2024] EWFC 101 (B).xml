	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In <span style="font-style:italic">[country A]</span> in 2014 the mother went out to the shops and left the children alone at home.  She should have stayed with them, or made sure there was another adult to take care of them before she went out.  She thought they would be safer at home than coming out with her.  That was not the case.  She is very sorry for the pain and hurt that GG then experienced as a result of the accident that happened while she was away.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">After the accident, the mother looked after GG every minute of the day for many months.  She slept on the floor in the hospital.  She washed her, she comforted her and fed her, and sat with her when she could not sleep.  She never left her side.  The care that she gave to GG saved her life.  She did this because she loved GG.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The father is still angry with the mother about the accident.  He cannot forgive her, and he wants her to be punished.  But in punishing her, he has also hurt the children, because he has made it seem as though there is no good in the mother at all.  This is not true.  There is lots that is good in her.  She has been a loving and caring mum to the children, and they have shared many happy times together.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The father cannot see any good things about the mother.  He told her she was not a good mother. Soon she came to believe what he said.  She lost confidence. Over time the children started to think the same as their father, that their mother was no good. This is not true.  The mother is human. Humans can make mistakes, but there is good in everyone. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">When the mother took the children to the refuge in [<span style="font-style:italic">place name redacted</span>] she thought it would make things better.  It was not what the children wanted and so she brought them home. She was not trying to kidnap them.  She was trying to find space to be the mother she thought they needed her to be, without the father criticising her and making her lose her confidence.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Children are allowed to have their own thoughts and opinions. Lots of children have parents who are not able to look after them in the way they need, but those children still have love for their parents.  The judge wanted to understand why the children&#8217;s feelings about their mother are so strong.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The judge was worried that the children&#8217;s understanding of what had happened in their lives was coming too much from stories told to them by their father, and was influenced too much by his own strong feelings about their mother.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">If children&#8217;s understanding of what has happened to them comes from what they have been told by someone else, it can be hard to make sense of their experiences. They might think that the part of them that comes from their mother&#8217;s side is bad, because they think their mother is bad.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The judge knows that the children do not want to talk about their mum and do not want to have any therapy that is about making them see their mum. But the judge still thinks therapy may help them.  The children have been through a lot of changes.  It would be good if they could have some help to understand what they have been through, to express their own feelings, and to recover from the difficult experiences they have had.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">So the judge agrees that therapy might be good for the children. But we do not knowwho would give the therapy, who would pay for it, or whether the children or their father would go to therapy.   If the case ended now, the children would likely not get any therapy and they would stay with the same feelings about their mum.  The judge thinks there may still be a way to help these children.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The judge knows this is not what the children want.  But while there is still a chance that the family could get some help, the judge thinks it is worth trying.  The children will stay living with their father.  They will not have to see their mother if they don&#8217;t want to. So asking the local authority to help will not change anything for the children right now.</p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">Two significant events have shaped the family&#8217;s history and the current dynamics. The family is originally from [<span style="font-style:italic">country A</span>].  [<span style="font-style:italic">When the children were 6 and 4 the mother left the children alone in the apartment and an accident happened causing life changing injuries to GG</span>]. The mother is wracked by guilt and remorse for her decision to leave the children alone in the property.  She will always bear the responsibility of that.  However, I found that the father&#8217;s attitude towards her had been cruel and unforgiving.  He has blamed the mother entirely, and has since encouraged the children to regard her as someone who did not love her children, and told them she locked them up in the apartment as a punishment, without caring what happened to them.  </p>
	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">GG was in hospital in <span style="font-style:italic">[country A]</span> for many months, her mother sleeping at her bedside day and night.  The family then went to live in [<span style="font-style:italic">country B</span>], again with the mother&#8217;s main focus being the care and treatment of GG.  They moved to England in 2016, where GG&#8217;s treatment has continued.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">The second event of significance was that in July 2017 the mother left the family home with the children and moved to a refuge.  The children were very unhappy and after a few weeks asked to return to their father&#8217;s care.  The mother returned to the family home with the children.  This event has been thereafter viewed by the father and children as an attempt by the mother to kidnap the children.  Since then they have been fearful that the mother would try to take them away again.  </p>

Mr Hodge says the Court must strive to do everything in its power to right the wrong that has been done to her, and which has been compounded by the Family Court proceedings, which have so far not succeeded in reuniting the children with their mother, and have only resulted in their views becoming more entrenched.</p>

He is not advocating for the children to be removed from their father&#8217;s care at this time, but does suggest the local authority should share parental responsibility for the children.  In this way, he submits, it could provide a package of support to the family, which would include intensive and meaningful work with both children and parents designed to help them process and understand their past experiences, and rebuild the children&#8217;s relationship with their mother.  </p>

The children&#8217;s hostility to their mother was long-standing and entrenched, but their views were found to have been, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;corrupted by the malignancy of the views with which they had been force-fed over many years of their life by their father&#8217;.</span>  At first instance, the judge acknowledged this, but considered that any further attempts at restoring the relationship would be unlikely to achieve anything, and would cause more harm than good.

In that case the mother was found to have falsely persuaded her children that the father and paternal grandparents had physically and sexually abused them.  Contact between the children and their father had stopped.  The mother breached a number of orders requiring her to make the children available for contact, and made a further allegation of sexual abuse, which was again found to be untrue.  An order was made for mother&#8217;s committal in prison. The oldest child separately applied for permission to apply for a prohibited steps order against all contact.  </p>

On the other hand, Dr Sason appears to suggest that the children should be believed, because they are adamant they have suffered trauma as a result of experiences at their mother&#8217;s hands.  The mother is not to be invited to participate at this stage, so would have no ability to share any alternative narrative with the therapist.

Living in a home where there was this kind of domestic abuse going on would have put both BB and GG at risk of emotional harm which could have impacted on their emotional health and development.  I have considered the concerns in relation to domestic abuse using the Cafcass domestic abuse pathway.  [The father] is able to verbalise the harm that experiencing domestic abuse could have on BB and GG. There is no suggestion that he has entered into another abusive relationship since the relationship broke down with [the mother].  The relationship between [the father] and [the mother] was clearly toxic and at times abusive.  It is positive that the parents have now separated.  [The mother] has not reported any concerns in relation to [the father] behaving in an abusive way towards the children (apart from the possibility of witnessing him behaving in an abusive way towards her in front of them).  The information provided within these proceedings supports the view that [the father] is currently meeting the children&#8217;s basic care, safety and emotional needs to a good enough standard.&#8217;</span></p>

In framing the issue in this way, it appears that some blame is directed towards the mother, by being a part of the toxic relationship, and caught up in a mutual unhealthy dynamic.  However, the findings were that the father had perpetrated physical, emotional, and financial abuse against the mother over a period of years.  The guardian assumes that now the parties have separated there is no risk to the children from the issue of domestic abuse. That may ignore the risk that a person who has acted in an abusive way within a household to adults may well continue to act in that way towards children in the household. That the father appears to have needed the children to be aligned with his viewpoint so totally could be seen as a risk factor for this.  That they are no longer living together may remove one element of risk from domestic abuse, but perhaps minimises the risk of continuing emotional abuse, as a result of continued belittling and denigration of the mother to the children.  </p>

This is very concerning, and I am in no doubt that [the father] could have done more to promote a positive relationship between the children and their mother.  It would be very helpful for GG and BB to be able to rebuild their relationship with their mother.  I have considered the concerns in relation to alienating behaviours using the Cafcass alienating behaviours pathway.  In my opinion the [injuries] that GG experienced in the care of her mother are important when considering this from the children&#8217;s perspective.  Both children view that their mother was responsible for GG&#8217;s [injuries].  Whilst I accept the findings that have been made it is important to remember that the children&#8217;s view of this is that their mother failed to protect them and is somewhat responsible for GG&#8217;s injuries.  In my opinion this is a justified reason for not wanting to spend time with their mother.  If the incident had occurred in the UK, I would have expected [the mother] to have been investigated for child neglect or child cruelty.  Dr Sason reported that GG has posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and BB has also experienced trauma resulting from the accident. The situation is further complicated by the children&#8217;s perception of their mother&#8217;s view of their father.  In my experience for a person to recover from trauma and PTSD they first need to feel safe.  BB and GG report feeling safe with their father.  Any suggestion by their mother and professionals that their father is in anyway unsafe would in my opinion be very hard for GG and BB to accept and could potentially hinder their recovery.  BB and GG would need their mother to accept their position in relation to wanting to live with their father for them to be able to rebuild their relationship with her.&#8217;</span></p>

On this basis the guardian says that the children are both justified in rejecting their mother, and she then weighs in with her own view, that this likely falls within the category of child neglect or child cruelty.  I did hold the mother responsible for leaving her children unsupervised, and that could be categorised as an instance of neglect, but I did not make findings that justify the description of cruelty.  The consequences have been horrific for GG and will last her whole life.  But I am concerned that in the guardian&#8217;s mind this of itself appears to justify the mother thereafter having her relationship with her children severed for ever. The idea that this mother is wholly beyond redemption is a hard line for a professional to take, particularly when [the mother] was barely out of childhood herself, was the victim of domestic abuse at the time and was living in a warzone. </p>

This is identified as the only way in which the children might be able to take steps towards rebuilding a relationship with their mother.  It was submitted that the children engaging with family therapy will help them process the findings the mother wasn&#8217;t abusive towards them, and could heal some of the harm caused by the father&#8217;s alienating behaviour. For reasons given above, I question how the narrative that the mother was not abusive towards the children will find its way into the therapeutic process where the mother is excluded from participating in it until the third stage, and the children&#8217;s beliefs about their experiences are to be treated as fact.</p>

The children have been given a false narrative about the past.  It has had the effect of distorting their own past experiences, and interfering with their ability to process those experiences, recover from them, and look to the future.  Ultimately these events have led to the mother leaving the household, and being rejected by her children, and the children aligning themselves with their father.  </p>

That is what has been ordered for the past four years, but it has achieved nothing.  The mother has been told that her letters have been ripped up and thrown away.  The children have made increasingly clear not only that they do not wish to receive a letter from her, but that they do not want her even to possess any photographs of them.  In the circumstances, both the guardian&#8217;s criticism of the mother for not maintaining her &#8216;commitment&#8217; to writing letters, and her optimism that this would be the best way to begin the process of re-building the relationship, appears to me to be somewhat misplaced.</p>

The local authority will be able to deploy specialists in domestic abuse and alienating behaviours to investigate, and may have access to in-house therapy, counselling or other interventions that may assist the family.  A section 37 report asks the local authority to investigate and then to consider what actions it takes.  It is not for me to shut down that option before the investigation has started. </p>
