The case was listed for hearing before me to determine the father&#8217;s application for a summary return of the children to the jurisdiction of Romania pursuant to the provisions of the Child Abduction &amp; Custody Act 1985 incorporating the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction 1980 (&#8220;the Hague Convention&#8221;) and under Article 11 of Council Regulation (EC) 2201/2003 (&#8220;BIIa&#8221;). </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The background facts can be summarised as follows.  The parents met in Romania in 1997 and were married in 2002, divorcing ten years later. The children then lived with their mother and had contact with their father, including holiday contact in summer 2014. At some point the mother and children moved to Miroslava to live with her mother. The father moved to Norway in 2014 to work and he remains living there. The mother worked in England for several months. The children remained in Romania in the care of the maternal grandmother. Both the mother and the father returned to Romania from England/ Norway to see the children in Romania.  In February 2015 the mother states that the father said that he would allow her to take the children to live in England. The father, however, states that he wanted to talk about the future care of the children but that they did not reach an agreement. The mother returned to Romania shortly afterwards &#8220;for good&#8221;.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">At around that time the father remarried. The mother made an application to change the father&#8217;s contact with the children and also sought his consent to enrol the children in a school in England for the academic year 2015/16. It is her case that he said yes but then changed his mind and the plan was abandoned. On 3 March 2015 a psychiatrist examined A and diagnosed reactive anxious-depressive disorder and oppositional defiant disorder. Risperidone and Sertraline were prescribed. S was diagnosed with &#8220;childhood emotional disorders&#8221;.</p>

They signed a document whereby they agreed that the mother could bring the children to England from 12 October 2016 to 26 October 2016 on the basis that they stayed at an address in Aylesbury, that their mother would travel and return with them and that they would be accompanied by her throughout.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The mother did not return to Romania on 26 October. She applied on 11 November to the Romanian court for permission both to remain with the children in the UK during the 2016/17 academic year and to remain permanently in the jurisdiction of England and Wales. On 29 November the application to remove during the 2016/17 academic year was refused by the Romanian court. The father&#8217;s application under the Hague Convention for the summary return of the children was made on 15 December 2016 and solicitors were appointed for him in England in mid February 2017. The mother appealed against the November decision of the Romanian court and on 26 January 2017 her appeal was upheld. She was granted permission to remain in England with the children until 31 August 2017. The father in turn applied to review that decision and the hearing was listed in May and heard on June 8th. His application was dismissed.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The father did not know where the children were living so he applied within the Hague Convention proceedings for a disclosure order on 22 February which was granted by Baker J. When the case was heard on 7 March, Moylan J recorded that the mother was asserting that the father had consented to her coming to England on a permanent basis if, during the 2 week agreed holiday, she could find employment and schools for the children. She also said that he had changed his mind on 26 October. She asserted that the children were at grave risk of harm if they returned to Romania as the father had been violent to her and the children in the past, that the children are frightened of their father and do not wish to return, and that she has insufficient funds to support them there. Directions for filing evidence were given. A Cafcass High Court Team reporter was appointed to report on the children&#8217;s wishes and feelings and any objections to return to Romania.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Ms Ionescu reported on 27 April. She recommended that the children should be joined as parties to the proceedings and offered to act as their Guardian. On 4 May Cobb J considered the issue of whether the children should be made parties to the proceedings. He declined to make them parties as the recommendation did not correspond with the PD16A guidance and because the children do not have competence to instruct solicitors. I have not been asked to revisit that decision. The mother is recorded as having accepted the Cafcass assessment that the children were less mature than their chronological ages.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">On 22 May the Hague Convention application was due to be heard by HHJ Jakens. The father&#8217;s Counsel applied for an adjournment on the basis that it was vital to know the outcome of the decision in respect of father&#8217;s application in Romania for a review of the decision to allow the mother and children to remain here for this academic year. This was said to be particularly relevant to Article 12 considerations. HHJ Jakens granted the adjournment and wrote to the Romanian Court to ensure that the court was aware of the adjournment of this case to 19 June and to request information about the outcome of the Romanian hearing on 8 June. On 14 June this court was updated that file 1595/99/2017 concerning the father&#8217;s application for revision of the 26 January decision in respect of file 34661/245/2016 was dismissed and that the decision is final.</p>

Both the mother and father were aware that there is a hearing on 22 June in Romania in respect of that application but it was the first time this court had been apprised of the matter. The mother told me that she does not know whether the 22 June hearing is to be a final hearing or whether the application will be heard after 10 September when the Romanian court reconvenes after the summer vacation. The document she produced refers to an &#8220;establishment of minor child&#8217;s domicile; parental agreement&#8221; and that there is a reference to &#8220;an adjournment of ruling&#8221; on 22 June.</p>

Secondly, that returning the children to Romania would place the children at grave risk of physical or psychological harm or place them in an otherwise intolerable situation under Art 13(b) and thirdly, that A and S object to returning to Romania and are of an age and level of maturity where it would be appropriate to take account of their views under Article 13.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The starting point is Article 3, which specifies that the removal or the retention of the child is to be considered wrongful where (a) it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person, an institution or any other body either jointly or alone under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention, and (b) at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised either jointly or alone or would have been so exercised but for the removal or the retention.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">In this case the children were habitually resident in Romania prior to removal. Both parents were exercising jointly their parental rights over the children as the mother needed either the father&#8217;s permission or the court&#8217;s consent to remove.  There was no permission from the Romanian court for the children to move here at the time of removal and unless the father&#8217;s consent can be proved there has therefore been a wrongful removal or retention of the children.  Accordingly, I must &#8220;order the return of the child forthwith&#8221; pursuant to Article 12 unless one of the exceptions in Article 13 applies.  The burden is on the mother to establish these exceptions. As she has represented herself before me in this difficult case, I have throughout endeavoured to consider the legal matters which her lawyer might have relied on had she been represented. I have assumed that if I find that an exception is made out the mother would ask me to exercise my discretion in order to allow the children to remain within the jurisdiction and that if I make an order to return she would ask that it be suspended until 1 September 2017</p>

The father has continued to live in Norway but requests return to Romania. In MacDonald J&#8217;s judgment the answer will be fact-specific as will the extent to which it can be said that the return of the child in such circumstances can be said to be placing the child in an intolerable situation:</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">&#8220;For example, where there has been delay in seeking the return of the child it is arguable that the absence from the jurisdiction of habitual residence of the parent seeking the return of that child to that jurisdiction, and the consequent inability upon the child's return to continue and promote the relationship between the child and the left behind parent in that jurisdiction, may increase or exacerbate the intolerability of uprooting the child for the purposes of return after a long period of settlement and/or the disruption, uncertainty and anxiety which follows an unlooked for return to the jurisdiction of the court of habitual residence. Against this, it might be argued that, where the left behind parent is still entitled, and able, to seek a welfare determination in the country of the child's habitual residence notwithstanding his or her absence from that jurisdiction, the underlying principle on which the Convention rests (that any debate on the merits should take place before the competent authorities in the State where the child had his habitual residence prior to his removal) will remain highly relevant.&#8221;</p>

The judges who try these cases do so regularly and build up huge experience in dealing with them, as do the CAFCASS officers who interview the children involved. I do not think that they need (or will be assisted by) an analysis of how to go about this part of their task. In making his or her findings and evaluation, the judge will be able to draw upon the entirety of the material that has been assembled in relation to the child's objections exception and to pick from it those features which are relevant to his or her determination. The starting point is the wording of Article 13 which requires, as the authorities which I would choose to follow confirm, a determination of whether the child objects, whether he or she has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of his or her views, and what order should be made in all the circumstances. What is relevant to each of these decisions will vary from case to case.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"> The father&#8217;s case is that the children were wrongfully retained in England on 26 October 2016 at the end of the holiday. Ms Chokowry submitted that the definition given by Lord Brandon in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Re H</span> was significant in that removal and retention are mutually exclusive concepts. The &#8216;paradigm&#8217; case, she submits, is wrongful retention after a holiday and that, following <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Re S</span>, the question of whether there has been a wrongful removal, and if so when, is a question of fact.  Ms Chokowry asks me to make an order returning the children to Romania forthwith, and in any event no later than 31 August. Ms Chokowry states that the father only consented to a holiday here and refers me to the document agreed by the parents before a notary public on 5 August 2016 which provides for the children to travel here with their mother on 12 October and return on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>.  The father has &#8216;custody rights&#8217; in Romania and therefore Ms Chokowry submitted that there was a wrongful retention on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October. Ms Chokowry accepted that it is possible to give &#8216;future consent&#8217;, conditional upon the occurrence of events but the father&#8217;s case is that the consent must be clear, unequivocal and operative at the time of removal or retention. In this case the father does not accept that he gave any consent, whether conditional or unconditional to permanent removal to the jurisdiction of England and Wales. Miss Chokowry submitted that if I were to look for a point in time when it could be said that the parties actually agreed I would fail to identify such a time.  </p>

There was a long history between the parents of the mother asking the father to consent to her moving to England with the children. In 2014/ 2015 the children had been left with the maternal grandmother whilst the mother worked here. The father was living in Norway. I am satisfied that the parents returned to Romania in early 2015 to discuss how the situation could be managed. The mother says that the father agreed that she could come to England but she did not travel as A was in psychological turmoil. I was unconvinced by her evidence. In my assessment if he had agreed to removal at that time she would have brought the children here. As it was she returned to Romania in her words &#8220;for good&#8221;.</p>

She asked the father to agree to them coming to England for the next school year but he refused. The background was therefore one of conflict and disagreement on the subject of her bringing the children to England as well as about his contact. Against that background the mother tries to persuade me that despite the fact that the August 2016 document refers to a holiday there was discussion about this becoming a more permanent arrangement if she had a stable job, registered the children with a GP and schools. She says that the father consented to permanent removal on those terms and that she trusted him. I do not accept her evidence on this point and preferred the evidence of the father. It was very clear to me that he has held a longstanding objection to the children coming to England. The mother states that he is controlling and that may be the case, however I accept his evidence that he would not have consented at that time because he wanted only wanted the children to have a &#8216;break&#8217;. I am satisfied that he also wanted to continue with the counselling and therapy proposed in Romania so that he could pursue his application for contact with the children which was ongoing in the Romanian court.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">In my assessment there are several additional factors which point away from the father consenting to permanent removal. These parents do not trust each other at all. They needed to have a sealed document agreed even for a holiday and had failed to negotiate terms for the children to come to live here in the past. They are embroiled in litigation about contact in Romania. A told the Cafcass officer that they had come here for a two week holiday which had been extended for seven months and the report of Ermina Soroceano dated 27 August 2016 comments that the mother told the psychologists that the father was willing for her to leave permanently but would not sign the relevant papers. Ms Soroceano records: &#8220;We mention the children&#8217;s father confirmed, in psychologist&#8217;s presence, that agreed to his children leaving abroad but during the summer holiday he signed before a notary public a document specifying that he agrees to his children&#8217;s leaving for England for a period of two weeks &#8211; and not for their leaving for an unlimited period of time as it would have been necessary for their enrolling at school in England&#8221;. In my assessment if the father had subsequently agreed to permanent removal the mother would have ensured that the agreement was notarised before she travelled on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October. </p>

Further she confirms that she applied in Romania for both permanent and academic year removal on 11 November. In my assessment the mother come to England on 12 October with no intention of returning. She knew that the father would not agree to a permanent removal and obtained his consent to a holiday in order to come here. This is in effect a similar situation to that seen in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">RS v KS</span> where Macur J found that the mother had no intention of returning the child at the end of the holiday.</p>

I refused her application as it had been made clear to her that no further evidence could be filed without permission and she had not asked for that permission in a timely fashion.

The mother complained to her of &#8220;maltreatment&#8221; during the marriage and of financial conflict and &#8216;suspected&#8217; abuse continuing after separation. She complained of the father controlling money and not consulting her about family decisions, and stated that the father had been violent to her in December 2010 when A was 4 and on other occasions. She also alleged that he had been violent towards A. The recommendation made by Ms Sorocianu was that there should be child psychotherapy for A and psychological counselling for the parents in order to diminish the negative consequences of divorce and family violence in children. The mother sought a further psychological report from Ermina Sorocianu on 24 October 2016. The psychologist diagnosed &#8216;mixed anxious and depressive disorder with anxiety episodes&#8217;. It was noted that the child was currently in England because the father had consented to him travelling to England as a tourist and recorded that A had been taken for &#8216;psychological tests&#8217; on 11 October, the day before he left for England. On that occasion A had complained that his father had spent a lot of time on the computer, that his father had disbelieved him preferring the paternal grandmother&#8217;s account of something and that he loved his mother, brother and maternal grandmother. He also expressed a wish to leave &#8220;&#8230;together with his mother for England and to live there&#8221;.

She evaluated the maternal and paternal family and the children. She observed the mother to be highly critical of the father and to be someone who did not encourage contact. She comments that the mother attended with a box of Lego bought by the father which she felt was unsatisfactory because he could afford better toys. She assessed the father as prioritising his children&#8217;s needs and applying educational and behavioural rules and was concerned that the children allied themselves with the mother in a way which was unhealthy. She also recommended psychological counselling for the family. A further child psychologist, Ms Ottilia reported on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August that A shows signs of &#8220;fury and aggression&#8221; towards his father but could not give a reason for them. She recommended that both parents should be involved in the planning for the children, counselling to develop closer bonds and to promote the development of collaboration between family members. The mother reported to me that recently A acted out stabbing his father during a biology dissection lesson and that she has sought an appointment for him on 30 June to achieve professional help.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The children have been in the UK since October 2016. I have to consider whether the disruption to them now that they have settled into a home following a move in February and that they are settled into school supports the notion that uprooting them would cause an intolerable situation. The children have had good attendance at school and are making progress. They have generally been stable, settled and secure. There is however insufficient evidence that for these boys the inevitable disruption, uncertainty and anxiety which will inevitably follow a return to Romania - which they do not want - is such that it would lead to grave risk of harm or intolerability, even allowing for and considering their psychological vulnerability.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Ms Ionescu met with the children on 5 April. She was able to converse with them in Romanian. She reported that their attendance at school is good and they have some friends. They are &#8216;below attainment expectations&#8217; but are making progress. The boys were seen together at their own request. S played with toys which are for much younger children and A joined in. In the context of the discussion A referred to mistreatment by his father. He said his father beat him with a rod when he was unable to do a cartwheel and that the paternal grandmother had chastised them when they used foul language. He also said that he had witnessed domestic violence and had bitten his father when he was biting the mother. The mother states that the reference to &#8216;biting&#8217; is actually a reference to beating.  He described an argument about a fried egg. He said that the police were not called because &#8220;&#8230;people think this is normal, for a man to beat up a woman, nobody will think about calling the police in the remote countryside&#8221;.</p>

A was only able to identify going to church as a good thing about Romania. They are both happy with their mother and are angry with their father. The reason for their anger is not always clear. When asked what would happen if they had to go back to Romania A would refuse to go but said that it would make a difference if their mother were to go with them.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">I have considered the issue of whether the children object to being returned to Romania.  Insofar as some of the views expressed to the CAFCASS officer are that things are better for them in the UK than in Romania on a material basis, those views are clearly an expression of preference.  The objection must be to returning to Romania rather than to the circumstances in Romania or to being separated from their mother if she were not to accompany them on their return. The threshold is relatively low at the &#8216;gateway&#8217; stage.</p>

They were fully aware of why they were being seen by Cafcass as A stated: &#8221;&#8230;he needs to leave us alone as he wants to bring us back to Romania.&#8221; A used phrases such as &#8220;abducted from Romania&#8221; and said that the situation related back to what he had said about the paternal grandmother, referring I believe to a holiday in 2015. The Cafcass officer commented that &#8220;&#8230;there is little doubt that A is influenced by listening to adult discussions&#8221;. I agree. The language she reports him using is not age-appropriate. In her assessment, and without apportioning blame between the parents, she concludes that A is anxious and that the boys appear to have been affected by the parental dispute. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">In my assessment the professional opinion expressed by Ms Ionescu about the children&#8217;s maturity and level of understanding is correct. They are immature for their chronological ages, a matter with which their mother agrees. Ms Ionescu comments:   &#8221;&#8230;both children expressed a strong preference to remain in England with their mother and although they objected to return, this appears to be related to the prospect of separation from their mother.&#8221; In my assessment the boys have expressed a clear preference to remain here and an objection to return without their mother. They do not however raise any specific or reasoned objections to return to Romania itself. They are angry with their father and loyal to their mother. Their mother was threatening not to return with them to Romania but has now said that if I order return she will return with them.</p>

There is of course always a risk in cases of this kind that a young person&#8217;s view has been skewed by the parent with whom they are living.  In this case I have no doubt that the children&#8217;s views have been skewed.  They are aware of the conflict and I have borne in mind the fact that they are living with their mother and have been exposed to her distress at this application. </p>

Having weighed the evidence I am not satisfied that either A or S has the level of maturity and understanding of a child of their respective chronological ages.  The things they said do not seem to me, on a broad assessment, to be age-appropriate. Even if what they said could be stretched to amount to an objection, I do not find that they have attained an age and maturity where it would be appropriate to place much weight on what they say.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The facts which point towards them returning would include the fact that both children were retained in England without the father&#8217;s consent and the clear policy of the Convention is that children should be returned swiftly when wrongfully removed or retained. In this case the Romanian court is actively considering the children&#8217;s future and is much better placed to consider the children&#8217;s welfare interests. Also, whilst the children say they would like to stay in England their preference is largely based on standard of living and they have lived most of their lives in Romania. The father has offered undertakings which I have assessed as adequate arrangements to protect the children on return and the principle of judicial comity means that the Romanian court can and will protect their welfare interests.</p>

On balance I have concluded that the measures which are proposed by the father&#8217;s undertakings are adequate to secure the protection of these children in these circumstances.  They provide realistic, enforceable protection from violence and emotional harm.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">These boys have had psychological difficulties which I would not wish to exacerbate. I am satisfied however on reading the reports that their difficulties relate to the parental conflict. That conflict will continue wherever they live until it is addressed. The conflict has continued here in England.   There is an argument that if something is intolerable then no amount of protective measures could make up for it and that one would not send children back to an intolerable situation.  I have however considered all of the factors in this case and have determined that the situation will be far short of intolerable.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Having balanced all of the factors above, I am satisfied that the children do not hold reasoned objections to return and the evidence does not come anywhere close to the threshold for a sufficiently mature objection for the limited purpose under consideration.  I am also not satisfied that there is a grave risk to these children or that return to Romania would be to return to an intolerable situation.  They would be protected from their father because he does not live there and their welfare is under active consideration by the Romanian court. The protective measures proposed are adequate to protect them from the perceived risks.  The clearer the need for protection, the more substantial the measures must be: in this case there is a somewhat reduced need for protection because the father lives in Norway and the children are therefore less likely to be exposed to any chastisement by him or direct parental conflict. Under Art 11.4 of the Brussels II revised convention I am satisfied that there are sufficient safeguards in place on the return. I have in any event (from an abundance of caution) weighed the policy aspects of this case and the principles of comity. In this case my discretion - were it to fall on me to exercise it - would propel me very firmly to the conclusion that the children should be returned to Romania.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">In this case the Romanian courts have been well acquainted with this family&#8217;s disputes for some time. In the past 8 months the issue of temporary removal has been litigated, appealed and reviewed. A decision on permanent removal is under active consideration. I consider that the Romanian court is far better placed to consider the issue and I am sure, given recent helpful communication as to the progress of the case, that the matter will be dealt with expeditiously, including the father&#8217;s contact application. That court will be looking at the longer term future of these children and will be considering their general welfare. The fact that I shall order return under the Hague Convention should not be taken by that court as to any attempt by me to fetter their decision-making power in respect of the future welfare of the children and the questions of interim or permanent removal to the jurisdiction of England and Wales. Were I not to suspend the order, but to order immediate return, this would be to return the children to a country in which their father no long lives and at the risk of significant disruption, anxiety and distress, in circumstances where the Romanian court might very shortly thereafter allow them to remain in England.   A in particular has suffered from anxiety issues and I do not wish to exacerbate his situation. Although the impact on him is not sufficient to found a defence under Art 13(b) I am satisfied that I should take it into account on the issue of suspension.</p>

The interim period will I hope be used by the Romanian Courts to consider the future of these children and the contact they will have with their father at least on an interim basis. The parents have been in discussions about this but have been unable to come to an agreement. The hearing in Romania today may go some way to resolving the issue. In the event that the Romanian courts have either extended the mother and children&#8217;s permission to stay either for another period or permanently by 1 September 2017 she will not have to return the children to Romania. </p>
