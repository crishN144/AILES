Perhaps inevitably, that has led to some reopening by the parties of the arguments advanced at the December hearing. </p>

The increase of &#163;1.2m pa does nothing other than reflect the increase in the lump sum that W will receive as a result of H&#8217;s late payment.  All that the new order does is to provide that she receives some of her award earlier than would otherwise be the case and provide an incentive for H to pay that which he should have already paid.  Thus, she should receive periodical payments of &#163;1.92m pa plus the continued payment of household expenses.  </p>

That does not mean that it cannot be paid before decree absolute and I remind myself that the date for payment of the first tranche was the very date that H chose, namely 30 September 2020.  Similarly, interest can run from the date of the order. But, says H, as the lump sum cannot be enforced until decree absolute, neither can the interest attached to it because of late payment. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">It is important to stress that subject to the amendment of paragraph 11 of the March order, there is no double recovery.  What my order does is to provide for W to receive what she would receive in any event at an earlier stage than would be the case in the circumstances which arise from H&#8217;s failure to pay the lump sum. It is fair that W should be compensated now for being kept out of her money. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I have to guard against double counting.  This takes two forms.  First, paragraph 11 of my March order provides for interest to run at the rate of 4% on the outstanding lump sum.  By reason of H&#8217;s default in paying &#163;30m, the whole of the sum of &#163;49m is payable and interest is accruing on that, it being rightly conceded by H that interest can be ordered to be paid from the date of the order until the date when payment is due, irrespective of whether the payment is enforceable (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/23/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.23(6)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref>).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In my December judgment I explained why I limited the increase in periodical payments to a sum reflecting only the interest on &#163;30m rather than &#163;49m.  It must follow that if W is to receive a sum in lieu of the interest that would otherwise accrue, the payment of interest on that element of the lump sum must cease to be payable, as otherwise W would be receiving the sum both now, following the making of this order, and again pursuant to paragraph 11.    </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">More difficult is the question of what the effect of this increase in periodical payments should be upon the March order for periodical payments to W of &#163;720k pa and certain household expenses, put by W at &#163;25k pm and by H at &#163;15k pm exclusive of mortgage and child related payments.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">There is much to be said on both sides.  I have come to the conclusion that it would not be right for an increase of this size to have no impact upon the original order.  To do so would be to run into the double counting complaint.  If H had paid the &#163;30m, the periodical payments would have been reduced by 61.2% (30/49) and thus go down from &#163;720k pa to (in round figures) &#163;280k pa.  The amount of this element of the periodical payments award will thus be varied from &#163;720k pa to &#163;280k, making for an amended payment of &#163;1.480m (&#163;123.3k pm) rather than the figure of &#163;1.92m.    </p>

I accept that the result is that W does not receive the full sum that she would receive if the periodical payments were not to be varied, but in fact the loss is significantly mitigated by the fact that she will not have to pay tax upon the interest which would be accruing and further she has the benefit of receiving the payment earlier than might be the case. </p>

H has suggested that he pay off the shortfall at the rate of &#163;48k pm in addition to making periodical payments of 100k pm, a lower sum than I have ordered.  W says the arrears should be paid by the end of January 2021.  I order that they shall be paid by 4 equal monthly instalments, with the first payment due on 31 January 2021, and I am satisfied that is within H&#8217;s means. </p>

I pointed out at paragraph 52 of my December judgment that her own capital resources did little more than permit her to pay off other liabilities.  Nor would her periodical payments award as set in March 2020 get near to allowing her to save sufficient for the outstanding future litigation.  </p>

In my December judgment I expressed the view that H should provide W with the funds for payment of those costs.  Those comments were made in the absence of a determination of the level of ongoing maintenance provision and it is right that I should revisit them having fixed that level.  This is appropriate, notwithstanding that I dismissed the grounds of opposition to the making of an order that H had previously put forward (paragraph 47 of my December judgment), </p>

The increase that I have provided is in the sum of about &#163;63.3k pm.  In reaching my decision I bear in mind that if H had paid the lump sum there would be no question of him also contributing towards W&#8217;s costs and the general principle that a LSPO is to be available only for those who could not otherwise reasonably pay their own costs. But it would equally be wrong for me to overlook why this situation has come about and I have to strike an appropriate balance. </p>
