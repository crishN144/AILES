R was born on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2006 and is therefore now aged eleven.  Sadly, she suffers from a number of profound disabilities and will need care and support for the rest of her life.</p>

In the summer of 2017, a crisis arose when the local authority became concerned that R might be at risk of significant harm in J&#8217;s care.  As a result, care proceedings were started and, for the last six months or so, R has been living in a specialist residential home, hereafter referred to as DHR.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is clear from everything that I have read that Dr. Cox and his team have provided dedicated medical care and treatment for R.  I see no reason to criticise or challenge his diagnoses or opinions.  In the course of these proceedings, however, an expert opinion was obtained from Dr. Richard Hain, a consultant in paediatric palliative care at the Children&#8217;s Hospital for Wales in Cardiff. I have found his report extremely helpful, as I know have the mother and other parties.</p>

	    <num style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.6in">8.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is appropriate at this stage to cite some further information concerning R&#8217;s condition and care from Dr. Hain&#8217;s report, in some detail.  He advises that Rett&#8217;s syndrome cannot be cured and its progression cannot be halted or reversed by any of the interventions currently available.  It is usually only slowly progressive and not all children with the condition will need palliative care. In practice, a large proportion of girls with the syndrome develop distressing symptoms and the life span of many of them will be shortened by complications of the condition. Dr. Hain concludes that R falls into this category, and that it therefore seems reasonable to consider that she has a life-limiting condition.</p>
	    </content>
	  </paragraph>
	  <paragraph eId="para_9">
	    <num style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.6in">9.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr. Hain advises that the normal history of Rett&#8217;s, even if the diagnosis is certain, does not help in prognostication because its course is so variable.  The commonest mode of death in progressive neurological conditions, including Rett&#8217;s, is respiratory failure due to chest infection.  Other important modes of death are prolonged seizures that cannot be terminated using anti-convulsive medications, and severe bowel dysfunction that threatens the child&#8217;s ability to extract nutrition from food.</p>

	  </paragraph>
	  <paragraph eId="para_10">
	    <num style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.6in">10.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr. Hain advises that, although it is not possible to know for certain how long an individual patient is likely to survive, increasing frequency of life-threatening events is an important indication that death is approaching more quickly.  In contrast, the absence of such events of increasing frequency represents good indirect evidence about prognosis. Dr. Hain advises that, as the material he has reviewed demonstrates that R has to date only had one life-threatening episode requiring admission to an intensive care unit, and that was seemingly related to the side effects of medication rather than a direct complication of her underlying condition, the prognosis about her short term is, therefore, relatively favourable. He therefore concludes that he would not be surprised if R were to die before reaching adulthood but, on the basis of the evidence that he has reviewed, he would be surprised if she were to die within the next year.  He expects her to live for some years, or at least a large number of months.</p>

	  </paragraph>
	  <paragraph eId="para_11">
	    <num style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.6in">11.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So far as pain is concerned, Dr. Hain notes that R has access to pain relief at home. Although not currently in pain, she is vulnerable to developing pain from a number of sources, including her dystonia and her dislocated hip.  He also notes that scoliosis causes pain by creating an imbalance in the very powerful muscles of the back. He concludes that, although she does not have much in the way of pain at present, there are potential sources for worsening pain.  Provided R has access to good generic palliative care locally and specialist paediatric palliative medical care is also available, Dr. Hain expects that the potential types of pain to which R will be vulnerable will be well-contained.  Complete resolution of her pain is less likely, although not impossible.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr. Hain also advises about the likelihood of dyspnoea in her case.  He points out that, while for most of us the sensation of breathing is normally effortless and rarely noticeable, in some patients there is an abnormal sensation that breathing has become uncomfortable.  It is known as dyspnoea.  It can have a number of causes and, in R&#8217;s case, the most likely cause is chest infection, to which she is made more vulnerable by her scoliosis and the reduction in her capacity for controlled movement. The mechanism is complex and can include diverse factors such as pain and the presence of fluid and other material that abnormally stretches infected lung airways. From the material that Dr. Hain has reviewed, he concludes there is nothing to suggest that R currently experiences dyspnoea.  She has, however, had one episode of aspiration (that is to say, chest infection caused by inhaled feed) in the last twelve months, and he thinks it likely that the frequency and severity of chest infections will worsen for the rest of her life. He again advises that, provided R has access to good generic palliative care locally, plus specialist paediatric palliative medical attention, he would expect the dyspnoea to be well controlled although not eliminated.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr. Hain also draws attention to the likelihood of fear and anxiety being features of R&#8217;s life in future.  Such emotions are fundamental and do not require well-developed cognitive function of the sort which R lacks, and therefore can be experienced powerfully by children with neurodegenerative conditions.  He points out that pain and dyspnoea can both be sources of anxiety and, in turn, anxiety can exacerbate the experience of pain and dyspnoea. He says there is nothing to suggest that R is experiencing anxiety at present, but he warns that she is certainly vulnerable to it, and that this is likely to become worse over the next few years.  Once again, however, he advises that, provided R has access to good generic palliative care locally, plus specialist paediatric palliative medical attention, he would expect that her anxiety will be well controlled, although in all probability not eliminated entirely.</p>

His advice was that at this stage there is no justification for withholding enteral feeds, since adequate nutrition was manifestly essential.  In most circumstances, there is little evidence to support giving prescribed feed as opposed to blended feed, but Dr. Hain advised that, when there are concerns &#8211; as there have been at some points &#8211; about her nutritional status and weight loss, it is reasonable to insist that R received prescribed feeds, rather than the blended diet.</p>

He acknowledged that invasive ventilation does not reverse the underlying condition which causes breathing difficulties, and that there comes a point with a child with life-limiting conditions when the benefits of invasive ventilation are not great enough to justify the harm it causes. He considered, however, that, at this point in R&#8217;s life, there is evidence that, even when suffering from severe chest infection, R can be returned to something approximating to her normal level of health, with the help of invasive ventilation.  In Dr. Hain&#8217;s view, it would not be reasonable to withhold invasive ventilation unless it was clear at the time that R had become so unwell that she was unlikely to benefit from it.</p>

She has three other children, all with different fathers.  So R has two older sisters, one aged 20, who was accommodated by the local authority under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.20</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> in 2013 and is now categorised as a care leaver, and the other, aged rising 17, who is currently accommodated by the local authority under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 20</ref>.

The local authority&#8217;s statement in these proceedings asserts that, prior to the move, the family had been known to social services in the local area where they lived before, and concerns had been raised about the mother&#8217;s emotional relationship with R and missed medical appointments for the child.  Similar concerns about missed appointments arose after the family moved. Other difficulties came to the local authority&#8217;s attention, in particular with regard to the two older girls, including allegations of aggressive behaviour by the oldest child.  At one point, in order to protect R from the effects of that behaviour, her mother agreed that R should be accommodated with the local authority under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.20</ref> for a period of over a year, between October 2013 and December 2014.</p>

Following her admission, on the night of 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2017, R suffered an apparent life-threatening event.  Dr. Cox&#8217;s opinion was that this may have been an electrical seizure; the clinical records refer to seizures, breathing difficulties and falling oxygen saturations, despite the administration of oxygen. R was treated with two doses of buccal midazolam, a sedative, and phenytoin, an anti-seizure medication, and required intubation and ventilation.  As the cause of the acute deterioration may have been reversible, R was transferred to a hospital in Cardiff, and specifically to a paediatric intensive care unit there, for specialist treatment, and was then successfully extubated.  Medication was stopped, save for dystonia, and she was discharged home to the care of her mother on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> May.</p>

I think I convinced myself that she was going to die and, when we were told she was not going to die, I was overwhelmed by relief.  As the enormity of what happened sank in, I also became petrified that she might have to go through again what she had just managed to survive.  I thought over everything she had been through in her life, the surgery, dystonia and the contractions and everything that she had to come, more of the same, and the proposal of really serious spinal surgery, and I couldn&#8217;t bear it for her.  R has made a full recovery from this, but I don&#8217;t think I have.  I don&#8217;t think anyone who is not R&#8217;s mother could ever really understand.  It has been truly traumatic and affected my thinking and mood and relationships with everyone around R for a very long time&#8221;.</p>

The minutes recorded, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>, that R&#8217;s ongoing health and well-being was such that she had recovered from an acute episode and was well enough to be cared for at home.  They also recorded that the mother&#8217;s mental and emotional well-being had fluctuated over the past few weeks and thus her ability to make appropriate decisions about R&#8217;s care was questioned by professionals.  This included her recently-formulated wishes document prepared with Dr. Cox. It was the view of the meeting that some aspects of the document may actually cause suffering and may not be ethical and/or legal.  The mother&#8217;s anxiety levels appeared very high, and it was noted that she had lost her confidence to meet R&#8217;s care needs.  The mother was also concerned about the impact of recent events on her younger child, M. In the meeting, the mother became very tearful when discussing the wishes document.  She was adamant that she would not change this and spoke of how hard it had been to complete it, and she would not repeat that process.  It was her view that prolonging R&#8217;s life with interventions would cause her further suffering.</p>

It is agreed that that day, the mother arrived at DHR and, shortly after her arrival, gave R a dose of midazolam, which she carried in her bag for emergencies. At the outset of the proceedings, it was asserted by the local authority that the mother had done this in breach of an agreement as to the management of dystonia and without checking whether midazolam had been previously administered that day.  In the course of the hearing, some inconsistencies were identified by Ms. Katie Gollop QC, on behalf of the mother, within the DHR records and between the DHR records themselves and the statement filed in these proceedings by a nurse at DHR on behalf of the local authority. All that can fairly be said at the conclusion of the evidence is that, on that day, midazolam was administered by the mother against the request of the nurse.  In so far as there was any suggestion or implication that the mother was on that occasion unnecessarily and dangerously administering the drug to her daughter in a way that endangered R&#8217;s safety and health, I record that the evidence provides no support for such a suggestion.</p>

I have explained that such a decision will be very difficult for us to make locally, as I am aware that J&#8217;s opinion is not shared by all health, education and social care professionals that had been involved with R, but none of these have to live with R day to day and witness her situation.</p>

She concluded that there had been a breakdown in communication between Dr. Cox and the GOSH staff, and she felt to some extent that she had been the subject of criticism when she sought to raise the ethical issue. Reports from GOSH staff record her as raising these issues.  Dr. Ganeson, a consultant in paediatric neurology at GOSH, reported in a meeting dated 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July, at which she and her colleagues had updated the mother concerning R&#8217;s medical condition and then proceeded to discuss the mother&#8217;s perspective of R&#8217;s health. She reported the mother as having stated that she thought R was in the worst health state she had ever been in in terms of her comfort, and dated this back to the intensive care admission in May.  The mother stated that she felt that the measures that were being taken to care for R were invasive and ineffective, and that R was suffering unacceptably.  She specifically stated that she felt feeding R was prolonging her life and that consideration should be given to withdrawing feeding from R.  Dr. Ganeson advised that this would be a matter to be resolved by a court. They then discussed whether R&#8217;s situation would fall under the remit of official guidance for withdrawing or withholding life-sustaining treatment, and she expressed the view that such guidance was not relevant, as it pertained to people who were felt to be nearing the end of their life, and she did not feel that this applied to R.  She added that exploring such issues would not be within the remit of a specialist neurology team at GOSH, and this was something that she would expect Dr. Cox and the local social services team to lead on. She said that the referral had not been accepted on the basis of resolving this issue and therefore planned to remit the case back to Dr. Cox.</p>

Dr. Cox was told, in terms, that GOSH saw the admission as a social care admission to a place of safety while long-term arrangements for her care were put in place.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2017, when R was still in hospital, the mother had a conversation with another consultant paediatrician, Dr. Cordingley.  In her statement for these proceedings, Dr. Cordingley recorded that the mother had said that, if R had a seizure, then she would like to have 5 milligrams of midazolam so she could give it to her at home.  Dr. Cordingley reported that GOSH staff did not think that R was having seizures and that she, Dr. Cordingley, would therefore not be dispensing it, as it was not part of the treatment plan. The mother told Dr. Cordingley that, if R had a seizure at home or became unwell, then she did not want R to be treated and did not want her to have oxygen, and did not want R to come in and out of hospital.  When Dr. Cordingley observed that GOSH had deemed that R was not at end of life, the mother said that this was not everyone&#8217;s opinion. Dr. Cordingley told the mother that she needed to make sure that R was safe.  If R had a seizure or an unusual episode at home, or became more unwell, then the mother would need to call the paramedics or contact her GP.  The mother responded that the paramedics were well aware of her wish for no oxygen or treatment.  Dr. Cordingley warned that she was not sure how the mother would stand legally if she did not call paramedics or allow treatment, and that she should discuss this with her lawyers.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In her recent statement in these proceedings, the mother accepts broadly the accuracy of Dr. Cordingley&#8217;s statement, and acknowledges that she had been warning her that, if she did not consent to R having treatment or failed to call an ambulance, she might be committing a criminal offence.  The mother observes now that, at that point, she did not, in her words: &#8220;haul that aboard&#8221;, adding &#8220;I was totally focused on what I believed was best for R and saving her from suffering&#8221;.  The mother now says that, in fact, whatever she may have said at the time, there has never been any occasion when she has not called for help for R when she needed it, and, she adds, she always would.</p>

On 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August, the mother, according to the social services, refused to speak to the social worker and declined a further appointment with the social worker the following week.  On 17th August, R was readmitted to the hospital following further episodes of distress and dystonia.  On the next day, an initial child protection case conference was convened.  On 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> August, R became unwell, vomited and had breathing difficulties, for which she was treated with oxygen. Chest x-rays confirmed that she had had an aspiration with the appearance of a right middle lobe pneumonia, with other evidence of infection in the form of raised white cell counts and CRP.  Dr. Cox discussed his treatment proposals with the mother, which included the use of antibiotics.  The mother indicated that she did not want R to be given antibiotics.  In her statement filed, as I say, shortly before this hearing, the mother says that by this point she was, in her own words, &#8220;totally stuck&#8221; and unable to take on any more information. She felt the outlook for R was hopeless.  She asserts that she could not process what Dr. Cox was saying about antibiotics. R seemed to be getting better and the mother could not grasp the purpose of giving antibiotics to a child who was getting better.</p>

The local authority, the mother and the guardian were represented.  The mother was not present but in contact separately with her solicitor by a separate line.  The father was neither present nor represented at this telephone hearing. Judge Robertshaw made an interim care order on the basis of an interim care plan for R to be discharged from hospital back to DHR.  As is clear from the transcript of the hearing, the parties agreed that the interim care order would be for a limited period, pending a further hearing at which all parties could be present and represented.</p>

A further emergency hearing was therefore arranged for the next day, 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> August, at which Judge Robertshaw made a declaration that R could be fed formula feeds, notwithstanding the mother&#8217;s objections. In her statement for this hearing, the mother accepts that with hindsight, she should have agreed with Dr. Cox, but adds that the father also thought that a blended diet would be appropriate.  </p>

On the next occasion, 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December, I gave further case management directions, including permission to the parties to instruct Dr. Freda Gardner, consultant psychologist, and further directions.  I refused to discharge the interim care order, but instead directed that the hearing at the end of January should be a final hearing.  Those directions committed the parties to a very tight timetable.  I am pleased to record that, thanks to the effort of all the parties and their legal representatives, in particular Mr. Sanjay Patel for the local authority, the case management directions have been complied with, with some minor slippage that has not ultimately caused any inconvenience or prejudice to any party.

Secondly, if the court finds that the threshold is crossed, the court must then decide what order to make, having regard in particular to the provisions of s.1 of the Children Act and in particular, the principle that the child&#8217;s welfare is the paramount consideration, and having regard to relevant matters in the welfare check list in s.1(3).  These statutory provisions have been considered in a number of reported cases, and the principles derived from those cases are well-known.

The mother admits that she smeared a very small amount of chocolate on R&#8217;s mouth.  She denies that this amounted to the &#8220;administration&#8221; of chocolate, and asserts that she acted in this way with the aim of giving her daughter some pleasure.  She does not believe that R suffered in any way as a result.  Once again, it seems to me that the local authority&#8217;s case is not so much that R suffered harm or was likely to suffer harm, but rather that the mother continued to fail to comply with agreed plans for her daughter&#8217;s care.</p>

Her instructions included a request to carry out a full psychological assessment of the mother, including a review of her medical history, identifying appropriate treatment and therapy as may be available for the mother; an assessment of the mother&#8217;s style of attachment to R; consideration of whether the mother was sufficiently psychologically robust to care for R at home without support; and an assessment of her capacity to work openly and co-operatively with professionals in future.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr. Gardner&#8217;s report includes an executive summary which sets out her conclusions in some detail.  She found that the mother has a protracted history of depression and anxiety and poor affect regulation, and that there was evidence that she currently experiences symptoms consistent with moderate reactive depression and moderate anxiety.  Psychometric assessment of the mother&#8217;s personality revealed the presence of compulsive traits but no evidence of severe personality pathology. There was evidence that, as a result of numerous fractured attachments and loss, particularly in childhood, the mother has developed a profound attachment disorder.  The characteristics of the disorder were, Dr. Gardner advised, an experience of distress and a tendency to up-regulate emotional responses, including defensive strategies, when her attachment system becomes activated.  The mother currently has very little insight with regard to the attachment difficulties she has and the impact that this has had, and continues to have, on her psychological functioning, both as an individual and as a parent.</p>

Such intervention would help her recover the memories from her past and the currently repressed feelings associated with them.  Dr. Gardner advised that, if the mother is able to fully engage in the intervention and commit to the therapeutic process, it is likely that she will be able to develop insight with regard to attachment difficulties, her tendency to up-regulate her emotional responses when her attachment system is activated, and the impact that this has had on the emotional functioning of the children and other adults. As the therapeutic process proceeds, Dr. Gardner advised that it was likely that the mother would experience relief from the psychological and mental health difficulties that she has experienced intermittently throughout her life.</p>

This would facilitate the development of more attuned care of all of her children and increase the mother&#8217;s level of insight into her relationships with others, including professionals.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr. Gardner further advised that, given the attachment and other difficulties that the mother has developed and the strength of the emotional bond with her daughter, it was likely that her attachment system would be activated and reactivated when separation and/or loss is anticipated and/or threatened.  In such circumstances, Dr. Gardner advised the normative strategies such as distress, sadness, increased dependence and/or withdrawal, will be overridden by heightened emotional/affective responses and a reduction in coherence in her emotional behaviour.  Dr. Gardner therefore advised that, at the most difficult times, such as when R experiences life-threatening complications and treatment becomes urgent, it was less likely that the mother would be able to work in full partnership with treating clinicians because of her own emotional responses and defensive functioning. Dr. Gardner advised that, although there was evidence that the mother had developed some adaptive coping strategies and resilience, her psychological strength was likely to add to the emotional charge of her behaviour.  In those circumstances, the mother&#8217;s psychological functioning was likely to make it difficult for her to care for R at home, even with the support identified. Dr. Gardner therefore concluded that, although the mother has the capacity to work openly with professionals, her capacity to work consistently and co-operatively will continue to be affected by attachment difficulties until she has had the opportunity to engage in and derive benefit from the intervention which Dr. Gardner recommended.</p>

She described the mother as highly motivated and having a degree of insight not always found.  It is unusual, said Dr. Gardner, for someone in the mother&#8217;s position to develop this level of insight and understanding during the court proceedings. Dr. Gardner confirmed that the attunement work she proposed in her report would be a relatively short-term piece of work, lasting perhaps ten to twelve weeks, but that the psychotherapy would last much longer, perhaps 18 months to two years.  Dr. Gardner was able to recommend a colleague who will be able to undertake the attunement work in the near future.  The attunement work would assist the mother in being able to enjoy the positive experiences in caring for her child during contact.  </p>

That therapy would be a challenging process for the mother, enabling her to come to terms with the details and causes of her attachment disorder and personality problems.  However, the benefit of attunement work was separate from, and not dependent on, psychotherapy.  The focus on the attunement work would be to help the mother address the difficulties she had picking up nuances in complex situations.</p>

All accept that the mother cannot resume care of R at this stage.  The principal issue between the parties is whether the court can conclude that there is no prospect of the mother resuming care of R in the short and medium term until she has completed psychotherapy.  The local authority, supported by the guardian, is of the opinion that the mother cannot do so.  The mother, on the other hand, contends that there is a reasonable prospect that she will be able to resume care after the attunement work. This issue leads on to the second principal issue between the parties, namely, what order the court should now make.  The local authority proposes that there should be a full care order now, whereas the mother argues that the court should make a further interim care order and list the matter for further review after the attunement work is completed.</p>

R is thriving in DHR, showing that she is enjoying her life, building positive relationships with staff.  R has a right to life and prohibition of torture.  The mother&#8217;s ongoing belief that R has a limited quality of life and the opportunity to restrict her access to medical services and treatments, means that R is highly likely to continue to experience significant harm in her mother&#8217;s care.  It is my belief that the mother does not have the capacity to change within a suitable timescale for R, and that R would be unsafe both physically and emotionally in her care&#8221;.</p>

The mother currently visits R twice a week for two hours on a Wednesday and three to four hours on a Sunday.  M accompanies his mother once a fortnight, and the older sisters attend on occasions. Since the start of the proceedings, the mother&#8217;s contact has been supervised principally by DHR staff.  This has not always worked successfully, since the process of supervising contact inevitably involves an element of monitoring and recording, whereas the mother and R also need a degree of support in order to protect R and assist contact in being as beneficial an experience as possible. </p>

Initially, the local authority plan &#8211; somewhat surprisingly, in my view &#8211; was for contact to be cut right down to once a month.  The rationale for this, as I understand it, was that the local authority did not at that stage envisage the mother ever resuming care of R full time.  The evidence did not really support that level of a reduction in contact.  Dr. Gardner did not support it, and as I understand her evidence, the social worker, Ms. Luscombe, did not really support it.  Furthermore, the rationale was contrary to the local authority&#8217;s position concerning long-term care as it evolved during the hearing, namely that the mother had the long-term potential to resume care of R if she successfully completed psychotherapy.</p>

When the stage is reached for the attunement work which includes R, as is apparently planned, an additional session of contact will be arranged for the purpose of that work.  Contact would be supervised by a member of the local authority&#8217;s intervention services and supported by a member of DHR staff, to ensure that R&#8217;s needs are met. R&#8217;s siblings will be permitted to attend any of the mother&#8217;s contacts.  In addition, three weekends a year would be arranged for R to stay at the hospice near to the family home.</p>

The father, who gave evidence before me and spoke of his commitment to R, and is plainly devoted to her notwithstanding the fact that he lives some distance away, supported R remaining at DHR for the indefinite future.  The guardian also supported the plan.  She was concerned that she could not be confident that the mother would meet R&#8217;s needs in an adequate way.  She was, however, critical of the local authority&#8217;s original plan about contact and her intervention was instrumental in persuading the local authority to increase the proposal.</p>

She stressed that she no longer held the views she had espoused in the summer of 2017 that R&#8217;s quality of life did not justify the current levels of medical intervention.  Her position now is that she will do anything she can to ensure that R achieves her potential. She said she had never wanted to kill or harm her child, had never consciously misrepresented how ill she was, and had only described her condition as she truly believed it to be.  She said that she fully realised and understood that R could not come home at this stage, but hoped that the court would not endorse R&#8217;s placement in what she described as &#8220;institutional care once and for all&#8221;.  The mother asked for a chance to show that her care for R can be consistent.</p>

As a result, her thinking now is different and she is not in the &#8220;same place&#8221; she was at the time of the local authority application.  Miss Gollop and Miss Pope stressed the real insight that the mother has developed during the currency of the proceedings, to a degree which Dr. Gardner has described as unusual from a mother in care proceedings.</p>

They acknowledged that both have a potentially favourable outcome from the mother&#8217;s perspective, but add that neither is a given.  They stress that the evidence demonstrates that the psychotherapy or psychodynamic counselling is a long-term piece of work which will take place over a period which Dr. Gardner identifies as 18 months to two years.  Furthermore, as Dr. Gardner also identifies, it will not be an easy piece of work for the mother. The local authority reminds me that Dr. Gardner was concerned that repeat illness in R would trigger the mother&#8217;s attachment response if R was in her care during therapy.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dealing with the mother&#8217;s proposal that there should be a further interim care order rather than a final care order, Mr. Vine and Mr. Rees rightly point out that such a course would not be aimed at securing a piece of evidence or enabling an event to occur which would permit a different outcome.  There are, they submit, no issues as to threshold, orders or care plan which cannot be decided at this stage. They submit further that, were the court to adjourn the case now, there would, as a matter of logic, be no lesser case for successive adjournments throughout the period of the psychotherapy work and/or psychodynamic counselling which is proposed.  Such a course would, they submit, offend not only against the principle in s.1(2) and the specific statutory regime for care proceedings under s.32(5), but also against the principles pronounced by the House of Lords in the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re S, Re W</span> decision cited above. They submit that, while a single short extension measured in a few weeks might in certain circumstances be permissible, (for example, whether or not there was still an uncertainty about whether psychotherapy would be provided and/or funded), the extension of the sort sought by the mother here is of a wholly different order and collides directly with the principles set out above.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In response, Miss Gollop and Miss Pope invite the court to take what they concede to be an exceptional and counter-intuitive course in the context of the family justice reforms, namely to delay a final decision in this case.  They argue that, in this case, a delay would not be detrimental but would in fact positively benefit R&#8217;s welfare interests.  They submit there is no evidence that any extension of time would be damaging to R&#8217;s welfare.  She will remain at DHR and no change is proposed. On the contrary, the significant benefit that would result would be that the mother would have the opportunity to engage in attunement and psychotherapeutic work not previously available, and thus demonstrate real evidence of her capacity to change.  They submit that, in four months&#8217; time, the court would have available evidence which is simply not available now, partly because of the history of the proceedings. They point out the disadvantages of a final order &#8211; namely the fact that the local authority would become the decision-maker, the fact that the mother&#8217;s legal aid certificate would be discharged, risks to the mother&#8217;s accommodation, and the disappearance of the guardian and the judge. They further express concerns about the involvement of the independent reviewing officer, who of course has a role in ensuring the proper administration of care orders following the conclusion of proceedings. In the light of comments made by the officer in this case, which they submit give rise to a concern about her true independence, it seems that the reviewing officer had expressed support for the local authority&#8217;s original plan for the significant reduction in contact to four hours a month, about which I have already been critical.  Miss Gollop and Miss Pope submit that that gives rise to a cause for concern as to whether the reviewing officer would truly perform the function that she is expected to perform in these circumstances.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the other hand, they submit that were the ICO to be extended, the court could continue to be the decision-maker during what they describe as the crucial period of the case.  It would enable the court to reach what they describe as the &#8220;right&#8221; decision for this exceptional child, rather than what they described as expedited determination conforming to the 26-week rule.  They point out that the continuation of the proceedings would enable the guardian to remain involved in the case and identify a number of ways in which the guardian&#8217;s continued involvement would be of assistance. They point out that the court would then be able to assess the progress of the mother&#8217;s attunement and psychotherapy work, and would have a far better sense of the prognosis of that work in four months&#8217; time.  They also suggest that Dr. Gardner would be able to review the mother&#8217;s progress at that point.  In addition, the mother will of course have the advantage of the ongoing legal representation.</p>

In other words, they attack the serious reduction in contact proposed at the outset of the proceedings, and suggest that this demonstrates that the local authority lacks a true understanding of the importance of the relationship.  They point to other evidence which suggests the local authority has been reluctant to acknowledge the important role the mother has played in R&#8217;s life hitherto.</p>
