The staff felt it was important to keep D under strict observation twenty-four hours a day. It was necessary to take the precaution of locking doors to try to contain her. </p>

D had made an escape. In doing so she put herself at considerable peril.  D managed somehow to scale a six-foot-high wall and run through a barbed wire fence into a very busy main road.  She was found by the police, in a distressed and agitated condition and returned. The following day D&#8217;s behaviour had reached such an alarming level that the staff at Eden House felt the need to call an ambulance because they were afraid that D would seriously injure herself.  They were also extremely concerned about D&#8217;s general well-being. The ambulance took D to Macclesfield Hospital in Cheshire where D was admitted. </p>

Thus, it seems reasonable to assume, for the present, that much of her extreme behaviour may be a consequence of what she witnessed in Iraq. This I understand to be the general, tentative, consensus of those who are seeking to help her. </p>

The following day D was reported missing to police by her father. The father asked that when D was recovered she be taken to Alder Hey Children&#8217;s Hospital as he believed he simply could not keep D safe.  It was, sadly, felt necessary in the end to convey D to Alder Hey Children&#8217;s Hospital in handcuffs.  When D arrived, she was screaming and assaulting staff, she was attempting to self-harm by putting ligatures around her neck and a plastic bag over her head.  It was decided that there should be both staff and security guards on the door to protect the other children as well as to prevent D harming herself.   </p>

However, an extensive search for a therapeutic placement was undertaken throughout the UK with repeated emails being sent to multiple providers. Unfortunately, due to there being a limited number of placements available and demand being high, no offers of placements were made that were remotely suitable to D&#8217;s identified needs. The Placements Team contacted commissioners in other Local Authorities, requesting any intelligence concerning potentially suitable placements. I have been told that they obtained a Residential Framework Placement list to ensure that they were contacting every possible provider.  </p>

It is not possible in this ex tempore judgment to set out the full chronology of these past few months. Mr Mylonas QC, who appears on behalf of the Trust, has drawn to my attention a particularly alarming fact. The Alder Hey Hospital, specialising as it does in the treatment of profoundly sick children, regularly has four to five air ambulances arriving every day.  He told me that he had been informed by his clients that the noise of those air ambulances caused real distress to D and that it was the view of those treating her that it triggered memories of her experiences in Iraq. She displayed conspicuous behavioural problems at such times. At no point had Judge De Haas been informed of this.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.04in">Today I have scrutinised an interim care plan which is, of necessity, in skeletal detail.  Mr Twomey has been able to flesh it out.  It is contemplated that D will move to the identified unit in the week commencing 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2018.  I am told that there will be therapeutic provision on site, full CAMHS support, opportunity for D to be able to socialise and structures in place for D to see her parents. Crucially there will be a supportive medical regime and staff who are appropriately trained in managing D&#8217;s behaviour in a way that will compromise her dignity as little as possible.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.04in">I hope that this hearing today has done something to galvanise constructive action, time will tell.  If there is any risk to this placement, in terms of its continuing availability (I have been told that there have, historically, been several false dawns), then the case is to be returned to me <span style="font-weight:bold">on short notice</span> by the Guardian&#8217;s team. Otherwise, the case will continue to be scrutinised by HHJ De Haas. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.04in">Ms Lomas, who appears on D&#8217;s behalf, tells me, depressingly, that it has not yet been possible to undertake a psychological assessment on her client. It follows that even the most rudimentary understanding of D&#8217;s psychological needs remains far from clear.  There is, however, information from CAMHS which is sufficient to inform the therapeutic support at the residential unit, at least initially.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.04in">A meeting with a psychologist had been arranged for D to attend a couple of days ago. For reasons that I need not set out it was cancelled. A new date has been fixed.  It should be regarded as set in stone. I highlight this to draw it to the attention of HHJ De Haas in her future case management. </p>
