	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">The court is concerned with the welfare of a sibling group of children. To preserve their anonymity, I shall refer to them as &#8216;the children&#8217; and alter other information from this judgment that might lead to their identification. The application before the Court is that of the Mother who applied, under the Inherent Jurisdiction of the High Court, for an order that the children be returned to England and Wales from a foreign jurisdiction that I will refer to as Country B. A complicating feature of the case was, at the time the Mother made her application, she was also in Country B with the children having, she alleged, been abandoned there by the Father. The mother&#8217;s application was heard by His Honour Judge Rogers, sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge. A judgment determining the disputed facts between the parents was given on 7 February 2020.  </p>

However, a number of other issues arose that required determination. As a result, I reserved judgment following the hearing of the evidence. Given the number of issues considered, this judgment is unexpectedly lengthy. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">The children were born in England and hold UK citizenship. The Father was born in Country B, but now has UK citizenship. During the relationship, the mother had permission to remain in the United Kingdom by reason of her marriage to the Father but she is a citizen of a third country, Country C. In 2016, the family visited Country B for the purposes of a holiday and to visit both the paternal and maternal grandparents who reside there. During the trip there were a number of disputes between the parents.  The Father returned to England without the Mother and children but, on the finding of Judge Rogers, brought with him the travel and identity documents that the Mother and children needed to leave Country B and re-enter the United Kingdom. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">As a result, the Mother and the children were left stranded in Country B. Although they were able to stay with relatives, the children had no access to formal education. The Mother and children were reliant on the generosity of family to meet their needs. They had entered Country B on a 90-day visa. That visa was extended on one occasion, but thereafter the Mother and children were over-stayers. As explained by the Children&#8217;s Guardian when she gave her oral evidence, the children were &#8220;stuck. Stranded and not able to access school, health or social opportunities. This was the children&#8217;s lived experience and the context within which they were raised&#8221;. The Guardian described the impact on the Mother and children as considerable. The children were just 4 years old, 2 years old and 16 months old when they were abandoned by their father in Country B. In his judgment, Judge Rogers described the impact on the Mother and children of the abandonment in the following way: </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.14in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;I am satisfied, as will be plain from my findings, that the mother's continued presence in Country B is against her will and has been caused by the circumstances I have described and brought about, in part, if not in whole, by the father. Her freedom of movement as an overstayer is now limited. She is not, I find, &#8220;literally a prisoner in her own home&#8221;, as perhaps her father had sought to suggest, but on her own evidence, which I accept, she really does not go out; she is in fear of apprehension. Her circle is very limited to the immediate family in the flat, which although spacious is plainly overcrowded, but neither she nor the children have any real sense of social integration. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.14in;text-indent:0in"> The children are not in full-time education; they are not receiving proper tutoring, merely informal assistance from their mother. They have no access to proper healthcare. Although that is not an issue since their health is good, it remains, nevertheless, an important deficit. There is no real element of social interaction. There is no evidence of frequently going out and visiting and participation in activities, and there is no evidence and I find little financial stability for the mother or the children. They are, I suspect and I find on the evidence, highly dependent upon charitable help from the family. The mother has, I am satisfied, an online and social media profile, but that, if anything, reinforces the point of isolation rather than proving integration.&#8221;  </p>

He determined the allegations of domestic abuse made against the Father and the dispute concerning how the children came to be stranded in Country B. The Father had filed 2 detailed statements and was represented by counsel at that hearing, as was the Mother. It was the Father&#8217;s case that the Mother had chosen to stay in Country B and had then prevented him from having contact with the children. The findings made by the Judge concerning domestic abuse were as follows: </p>

But it goes beyond that and I make a positive finding: I reject his denial. He had every incentive, I find, to retain the documents. His goal in that regard was to create difficulty for her and therefore to isolate her; it made sense. If he had her passport then she would be stuck. If he had the children's passports, although the plans themselves had not yet been formed, there would, in his view, no doubt come a time when he could facilitate their travel to the United Kingdom without the mother, particularly if by then she had had to leave Country B, most probably to go to Country C. His swift departure is also, in my judgment, significant. He said that there were a range of reasons, partly practical, partly financial and partly to avoid himself being stuck in Country B, but overwhelmingly I find his departure was a response to the family breakdown and his desire to isolate and weaken his wife and children's position. It is, I am sorry to say, demonstrative of a selfish outlook. He may have had his own practical and financial reasons, but he appears to have paid little regard to the consequences for the others. It was, in the heightened emotional circumstances of that time, also a punishment for her attempts to rebuild her quality time with her own family.&#8221; </p>

Since then, there have been a number of case management hearings, at which a nonmolestation order was made and a money judgment given due to the Father&#8217;s failure to pay the costs associated with the return of the children; costs that Judge Rogers had ordered that he meet.

He seeks an order that he spends time with the children and does so directly, and in-person, rather than by any indirect means. He also seeks the return of his passport that is retained by the Tipstaff. The Father rejects all the findings made against him by Judge Rodgers. He continues to assert that the Mother chose to remain in Country B, an explanation rejected by Judge Rodgers. He denies stranding the Mother and children and he denies that he was ever a perpetrator of domestic abuse. In his position statement filed for this hearing, he accuses the Guardian of bias against him and says &#8220;CAFCASS and the Court have fundamentally failed the children and the father with primarily failing to acknowledge the parental alienation committed by the applicant mother especially since 2016.&#8221; </p>

She opposes the return of the Father&#8217;s passport as she believes, were he to have it, that he would be likely to attempt the abduction of the children. The Mother now agrees some limited indirect contact by way of letters and cards at a frequency of one letter from the father every 2 months, with the children being encouraged (not required) to reply in the intervening month.  </p>

I raised this with Mr Jubb at the commencement of the case and gave him time to have discussions with his client. I was then informed the Mother was not opposed to the Father asking direct questions of her. I asked the father to outline the issues he wished to raise with the mother so that their relevance to the matters I have to decide could be established. I did not require the Father to set out his questions, as I took the view that requiring him to set out his cross-examination in advance would be putting him at a disadvantage as the same had not been required of the Mother. When the Father described the issues he wanted to raise, Mr Jubb had no objection to those matters being put to his client directly by the father. </p>

The Father was able to ask relevant follow-up questions without causing upset or distress. Indeed, the Mother only became visibly distressed in response to a question I asked concerning the effect on the children of being unable to leave Country B. </p>

However, it was far from an ideal situation. Advanced planning for how an unrepresented party is to put his or her case to the alleged victim of their behaviour is always necessary. It will be all the more necessary once the provisions of the Domestic Abuse Bill currently before Parliament come into force and the cross-examination of a victim in circumstances such as these is prohibited. </p>

Both the statement and position statement he filed for this hearing very much concentrate on his rejection of the findings and his case that the mother has alienated the children from him. In his questioning of the Guardian, and in the questions he raised of the Mother, the Father sought to put his case from the perspective of the findings being wrong. It was necessary to bring the Father back to focus on what he says should happen within the context of the findings having not been appealed or otherwise disturbed. Within that focus, he was told he would be permitted to ask whatever questions he thought necessary of the Guardian, and of the Mother as refined by me. However, the Father regularly strayed into asking questions on matters that were addressed by the fact-finding judgment.  </p>

The Mother was represented before HHJ Rogers by Mr Jubb, who also represented her before me. Due to various connectivity issues and the need for the Mother to collect the children from school, who would then have been in the house and able to hear the proceedings, it was necessary to finish early at the end of the first day. The shorter day resulted in only the evidence of the Guardian being completed.  Before we started hearing evidence on the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> day of this hearing, I invited representations from all parties. Mr Jubb and Mr Osborne did not object to the court treating the Father as having made an application for the findings of HHJ Rogers to be reviewed and considering whether, or not, stage 1 of the &#8216;test&#8217; for such a review was met. Although this was a slightly unusual procedure, the hearing continued with the father advancing his case that the findings made by Judge Rogers should be reviewed, alongside his case that he should be granted direct time with his children within a Child Contact Intervention program [CCIP]. In truth, it was impossible for the Father to separate his views concerning the findings made against him from his case that he should be granted direct time with the children. </p>

Although his focus remained on the inaccuracy of the findings and his allegation that the mother had alienated the children, he gave his evidence clearly and forcefully but he politely pressed his points and clearly communicated his desire to have direct contact with his children. </p>

The 3 documents, 2 of which contain an acceptable version of a statement of truth, provide descriptions of a happy family home and each of the 3 authors making complementary remarks about the care the Father provided to the children and his efforts with both cooking and cleaning within the home. 2 of the authors state explicitly that they saw or heard no arguments or otherwise negative behaviour by the Father. The Father submits that these statements demonstrate that the findings of domestic abuse are wrong. In his written submissions, the Father does not explain why these witnesses were not relied upon before HHJ Rodgers. </p>

But she makes the point with clarity, and Mr Jubb reinforces that, by saying &#8220;Why on earth would she go to [Country C] without her children? It was an unrealistic prospect for her&#8221;.

It is also clear from the conversation that the Father was refusing to assist the Mother&#8217;s return to England. In my judgment there has been no material change in the evidence before me on this issue to that before HHJ Rogers. Further, I do not accept the Father&#8217;s submission that the Mother accepting she had a valid UK visa in her expired Country C passport is anything new. Indeed, at paragraph 41 of his judgment, Judge Rogers says &#8220;the key question then arises: where were the passports, the relevant passport with the mother&#8217;s crucial visa and the travel documentation?&#8221;. I therefore reject the Father&#8217;s submission that the Mother&#8217;s acceptance in her evidence before me, that she had a valid UK visa in an expired Country passport that was retained by the father, demonstrates that the Mother wilfully chose to remain in Country B with the children. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.14in;text-indent:0.12in">It is also clear from his judgment that Judge Rogers knew there had been some communications between the Mother and the Father. As I have set out above, he quoted extensively from a transcript of one such conversation. Judge Rogers also referred to conversations that had occurred between different sides of the family. At paragraph 33 of his judgment he says  &#8220;all of these problems and these minor tensions led to the various attempts at counselling and mediation which were described, and it appears that both the parents and, perhaps more significantly, the wider families were involved. Again, it is unnecessary to deconstruct the precise detail of exactly when this occurred and what the advice of the sheikh was on any particular occasion. The overall impression I have, and I am satisfied, is that the father was prepared to enter into mediation but that compromise would mean substantively, if not entirely, accepting his terms.&#8221; In my judgment the father is quite wrong to describe the Mother as now making admissions on matters that were not known to Judge Rogers. It is clear from my reading of the judgment, and the bundle, that Judge Rogers was well aware of the issues raised by the father and he addressed them in his judgment. These are not new issues that justify a revisiting of the findings made. </p>

I asked him to produce a copy of that letter. The letter he provided is the same as the letter found at page C310 of the bundle. It is a letter dated 21 August 2019 and it does not record the Mother as having refused to engage in mediation. All the letter records is the Father having contacted Reunite in November 2017 and receiving advice regarding the international movement of children. As set out in the paragraph above, Judge Rogers knew there were attempts to mediate and formed his own view about the father&#8217;s approach to that. The letter from Reunite adds nothing and the Father&#8217;s initial description of the letter as being evidence of the Mother rejecting his attempt to mediate was inaccurate. </p>

It may well be that the Mother published her views in the knowledge that they would be seen by the Father but that does not in any way serve to cast doubt on the reliability of the findings made by HHJ Rogers. On the basis of the findings made, the Mother had cause to complain about the behaviour of the father. That she chose to publish her complaints online where they could be seen by others was, in my judgment, a matter entirely for her and is no indication of dishonesty.  </p>

The authors of those documents describe seeing a happy home and a committed father. These are witnesses that could have been called at the hearing before HHJ Rogers. The Judge heard evidence and argument over 4 days. The Father was represented and had the opportunity to call evidence. He did not explain in his written closing submissions why these witnesses were not called then. The documents are brief and in no way exclude domestic abuse having occurred out of sight or hearing of the authors of the documents. In my judgment the evidence contained within them is not a solid ground for challenging the accuracy of the findings. </p>

I have carefully considered the arguments raised by the Father but find that all the issues he now raises were before Judge Rogers who provided a careful and well-reasoned judgment. The Father has raised nothing new, save for the 3 documents from his witnesses that do not prove that there was no opportunity for him to perpetrate domestic abuse. The Father&#8217;s application falls far short of establishing solid grounds for believing that a rehearing will result in different findings. I dismiss his application. </p>

She said the impact on the children had been considerable and resulted in them being raised outside of the UK, denied education, denied healthcare and the general everyday social interactions of children. She said the recommendation in her report is for him to engage with a DAPP program to address abusive behaviours. It was the Guardian&#8217;s evidence that the workers at CCI are not experts in the assessment of risk that arise from domestic abuse. The Guardian told me that the CCI program supports a reintroduction of contact but that would be the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> stage for re-establishing a relationship between these children and this father.

She told me that if the Father did not attend a DAPP course and learn to change his behaviours, the children were at risk of emotional harm as they would receive a confusing narrative as the Father is entirely blaming of the mother and rejecting of the court&#8217;s findings. She said the children would need an explanation for this period in their lives and any narrative provided by their mother would be undermined by the Father. The Guardian was of the opinion that the Father is undermining of the Mother&#8217;s parenting and any negative comments made by him would be emotionally harmful and confusing for the children. The Guardian accepted that the risk of physical abuse is addressed by supervision of contact but she did not accept that supervision could protect the Mother&#8217;s home from being discovered by the Father if he chose to follow her after contact sessions. The Guardian accepted that the risk of abduction could be addressed by court orders and also by the supervision of contact. However, the Guardian observed that private supervision of contact, outside a CCI program, is very expensive and beyond the means of this family, certainly for any extended period of time. </p>

The beating with a wire that the Father perpetrated on the Mother when one child was a baby occurred in 2012. Judge Rogers accepted the Mother&#8217;s evidence of F&#8217;s use of violence during the relationship by slapping her around the face. I agree with the Guardian&#8217;s view that the Court must assess the history of violence as having extended over an 8-year period, although the findings of Judge Rogers have the more serious incidents occurring at the beginning of that period.  </p>

As explained by the Guardian, the children appear to have no memory or knowledge of the violence that took place, so this is not a case where a child&#8217;s memories and fear of violence within the home are additional features that require interventions. The mother&#8217;s fears for herself and for the children are, on the findings of Judge Rogers, entirely justified but she says she is supportive of contact if she and the children can be safe. </p>

This has been described as a &#8220;family feud&#8221;. That is dramatic language but is broadly accurate. It was not strictly a feud so much as a clash of social mores; some of it was cultural, some of it was religious with very different interpretations of Islamic tenets. It is no part of my task to form a value judgment on such matters, or crudely characterise either side as in the right or in the wrong. What, however, is clear is that there were very different interpretations of the dynamics of a married couple's relationship and, in particular, the authority of the husband.  </p>

It is the effect on the children, directly and via the effect on the mother, that any arrangements made for the children must protect against until such time the risk presented by this history is assessed as having reduced to a level that can be managed. There was no hint of remorse by the Father, in his written or oral evidence, for the harm caused to the children by his stranding of them. Indeed, in his oral evidence he accused the mother of torturing him. He does not accept that he has done anything wrong. He blames the Mother entirely for his lack of contact with the children. What was clear from his evidence is that he believes himself to be right and the Mother to be entirely wrong. It is within this context that I must apply the provisions of PD12J and consider the guidance given by the authorities relied upon by the Father. </p>

Given their age, their expressed wishes are informative, and to be taken into account, but not decisive. They have said that they do not want to see or speak to their father as he &#8220;had left them&#8221; but they did not express significantly negative views of the father. I agree with the opinion of the Guardian that the absence of strong negative views being expressed by the children, and one saying she loves her father, indicates that the mother has not sought to influence them. One of the key indicators of the possible alienation of a child by the parent with whom they are living is the expression by the child of very strong negative views against the non-resident parent. An alienated child will often see the resident parent as all good and the non-resident parent as all bad, because the resident parent gives negative information to the child to manipulate the child&#8217;s feelings about the non-resident parent, with the intention of encouraging the child to reject any contact. That is not what the Guardian found when she met with the children. </p>

Unfortunately, in his oral evidence, the Father refused to accept indirect contact by way of written correspondence as appropriate. This rejection demonstrates the Father&#8217;s inability to put himself in the position of the children and think how they might be feeling. They are questioning why he left them behind. They have not seen him for 4 years. The Guardian says in her report &#8220;stranding of children can leave them with feelings of abandonment and the children may need to make sense of their experiences&#8221;. In such circumstances, the Father&#8217;s belief that he can walk back into the lives of his children without providing a truthful explanation for what has occurred is entirely unrealistic.

In her report, the Guardian explains &#8220;In requesting a referral to a CCI program, he does recognize his relationship would need to be gradually re-built with the children as L and M particularly will have no direct memories of or relationship with their father. For a CCI to be recommended, it is necessary for any outstanding risks to have been addressed and for there to be a safe plan as to how contact can progress upon completion of the intervention. As discussed, I am not of the view that is the case. I recommend the father would need to engage fully with a DAPP, after which, if successfully completed, consideration would be given to whether a CCI would assist with re-establishing the children&#8217;s relationships with their father. Unfortunately, the Father has not yet reached a level of acceptance and taken responsibility for his behaviour and how it has impacted upon the children and the Mother, for a referral for a DAPP to be indicated.&#8221; </p>

It was the Guardian&#8217;s evidence that, in the absence of the successful completion of a DAPP, contact could not &#8216;move on&#8217; so it would be wrong to start a CCI.

In my judgment, a CCI is to be used once the Court has decided that direct contact should take place and is not an alternative to an intervention aimed at reducing the risk posed by an abusive parent. </p>

The particular characteristics that arise on the circumstances of this case, that require special attention over and above those of any child, is the need to achieve stability. The Mother was, on the finding of Judge Rogers, deliberately isolated by the actions of the Father when living in England before 2016. As described by the Guardian in her report, the Mother has no family in England and has not made contact with previous acquaintances for fear that the Father would then discover her location. The sources of support to the Mother are extremely limited. When the Guardian spoke to the children, one spoke of making friends but the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has restricted the ability of the Mother and children to make community connections via the children&#8217;s school as the Mother and children arrived in England just as &#8216;lock-down; was imposed in March 2020. The children have missed a considerable amount of school and the Guardian describes the need for them to settle into school as a priority. It is also the opinion of the Guardian that 2 of the children may require some additional support to settle within the structure of formal education. </p>

This lack of stability of the children, when seen in the context of the 4 years they were stranded in Country B does, in my judgment, increase the need for the court to be satisfied that any changes in circumstances for the children will not threaten the development of stability that is still very much in a fledgling stage. </p>

His blaming attitude towards the Mother risks causing further harm as he is, in my assessment of him, highly unlikely to promote a positive image of the mother to the children. There is a significant risk that he will seek to enforce his own narrative with the children, will tell them that he has done nothing wrong and that it is the mother who is at fault.

They would be enriched by knowing the paternal side of the Family and the advice and experience that I am sure would be available to them from exposure to that side of their family. I take the view that it is important that children be given the opportunity to form their own views of the parent they do not live with, however flawed the parent may be, and not be reliant on the reports of others but all these benefits of contact can only occur if the advantages to the children of direct contact outweigh the disadvantages.  </p>

In my judgment, the Father&#8217;s exploitation of the vulnerability of the mother led to the Father disregarding completely the most basic needs of his children and him doing so for an astonishingly long period of time. That abdication of his responsibility as a father, when taken with his blaming attitude toward the mother, leads me to conclude that until the Father has recognised the harm that he has caused to the children and demonstrated that he understands the importance of not undermining the mother when in the presence of the children, there is a significant risk of emotional harm being caused to the children were the Father to have direct contact with them. </p>

I also have firmly in mind the warning given by Macur LJ in Re M that I must not regard the Father's &#8220;aspiration for a less restricted contact regime to be destructive of the implementation of a heavily circumscribed regime if the acknowledged benefits of contact for these children can be achieved whilst assuring the mother's safety and emotional stability&#8221;.  </p>

Requiring the children to attend for direct contract with the Father will, in my judgment, place them at a direct risk of emotional harm as the Father is very likely to seek to persuade them that he is right and the Mother is wrong. His abandonment of the children demonstrates his willingness to take extremely harmful action to impose his will.

It is not at all unusual for parents to continue to deny allegations made against them and to continue their denials even after a court has made findings. It is within my experience of public law cases, where findings have been made against a parent that they have injured a child, possible for a risk assessment to be undertaken without an admission by a parent being a precondition for success. It seems to me possible for a parent to recognise that he has caused harm to his children even though he cannot bring himself to admit it openly. It might then be possible for a parent to modify his behaviour sufficiently for the risks posed by direct contact to reduce to a manageable level. </p>

The decision I have reached is based on the Father as he presents now. The Mother accepts the Father had a good relationship with the children prior to the events of 2016 and, were he to present differently in the future, for example after having completed an intervention that addresses the abusive behaviours that Judge Rogers found him to have committed and an intervention that modifies the views about the mother that he expressed before me, a different assessment of the risks and benefits of contact may be made. </p>

In his oral evidence his focus was on what he said was the injustice of his situation and, as I have described, he was unable to show empathy for his children&#8217;s circumstances. Although I did not form the impression that the Father pursued contact to continue a form of domestic abuse against the mother, his lack of attention to the needs of the children and his unwillingness to reflect has led me to conclude that he is motivated more by the need to win the fight than he is by a desire to communicate with his children.

I accept the evidence of the Guardian that the consequences of such behaviour on these children outweighs the benefits. They are achieving some stability but still have some way to go and the introduction of the Father at this time risks undermining that process and causing them not just confusion but also distress if the Father seeks, as I find likely, to undermine the Mother, upon who they rely to meet all of their needs. The risk is not just of temporary disruption that will then pass as the children get accustomed to the arrangements, as described by King LJ in  Re S, but of a continuing and longterm risk of repeated occasions of emotional harm and until such time that the Father&#8217;s attitudes have been shown to have changed, the likelihood of emotional harm during contact visits will remain. </p>

He can attempt to demonstrate these changes by reflecting on his past behaviours and attending a DAPP program. It was the evidence of the Guardian that until the Father is able to accept some of his past behaviours as found by Judge Rogers, he will not be accepted onto a DAPP program. There is no other program available to CAFCASS that can work with the Father. The work required is not simply assessment. The Father needs to change his attitudes towards the Mother and demonstrate that he recognises the harm his previous behaviours have caused so that they are not repeated. There is no intervention put before the Court as a suitable alternative to a DAPP program. </p>
