	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This matter concerns the mother&#8217;s application under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985</ref> (incorporating, by Schedule 1, the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction; the &#8216;1980 Hague Convention&#8217;) for the return of two children, X age 8 and Y age 3, to the USA. That application is opposed by the father, who defends the application on the basis that the children were not habitually resident in the USA at the time of their removal from the USA on 5 May 2022. If he is wrong about that, the father relies on the defence of grave risk of harm under Article 13 (b), including the inadequacy of the protective measures offered by the mother.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother has also issued proceedings under the inherent jurisdiction seeking an order for the children&#8217;s return. The mother accepts this hearing is listed to determine the 1980 Hague application. In the event that is unsuccessful, directions will need to be made on the application under the inherent jurisdiction.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is the mother&#8217;s case that this is a clear case of child abduction and a separation of the children from their primary carer. It is not  in dispute that the father unilaterally removed the children from the USA on 5 May 2022 during a pre-arranged visit that was due to last a day, with them being returned to their mother&#8217;s care that evening. Unbeknown to the mother, the father boarded a plane with the children and brought them to the UK, where they remain. The father says he took that action as he was so concerned for the children&#8217;s welfare as a result of what he alleges is the mother&#8217;s emotionally and physically abusive care towards the children. In the email to the mother on 5 May 2022 informing her of what he had done he describes the trip to the UK as a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;visit&#8217; </span>to their grandparents and invited the mother to join them. The children have remained with the father in the UK.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother remained in the USA until last weekend, when she came over for this hearing. At the pre-trial review last week arrangements were put in place to enable the mother to spend significant unsupervised time with the children in their home. That is the first time she has spent time with them since May 2022, although she has had indirect video contact with the children.</p>

After the children had been brought to the UK the parties agreed to arbitrate with the Bais HaVaad Rabbinical Court (&#8216;Bais HaVaad&#8217;) in the USA. The Bais HaVaad made a number of determinations in May and June 2022 which, for various reasons, were not fully complied with.</p>

That hearing was adjourned on 15 December 2022 to enable a joint instruction of a child and adolescent psychiatrist to prepare a report in relation to both parents mental health and expert evidence regarding the immigration position of the father in the USA.</p>

The court is grateful to Ms Renton and Mr Gration K.C. on behalf of the parents for their very full written skeleton arguments and focussed oral submissions. There is no significant issue regarding the legal framework. The court has had the opportunity of reading the extensive trial bundle, now exceeding 1,100 pages.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before turning to consider the background, I want to take this opportunity to remind practitioners of the General Guidance on electronic court bundles dated 29 November 2021, which applies to these cases. Paragraph 2 specifically provides that the numbering should start at page 1 for the first page of the bundle (whether or not that is part of an index). This is for the very obvious reason so that the pagination matches the pdf numbering. That did not happen in this case, with the result that each page reference during the hearing required two page number references, which was frustrating for the court and counsel. It simply should not happen. This Guidance has been in place for over a year and compliance with it should now be standard practice.</p>

Following their initial stay with her sister and a period in other short term accommodation they rented a property on 25 October 2021 until 9 December 2021. They left that property then to travel to New York connected to work the father may be able to secure. In any event, the mother stated there were plumbing difficulties in the flat they had rented. Between 9 December and 16 February 2022 they were either travelling to and from New York or staying with friends or longer periods in short term accommodation in New York or New Jersey arranged through the Jewish community (&#8216;chesed&#8217; apartments). On 16 February 2022 they rented a house in New Jersey until 30 June 2022, which they would have remained living in had the father not unilaterally removed the children on 5 May 2022. Even during the periods they were in rented accommodation they went to stay with friends for periods of 2 &#8211; 3 days. What the mother describes is reflected in what X said to Ms Julian in November 2022 when she reports X saying <span style="font-style:italic">&#8217;they moved from her cousin&#8217;s house to a flat and then to a house in &#8216;Piccadilly Drive&#8217;.

He submits when you look at the emails around the time of the mother&#8217;s departure this was not a pre-planned trip, the children did not take all their possessions and the emails demonstrate the development of the mother&#8217;s thinking and approach culminating in her email to her father in law on 3 October 2021, copying in the father, when she stated she was not returning to the UK. Mr Gration submits why the father did not engage in what the mother says he because he was committed to the Jewish religious ethical principle of <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;Shalom bayis&#8217; </span>(peace in the house). Mr Gration submits this resulted in the mother putting increasing pressure on the father to take steps, such as selling the property in the UK.

There was no settled intention as a permanent or even a semi-permanent basis, it remained, Mr Gration submits, still up in the air when the father removed the children. Mr Gration relies heavily on how the lack of planning is played out by the number of moves the family made in the USA. The father submits there were 28 moves over the 9 month period. The children did not have a settled home with their things, there was never the move of their possessions from the UK. Apart from the fact the children were in their care of their mother the children&#8217;s lives during this period did not have the other stabilising factors such as school, their belongings and consistency that would aid their integration.</p>

The father&#8217;s evidence is that since her return X has had no difficulty in eating, either in the home or at school. Mr Gration stated it was revealing when the mother informed Ms Julian in November 2022 that she considered a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;multidisciplinary feeding assessment and olfactory testing&#8217;</span> was required. That reveals, he submits, no recognition by the mother of improvements X has made. This raises a real risk of what the mother will do once X is back in her care, and what the impact on X will be. As regards X&#8217;s education, Mr Gration submits the mother&#8217;s actions in home schooling have harmed the children, in particular X, as evidenced by the reports of the measures that have had to be taken by the school.</p>

It is of note that this is how it was viewed by X in her meeting with Ms Julian. Ms Renton does not suggest there was a clear plan when they left, other than the shared goal to leave the UK for a period of time and evaluate the options.

The local authority assessments and decisions to close the case on three occasions is revealing. The last assessment in August 2021 confirms the strong relationship the children have with the mother and the other positive welfare matters referred to in the report. The concerns the father now relies upon regarding the mother&#8217;s care were not seriously voiced by him previously, he sent the email to the school in January 2020, he agreed to the children spending periods of time in the USA in the sole care of their mother and in May 2022 he invited the mother to come and join them after he removed the children to the UK. None of this, she submits, is consistent with a parent who considers that the mother will cause the children a grave risk of exposing the children of psychological harm or place them in an intolerable situation. Most recently, the mother arrived from the USA last weekend and has had extensive unsupervised time with the children with no issues being raised. In any event, the protective measures proposed will ameliorate any risk the court may find that exists.</p>

Whilst it is right their belongings from the UK were not shipped over to the USA and their property in the UK was not put on the market for sale, those matters were being actively discussed and do not prevent the children, on the facts of this case, being integrated in a social and family environment in the USA.</p>

In this case the children had the continuity of being cared for by their parents, of being home schooled, continuing to be an active part of the local Jewish community and engage with friends and the wider family with their parents.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Standing back to consider the evidence, on the particular facts of this case, I am satisfied that at the time of the children&#8217;s removal on 5 May 2022, the children&#8217;s habitual residence was in the USA. Drawing on the analysis above the reasons for that conclusion can be summarised as follows:</p>

It became clear after the return tickets were converted to travel vouchers that there was no time limit advocated by either parent. The mother&#8217;s position became increasingly clear that she wished to remain in the USA and the father did little, if anything, to challenge that, even though he knew the mother&#8217;s position.</p>

Whilst it is right there were some moves, X&#8217;s perception as described to Ms Julian is right. Whilst it did involve changes for X as she describes regarding the loss of friends when they moved, when looked at in the context of the other evidence that did not detract from the qualitative stability of the children&#8217;s residence in the widest sense.</p>

The issues he raises now were not raised by him at the time, including at the time of the children&#8217;s removal. Ms Renton submits it is the father who has behaved in a way that is detrimental to the children since May 2022, in the way he removed them from their primary carer and has refused to properly engage with the mother as a parent who shares parental responsibility for the children since then.</p>

It is also right that each time the local authority undertook investigations following those referrals, they ended up taking no further action and closed the case. The concerns centred on the issues of the parents mental health, X being removed from school and over medicalising issues relating to X&#8217;s eating habits.</p>

The assessment notes the social worker visited the family home and spoke to both parents and saw the children just days before they went to the USA. It is of note that there is no reference in the assessment by either parent of the plans in relation to the USA and there is nothing in the assessment that indicates any decisions about the children&#8217;s care or education were other than joint decisions of the parents.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Those care arrangements for the children continued when they went to the USA, with the father remaining an active part of the family household during that time. At no stage did the father raise issues or concerns about the care or arrangements for the children. He only did so in the context of his statements filed in these proceedings or in the context of the parents&#8217; engagement with the Bais HaVaad, when their relationship had broken down and after he had unilaterally removed the children from the mother&#8217;s care. It is important to bare this context in mind when considering the way the father puts the basis of the risk of grave harm.</p>

X had been out of school since January 2020, the parents had looked at and considered schooling option in the USA and so X&#8217;s position needs to be considered in that wider context. Whilst it is clear that additional support has been required for X, the school reports in glowing terms about X describing her as being <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;absolutely delightful&#8217; </span>in school.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst I recognise there is a risk, bearing in mind the background to this case, I do not characterise it as grave in the situation that exists now and looking forward. The report from Dr Van Velsen confirms the mother does not currently suffer from any mental ill health. Whilst the mother&#8217;s mental ill health had been a part of the father&#8217;s case previously it is now suggested that Dr Van Velsen&#8217;s report now makes the risk more serious as the mother&#8217;s previous actions were not partly attributable to mental ill health. That, in my judgment, fails to give proper weight to Dr Van Velsen&#8217;s conclusions regarding the mother&#8217;s mental health going forward, and the important safeguard that evidence provides and the different circumstances now the parents are separated. The evidence demonstrates that the father was part of the household that made the previous decisions regarding the care of the children which he did not take issue with until after May 2022, when the parties had separated and he needed to justify his unilateral decision to remove the children from their mother&#8217;s care in the way that he did.</p>

The parents had discussed putting X into school in the USA, and that is what is proposed by the mother.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having stood back and considered the evidence, I have reached the conclusion that the father has not established the Article 13 (b) defence. In the circumstances of this case now, and looking forward, I do not consider the return of the children to the USA would result in a grave risk of psychological harm and/or place either child in an intolerable position. The children will be returning to the care of their primary carer. The parties are agreed that the arbitration should continue before the Bais HaVaad, they agree to make a joint referral back to that Beth Din which looks like it will be considered without any significant delay. Since the children have been in the father&#8217;s care, he has shown a disregard of the mother&#8217;s parental responsibility, he has not consulted her or kept her updated about a number of steps he has taken regarding the children as set out in Ms Renton&#8217;s skeleton, including not informing the mother about attendance at meetings regarding X&#8217;s education and not informing the mother about play therapy that has been undertaken. I am satisfied he can spend significant periods of time in the USA, for repeated periods of up to six months, so will effectively be able to engage with the Bais HaVaad and spend time with the children. I recognise he will not be able to work in the USA under his current visa but will have the opportunity to return to the UK for work and/or explore what work options would be open to him in the USA in the longer term.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Even if I am wrong about whether the grave risk of harm threshold has been met, I am entirely satisfied the list of protective measures proposed by the mother are sufficient to ameliorate any risk. There is no evidence on which to base any suggestion the mother will not comply with them. Her reasons for approaching other Rabbinical Courts, she says, are related to the fact that the father has refused to give her a Get. The recent email from Bais HaVaad sets out that they consider they are dealing with all matters. There may be an issue between the parties as to the extent to which the Bais HaVaad deals with non-welfare related matters, but the one thing the parties agree is that the Bais HaVaad is dealing with welfare matters relating to the children, in accordance with the arbitration agreement entered into between the parties on 25 May 2022. The mother&#8217;s protective measures include arrangements in relation to the children&#8217;s school and recognises the need to consult with the father regarding any medical related issues concerning the children.</p>
