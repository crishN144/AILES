	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">This case concerns a number of applications in respect of PBM who is in his midtwenties. PBM has been represented in these proceedings by his litigation friend the Official Solicitor who has instructed David Rees QC for this hearing.  From the outset, PBM expressed considerable concern about the possibility of members of the public being present at this hearing. Unusually, the decision was taken by me, following consultation with counsel, that I should hear the case in private. I intend to publish this Judgment in an anonymised form which will not only remove reference to names but will also remove geographical references (save for the fact that PBM lives in Wales, as that is relevant to the applicable statutory background). I am of the clear view that the very personal and sensitive nature of the material being considered at the hearing made it inappropriate to conduct the hearing in open court and that hearing the matter in open court would have been likely to cause emotional harm to PBM. </p>

PBM requested to meet me prior to the final hearing and, with the agreement of all parties, on 10 October 2018 I met with him.  I made it clear to him (as did the Deputy and his solicitor) that my meeting with him was not in any sense an evidence gathering exercise.  When we met, the Deputy and his solicitor were present throughout.  I felt it important to respond positively to PBM&#8217;s request and he was charming and talkative when we met.  There is an agreed note of our conversation which I have ordered should remain on the court file.  </p>

I excused the need for the LA to attend or to be represented at the hearing, but have received a comprehensive a position statement on behalf of the local authority from their instructed counsel David Hughes, for which the court is grateful.</p>

There has now been a considerable narrowing of issues and it is agreed by all that PBM does have the capacity to marry, to make a will and to enter into a prenuptial agreement. Given the unusual circumstances of this case, it is agreed that I should give a Judgment in respect of these agreed issues, albeit that much of this Judgment will be taken up with the issue as to whether PBM has capacity to make a decision as to whether he should be told about the amount of his estate. I am told by Mr Rees on behalf of PBM, and of course accept, that it is PBM&#8217;s wish that he be told about the extent of his assets. The Deputy does not agree that he should be told. Before I give my Judgment in respect of this discrete, but important issue, I need to set out the background, the legal framework and my concise reasons for agreeing with the decisions that the parties have reached in relation to the other matters. </p>

Among PBM&#8217;s difficulties, he sustained muscular and ligament problems resulting in a number of orthopaedic surgeries. PBM has been in and out of a wheelchair due to the impact of surgery on his lower limbs.  PBM received a significant compensation award from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (&#8220;CICA&#8221;) in respect of these injuries and this is managed for him by his Property and Affairs Deputy. PBM is described as having coexisting mild/moderate learning difficulties; he has an autistic spectrum disorder (Asperger&#8217;s) and epilepsy.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">In order to substantiate PBM&#8217;s claim to the CICA, a number of expert medical reports were obtained. The conclusion that was reached was that PBM would, on attaining 18, lack capacity to litigate and to conduct his own affairs. PBM was described as being impulsive in his thoughts and actions which had implications in respect of safety awareness in the management of even small amounts of money. One report found that PBM could be emotional and behaviourally reactive if he did not get his own way. The author felt that PBM lacked any form of inhibitory control.  </p>

However, on 24 May 2018, following an application by the Deputy, the court made an interim declaration that PBM lacked capacity to marry and consequent thereto a caveat has been entered by the Deputy under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76/section/29/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 29(1)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Marriage Act 1949</ref>. This had the consequence of preventing PBM from marrying. I am aware from all that I have read and heard that PBM was upset by this step taken by the Deputy. Whilst I understand and sympathise with PBM in this regard, I am not in any doubt that the Deputy was correct in making the application.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">PBM did not give evidence at the hearing and nobody suggested that he should. He did, however, prepare a statement dated 15 January 2019 which everyone agrees was prepared by him and is set out in his own words. Although not evidence in a formal sense, the letter is significant in assisting me to understand PBM&#8217;s wishes and feelings and I direct that a copy of it should remain on the court file. In his statement, PBM describes that he lives in his house with his partner MVA. He says that they have a number of dogs &#8220;that bring joy to every day&#8221;. He says that he and MVA are in a stable relationship, &#8220;and all we want to do is to be able to build our future together without anyone having to tell us yes or no. I want to purchase a house with land and be able to build a business of our own, make our own money and to be able to make it a home as a married couple.&#8221; PBM describes in his letter that MVA is &#8220;the one constant support I have every day she is there we support each other&#8221;. He, not unreasonably, observes, &#8220;everyone deserves to be happy and just because I have a brain injury that doesn&#8217;t make me any less of a person as I deserve to be happy and be able to make the decision to marry the woman I love and want a future with&#8221;.  </p>

In fact, by agreement, his Deputy is to remain in place and I shall continue the declaration that PBM lacks capacity to manage his property and affairs. I made it clear in court, and repeat here, that this does not mean that such a declaration is there for all time and in due course PBM may very well make an application to the court for the discharge of his Deputy. I am satisfied, for reasons which I shall expand upon below, that the time has not yet been reached when this should happen.  </p>

I am a guy in a relationship just wanting independence and to be able to make the choices I want without people telling me I can or I can&#8217;t. I&#8217;m doing something right as my care used to be 24/7 however it has been reduced by loads. I made the choice to purchase a house and dogs and move with my partner. I make day-to-day decisions by myself along with MVA because as a couple there are things to decide together.&#8221; Movingly, PBM ends his statement with these words: &#8220;I just want to be happy and not live like this anymore.

Her statement was uncontroversial and therefore she did not need to give oral evidence. The Deputy explained that the package of care for PBM is presently, on average, 40 day hours per week staff are on hand to provide PBM with information so that he can make informed decisions, to prompt him with household tasks, to support and address any concerns with the case manager, to transport him to appointments as required and to carry out various repairs as required.  </p>

The Deputy notes that, although the support plan has not changed much in the past six years, the way that it is delivered has changed since MVA moved in. The Deputy believes that it is now more difficult to engage PBM in the domestic elements of the house work, which PBM now regards as MVA&#8217;s domain.  </p>

She refers to occasional problems with his memory. She also says that at times PBM can display verbal aggression, mainly when request for money cannot be honoured. There was an episode in about October 2018 when there were increased requests for money. It is clear that there was an occasion when PBM was taken advantage of by another man and lost some money as a consequence. It is understood that this male has criminal convictions and had allegedly acted towards MVA and PBM in a threatening manner.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">The episode involving money being requested by PBM and passed on to a person that was taking advantage of him demonstrates that the current situation is working, in that it quickly became clear to the Deputy that things were not right. PBM himself says, and I accept, that he has learned from the episode and will be more cautious in the future. I also note that other people have also been conned by this male and, as Dr Layton himself said, it is important to distinguish between people who are vulnerable and people who have a disability. Just because PBM was conned is not necessarily evidence of his inability to manage his affairs. However, as set out above, there is no suggestion currently that the Deputyship should end.  </p>

I shall deal with that shortly, but it is obviously desirable (from the prenuptial agreement perspective) that he should know. I make it clear that this is not a reason for him to know or not since the test that I have to apply in relation to that issue is the test of capacity already set out above. However, it is hard to envisage how the disclosure consistent with a successful prenuptial agreement could take place without PBM knowing about the extent of his estate. </p>

It is, in my judgement, inevitable that when MVA seeks legal advice, as she must, in respect of the prenuptial agreement, those advising her are going to want to know how much PBM is worth. Whilst I am not saying that would be impossible to have an effective prenuptial agreement without disclosure, it is clear, at least on the present state of the law, that full and frank financial disclosure is regarded as one of the key building blocks of a successful prenuptial agreement.  In this regard I do not agree with the statement contained in paragraph 34 of Ms Fottrell&#8217;s written submissions that &#8220;it is common ground and established law that PBM cannot enter into a PNA if he cannot disclose his assets to MVA&#8221;.  I would not go so far as to say that it would be impossible to have a valid prenuptial agreement without disclosure but certainly I agree that disclosure is generally regarded as being necessary.  In discussion in court, Ms Fottrell accepted that she may have over stated things, but we are all agreed that, in a perfect world, full disclosure would form part of the negotiations necessary to a binding prenuptial agreement.  </p>

The Official Solicitor submits, and I accept, that PBM&#8217;s discussions with Dr Layton clearly evidence his ability to understand, retain, use and weigh the information relevant to this decision, and there is clearly a recognition on PBM&#8217;s part for a need for professional support in making such a decision. I therefore declare that PBM has capacity to enter into a prenuptial agreement. I accept the Official Solicitor&#8217;s submission that there is nothing inconsistent in saying that PBM has capacity to make a decision about a prenuptial agreement but yet may lack capacity to manage his property and affairs generally on an ongoing basis.  Understanding and negotiating (with advice) and entering in to a pre nuptial agreement is a one off event, albeit that the effect of the contract negotiated is always binding.

The narrative description of PBM&#8217;s discussions with Dr Layton on this issue clearly demonstrate that PBM has the ability to understand, retain, use and weigh the information relevant to the decision.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">Mr Rees asks me to go further still: he submits that where a person has capacity to take a decision and wishes to make that decision, that person must be entitled to any information belonging to them which they require to make that decision. I am not prepared to go so far as to say that Foskett J was wrong, nor am I prepared to say that I disagree with him. It is not necessary for me to do so for the purposes of this case. I do not accept that a valid prenuptial agreement <span style="font-style:italic">cannot</span> be made without knowledge of the value of one&#8217;s assets. Accordingly, the premise of Mr Rees&#8217;s submission falls away.  I can readily envisage a situation where the judge could decide that somebody has the capacity to enter into a prenuptial agreement but does not have the capacity to know about the extent of their assets. I have already highlighted, above, the obvious disadvantages in this factual state of affairs which is, I suggest, one that we should strive to avoid if at all possible. </p>

However, here we are striving into semantic realms when we do not need to tread.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">In spite of the properly articulated argument on behalf of the Deputy, I have formed the clear conclusion, based on the evidence of Dr Layton as well as everything that I have read, that PBM does have the capacity to be informed about the extent of his assets. It is unnecessary for me to decide whether the test is whether PBM can decide whether he should ask about the extent of his assets or whether he should be told. To me this is bordering on a semantic absurdity. Plainly, the moment one is entitled to know about the extent of one&#8217;s assets one is almost bound to make the enquiry. I do not think that the distinction is one which will burden people in the real world.  </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:-0.01in"><span style="font-style:italic">Although protecting adults from abuse and neglect has been a priority for local authorities for many years, there has never been a legal framework for adult safeguarding. This has led to an unclear picture as to the roles and responsibilities of individuals and organisations working in adult safeguarding. New legislation is needed to provide a clear framework for organisations and to set out their responsibilities for adult safeguarding. 63. The provisions in this part of the Bill will require local authorities to make enquiries, or to ask others to make enquiries, where they reasonably suspect that an adult in their area with care and support needs is at risk of abuse or neglect. The purpose of the enquiry is to establish what, if any, action is required in relation to the case. 64. The Bill also provides for authorised officers of a local authority to apply to the court for an &#8220;adult protection and support order&#8221;. Such an order will confer a power of entry to facilitate practitioners in speaking to an adult suspected of being at risk in private and enable them to ascertain whether that person is making decisions freely</span>. </p>

It says that, where it appears to a local authority that an adult may have needs for care and support, the LA has a duty to assess whether the adult has those needs and, if so, what the needs are. It goes on to say that the assessment is to be focussed on the outcomes the adult wishes to achieve in his or her daily life and the extent to which the provision of care and support contributes to those outcomes. </p>

The assessment records PBM&#8217;s apparent resentment of the care package that he currently has, which he views as unnecessary and, it would seem unduly limiting on him.
