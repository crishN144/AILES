Mr Brown was unable to communicate with F so, despite valiant efforts by the court staff to locate an interpreter, the start of the case was delayed by a whole day. The evidence was completed on 28 April and the advocates made final submissions before me on 7 May. Due to other hearings and holidays I was unable to give judgment until June.</span></p>

The foster carers were approved as long term carers and now felt that they would wish to care for L who had settled with them. The CG balanced the advantages and disadvantages of remaining with his carers against the advantages and disadvantages of adoption. He concluded that L&#8217;s needs would best be met by him remaining with his current carers and he therefore recommended that the care plan be amended to placement with the foster carers with placement for adoption if the carers were not successfully matched with L.</span></p>

She stated that a family finder has been identified for L who would commence family finding if a placement order is granted. She stated : &#8220;Ideally, the LA would try to place L with a family who would reflect his cultural and ethnic needs. In L&#8217;s case the LA would look to see if there were any Polish adopters who may be available. However at the same time, the LA would widen the search to adopters from other Eastern Backgrounds and those who are White British to avoid any delay&#8221;. She continued: &#8230;&#8221;Although other Eastern European countries will differ in many ways to Poland, the focus would be on looking at prospective adopters from this part of the world owing to the greater similarities, in comparison with prospective adopters from other regions.&#8221; Ms Orchard was not called to give evidence, the parties&#8217; preferring to challenge the placement plans through submissions and cross examination of Miss Langley.</span></p>

He had cynically used the second attempt to persuade M that she should abandon her divorce proceedings in Poland and return to him in England. His behaviour was manipulative and cruel, just as it had been when he had kept L&#8217;s passport and tickets when M was desperately trying to leave him and flee to Poland. He thought that she would return for L, and he was of course correct. He also knew that she would remain afraid that he would keep L from her if she tried to leave in the future.</span></p>

Her behaviour in removing A from psychiatric hospital in November 2012 and bringing L and A to the UK  against the advice of the hospital and her parents is a clear example of this. A had been threatening suicide and self harm and was sufficiently ill to have been recently readmitted as a psychiatric inpatient for the fourth time that year. She knew F had recently attempted suicide for the second time in the space of 6 months but decided to give into his emotional blackmail, risking her own safety and the physical and emotional wellbeing of her children. I am not sure how much F influenced this decision, which he describes as a joint decision, but it really was an extraordinarily risky thing to do. I am sure M soon regretted her decision and made several attempts to leave him in 2013, but the traumatic events of that year could have been avoided if she had remained firm in her resolve to separate from F and had remained in Poland where A could be therapeutically treated and L was safe from emotional harm.</span></p>

It is easy to say that the parents were being told very distressing news and that F didn&#8217;t mean for the table he kicked to hit the social worker. It is however completely unacceptable.

Both Miss Langley and Mr Wood held the belief that a Polish court and social services would not be able to effect a transition which would cause the least emotional damage to L. Comparisons with the English Local Authority plan to move him to an adoptive placement or concerns about the Polish foster care system are not relevant to this decision. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-family:Arial">L is a Polish child. He spoke only Polish until about a year ago. His current rejection of Polish culture and language is in my view not in his best interests. His foster carers have not taken him to Saturday Polish school and he has had only his parents&#8217; cultural influence during restricted and limited contact. He is only just 5 years old, and I am sure he would be able to return to his native tongue without too much difficulty. He was able to converse with his grandparents when they visited last year, so I do not agree with the Guardian and the LA that he would suffer harm in being placed in a non English speaking environment. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-family:Arial">Whilst he has formed very clear bonds with his foster carers I am sure that they would assist him to move to another placement, and his parents, particularly his mother, will encourage him to adapt. From what I know of his extended family in Poland I am sure that they too would assist the Polish authorities in making his return to Poland, and decisions about his future life, to take place in the best manner possible. I anticipate that L could return to Poland in the near future and be placed there before the start of the next school year.</span></p>

He will be very unhappy. If L remains in his current circumstances he will lose his Polish identity. His Foster carers have not promoted his Polish culture in any meaningful way, despite the recommendations of the LA and I have little confidence they would do so in the future. His contact with family will not be spontaneous or natural, and is likely to diminish significantly. He will soon be unable to speak Polish. He will not be able to communicate with his parents, his brothers and his extended family without a translator. Those important relationships will effectively be denied to him and in my view that long term loss would be highly damaging to him and contrary to his welfare interests. </span></p>
