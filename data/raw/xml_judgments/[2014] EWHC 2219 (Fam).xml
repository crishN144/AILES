The ladies thought he might have some trapped wind.  They took it in turns to try and settle him.  For a time he slept in a double buggy. While S gave the girls a bath T changed D.  She did so by removing his clothing.  Whilst doing so, and lifting up his right arm, he cried even more, and when she had removed his vest she saw some purple marks on his right shoulder and upper arms.  She called S to look, and they discussed the marks.</p>

Moreover, on the 27 August while D and they were in S&#8217;s house there must have been a lot of anxiety, commotion and discussion between the adults about D&#8217;s unhappiness and marks on him.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">His evidence was highly unsatisfactory.  It was unreliable.  He admitted at specific times lying, and when under pressure was unable to remember many details.  He showed little or no emotion or understanding of the impact upon A to stand accused of causing the injury, of giving evidence in the criminal proceedings, and showed little emotion when considering the injuries and consequences for d.  It may be he had his emotions firmly under control.  However, that would be in stark contrast to his behaviour and anger he displayed on the Monday evening and Tuesday morning.</p>

It may be some of the bruises were sustained that night, but according to the agreed medical evidence it is not impossible, but unlikely that the head injuries were sustained then.  The doctors did not rule out the possibility of more than one incident. They were clear and in agreement that the probability is the serious head injuries were sustained a few hours prior to 8.30am when S noticed D was not right.</p>

The girls were aware of the incident given the noise, if they did not witness it.  In either event it would have been a traumatic incident for them and no doubt frightening.</p>

The fact that he used the drugs frequently and that he suffered stress without their use must have had an impact on his behaviour, his ability to help the family financially and generally on the children if he became stressed.</p>

He displayed no understanding of the effect and impact on A of his denial for the responsibility of the injuries to D, of her being blamed for the injuries and her being interviewed by the police and giving evidence to the Crown Court, during which she was cross-examined by his counsel.</p>

I am critical of him and his behaviour, but I can also see he has good qualities.  He needs to reflect on his own behaviour and how it has and still affects other people, in particular his children.</p>

Their baby brother was very seriously injured, their lives were disrupted by being removed from their mother&#8217;s care, and A was blamed by the father and other family members.  It must have been a traumatic, distressing and confusing time for her and her sisters.</p>
