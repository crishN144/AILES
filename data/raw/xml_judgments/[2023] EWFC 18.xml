	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The adoption application was issued as long ago as 17 February 2021. The delay has been caused by reasons wholly unconnected with the merits of the application. The delay has, understandably, been very frustrating and distressing for the applicants. Ever since X and Y were placed in their care they have remained wholly committed to providing secure and stable care for the children, which the orders they seek will support.</p>

Y&#8217;s father was unable to care for Y and relinquished her care to a family member, who looked after Y until she moved to the applicants care in October 2016, aged six months, with Y&#8217;s father&#8217;s consent. Y&#8217;s father supports this application and remains in contact with the applicants and Y. He cares for Y&#8217;s two half siblings who live with him in Nigeria.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the hearing on 25 January 2022 MacDonald J acceded to the submissions on behalf of the Children&#8217;s Guardian that the correct route to deal with this matter was by way of applications seeking recognition of the adoption orders made in Nigeria pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction and a declaration pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/57" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 57</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref>. MacDonald J granted permission for the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;applications to be amended in the face of the court&#8217;</span> so that they were deemed to be for <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;formal recognition of the adoption orders&#8217;</span> and the order made directions relevant to those deemed applications, including providing for the instruction of an expert to provide evidence of the relevant Nigerian law.

The matter first came before me as an urgent application in February 2022 seeking directions due to difficulties in the LAA authorising the fees to instruct an expert with a view to keeping the hearing listed in March 2022 to remain effective. I made directions on 15 February 2022 and 18 February 2022, which included directing enquiries to be made regarding other experts and for the papers to be disclosed to the Attorney General.</p>

There is the fact, given the declaration I have made, that the applicant is already recognised in English law as being N's mother, but Ms Cronin points to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/51/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 51(4)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref> as permitting the court to make an adoption order in such a case.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">161.&#160;That an adoption order is very much in N's interests, now, for the last few days of her minority, and hereafter throughout her life, is, in my judgment, clearly demonstrated by the materials I have referred to in paragraphs 36-38 above.

Ms Cronin submitted that I should make an adoption order because, by conferring British citizenship on her, N will be assured of her right to go on living with the applicant in this country, thereby giving her security in the full enjoyment of her family life which is not assured merely by recognition of the Indian adoption. As Ms Fottrell put it, an adoption order is necessary to safeguard, now and into the future, the established and central relationship &#8211; legal and factual &#8211; between N and the applicant, her mother. I agree with Ms Cronin and Ms Fottrell.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">162.&#160;In my judgment it is manifestly in N's best interests, now and throughout her life, that I make the adoption order the applicant seeks.&#8221;</span></p>

As a consequence, he submits, there is no hierarchy as to how the court should deal with these applications and rejects any suggestion that in cases where there is a foreign adoption order the court should go down the recognition route first. In this case the applicants can meet the criteria under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref> and, as set out below, there are good reasons why that application should proceed. The submissions made by Mr Wilson are accepted by Mr Haggis, on behalf of the Children&#8217;s Guardian. I agree with Mr Wilson&#8217;s analysis. Each case will turn on its own particular facts as to which route those seeking adoption orders should take, with no priority being given to any one particular route.</p>

For each child he concluded it was his <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;firm recommendation&#8217;</span> that they be adopted by the applicants. That view has been repeated in the updated position statement on his behalf filed for this hearing which includes the following:</p>

The family are well versed in Nigerian culture, having lived there for many years, and continuing to have regular contact. They are thus well placed to maintain these links&#8230;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having considered all the evidence, I am in no doubt that making these adoption orders will meet the lifelong welfare needs of each of these children. The applicants undoubted love and unconditional lifelong commitment to these children shines out from all the reports and has the admiration of the Court. An adoption order will provide security and stability for each of these children which their lifelong welfare needs require.</p>
