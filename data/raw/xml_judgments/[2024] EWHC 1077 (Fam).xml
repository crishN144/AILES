They separated over ten years ago and their relationship has since been acrimonious.  At first Q shared his time between his parents. In 2020 he informed them that he was transgender. His father quickly accepted this but his mother did not. As a result Q&#8217;s relationship with his mother deteriorated and he has been living full time with his father since about 2021.</span></p>

In August 2022 the mother made an application for a prohibited steps order, asking the court to prevent the father from arranging for Q to access treatment for gender dysphoria. In October 2022, and at his mother&#8217;s request, Q agreed to undergo an autism assessment which concluded that he had some limited traits of the condition.  In November 2022 the local authority conducted a single assessment which noted that Q had suffered disruption and trauma because of parental acrimony and gender dysphoria.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In December 2022 Q was seen by his GP who provided a letter for the court saying that Q had gender dysphoria but no clinical evidence of any mental health problems.  The family proceedings were transferred to me.  The mother agreed that Q should join the waiting list for NHS treatment, but she did not agree to his accessing it privately. At that time there was no private clinic in England and Wales which provided assessment and treatment for gender dysphoria but Gender GP, an organisation based offshore was a possibility which Q and the father on his behalf, wished to pursue. In the event the parties agreed on an interim basis that I should make a PSO with respect to private treatment.  That order has remained in place ever since.</span></p>

Q was reluctant, however. The Guardian then proposed that the case should be adjourned for a matter of months for the parents to engage in an Improving Child and Family Arrangements (ICFA) service.  There did seem to be a prospect at that point that the case could be resolved by agreement.</span></p>

The father continued to represent himself.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">It proved to be impossible to find a Consultant Endocrinologist in this country who was prepared to give expert evidence.  An expert in Australia was identified but in the event she did not engage with the process and the direction for expert evidence had to be discharged. In any event Q refused to agree to his medical records being disclosed.  A Consultant Psychiatrist was identified, but Q refused to be assessed by him.  He was reluctant at the start to be asked to engage in an assessment which was not part of an assessment/treatment pathway, and he refused altogether after finding an article online by the expert which led him to believe he could be sceptical about treatment for young people.  That instruction therefore did not go ahead either.</span></p>

She invites the court to adjourn the proceedings until the assessment is complete and for the case to be restored to court for further consideration thereafter.  Following publication of the Cass Review the mother also invites the court to make a declaration that any proposed prescribing of puberty blockers or gender affirming hormones to a person under the age of 18 years of age by a private provider must be subject to the oversight of the court.

This fact should not, however, obscure the very deep differences between the parties. Ultimately the mother objects to Q undergoing undergoing any gender related medical treatment before he is 18 on the basis that she believes that it is still not well understood and that it could cause him harm. She is concerned that Q has been very much affected by what he has read and seen online, by his father&#8217;s attitude towards her and the whole issue, and by having a partner who also identifies as transgender.  In many of the concerns she has been raising about the treatment, her views have been borne out by what has been said by Dr. Hilary Cass in her independent review of gender identity services for children and young people.</span></p>

Clinicians will inevitably take great care before recommending treatment to a child and be astute to ensure that consent obtained from both child and parents is properly informed by the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed course of treatment and in the light of evolving research and understanding of the implications and long-term consequences of such treatment. Great care is needed to ensure that the necessary consents are properly obtained.

But it is for the clinicians to exercise their judgment knowing how important it is that consent is properly obtained according to the particular individual circumstances, as envisaged by Gillick itself, and by reference to developing understanding in this difficult an uncontroversial area. The clinicians are subject to professional regulation and oversight. The parties showed us an example of a Care Quality Commission report in January 2021 critical of GIDS, including in relation to aspects of obtaining consent before referral by Tavistock, which illustrate that. the fact that the report concluded that Tavistock had, in certain respects, fallen short of the expected standard expected in its application of the service specification does not affect the lawfulness of that specification; and it would not entitle a court to take on the task of the clinician in determining whether a child is or is not Gillick competent to be referred on to those Trusts or prescribed puberty blockers by the Trusts</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8221;.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">On behalf of the father, Mr Wilson relies on the provisions of section 8 Family Law Reform Act 1969 which provides that as a young person of 16, Q is entitled to consent to his own medical treatment as long as he has capacity within the meaning of the Mental Capacity Act 2005.  He submits that transgenderism and the concept of a gender identify are recognised and established phenomena which are capable of legal recognition and attract legal protection.  An individual&#8217;s gender identity and freedom to define it, has consistently been held to fall under the protection of Article 8 of the ECHR as a basic essential of the right to self-determination.  It is lawful for a 16 year old to undergo treatment from a private clinic, and his right to do so is particularly important given the fact that there is no realistic prospect of his obtaining support, assessment or treatment through the NHS.  In any event the court has information from Gender Plus as to their assessment process and procedure for determining appropriate treatments which mirror in substantial part the approach of the NHS. The clinicians are professionally regulated and the Hormone Clinic is registered with the CQC. Comprehensive assessments by the local authority and guardian have evidenced no safeguarding or other welfare concerns about Q.</span></p>

She submits that there is no basis upon which the court could reasonably find that a best interests declaration is required in Q&#8217;s case.  Hormone treatment for gender dysphoria does not fall into a special category of treatment; gender dysphoria should not be treated differently from other medical conditions.  In her skeleton argument Ms Favata also deals with a number of criticisms of the Guardian made on behalf of the mother, in particular that the Guardian was elevating Q&#8217;s autonomy above his welfare to a degree that he was being encouraged in his stance of frustrating the court&#8217;s process by refusing to engage with the experts, and that there was insufficient curiosity with respect to Q&#8217;s relationship with another trans child and the effect that this might have upon his views.  The skeleton argument makes a number of serious criticisms of the mother stating that the manner in which the mother had pursued the case was a repeated challenge to Q&#8217;s capacity and competency and had eroded his trust in her.  The mother is criticised for prolonging these proceedings, and also for allowing Q to continue to be untreated for so long.  The skeleton argument concludes by saying this:</span></p>

The Guardian describes the father&#8217;s parenting style as permissive and indulgent, characterised by a relaxed and responsive approach towards Q, sometimes overly accepting and deferring to his wishes.  This can be seen in the father&#8217;s approach in providing Q with a breast binder at 12 or 13 years of age, supporting his wish to social transition at school when he wanted (the mother says without consulting her) and stating that Q&#8217;s wishes as to whether or not he contacts his mother or shares information with her should be followed.  The Guardian also stated that there has been a largely unrestricted flow of information to Q from the father as to the difficulties between the parents.  Q&#8217;s expectation as to his involvement in these proceedings and what can be provided to him in terms of clinical intervention has been high, and managing these expectations (which the Guardian and Q&#8217;s legal team have been trying to do) has not been easy.</span></p>

The differences in the parenting styles in this case has exposed Q to a persistent level of ambiguity.  The overall outcome of all that has been going on is that Q is closely aligned with his father and rejecting of his mother.  Q perceives that the mother is placing barriers in the way of the person that he wishes to be. The mother refers to him by his original, female name and misgenders him.  During the course of these proceedings, Q&#8217;s relationship with his mother has deteriorated so that there is now very little contact between them.</span></p>

When it became apparent that Q would not see the expert the court had appointed I asked the Guardian to provide a further report. I was concerned that I had no evidence at all about the circumstances in which Q was living save that he was in a relationship with the child of his father&#8217;s partner (who also identifies as male having been born female), and living in the same household.

They have avoided a situation whereby Q had to be directly and separately represented and have managed to keep him on side which I think has been a very good thing.

If she had not objected to medical treatment there is every likelihood that Q would have approached a private resource offshore and been prescribed puberty blockers. The long term effects of such treatment remain a matter for further research, but it is possible that in future Q will have reason to be grateful he did not ever take them.</span></p>

I know that Q believes that his mother has lied, or that she is motivated by wider political matters, but the fact that he holds these views does not mean that they are objectively correct. If he is being allowed or encouraged to believe his mother is behaving in this way then that is a great pity. The mother has, with some difficulty, agreed that he could change his name. She accepted the fact of his social transition even though she did not think that should happen (and the Cass Review raises questions about this). The price she has paid for fighting for what she considers to be best for her child is to lose her relationship with him. This has been very hard indeed for her and I hope that it will not be permanent.</span></p>

He has faced strong criticism from the mother who has sought to blame him for his permissive and affirmative stance, and has accused him of alienating behaviours.  These parents and Q have been in a situation that would challenge anyone, especially when there is so little consensus anywhere about how children with gender dysphoria should be treated, and so little trust.

I also acknowledge the submissions she made about many of the findings and recommendations of the Cass Review which call into question the way that some young people have been treated to date and the long term effects of social transition, puberty blockers and cross sex hormones.  It would not be right for me to comment on all of this, but I note that some of the recommendations of the report have already led to changes, for example NHS Scotland has very recently announced that those who are under 18 will not be prescribed hormones.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The inherent jurisdiction is flexible, and judges do extend existing boundaries from time to time to meet the needs of a particular case.  There could be a situation, for example, where a child is extremely vulnerable or where the proposed medical providers are not regulated in this country and the safeguards that have been relied upon in other cases do not apply. Since this judgment was sent to the parties in draft the President of the Family Division has handed down judgment in </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman'">EF V LM and J </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman'">[2024] EWHC 922 </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> which highlights concerns about Gender GP.  Situations such as those could potentially lead to a judge being persuaded it was appropriate to intervene.   In this case, however, Q does not have any mental health problems, nor does it appear that he is personally the subject of coercion in his home or socially although I am not sure I share the Guardian&#8217;s confidence that Q is able to consider all the evidence about gender dysphoria and the treatment available in a balanced and unbiased way (something that is beyond many adults).  The father is prepared to give an assurance that he will not facilitate Q seeking treatment through Gender GP or any other offshore agency whilst he remains under 18 and so seeking treatment offshore does not apply.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The controversy over treatment of young people (whether privately or through the NHS) for gender-related distress or dysphoria is a matter of public interest, but it is something which should fall to be considered by medical and associated professions and their regulators, or if need be, the government.  Although Gender Plus is a private provider the hormone clinic requires continued registration. Those who treat Q could be liable in negligence if they do not provide a proper standard of care or fail to abide by guidelines without good reason.  Ms Phillimore submits that safeguards to date have not been sufficient for many young people, but once again, such issues are a matter for regulation and professional standards rather than a judge sitting in the Family or High Court.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In any event I find that it is in Q&#8217;s best interests to bring the proceedings to an end.  The Guardian&#8217;s evidence is that he is a very mature child and that his views are very much his own. His attitude has hardened very considerably over the last few months.  The proceedings themselves, which may have provided him with some protection to date, are causing him to become more entrenched in his views about treatment and increased his anger towards his mother. Q is aware of the law and this creates its own expectations. With the lines still drawn, I can see a danger that the battle itself could distract Q from focussing on the advantages and disadvantages of any proposed treatment, and what he wants for himself throughout his life. He is impressive, hardworking and intelligent. It is vital that he engages fully in the assessment that is being offered to him and prepares himself to make some very important decisions if he is offered medical intervention thereafter. Given the advice from the Cass Review any doctor will have to exercise great caution before prescribing hormones to a minor, and so it seems quite likely he will have to wait for another two years, but that time will go fast.  He needs calm and dispassionate advice over the coming months and years, and the ability to recognise it as such.</span></p>

Given the Guardian&#8217;s evidence that a referral to an offshore body such as Gender GP would not be safe for Q, I consider it right to ask the father to give the court an undertaking that he will not fund or facilitate it whilst he is a minor. I understand that he is prepared to do this.  I do not make any declaration as to medical or other treatment.</span></p>

In doing this I have firmly in mind the warning from Lord Philips of Worth Matravers as to the dangers of a court grappling with issues which are divorced from the specific facts of a case.  The debate is properly being conducted elsewhere, and in my judgment I should leave it at that.</span></p>

This has been conducted with great efficiency and skill. The parents did an excellent job representing themselves in very difficult circumstances but I am sure they have been very glad to have lawyers acting for them at this hearing (and so far as the mother is concerned, in October 2023 too). The court has certainly benefited by having clear and focussed submissions from all counsel.  I know that solicitors and counsel for both of the parents have acted at reduced rates in order to ensure that they can be represented. </span></p>
