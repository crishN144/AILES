	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The first relates to the meaning and effect of section 12(1)(a) of the Administration of Justice Act 1960 and involves a question the answer to which, despite the by now extensive jurisprudence on the topic, is seemingly not altogether clear.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The second relates to the anonymity of professional witnesses in care proceedings under Part IV of the Children Act 1989: specifically, whether three categories of witness &#8211; medical experts, treating clinicians (in which phrase I include nursing as well as medical staff) and social workers &#8211; should have their anonymity protected by <span style="font-style:italic">contra mundum </span>injunctions.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_3">
	  <num>3.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I emphasise at the outset that, although these questions have to be resolved in the context of the concrete facts of the specific case &#8211; after all, as Lord Steyn made clear in <span style="font-style:italic">In Re S (A Child) (Identification: Restrictions on Publication) </span>[2004] UKHL 47, [2005] 1 AC 593, at para [17], &#8220;an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case is necessary&#8221; &#8211; the truth is that the particular factual context here is largely unexceptional. Without for a moment seeking to diminish the tremendous significance of the proceedings for the three human beings most directly involved &#8211; Mr and Mrs Ward and their son William &#8211; the fact is that the care proceedings which give rise to the issues I now have to resolve did not exhibit, from the forensic perspective, any particularly unusual or striking features. And with only two exceptions (see below) none of the professionals involved was singled out by the judge who tried the care proceedings, Her Honour Judge Isobel Plumstead, either for blame or for praise. So the reality is that the issues presented to me for decision arise in a singularly &#8216;pure&#8217; context. This is not, so far as the central issues are concerned, a fact-specific case. I emphasise the point at the outset because the inescapable reality is that the issues I have to address are in large measure points of pure principle and that my answers to the questions posed are likely to be determinative of similar questions in many, indeed even in the generality, of care cases hereafter.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">William Ward was born on 21 April 2005. On 21 July 2005 he was discovered to have fractures of his right tibia. On 16 December 2005 the local authority, Cambridgeshire County Council (CCC), began care proceedings. The case was based entirely upon the fractures, for CCC accepted that there was no other evidence of ill-treatment or poor parenting. A fact-finding hearing, to establish whether the threshold for making a care order had been passed, took place in the county court before Judge Plumstead.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr and Mrs Ward were unable to identify any cause for William&#8217;s injuries from anything they had themselves seen. They hypothesised that his foot may have become trapped between his cot and their bed, which was immediately beside the cot, and that he may have twisted and fractured his leg as he pulled his foot free. In addition to hearing evidence from the parents, Judge Plumstead read contemporaneous notes or later reports prepared by, and in some cases also heard oral evidence from, various professionals.</p>

But this raised issues which, as I made clear (para [37]), could not be resolved within the confines of what was only a comparatively short directions hearing. They were, moreover, issues of some complexity on which I required more detailed argument and, furthermore, issues in relation to which the parties might, as it seemed to me, wish to adduce further evidence. Accordingly, while making an order the effect of which was to permit the identification of the family, the hospital and the local authority, the publication of Judge Plumstead&#8217;s judgment and the disclosure by the family to the BBC of various video tapes, I granted an interim <span style="font-style:italic">contra mundum </span>injunction (para [53]) prohibiting the identification of the social workers, the police officer, the treating clinicians and the expert witnesses pending full argument on the outstanding issues.</p>

From Mr and Mrs Ward I had the two position statements they had prepared for the abortive hearing on 14 May 2008 and a skeleton argument prepared for the hearing on 16 June 2009. I also had the skeleton argument which Ms Kate Wilson had prepared on behalf of the BBC for the hearing on 14 May 2008. By then the BBC no longer intended to make a programme about the case and appropriately, from its point of view, had decided not to make any oral submissions, but helpfully, from the court&#8217;s perspective, lodged written submissions setting out what Ms Wilson described as &#8220;points of principled opposition&#8221; to the applications being brought against Mr and Mrs Ward.</p>

But before turning to those different aspects of the dispute I must first address the logically prior question of just what it is that section 12 of the 1960 Act applies to. For analysis of the list of documents that Mr and Mrs Ward wish to be able to disclose indicates that many of the documents, including some which from their point of view are the most important, are arguably not within the ambit of section 12 at all.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr and Mrs Ward&#8217;s position throughout has been clear and readily understandable. They wish to be able to speak publicly about their experiences of the child protection system, both to encourage further investigation into the area of infant fractures and to help other families involved in the child protection system &#8211; &#8220;to communicate to others what happened and what it felt like, to share our experiences with others, to speak openly and rationally about our experiences&#8221;. They have, as they put it, no wish to &#8216;name and shame&#8217; doctors nor to vilify those who were involved in their particular case. But to achieve their aims they say they need to be able to speak fully about the medical evidence presented in their case. Expressing themselves as sympathetic to the arguments being put forward by Mr Lock and to the difficulties faced by doctors in the position of the treating clinicians, they say &#8220;We do not wish to name the hospital doctors involved but we would like to be able to provide details of their treatment and the information that they gave us about medical and child protection issues.&#8221; Similarly, they say, they have no wish to name the CCC staff whose names appear in the documents. &#8220;Our sole wish is to be able to enter into a free and open discussion about our experiences of the child protection and family court systems.&#8221; But they made clear that although they have some sympathy for the position in which the social workers find themselves, they are not so sympathetic to them as to the treating clinicians and would not have been willing to agree, as they put it, to &#8216;sign away their rights&#8217; in relation to CCC or its employees.</p>

She wishes to challenge what is said in the certificate, which she believes to be founded essentially on Dr L&#8217;s views, &#8220;but to do this I also need to be able to discuss the facts of our case fully and to disclose the dissenting opinions of the other doctors.&#8221;</p>

But most of this was expressed at a high level of generality and without any specific detail or elaboration of what was being referred to. When I inquired of counsel as to whether there was anything in the material before me which, complaints to the GMC apart, detailed exactly what it was said paediatricians were being exposed to, I was taken to what Professor Sir Alan Craft had said in the course of an address to the Medico-Legal Society on 14 December 2006 as published, under the title &#8216;Paediatricians and Child Protection&#8217;, in (2007) 75 Medic-Legal Journal 55 at page 58.

In relation to this last point Mr Clemens points out that participation is voluntary and the pool of available experts is relatively small. He submits that it does not overstate the position to assert that identification will have a significant and negative impact on the involvement of experts in the family courts &#8211; a reluctance which, he says, sounds not only in giving evidence in court but in whether doctors will engage in the whole process at all.</p>

The publication of Judge Plumstead&#8217;s albeit anonymised judgment which I authorised is, she says, sufficient to enable Mr and Mrs Ward to achieve their stated objectives. Given that, the balancing exercise, she says, now comes down firmly against further disclosure of information, save, perhaps, specific disclosure for the purpose of enabling Mrs Ward to challenge the Enhanced Criminal Records Certificate &#8211; as to which CCC says it is &#8220;sympathetic&#8221;.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Basing her submissions upon a careful analysis of the relevant authorities (see further below) and of the various rights engaged under Articles 8 and 10 of the Convention, Ms Wilson correctly identifies the starting position as being that section 12 confers no anonymity upon either the treating clinicians (as the Trusts have always accepted) or the expert witnesses.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"><span> </span><marker name="tab"/>At the time Ms Wilson prepared her skeleton argument CCC had not yet made its application for a <span style="font-style:italic">contra mundum</span> injunction, so unsurprisingly she does not consider the position of the social workers; no doubt if she had done so her submission would have been to similar effect. Nor had Mr and Mrs Ward yet applied to &#8216;disapply&#8217; section 12, so I do not have the benefit of Ms Wilson&#8217;s submissions on the issues raised by that application. </p>
	      </authorialNote> She observes that it is unfortunate that, despite the exposition of the scope of section 12 to be found in the authorities, Dr A, Dr B and Dr L and their solicitors continue, as she puts it, to adduce evidence or labour under the misunderstanding that their identities and involvement in the care proceedings are prima facie protected. And she castigates as a &#8220;heresy&#8221; pervading the evidence of Dr A, Dr B and Dr L, their reliance upon what she describes as an absolute (albeit vague) promise that their evidence in the care proceedings would remain confidential and not be disclosed outside the confines of the proceedings. She acknowledges that section 12 and what she calls &#8216;family court practice&#8217; make confidentiality the norm, but submits it is not absolute. The same goes for the treating clinicians. The BBC, she says, &#8220;profoundly disagrees&#8221; with the very broadly stated principle upon which the application by the Trusts is based, namely that it is generally &#8216;desirable&#8217; to grant treating doctors involved in child care proceedings anonymity. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Turning to the evidence filed by or on behalf of Dr A, Dr B and Dr L, Ms Wilson characterises it as in some cases mere assertion and elsewhere as demonstrating, as she puts it, only vague or even generic concerns. She submits that none of the expert witnesses can demonstrate any high risk of interference with their core Article 8 rights. First, she says, the confidentiality which they rely upon is not a confidence akin to Article 8&#8217;s protection of privacy; the confidentiality is the court&#8217;s. Second, she says, their names as experts and their professional opinions do not engage Article 8, for the disclosure of these does not impinge on their ability to develop professional relationships or affect their personal autonomy or development. Third, she says, it follows that the only matter raised by the expert witnesses which truly invokes Article 8 is the risk of harassment as a result of being identified, but what is striking here, she submits, is that it is only mentioned in passing (if at all) by the applicants themselves and that Professor Sir Alan Craft&#8217;s evidence appears to be very similar to that adduced in other proceedings: compare, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (A Child) (Disclosure)</span> [2004] EWHC 411 (Fam), [2004] 2 FLR 142, at paras [87]-[89]. And apart from one matter referred to by Dr B (which, she says, may or may not be connected to these proceedings) there is simply nothing, she submits, to which the court can even start to give an intense focus. She suggests that the MAMA website, although being highly critical of Professor Sir Roy Meadow, does not appear to give rise to any severe risk to doctors generally and submits that, whilst Professor Sir Alan Craft alludes to these problems, he gives little specific detail. Taken as a whole, she submits, the evidence falls short of showing a &#8216;pressing need&#8217;.</p>

Insofar as Dr H and Dr J are concerned about the possibility that they may be criticised this is a matter for the law of defamation. In relation to harassment Dr H, Dr J and Dr K all expressly disavow any concerns about Mr and Mrs Ward. Instead, she says, they rely upon wholly unspecified and unparticularised concerns about becoming subject to a campaign of harassment, but these concerns, she says, are based solely on a belief that some parts of the public consider doctors in child protection work to be &#8216;fair game&#8217;. As to the argument that doctors will not refer children they suspect of child abuse she observes acidly that the court should require compelling evidence &#8211; which has not been adduced &#8211; that, if an injunction is refused, the doctors would disregard their legal and professional duties as set out in the various materials to which I have already referred.</p>

She points to the value to the courts of knowing whether an expert has been criticised in other proceedings and suggests that it is important to distinguish between the real public policy concerns which arise from naming experts and more general problems experienced in the area of child protection.

The court, she says, should be wary of extending through precedent a situation where expert witnesses and clinicians treating children suspected of abuse are always granted anonymity even though Parliament has not chosen to legislate for that situation. And the concern that paediatricians will not assist the courts cannot, she submits, be allowed to become a trump card.</p>

In due course I received further written submissions from both of them. Mr Clemens, in written submissions dated 23 July 2009, explained the legislative history of the 1960 Act; he very fairly pays tribute to the invaluable assistance he received, just as I should like to pay tribute to the invaluable assistance I have thereby received, from a pupil in his chambers, Mr Alex Young, who assisted him in his research. It is not their fault that their research, historically fascinating as it is, does not in fact throw any light on the issues before me. For her part, Ms Connolly in written submissions dated 22 July 2009 (with a supplemental note dated 23 July 2009) has taken me to the relevant case-law. I am grateful to all of them.</p>

It was criticised by <span style="font-style:italic">The Times </span>in leaders on 9 March 1960 and 24 March 1960 for not going far enough. Substantive consideration of the Bill took place in the House of Lords on Second Reading on 24 March 1960 (<span style="font-style:italic">Hansard 5</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span><span style="font-style:italic"> series </span>Vol 222 cols 247-304) and in Committee on 10 May 1960 (<span style="font-style:italic">Hansard 5</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span><span style="font-style:italic"> series </span>Vol 223 cols 561-591 and 1108-1123) and then in the House of Commons on Second Reading on 1 July 1960 (<span style="font-style:italic">Hansard 5</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span><span style="font-style:italic"> series </span>Vol 625 cols 1693-1757) and in Committee on 12 and 14 July 1960 (<span style="font-style:italic">Hansard 5</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span><span style="font-style:italic"> series </span>cols 3-52 and 55-94). Much of the debate at each stage was taken up with other provisions of the Bill and insofar as clause 12 (now section 12) was concerned there was neither explanation nor debate as to the meaning of the words with which I am now concerned. The Second Reading debate in the House of Lords is chiefly interesting for the participation of Lord Parker of Waddington CJ, Lord Denning, Lord Goddard and Viscount Simonds (though none of them expressed any views of relevance to anything I have to decide) and for the irony that, as Mr Clemens puts it, had there been recourse to <span style="font-style:italic">Hansard </span>(and, in particular, col 254, where Viscount Kilmuir LC said that &#8220;Nothing in Clause 12 will have the effect of making something punishable as contempt of court which could not have been punished as contempt under the existing law&#8221;) the great point which subsequently arose &#8211; before Lord Denning, by then Master of the Rolls &#8211; in <span style="font-style:italic">In re F (Orse A) (A Minor) (Publication of Information) </span>[1977] Fam 58 could have been answered swiftly and definitively.</p>

Indeed, he construed the words so as to include information about the ward irrespective of whether the information related to a hearing or not. He accepted that there was no reported case at common law which went further than to declare an account of the proceedings (or of the order made) to be a contempt; but, bearing in mind the nature of wardship, he interpreted &#8220;proceedings&#8221; as meaning &#8220;a continuing state of affairs for as long as the wardship lasts.&#8221;</p>

By retaining the word &#8220;proceedings&#8221; Parliament must have intended to maintain the relationship between contempt of court and a court&#8217;s proceedings. As I read the section, what is protected from publication is the proceedings of the court; in all other respects the ward enjoys no greater protection against unwelcome publicity than other children. If the information published relates to the ward, but not to the proceedings, there is no contempt; as North J commented in <span style="font-style:italic">Martindale&#8217;s </span>case<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>[1894] 3 Ch 193, 201, there would have been no contempt in that case had the newspaper confined its report to the fact of the ward&#8217;s marriage&#8221;.</p>

In response to this, Butler-Sloss LJ said this (at page 210):</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;[Counsel] has relied principally on the provisions of section 12 in order to support her argument that documents not filed with the court are nonetheless protected from disclosure to the police. Section 12 is designed to protect information from publication in child family cases heard in private. The protection covers the proceedings, principally the actual hearing before the court and those proceedings cannot be, for instance, reported in the press. This section was not intended to cover documents held by social workers which have not been filed with the court nor used in the proceedings heard by the court in private. It does not seem to me that the control by the court either under the umbrella of rule 4.23 or of section 12 extends to documents outside the court proceedings. The argument of [counsel] supporting the judge's approach is, none the less, at first sight, very attractive since, if the purpose of rule 4.23 is to protect the information contained in the documents, there seems little point in having a rule which protects only the pieces of paper and not the contents. It is not, however, necessary for the court to give rule 4.23 the extended meaning suggested. The appropriate protection of information, notes and other papers from disclosure can be achieved by another route which does not do violence to the clear words of rule 4.23.&#8221;</p>

It would be absurd to suggest, to take a very obvious example, that section 12 prohibits the publication of a birth certificate or of the information contained in it merely because the birth certificate has been lodged with the court or even if it has been referred to in and annexed to a witness statement or report which is itself plainly within the protection of section 12.</p>

Indeed, Ms Connolly accepts that, as she puts it, not every document before the court could, or should, be protected by section 12, giving the example of a letter contained in a bundle of party and party correspondence prepared for use in the proceedings &#8211; which I agree would not, as such, be within the ambit of section 12.  Yet, she submits, confidential social work records disclosed and filed within and for the purpose of the proceedings, as here, do fall within section 12.

Suppose that a local authority in exercise of its duties under section 47 convenes a child protection conference at a time when there are no proceedings on foot and, indeed, when there has not even been consideration of whether or not proceedings should be commenced. Now whatever other restrictions there may be upon the use of the document, section 12 plainly cannot apply and the publication of the minutes of that conference cannot be a contempt of court, because there are no proceedings on foot. But why should the self-same act &#8211; publishing the minutes <span style="font-style:italic">but without any reference to the proceedings</span> &#8211; be a contempt of court merely because proceedings have in fact been commenced and the minutes lodged with the court attached to some witness statement or report? Why should the question of contempt in relation to a publication which does not refer to any proceedings at all depend upon whether or not proceedings have been commenced and upon whether, if they have, the particular document has been produced to the court as an exhibit? In my judgment it makes no sense. And it makes no sense because it is not the law and because it does not focus upon the statutory language. </p>

Only a court can authorise the placing of a child for adoption or make an adoption order: <span style="font-style:italic">R (G) v Nottingham City Council </span>[2008] EWHC 152 (Admin), [2008] 1 FLR 1660.

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Second, the commencement of care proceedings, leading potentially to the making of a care order and even, it may be, an adoption order against the protests of the parents, involves a massive intrusion by the State &#8211; both the State in the guise of the local authority and the State in the guise of its judicial authorities &#8211; into the quintessentially private life of the family. And the family, whatever form it takes, is, of course, the bedrock of our society and the foundation of our way of life. I make no apologies for repeating again the observation that I first made in <span style="font-style:italic">Re L (Care: Assessment: Fair Trial) </span>[2002] EWHC 1379 (Fam), [2002] 2 FLR 730, at para [150]:</p>

The evidence they are giving is not about their own private affairs; it is either evidence about other people &#8211; about those who are parties to or subjects of the proceedings &#8211; or evidence of professional opinion. So although Article 8 is in play, the Article 8 interests of the applicants &#8211; the social workers, the treating clinicians and the expert witnesses &#8211; are far removed from the intensely private and personal Article 8 interests engaged in cases such as <span style="font-style:italic">Re N (Family Proceedings: Disclosure) </span>[2009] EWHC 1663 (Fam), [2009] 2 FLR 1152.</p>

Even those of us who spend our professional lives in the family courts can have but little real awareness of what they must have been going through. It is hard to imagine a predicament which more obviously and more intensely engages Article 8. And in the same way they have a strong call upon the protection of Article 10. For the workings of the family justice system and, very importantly, the views about the system of the mothers and fathers caught up in it, are, as Balcombe LJ put it in <span style="font-style:italic">Re W (Wardship: Discharge: Publicity)</span> [1995] 2 FLR 466 at 474, &#8220;matters of public interest which can and should be discussed publicly&#8221;.</p>

The present dispute is only part of an on-going debate as to where in the family justice system the lines should be drawn, where the balance should be struck, as between the often starkly opposed arguments, on the one side in favour of preserving the traditional privacy and confidentiality of family proceedings and on the other side in favour of greater &#8216;transparency&#8217;, to use the vogue expression. My duty here is to determine the present case according to law &#8211; that is, the law as it is, not the law as some might wish it to be or even the law as it may yet be if Part 2 of the Children, Schools and Families Bill currently before Parliament receives the Royal assent. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">But the law has to have regard to current realities and one of those realities, unhappily, is a decreasing confidence in some quarters in the family justice system &#8211; something which although it is often linked to strident complaints about so-called &#8216;secret justice&#8217; is too much of the time based upon ignorance, misunderstanding, misrepresentation or worse. The maintenance of public confidence in the judicial system is central to the values which underlie both Article 6 and Article 10 and something which, in my judgment, has to be brought into account as a very weighty factor in any application of the balancing exercise. And where the lack of public confidence is caused even if only in part by misunderstanding or, on occasions, the peddling of falsehoods, then there is surely a resonance, even for the family justice system, in what Brandeis J said so many years ago.

The care proceedings came to an end without the making of any order. The local authority does not have parental responsibility for William and he is not a ward of court. The only persons with parental responsibility for him are Mr and Mrs Ward. Insofar as the disclosure of information about a child of William&#8217;s age involves an exercise of parental responsibility then it is for Mr and Mrs Ward to exercise that responsibility, not the court or any other public authority. There are no grounds for any interference by the State &#8211; whether the state in the guise of the local authority or the state in the form of the High Court &#8211; with the exercise by Mr and Mrs Ward of their parental responsibility. No one has made any application for a specific issue order. Mr and Mrs Ward have not sought the assistance of the court in the exercise of their parental responsibility: compare <span style="font-style:italic">Re B; X Council v B (No 2)</span> [2008] EWHC 270 (Fam), [2008] 1 FLR 1460, at para [17].</p>

After all, if CCC&#8217;s involvement had not led to the institution of proceedings at all, there would have been nothing in section 12 to prevent Mr and Mrs Ward speaking out and making whatever use they wished of all the paperwork generated by the local authority&#8217;s involvement or, as they might see it, unjustified interference. Why should things be so very different merely because proceedings were brought which ultimately failed? There will be cases where there is a ready answer to this rhetorical question and where the balance of competing interests, whether private or public, will fall the other way, but in this case, given the nature of the issues in the care proceedings, the outcome of the proceedings and all the other circumstances, the balance, as I have said, falls, in my judgment, in favour of Mr and Mrs Ward being allowed, both for themselves and on behalf of William, to make use of &#8211; to publish &#8211; even those documents which would otherwise be subject to the restrictions imposed by section 12.</p>

Treating doctors are only infrequently and incidentally involved as witnesses in care proceedings &#8211; and then essentially as witnesses (and, it is to be noted, compellable witnesses) of historical fact. Social workers and police officers in child protection teams, in contrast, are employed in jobs which, in the nature of things, mean that they will not infrequently &#8211; social workers more frequently than police officers &#8211; have to give evidence in care proceedings, evidence which is often a mixture of historical fact and opinion. A children&#8217;s guardian is employed to perform a task whose very raison d&#8217;&#234;tre is the giving of evidence to the court and whose primary function, in addition to reporting what the child, if old enough, has said, is to offer advice to the court. And an expert witness is someone who, in consideration of the payment of a fee, and in marked contrast, for example, to the treating doctors, has chosen to proffer expert opinion evidence for the purpose of the particular proceedings.</p>

This work, though very important, is voluntary. The concern is that if expert witnesses in care cases are publicly identified this will be likely to lead to a further drain on the already diminishing pool of doctors and other experts willing to do child protection work. Doctors and experts in other disciplines may be yet further disinclined to do such work if they see that the evidence they give to the court on the understanding that it (and their own identities) will remain confidential may become public knowledge and be the subject of public criticism. The already inadequate number of experts willing to assist the courts in vitally important child protection cases may, it is feared, be even further reduced.</p>

As to this, whatever the factual merits or otherwise of what is being said &#8211; a topic on which I have and express no views whatever &#8211; I have some difficulty in seeing how this is something that can properly or appropriately be taken into account by the court when considering the question with which I am concerned. Put bluntly, if there is some problem here, it is a problem to be solved by others &#8211; by the GMC, by the medical profession, by Parliament &#8211; not by the family court controlling the information it allows to be disseminated or the form in which it allows such information to be disseminated. Judicial control of the GMC and its processes is, after all, a function of the Administrative Court, not the Family Division.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this connection I would also observe that, not merely is there a strong public interest in the family courts making disclosure of otherwise private or confidential information and documents to the GMC &#8211; reflecting the public interest in the effective regulation of the professions and in maintaining public confidence in them &#8211; but that it is not for the family court to seek to evaluate, let alone to pre-judge, the strength or otherwise of the case to be investigated by the GMC: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re N (Family Proceedings: Disclosure)</span> [2009] EWHC 1663 (Fam), [2009] 2 FLR 1152, at paras [44]-[48] (application for permission to appeal dismissed [2009] EWCA Civ 1345). Moreover, the recently introduced FPR rule 11.4(1)(c) permits a party to family proceedings to disclose the papers in the case to the GMC without any need first to obtain judicial permission: <span style="font-style:italic">Re N (Family Proceedings: Disclosure)</span> [2009] EWHC 1663 (Fam), [2009] 2 FLR 1152, at para [62]. So the scope for control by the family court of complaints to the GMC by disgruntled litigants is limited. And if that is so, what justification can there be for the family court seeking to exercise some wider degree of control where the complaint comes from someone other than a litigant? </p>

And quite apart from the more severely pragmatic of the reasons for needing to know who are the experts giving evidence in such cases, does not the public in this context have an interest not merely in knowing what is being done in its name but also in knowing who the experts are whose evidence may have led (though not of course in this case) to a child being removed from his parents and placed for adoption? </p>

It is unthinkable that, save conceivably in highly exceptional and unusual circumstances which I have to say I have some difficulty imagining, there should be any question of an expert witness who gives evidence in such a case in the Crown Court being afforded anonymity. Why then should matters be any different in the family court? After all, it might be thought that the risks of targeting, harassment and vilification are every bit as great in relation to an expert giving evidence in the Crown Court as in relation to an expert giving the same kind of evidence in a family court. </p>

Social workers generally must regard this as a professional hazard. I have not myself ever had experience of a local authority seeking anonymity for a professional worker in these circumstances. I am unaware of any previous ruling to this effect. Obviously the court must exercise a discretion, and it is quite impossible to set any useful bounds on the exercise of that discretion. Perhaps it is enough to say that cases in which the court will afford anonymity to a professional social work witness will be highly exceptional.&#8221;</p>

It should be noted that this interest is usually characterised as a need to preserve confidential sources and information rather than as an incident of any right to personal confidentiality or anonymity in the professional witness who relays that material to the court, although the various aspects of confidentiality will have greater or lesser weight on the facts of each case: see Munby J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re X (Disclosure of Information)</span> [2001] 2 FLR 440, at para [24].

Despite this, I take notice of the fact that there is a continuing shortage of social care professionals, particularly in child protection and that there have been and are campaigns against them which can have a serious effect upon an individual&#8217;s private life. Further, there is a public interest in encouraging social workers and others to engage in this difficult work. Great weight is placed on this by the local authority and by X and Y, and, although I should take these factors into account and I do, no one suggests that they are the determinant or predominant factual issues in this case.&#8221;</p>

That said, however, the starting point is the same, namely that they are not afforded anonymity either by the general law or by section 12, and accordingly they, like the other claimants, need to be able to demonstrate that the balancing exercise tips in their favour. In my judgment, and for reasons which will by now very largely be apparent, they fail in that endeavour. I am not of course saying that their claim fails because the other claims have failed. Each of the three claims &#8211; that by the expert witnesses, that by CCC on behalf of the social workers and that by the Trusts on behalf of the treating clinicians &#8211; is a separate and distinct claim that has to be assessed on its own merits. But for reasons which are too obvious to require further elaboration, many of the arguments are much of a muchness and many of the reasons why the other two claims in my judgment fail are also, <span style="font-style:italic">mutatis mutandis</span>, reasons why this claim also fails.</p>

Again here, as there, the evidence is, by and large, general rather than specific and as striking for what it does not say as for what it does. One can sympathise with conscientious and caring professionals who cannot understand why they should be at risk of harassment and vilification for only doing their job &#8211; and a job, moreover, where participation in the forensic process is not, as it were, part of the &#8216;job specification&#8217; as in the case of social workers and expert witnesses. But the fact is that in an increasing clamorous and decreasingly deferential society there are many people in many different professions who, however much they might wish it were otherwise, and however much one may deplore the fact, have to put up with the harassment and vilification with which the Internet in particular and the other media to a lesser extent are awash. And the arguments based upon the risk of unfounded complaints being made to the GMC has, as it seems to me, no more weight in the case of the treating clinicians than in the case of the expert witnesses.   </p>

On the contrary, the treating clinicians disavow any concerns in relation to Mr and Mrs Ward. The claim in all three cases is, in reality, a &#8216;class&#8217; claim, that is, a claim that any professional who falls into a certain class &#8211; and in the case of both the social workers and the treating clinicians the membership of the class is very large indeed &#8211; is, for that reason, and, truth be told, for that reason alone, entitled in current circumstances to have their identity protected, in plain language to have their identity concealed from the public.

Is a distinction to be drawn between those treating clinicians involved in a case which ends up in court and those involved in a case which does not?

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;From 2002 to 2006 I was president elect and then President of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. The College represents all paediatricians in the UK including consultants and trainees. The total membership is now almost 10000. During the period of my presidency I became very aware of the enormous pressures facing paediatricians in their work with regard to child protection. This was a particular issue because of the high profile cases involving Sir Roy Meadow and Professor David Southall, both leaders of the profession, and pioneers in the field of child protection. In addition there was a huge increase in the number of complaints against paediatricians, both to their employers and to their regulatory body, the General Medical Council. The College undertook a survey of its members and had a very high response rate of over 80%. Of the 4500 respondents 14% had a complaint against them in the recent past. A total of 786 complaints were reported. The annual number had increased from 20 in 1996 to over 100 in 2003. The vast majority of these were resolved at Trust or NHS ombudsman level and of the complaints to the GMC only 1 case resulted in a finding of serious professional misconduct. The fourfold increase in complaints does have to be set in the context of a pervading culture of complaining. The overall number of complaints to the GMC for all reasons increased 15-fold between 1990 and 2003, an annual increase of 33%. In spite of the fact that many of these cases come to nothing, when a complaint is made, especially to the GMC one cannot underestimate the enormous effect that this has on the doctor and his family. Complaints can take a year or more to resolve and the pressure endured by these doctors cannot be underestimated. During my period of office we were aware of the difficulties in finding doctors willing to take on specialist roles in child protection. Each district should have a designated doctor for child protection and many of these posts were unfilled. There was also a severe shortage of doctors willing to act as experts in child protection cases. The Research Division of the RCPCH undertook a follow up interview project with a sample of those paediatricians who had responded to the original survey and who had received a complaint in connection with their child protection work. A paper describing the results of this study were recently published in the Archives of Disease in Childhood &#8230; </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">There is no doubt of the adverse impact of high profile child protection cases over the last few years. Professionals working in health and social care have been subjected to a high degree of media attention and scrutiny. This has focussed on a perceived failure to intervene to safeguard a child when such intervention seemed indicated or for intervening when it was not necessary ie when the end result of child protection proceedings is that the child was deemed not to have been abused. The tragic Victoria Climbie case was an example of a failure to take appropriate action and there are many examples such as the Cannings and Clark cases where the courts decided that abuse had not occurred. The media portray these cases as black and white failing to recognise the extreme complexity in many of the cases. Damned if you do and damned if you don&#8217;t intervene has certainly been the perception of many professionals.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Child protection is part of every paediatrician&#8217;s every day work. They never know whether the child presented to them may not be as straightforward as the parent or carer indicates. Indeed paediatrics is most unusual in medical practice. The classical medical method decrees that when a person presents the first thing to do is to take a good history. Indeed generations of students have learned the aphorism &#8220;listen to the mother, she is telling you the diagnosis.&#8221; A good history is followed by examination investigation if necessary and the formulation of a diagnosis and treatment plan. If a child has been abused the parent or carer responsible will usually give a misleading or inaccurate history making the whole medical encounter extremely difficult. In every paediatric consultation the doctor has to have in the back of his mind that the parent may not be telling the truth.</p>

It is well known by paediatricians that there is what appears to be an orchestrated campaign against doctors involved in child protection. Much of this has been concerned with those acting as experts but not exclusively. This has been a campaign both in the media and on the internet. Further details of this are given in the &#8230; paper which I presented to the Medico Legal Society at the Royal Society of Medicine in December 2006.</p>

Child protection work, which is a potential part of every paediatrician&#8217;s everyday practice, is enormously stressful, and adding the further worry that they could be named in the media is an unnecessary extra burden. It is very likely to make paediatricians err on the side of self protection rather than child protection. This will not be good for children and will potentially lead to more children being allowed to &#8220;slip through the net&#8221; and ultimately suffering more serious abuse which could have been prevented.</p>

In large part, these comments relate to staff who are directly involved in &#8216;front-line&#8217; child protection work rather than those doctors who are employed in a professional capacity to provide expert evidence. It must however be recognised that staff actively involved in treating patients may commonly find themselves called to give evidence in court ostensibly of a factual nature but only by virtue of their professional qualification and employment. The factual evidence that they give will often include an opinion as to whether injuries are characteristic of those caused accidentally or non-accidentally. The distinction between expert witnesses and treating staff may be misleading: the child and the court depend upon both being prepared to give their evidence without fear or favour.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The diagnosis of child abuse to account for unexplained injuries, failure to thrive and neglect has really only been better recognised as an important part of the work of paediatricians over the last 50 years. During this time new manifestations of child abuse have become increasingly recognised, such as emotional abuse, child sexual abuse and FII. The diagnosis of child abuse is commonly not straightforward, involving the piecing together of various bits of information including the history and physical findings, as well as information from Social Services and Police. Paediatricians have a duty to report cases of possible child abuse to the statutory authorities (Social Services and Police) and to engage in subsequent child protection procedures. It is regrettable but inevitable that, with a proportion of entirely proper referrals, a case of possible child abuse will be investigated and found to be unsubstantiated. When this happens it can be very distressing for the parents or others involved in the child&#8217;s care, but it is an unavoidable consequence in this complex area. The only practical alternative would be to ask paediatricians to only report definite cases of child abuse. If the evidential threshold we were required to apply was much higher, many cases of possible child abuse would not be reported and therefore not be investigated. It seems inevitable that this would lead to a situation where some vulnerable children would remain unprotected.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">When paediatricians or other health professionals make a report of possible child abuse to Social Services or Police, parents will be informed provided this does not threaten the child&#8217;s safety. It is not uncommon that parents may become upset about such referrals and the subsequent procedures usually aim to acknowledge this upset and provide support to parents. Such upset is all the more likely when reports made by health professionals of possible child abuse are unsubstantiated following investigation by the statutory authorities. Thus it is a regular part of paediatricians&#8217; practise to expect some parents to be upset and to help try and resolve this.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">In the last 10-15 years, there have been increasing levels of action taken by parents involved in child abuse cases where either the abuse has been unsubstantiated or where parents have denied alleged abuse. The actions include use of employer complaints procedures, complaints to regulatory bodies and use of politicians and the media to support their &#8216;cause&#8217;. Various websites developed to aid communication and provide support for parents who alleged they had been falsely accused. One of the most notable was the site that dealt with parents who alleged false accusations of fabricated or induced illness: Mothers Against Munchausen&#8217;s Syndrome by Proxy Allegations   or   MAMA (www.msbp.com). This site was used to co-ordinate public meetings, including with Members of Parliament and the General Medical Council and in addition, posted a variety of libellous and threatening messages against professionals involved in child protection. In the last year, this site has been removed by the American authorities following complaints by medical professionals to the US Attorney General.</p>

A common tactic has been to report a professional and then publicise that the individual is under investigation for making false allegations of abuse against parents. The success of the campaign against paediatricians and other professionals in child protection is evident in speeches in both the House of Commons and House of Lords, which include denials of certain types of abuse (eg FII) (available in Hansard). The above activist was imprisoned for conspiracy to abduct children from the care of social services in a case of FII, although her complaints against paediatricians and others continue to be listened to.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">I would like to stress to the court that the active campaigners who are involved in this see their campaign against individual paediatricians as a &#8220;cause&#8221;. They are rarely involved in the original cases but once they decide on a paediatrician to target, the doctor finds himself at the centre of a web of allegations and complaints. It is often very difficult to locate the source of these complaints and they can be generated by people who have nothing to do with the original medical or legal case, but jump on to the facts as yet another example, as they see it, of paediatricians abusing their professional status and power. As the court will accept, I profoundly disagree with their agenda because, even where investigations do not eventually prove there has been child abuse, I believe that doctors should be committed to the process in order to protect vulnerable children. However we have to live and work in an environment where there are a sizeable number of individuals who appear to be committed to seeking to prevent us doing our job.</p>

Their initial report of this RCPCH survey showed a marked increase in the numbers of complaints against paediatricians. Further qualitative interviews with paediatricians have identified that they are now less likely to become engaged in child protection work and more careful about the reports they make to child protection authorities.</p>

This has led the Chief Medical Officer to examine the way expert witnesses are sought for child protection cases. Trainees in paediatrics are now less likely to want to undertake careers involving child protection and an increasing proportion of advertised jobs for child protection now remain unfilled.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8230; Paediatricians are particularly concerned that the medical regulator, the GMC, is taking actions against internationally acclaimed paediatricians in child protection as a result of a campaign of complaints. Many in the profession consider that the actions taken by the GMC against Professor Sir Roy Meadow, the founding President of the Royal College of Paediatrics &amp; Child Health, and Professor David Southall were inappropriate. As a result, the Royal College of Paediatrics &amp; Child Health voted almost unanimously at their Annual General Meeting in March 2008 with grave concerns about the actions of the GMC and the effects on child protection.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8230; In deciding whether to make a report of possible child protection, paediatricians are professionally and legally required solely to focus on the needs of the child. Thus they should be considering all the evidence that either supports or refutes a diagnosis of possible abuse, as well as the relative likelihood of the presenting condition being caused by abuse. If a paediatrician has reasonable concerns that this may be a case of abuse, the paediatrician should make a referral. However, in recent years, paediatricians have also had to consider the fact that if they make a referral to child protection services and the abuse remains unsubstantiated, the parents could use disciplinary procedures and the complaints systems and this may well generate publicity which is adverse to the paediatrician. Paediatricians are also concerned that they could become the target for the campaigners I have referred to above or otherwise targeted in the press. This obviously has the potential to bring substantial stress to the paediatrician and his or her family. However it can also make it much more difficult for the paediatrician to deliver proper care to other patients. A paediatrician who faces accusations in the press of taking children away from parents in unjustified circumstances and who is reported to be &#8220;under investigation&#8221; by the GMC for unprofessional conduct will never know if the parents of the next child who he or she sees is worried about having their child taken away. This has the potential to undermine the professional confidence of the doctor and to undermine the doctor-patient relationship. The real victims here are other children whose successful treatment depends on the doctor establishing a trusting, professional relationship with the parents.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">I accept that some paediatricians make mistakes and that some act in ways that are not in accordance with the highest standards of our profession. Whilst that is inevitable, as a profession those of us who are working in child protection increasingly feel we are working in siege conditions, where we face the possibility of public exposure and unjustified and vicious criticism just for doing our job properly. Given this possibility I regret that I have to report to the court that my view is that paediatricians have increasingly become more wary in making referrals for child protection.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The evidence for this change in referral threshold is soft, in that there are no routine data collected on reports and substantiation rates. However, paediatricians&#8217; concerns are recognised by the fact that they are less willing to undertake child protection work, jobs remains unfilled, and trainees are less likely to want to go into child protection work. In recent years there has been a general reduction in child protection plans around children (data from Department for Children, Schools and Families), while paradoxically there has been an increase in the numbers of adults who have been convicted for child abuse offences (Home Office data).</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">There is also evidence that professionals engaged in child protection work have been subject to physical and verbal intimidation. A survey was carried out in 2000 at the Annual Meeting of the British Association for the Study and Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (BASPCAN) and results from nearly 300 professionals in child protection documented a range of verbal and physical abuse that they had received as a result of their involvement in child protection cases. This possibility clearly may influence professionals&#8217; involvements to engage in child protection work.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Doctors have also become increasingly worried about the risks of being referred to the General Medical Council. Although Professors Southall and Meadow have been the most high profile cases, a number of other professionals engaged in child protection work have also been referred to the General Medical Council. After what are often prolonged investigations, most of these cases are dropped, but they undoubtedly instil a great deal of anxiety in the professionals who have to undergo investigations.</p>

Whilst we accept that those in authority, including regulatory powers, politicians and employing authorities recognise that professionals in child protection act in good faith to do their best for children where abuse is suspected, there are times when it does not feel like that. These professionals now have to consider their own professional and personal safety &#8211; this is a major deterrent to effective child protection.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The Council has a statutory duty to investigate in every case in which child protection concerns arise, and the social workers in this case were simply doing their jobs. Many parents take exception to the child protection process and social workers sometimes suffer hostile reactions. It is a difficult and often stressful job, requiring a high level of knowledge and skill and the ability to make finely balanced judgments under pressure. They are responsible for protecting the most vulnerable members of society. Their decisions can have very serious implications for children and families.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The threat of publicity or media intrusion in to their professional and/or private lives would only add to the difficulties which social workers already face. Effective child protection processes rely on professionals being able to take decisions which are in the best interests of children, not of the adults caring for them. They have to take these decisions in the face of opposition from parents and in times when tensions and emotions are, understandably, running high. The added threat of being the subject of publicity, and all that entails, would serve only to inhibit appropriate decision-making and sharing of information. Further, it will deter others from entering a profession in which there is already a nationwide shortage.</p>

The lead professional will obtain information and sometimes advice from the other agencies, such as Health, Police, Education or Probation, but it remains the children&#8217;s services authority which has the legal duty and responsibility to take Court action to protect children. Social care staff who take difficult decisions as to what action to take are in the front line, facing the family&#8217;s emotions and anxieties. I know, from talking to many social workers, that they worry about these things.</p>

Most sectors of the media do not. In appropriate cases, particularly where the system has failed, sometimes with disastrous consequences, it is right that the role of individuals is held up to more public scrutiny and in these cases it may be that individuals should be named. This already happens and social care staff have to expect this. Were this to become routine practise or the norm, the concern is the impact of yet further pressure upon staff trying to do an extremely difficult job in difficult circumstances, and consequently the impact upon the families they are trying to help.</p>

They may need to address with the parents issues over their care of the children and often have to say difficult things. At the same time, they are expected to maintain good working relationships both with the children and parents, and with other professionals with whom they may have differences of professional opinion.  Their overriding objective is to keep the best interests of the children at the forefront of their minds and as a paramount consideration in their decision making. </p>

They have had to continue operating through periods of crisis, when there are not enough qualified and/or experienced workers to respond to continuous new referrals as well as deal with open cases. Rolling programmes of recruitment, and use of agency staff, are in place but the national shortage of qualified and experienced social workers means that we often struggle to fill vacancies. This is not due a lack of funding. We have seen some teams&#8217; budgets underspent. There simply are not enough social workers willing and able to deal with child protection work. Even where posts can be filled, reliance on agency workers and a high turnover of staff affect case continuity and, therefore, standards of practice.</p>

Accountability exists through the legal system, through the GSCC, through the Local Government Ombudsman and through councils&#8217; complaints and representations procedures. Mr and Mrs Ward wish to advance public debate. No issue is taken with that. However, publicly naming social care staff in that process is unnecessary and undesirable for all the reasons stated. It would not advance the public debate about infant fractures, about the family court system or about child protection systems.&#8221;</p>
