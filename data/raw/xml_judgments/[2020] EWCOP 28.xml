	      <p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0.01in">GTI is now aged 45. He has an established history of schizoaffective disorder which appears to date back to 1997 but is certainly well evidenced from 2006 onwards. It has been controlled with psychotropic medication and he has lived in supported accommodation in the community.  In his conversations with the Official Solicitor he described a fairly conventional daily routine for an individual unable to work. Preparing meals, shopping, socialising in the pub, cooking and watching television. However in January 2020, during what appears to have been a paranoid episode, he appears to have stabbed himself in the neck causing significant damage to his recurrent laryngeal nerve. This is the nerve which controls the muscles of the larynx and as a result, following surgery, it became apparent that the neurological damage had affected his swallowing reflex and he is now unable to take food or drink orally without significant risks of aspiration; food and drink passing into the lung. This carries with it the risk of recurrent aspiration pneumonia and physical asphyxia leading to respiratory arrest. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0.01in">Following the operation GTI was an inpatient at Aintree Hospital and initially agreed to the insertion of a PEG. However, on 9 March he was detained under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>. The PEG procedure was planned for 11 March 2020 but by then GTI&#8217;s position had changed and it did not go ahead as there were concerns about its legality. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0.01in">He was discharged on 26 March from Aintree Hospital to Hollins Park Hospital, a mental health unit, with a naso-gastric (&#8216;NG&#8217;) tube in place. He pulled this out within 24-hours of admission to Hollins Park. He was then admitted pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/17" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 17</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MHA 1983</ref> to Warrington Hospital where he still remains.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0.01in">Since then numerous attempts have been made to encourage GTI not to interfere with his total parenteral nutrition (&#8216;TPN&#8217;) lines and to agree to the PEG insertion but without success. He has been able on two occasions to drink water from a tap whilst having a shower and obtained a piece of chocolate. He is now supervised permanently by two mental health staff which is plainly highly intrusive. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0.01in">Unfortunately, GTI does not accept that he is unable to eat or drink normally. These seem to be perhaps two of the significant pleasures in his life but he is unable to accept the risks of aspiration or asphyxia. Since the injury he has been fed either by NG tube or directly into his bloodstream by TPN but GTI is resistant to these measures which are in any event only ever contemplated as temporary measures. He has removed several NG tubes and TPN lines inserted to feed him. </p>

Overall it is believed he has had four days&#8217; worth of food in the last 51 days.  Extracts from the dieticians record of his weight show the following (all in Kg) </p>

The development of this side-effect is caused by his deteriorating physical condition associated with the lack of nutrition. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0.01in">It is clear from the evidence of the clinicians that GTI &#8217;s ongoing care has been the subject of multidisciplinary collaboration over the last three months. It has become apparent that attempts to deliver nutrition by the nasogastric tube or by TPN have not achieved anything like the delivery of nutrition necessary to sustain GTI &#8217;s health. His position has become urgent partly because of the risk to his physical health arising from malnutrition, including sustaining an infection between the 17 and 19 of May but also because of the inability to provide him with the clozapine medication that is essential for the restoration and maintenance of stability of his schizoaffective disorder. </p>

The decision was then taken to issue proceedings in the Court of Protection in order to seek the court&#8217;s authorisation for that operation on the basis that GTI lacked capacity to take the decision himself and that the consensus of all present was that it was in GTI&#8217;s best interests to urgently undergo the insertion of a PEG. The clinical team hoped to carry out the procedure on the afternoon of 22 May. </p>

The view of the NHS Trust&#8217;s Deputy Medical Director, Dr Robinson, and other references to GTI having capacity engendered some uncertainty. However, review of the totality of the records and in particular the opinion of GTI&#8217;s treating consultant made clear that he did lack capacity. In relation to the best interests the position was clear-cut; without delivery of nutrition through the PEG there was a growing risk that GTI might die, possibly within the next 2 to 3 weeks. </p>

That said, they will rarely, if ever, be determinative of P&#8217;s &#8216;best interests&#8217;.  Respecting individual autonomy does not always require P&#8217;s wishes to be afforded predominant weight. Sometimes it will be right to do so, sometimes it will not. The factors that fall to be considered in this intensely complex process are infinitely variable e.g. the nature of the contemplated treatment, how intrusive such treatment might be and crucially what the outcome of that treatment maybe for the individual patient. Into that complex matrix the appropriate weight to be given to P&#8217;s wishes will vary. What must be stressed is the obligation imposed by statute to inquire into these matters and for the decision maker fully to consider them. Finally, I would observe that an assessment of P&#8217;s wishes, views and attitudes are not to be confined within the narrow parameters of what P may have said. Strong feelings are often expressed non-verbally, sometimes in contradistinction to what is actually said. Evaluating the wider canvass may involve deriving an understanding of P&#8217;s views from what he may have done in the past in circumstances which may cast light on the strength of his views on the contemplated treatment. Mr Patel, counsel acting on behalf of M, has pointed to recent case law which he submits, and I agree, has emphasised the importance of giving proper weight to P&#8217;s wishes, feelings, beliefs and values see Wye Valley NHS Trust v B.</span></p>

		      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:-0.01in;text-indent:0.25in"><span style="font-style:italic">A special factor in the checklist applies to decisions about treatment which is necessary to keep the person alive (&#8216;life-sustaining treatment&#8217;) and this is set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4(5)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. The fundamental rule is that anyone who is deciding whether or not life-sustaining treatment is in the best interests of someone who lacks capacity to consent to or refuse such treatment must not be motivated by a desire to bring about the person&#8217;s death. 5.30 Whether a treatment is &#8216;lifesustaining&#8217; depends not only on the type of treatment, but also on the particular circumstances in which it may be prescribed. For example, in some situations giving antibiotics may be life-sustaining, whereas in other circumstances antibiotics are used to treat a non-life- threatening condition. It is up to the doctor or healthcare professional providing treatment to assess whether the treatment is life-sustaining in each particular situation. 5.31 All reasonable steps which are in the person&#8217;s best interests should be taken to prolong their life. There will be a limited number of cases where treatment is futile, overly burdensome to the patient or where there is no prospect of recovery. In circumstances such as these, it may be that an assessment of best interests leads to the conclusion that it would be in the best interests of the patient to withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment, even if this may result in the person&#8217;s death. The decision-maker must make a decision based on the best interests of the person who lacks capacity. They must not be motivated by a desire to bring about the person&#8217;s death for whatever reason, even if this is from a sense of compassion. Healthcare and social care staff should also refer to relevant professional guidance when making decisions regarding life-sustaining treatment. 5.32 As with all decisions, before deciding to withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment, the decision-maker must consider the range of treatment options available to work out what would be in the person&#8217;s best interests. All the factors in the best interests checklist should be considered, and in particular, the decision-maker should consider any statements that the person has previously made about their wishes and feelings about lifesustaining treatment. Importantly, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4(5)</ref> cannot be interpreted to mean that doctors are under an obligation to provide, or to continue to provide, lifesustaining treatment where that treatment is not in the best interests of the person, even where the person&#8217;s death is foreseen. Doctors must apply the best interests&#8217; checklist and use their professional skills to decide whether life-sustaining treatment is in the person&#8217;s best interests. If the doctor&#8217;s assessment is disputed, and there is no other way of resolving the dispute, ultimately the Court of Protection may be asked to decide what is in the person&#8217;s best interests. 5.34 Where a person has made a written statement in advance that requests particular medical treatments, such as artificial nutrition and hydration (ANH), these requests should be taken into account by the treating doctor in the same way as requests made by a patient who has the capacity to make such decisions. Like anyone else involved in making this decision, the doctor must weigh written statements alongside all other relevant factors to decide whether it is in the best interests of the patient to provide or continue life-sustaining treatment. 5.35 If someone has made an advance decision to refuse life-sustaining treatment, specific rules apply.  More information about these can be found in chapter 9 and in paragraph 5.45 below. 5.36 As mentioned in paragraph 5.33 above, where there is any doubt about the patient&#8217;s best interests, an application should be made to the Court of Protection for a decision as to whether withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatment is in the patient&#8217;s best interests.&#8221; </span></p>

The overwhelming weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that GTI is either unable to understand the information about the risks or his inability to take food or drink by mouth or that he is unable to use or weigh that information. These functional deficits are a consequence of his schizoaffective disorder; perhaps in part because the persecutory nature of the disorder leads him to question the reliability of the medical advice or perhaps in part is because of concrete thinking which prevents him considering alternatives to his own formulation of his situation. There is no means by which he could currently be enabled to make a decision save perhaps by authorising the treatment in order to restore proper nutrition and thus enable the resumption of the administration of enteral clozapine. On the evidence currently available it is possible to say that the current lack of capacity is likely to endure for some months if not years if his previous history of adapting to necessary change is an indicator </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0.01in">Dr Loo is a Consultant Gastroenterologist based at the NHS Trust. He says that following surgery at Aintree Hospital GTI was found to have an unsafe swallow and was thought to have oropharyngeal dysphagia secondary to neck trauma. He gave evidence that the Aintree Hospital is the regional ENT centre and that the notes made clear that they envisaged no future role for surgery for GTI. Thus it would appear that further surgery to correct the neurological damage is not a possibility. He went on to explain that swallow assessments had concluded that it was unsafe for GTI to eat food or fluids of any consistencies. Those tests included therapists giving GTI foods of different consistency to try to eat and observing his ability so to do. However, they also included a video fluoroscopic examination on two occasions which supported the swallow tests. Dr Loo said that this did not mean that GTI could not swallow small amounts of liquid or food and it might be that references to him drinking tap water whilst taking a shower or occasionally managing to get hold of some chocolate were examples of him having been able to consume some drink or food by mouth. However, Dr Loo emphasised these were self-reports by GTI and Dr Mercadillo expressed reservations about how much GTI might have consumed without the knowledge of staff. She pointed out that he had been subject to four person supervision reducing to three and now two and so his ability to consume anything covertly was very limited indeed. However Dr Loo in particular emphasised that being able to consume small amounts of water or a piece of chocolate carried with them the risk of aspiration or choking and the fact that GTI may have successfully consumed some was of no assistance in determining whether he could safely consume sufficient nutrition to keep himself alive and well.  </p>

The TPN tube had come out either as a result of GTI removing it or for other reasons. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0.01in">The only viable means of delivering sufficient nutrition to maintain GTI &#8217;s health was the insertion of a PEG. He accepted that this carried with it risks both in relation to the operation under general anaesthetic and in the aftermath. In particular given GTI&#8217;s antipathy to the procedure there was a risk that he might pull out the PEG tube which for the first two weeks would be a 15 to 20 cm silicon tube emerging from just below his breastbone. Pulling it out would risk trauma to the perforation including enlarging it. However, the tube is designed to be capable of removal without further operation. If discovered within an hour or so the tube could be reinserted without further operation. He thought they would attempt this having committed themselves to feeding by PEG as being in GTI&#8217;s best interests. After roughly a week to two weeks the tube could be replaced by a shorter tube more in the nature of a button which would be less intrusive. He accepted that if GTI reacted badly that might require physical restraint or medical sedation to stop him pulling out the PEG and whilst he could not contemplate this in the long term he did consider that it might be justified in the short-term to enable sufficient nutrition to be delivered to improve GTI&#8217;s health and to allow the re-administration of clozapine. If those could both occur GTI&#8217;s attitude to the PEG and his toleration of it might improve thus reducing the need for consideration of restraint or sedation. </p>

Corrective surgery is not an option. Aspiration of food or drink into the lungs carries with it the risk of recurrent pneumonia which even if treated may be life-threatening. Furthermore, aspiration of food or drink into the lungs may cause asphyxia and respiratory arrest again potentially life-threatening. Although GTI may not accept them the conclusions of the clinicians are fully supported by the evidence. The ability to occasionally swallow a chunk of chocolate or a mouthful of water does not detract from the general conclusion that normal eating and drinking are not possible and carry grave risks to GTI&#8217;s health.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0.01in">At present GTI is receiving very little in the way of nutrition. The reduction in his weight from 93kg to 66.7kg is a compelling indicator of the inability to provide GTI with the nutrition he needs by other means. Four full days of nutrition in the last 51 is plainly inadequate. An incomplete administration of four days TPN in the last nine is also clearly inadequate. The continuation of these attempts to deliver nutrition are clearly not going to deliver a level of nutrition that is consistent with GTI&#8217;s health needs. It hardly needed to be said by Dr Loo, but perhaps is worth emphasising, ultimately if GTI continues to receive so little nutrition his health will eventually collapse and he may die. The lack of nutrition has also led to the development of clozapine driven agranulocytosis and thus the best form of medication that can be provided for the schizoaffective disorder is now only capable of administration in doses which are inadequate to restore or maintain stability of his schizoaffective disorder. The malnutrition has also recently led to GTI developing an infection.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0.01in">I am therefore satisfied that GTI cannot safely eat or drink via his mouth. If he does so the risks of pneumonia or asphyxia are significant and the potential consequences life-threatening. It of course remains the case that GTI may try to eat or drink whether a PEG is inserted or not. Whilst under close supervision this will be difficult but it is hoped that GTI will be discharged back to his supported accommodation and he will then be able to eat or drink. Unless he accepts the dangers associated with so doing he will be at risk. However, the hope is that when his condition improves and his mental health stabilises again he will come to accept the need for the PEG and indeed the need to avoid eating and drinking. Dr Mercadillo was cautiously optimistic given her knowledge of GTI&#8217;s character and history to date. It is clear that the continuation of the delivery of nutrition by the means pursued since the operation in January is not likely to achieve its intended purpose or to maintain an adequate level of nutrition to GTI. It is likely that his malnutrition will worsen and eventually he will collapse. His ability to covertly take occasional drinks of water whilst in the shower or the occasional covert piece of chocolate may put off the deterioration but that seems inevitable. </p>

There is some risk of perforation of the stomach. Following the insertion of the PEG there are risks arising in relation to P attempting to remove the PEG which include tissue damage and peritonitis. This risk must be a real one given his expressed views both in opposition to the insertion of a PEG and his belief that he can obtain nutrition naturally but also in relation to his views that to do something against his will was reminiscent of Nazi Germany. If he feels that his personal autonomy has been grossly violated that might encourage him to seek to remove the PEG. </p>

His actions in January 2020 do not appear to have been an attempt at suicide although he used that expression in conversation with the Official Solicitor. They appear to have been an action which was entirely out of character. Therefore, on the basis that he wishes to live, the insertion of a PEG would appear to be the only means by which this could be achieved with minimal risk and with the possibility of discharge from hospital and some sort of return to normality. NG or TPN are not consistent it seems with a return to living in the community. Although the insertion of a PEG will not prevent him orally consuming food or drink the combination of a resumption of greater stability in his mental health together with provision of support in the community may reduce that risk. </p>

Although I am satisfied that he lacks capacity to make the decision it is he who has to live with it not I. I take seriously what he said to Mr Edwards, not only the fact of the PEG being intrusive, but more importantly, that the state overriding his wishes and imposing a medical procedure on him would be experienced by him as a gross insult to his personal autonomy and dictatorial. How would I feel were that to be done to me I ask rhetorically. Of course, it is almost impossible to provide an answer given that the situation GTI finds himself in is beyond my ability to truly understand. If I were to suggest that I might feel angry and violated I doubt that it does justice to GTI&#8217;s position. However there is another side to this from GTI&#8217;s perspective I think. I do note though that GTI said his mother means the world to him. I also see that he speaks positively about his life prior to his injury. He enjoyed socialising and would like to expand his circle of friends. He aspired to meeting a partner. He emerges as an intelligent and articulate man who has much to live for. I do not believe that he wishes to continue on a slow decline towards malnutrition, starvation and death. I do not believe he would dream of putting his mother through that appalling process. I believe he would wish to resume as good a life as was possible given the cards life has dealt him. That appears to have been his attitude before and the evidence of those who have been involved with him for some years appears to support the likelihood of him adapting and making the best of his situation again. Thus, whilst I accept that in approving the carrying out of this procedure I am overriding his wishes, I believe that in the short, medium and long term it is the best course for him and I hope that at some point in the future he might (even if only to himself) see that was so.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0.01in">The Court of Protection exists to take decisions such as this. It not the decision of the hospital or any of the members of staff, nor that of GTI or his family or of the Official Solicitor. Ultimately the state has delegated the making of decisions such as this to the judges of the Court of Protection and it is we who bear responsibility for these decisions. Although it is never easy to make a decision which is contrary to a person&#8217;s own wishes I am satisfied that the evidence in this case clearly establishes that it is in GTI&#8217;s best interests to undergo the PEG procedure and that he lacks capacity to take the decision himself. </p>
