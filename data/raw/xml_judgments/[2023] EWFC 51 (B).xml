      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt;color:#FF0000">This judgment was handed down in private. The Judge has given permission for the judgment (and any of the facts and matters contained in it) to be published on condition that in any report, no person other than the advocates or the solicitors instructing them (and other persons identified by name in the judgment itself) may be identified by name, current address or location [including school or work place]. In particular the anonymity of the child and the adult members of their family must be strictly preserved. All persons, including representatives of the media, must ensure that these conditions are strictly complied with. Failure to do so will be a contempt of court. For the avoidance of doubt, the strict prohibition on publishing the names and current addresses of the parties and the child will continue to apply where that information has been obtained by using the contents of this judgment to discover information already in the public domain.</span></p>

Christine&#8217;s father, who is present and represented, has taken the decision that he is not putting himself forward to care for Christine and therefore does not feature further in this judgment. Her mother, whom I will call Jane, is a young mother who for reasons I do not need to relate in this judgment has had a previous child, Ben, removed from her care. The first set of proceedings in relation to that child concluded in July 2021 initially with Ben remaining in his mother&#8217;s care pursuant to a 12-month supervision order. However, that plan was not successful and Ben was placed in foster care in October 2021. The second set of proceedings in relation to Ben concluded when Ben was placed with an alternative carer by way of a Special Guardianship Order in November 2022.</span></p>

Ms Agamemnon acknowledged that it would have been helpful if the details of that conversation was included in the initial statement. She pointed out, and I agree, that there was a real possibility that Jane would not have nominated any maternal relatives both because of the strained relationships and Jane&#8217;s own belief, which may of course be correct, that Christine would be returning to her care. I also note that Jane now has the benefit of an intermediary following a report that indicates some difficulties in her levels of comprehension.</span></p>

In this matter the obvious point is that the local authority already knew that Jane&#8217;s relationships with her family members were fractured and therefore it was always unlikely she was going to be forthcoming about potential alternative relative carers. Furthermore, Jane&#8217;s view has always been that Christine should and would be likely to be returning to her care. The local authority considers at least that there is a real possibility that would not be the case. No one at the local authority seemed to realise prior to February 2023 that those two factors combined made it unlikely that Jane would volunteer relatives to be assessed or indeed that if she had discussions with relatives, the picture she would paint to them would possibly be too optimistic.</span></p>

In short, such an outcome is and should be a matter of last resort as it represents a huge and largely irreversible interference by the state in the family life of the parents and child. In such circumstances the state should take all reasonable steps to avoid such interference.
