I am asked instead to make a finding that there were vitiating factors that will negate any effect the agreements might otherwise have.  </p>

The wife&#8217;s application is dated 6 December 2019 and was heard by me on 20 and 21 May 2020, with Judgment reserved, as the hearing finished in the afternoon of the second day and there was a considerable volume of material to digest.  </p>

As is my custom in respect of all remote hearings, I asked Counsel to confirm on behalf of their respective clients that they were content for the matter to proceed remotely. Both counsel indicated that they were and, indeed, in circumstances where there has been no oral evidence, this type of hearing is, in my judgement, particularly well-suited to being dealt with remotely.  It also has the advantage that I have been able to play back the entire hearing before writing this Judgment.  I am bound to say that I have found this to be a very considerable advantage: watching the entire hearing is immeasurably better than reading my own notes and I trust that, as we review in due course the benefits and drawbacks of remote hearings, we shall bear this in mind. The capacity to play back any part of the hearing has been of immense value to me. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">At the outset of the May 2020 hearing there was a dispute between counsel as to whether I should hear the set-aside application or the strike out application first. Having considered the matter and read the parties&#8217; written submissions, it was clear to me that there was, at least, an arguable case that the wife&#8217;s set-aside application should be struck out and it was obviously logical and appropriate for me to hear that first. Although there was no formal strike out application issued, Mr Mitchell QC, on behalf of the husband, had advertised in an e-mail exchange with Mr Chamberlayne dated 11 May (i.e. 9 days before the hearing) that &#8220;there is a live point about admissibility and delay which, if successful, disposes of the application without evidence&#8221;.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Chamberlayne, in a note attached to an email sent to me on 26 June 2020, described the strike out application as being &#8220;completely unadvertised&#8221;. He also suggested in that note that &#8220;we were substantially disadvantaged by the tactic employed&#8221; and that the strike out application should not have been heard. He even went so far as to suggest in his e-mail that the strike out application was &#8220;an abuse of process itself&#8221;.  I disagree. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The husband&#8217;s arguments in support of his strike out application would all in effect have been deployed in defence of the set-aside application. If there is cogent evidence to suggest that an application should be struck out it is, in my judgement, plainly correct to hear the strike out application first. Moreover, the two day time estimate for this case was woefully inadequate, especially given that there was half a day&#8217;s reading suggested by counsel before we could even commence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Chamberlayne submitted that here, as in <span style="font-style:italic">Ketteridge</span>, the strike out application, if made, should have been made immediately.  However, a proper analysis of the decision of Rimer J shows how very different the circumstances there were.  In the instant case, the litigation was fully on hold in the sense that the parties were waiting for the hearing before me for &#8220;further consideration of the wife&#8217;s claim for financial remedy&#8221; following the decision of the Court of Appeal in December 2018.  More than three years after my original decision, the wife was seeking to set aside one of my central findings, yet it is she who now, through Mr Chamberlayne, not only complains about the <span style="font-style:italic">husband&#8217;s</span> delay, but uses it as the basis of her argument that, on account of delay, I should not hear the application.  The irony of this situation is manifest.  At the first hearing of that application, the husband asked me to strike it out.  The last hearing before me, i.e. before the May 2020 hearing, was in November 2019, when the wife indicated that she &#8220;intended&#8221; to bring a set aside application (although she was yet to make it).   </p>

I further provided for the filing of evidence in respect of that intended claim.  The wife duly made the setaside application on 9 December 2019 and filed her statement in support on 18 December.  The husband filed his statement in opposition on 21 January 2020. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In <span style="font-style:italic">Ketteridge</span>, the point was that the Defendant had defended the claim on its merits, at very considerable expense to all, instead of applying to strike out the claim.  To use an analogy, it was a bit like submitting to the jurisdiction in a conflicts case.  The basis of his strike out application had nothing to do with the merits, rather it was that, if the Claimant had a claim against the relevant Defendant, it should have brought the claim in an earlier round of litigation.  The Judge found that choosing to defend the claim on its merits amounted to acquiescence.  This is quite different from the instant case where, </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">On 22 December 2016 I handed down my Judgment in respect of the wife&#8217;s application for a financial remedy order. The parties argued for some months after that Judgment about the drafting of the order and the final order was not sealed until August 2017, following a half day hearing about the terms of the order in June 2017. In my December 2016 Judgment, I made it clear that I thought that the wife should be provided with a home in her own name as well as other capital provision, but I found that I was constrained by the prorogation clause from giving full effect to that. The precise details of that are no longer relevant. I found that I was constrained by the combined effect of the prenuptial agreements into which the parties entered and my interpretation of the European Maintenance Agreement from making the provision for the wife which I wished to make. I encouraged the parties to try hard to settle their differences. It was obvious that I was encouraging the husband to make provision more generous than that which I had felt able to make because of the constraints referred to above. </p>

However, the court made clear that, where there was a valid prenuptial agreement (or agreements, as I had found), which provided that the wife had contracted out of a division of the assets based on sharing, the court was likely to regard fairness as demanding that she receive a settlement limited to that which provided for her needs. The court made it clear, however, that this would not <span style="font-weight:bold">inevitably</span> be the outcome in every case because the court remained obliged to consider all the factors pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref>.  </p>

The parties&#8217; children were aged 8 and 12 when the case was before me in 2016. They are now respectively 12 and 16 and it is regrettable that their young lives will have been overshadowed by their parents&#8217; litigation. The husband has now spent &#163;1,003,959 on this litigation and expects to spend a further &#163;301,000 by the time the case has finished (I should say that, by tragically sad circumstances, his original leading counsel is no longer available). </p>

Although I have not received any up to date evidence about this, I imagine that the value of the assets which I identified at that time will have decreased, given the events which have overwhelmed the world since 2016. This means that the parties have now spent at least 20% of their net worth litigating against each other.  It would, I respectfully suggest, have been wiser to spend that money on each other and not on their excellent, but expensive, legal teams.  It is, of course, a matter for them, but it would be hard to explain to that elusive &#8220;reasonable person&#8221; how they are where they are. </p>

The second is the wife&#8217;s reply at 0950 of the same date which appears at page A89. I pause to note that this &#8220;new&#8221; material upon which the wife seeks to rely is not contemporaneous to the signing of the prenuptial agreements. The prenuptial agreements were all signed in 2000. The parties married in December 2000. The wife issued her petition for divorce on 20 February 2015. The documents on which the wife now seeks to rely both post-date the issuing of her divorce proceedings.  The wife issued her Form A in February 2015 and the parties exchanged their Form Es in June 2015. The emails upon which the wife now seeks to rely were, therefore, exchanged at the height of this litigation. It is common ground that, on 22 July 2015, there was a party at the former matrimonial home which the husband attended and at which the husband and the wife had a row about a without prejudice offer that the husband had made to the wife a few days earlier. It is clear to me the context of this email exchange is important.  It manifestly is not evidence of what happened in 2000.  At best, it is evidence of what the parties said to each other in 2015 when they were embroiled in financial remedy proceedings.   </p>

I now have two versions of her statement, but the one that the wife relied on in court, and which formed part of the court bundle in front of me in 2016, made no reference to this email exchange. At that stage (December 2016) I did not have the earlier signed but unused statement. As it happens, that statement was accidentally produced by the wife&#8217;s solicitors when preparing the bundle for the May 2020 hearing.

The wife&#8217;s solicitors initially referred to this earlier statement as a &#8220;draft&#8221;, but when it was pointed out by the husband&#8217;s solicitors that it had been signed, they accepted that it was, indeed, a statement signed by the wife. There are some important and significant differences between the signed, but unused, statement and the signed, but used, statement. In particular, the unused statement includes this passage: </p>

However, there is a strong public interest in the finality of litigation, and in this case (leaving aside the issue of privilege) the consequence of admitting fresh evidence would probably be the case would have to be remitted to the judge for the primary finding of fact to be reconsidered. This would add further to the delay and expense that has already risen. Finally, and decisively, no good reason whatever has been given for the failure to produce this evidence at trial.  </span></p>

Importantly, the Court of Appeal said that no good reason had been given for the failure to produce the evidence at trial. Does the same apply now as applied when the Court of Appeal ruled against the wife on Ground 4 in December 2018?  Mr Chamberlayne says not and I now turn to address the case that he has forcefully advanced.  </p>

At that time there was binding Court of Appeal authority in the form of the then recent (March 2017) Court of Appeal decision in Takhar v Gracefield Developments (and two other Court of Appeal decisions to the same effect) that where an application to admit new evidence to set aside/appeal an earlier decision was based on a claim that the new evidence showed fraud, permission would be refused unless the appellant could show that the material could not have been produced at the original hearing if reasonable diligence had been used. However, the Supreme Court, sitting as a court of seven judges, reversed Takhar and the other Court of Appeal authorities on 29 March 2019 &#8211; UKSC 2019 13. The law now is that fraud unravels all and therefore:- </p>

But once it is satisfied, there are no degrees of fraud which can affect the right to have the judgment set aside.&#8221; </span></p>

It was only after judgment &#8211; the case having proceeded on the assumption that she had signed the document &#8211; that she obtained evidence that in fact her signature had been forged. That gave rise to a wholly new cause of action, namely for fraud which, notwithstanding the prior judgment in the action which she had lost, she was permitted by the Supreme Court to advance as a fresh claim. The judgments in that case raise the possibility, obiter, that had she even <span style="font-style:italic">argued </span>first time around that the signature was forged, albeit that she had lacked the evidence to prove it, she might not have been permitted to pursue her fresh claim. </p>

However, that power was to be exercised only where it was just and proportionate to do so, and that was likely to be only in very exceptional circumstances.  Mr Chamberlayne&#8217;s complaint is that the wife &#8220;has had no opportunity to present her evidence or for the court to hear from H about the manifestly false evidence he gave at the original trial&#8221;.  As I have set out above, the wife has had since (at least)  November 2016 to show me the &#8220;new&#8221; material.  In fact, as the unused but signed statement shows, she has in fact had since before the 2016 hearing started the opportunity of showing me the material. </span></p>
