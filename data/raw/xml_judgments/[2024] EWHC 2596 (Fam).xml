The mother asserted that the children &#8220;wanted to give more information to Cafcass&#8221;; the children had seen Ms Callaghan on 15 August 2024.  The father opposed the application.  Ms Callaghan had been approached directly by the mother on 9 September to agree to this course, but had rightly declined, absent a court order.  Given that the mother had placed the children&#8217;s so-called &#8216;objections&#8217; to a return at the centre of her defence to the application, I considered (on a review of the documents only, and without hearing oral argument) that it would only be right for me to accede to her application so that I could obtain the children&#8217;s most up-to-date views, and could then proceed with the hearing without delay.   Ms Callaghan met with the children on the morning of the hearing and helpfully prepared a concise note of their discussions which she filed.</p>

They both travelled extensively between New Zealand and England for work, and started living together in this country in about 2006.  They returned temporarily to New Zealand to marry in 2011, and moved there permanently in 2013. By the time of their first emigration Will had been born (in the UK), in 2012, and had spent his first year.  Ed was born in New Zealand in 2014. The mother became homesick; life was not working out for her as planned, and arrangements for Will&#8217;s nursery were not to her liking.  Accordingly, the family returned to the UK in 2016 with a view to remaining permanently; they stayed here only about nine months (between 2016-2017: see below) emigrating a second time back to New Zealand in March 2017.  </p>

The mother has provided many examples in her written evidence of the father&#8217;s alleged temper, and his uncontained use of expletives and intimidating behaviour in front of the children; she contends that the children have been fearful of their father when he is angry.

It requires an evaluation of all relevant circumstances. It focuses on the situation of the child, with the purposes and intentions of the parents being merely among the relevant factors. It is necessary to assess the degree of integration of the child into a social and family environment in the country in question. The social and family environment of an infant or young child is shared with those (whether parents or others) on whom she is dependent. Hence it is necessary, in such a case, to assess the integration of that person or persons in the social and family environment of the country concerned. The essentially factual and individual nature of the inquiry should not be glossed with legal concepts which would produce a different result from that which the factual inquiry would produce."</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">How does this apply here?  There is no doubt in this case that the children were habitually resident in New Zealand up to December 2023.  It is the father&#8217;s case that the children have retained their habitual residence in New Zealand. He is pleased that the children have engaged in social activities in England since December last year, and would not have wished them to go without the opportunity to participate in a range of entertaining, child-focused pursuits.  However, he argues, this does not mean that the children&#8217;s habitual residence has changed.  It is the mother&#8217;s case that by the time that she repudiated the agreement to return, the children&#8217;s habitual residence had changed, and that they were habitually resident in England.</p>

It is of some (but limited) significance that the parents were initially discussing a 1-2 year visit for the boys and the mother to England, which illuminates (to a limited degree) the father&#8217;s consideration (at least) of the boys being away from New Zealand for a particularly prolonged time.  That said, this 1-2 year period was not ultimately agreed, and I have of course considered the actual facts on the undisputed evidential basis that the parental agreement was for a 6-month stay in England.</p>

These points militate against a finding of a change of habitual residence.  I further take into account that the boys and the mother were in temporary, rented, accommodation at the point of the repudiation; the relative insecurity of her tenure (she was indeed required to leave the property, in June 2024, after six months) plainly lacked permanence, but also inherently lacked a degree of stability too.  I note that the boys did not bring all of their belongings when they travelled to this country, but merely brought suitcases of clothes.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, let me consider what the boys had left behind.  It is clear from the evidence (the parties indeed agree) that the mother and children lived reasonably isolated lives in New Zealand; the children were home-schooled; it seems likely on the evidence that the mother was diffident about arranging social activities for them.  The boys undertook some sports including hockey, and made friends in that way, though it was notable that in his recent discussion with Ms Callaghan, Will said that he had &#8220;not really&#8221; kept in touch with his friends in New Zealand since being here.  The father&#8217;s own evidence shines a light on the family situation:</p>

She cannot bear to be separated from them &#8230;  [the mother] refused to go anywhere to meet people or make friends, making the boys her life.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father appears to have accepted that the boys had fewer activities in New Zealand than they have enjoyed in England, as the mother was &#8220;reluctant&#8221; to arrange them; he separately spoke of the mother&#8217;s emotional dependence (he implied <span style="font-style:italic">over</span>-dependence) on the children, and her tendency to &#8220;keep them close to her&#8221;.   The mother described the situation thus:</p>

		      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:1.05in">&#8220;&#8230; there was less structured activities in New Zealand, and although we lived a 10 mile drive from [town X] and 20 minutes from [town Y] we spent the majority of our time at the library or walking the dog [Murphy].

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, the family home had been rented out and then sold in New Zealand; the parents and the children were living in tied accommodation connected to the father&#8217;s work.  Given the parents&#8217; imminent separation upon the breakdown of their marriage, such stability and security which the boys would have derived from the continuation of their familiar home surroundings in New Zealand would thereby be lost; this was more than a symbolic loss of an enduring connection with the place where they had for the last few years been raised, it was a very real severance with their familiar environment there.  Their extended family in New Zealand was not geographically particularly close (a 4-5 hour drive away) and I did not get the impression from the evidence filed that the boys were particularly emotionally close to their paternal extended family either; the mother deposed to the fact that they have made &#8220;little to no contact&#8221; with the boys since they have been in England.  While I am convinced that the boys adore their father, his probable flashes of temper (as I find, on the documents) had (it would appear from the mother&#8217;s contemporaneous accounts, see above) at times caused them distress, and it was likely that they would have experienced at least transient periods of emotional insecurity even within their home environment. Will&#8217;s recent comment about his mother&#8217;s sadness in New Zealand (see below) may have contributed to a lack of confidence in the stability of the domestic arrangements.  The father accepts that the parents had &#8220;different approaches to parenting&#8221;, and accepts that he had at times &#8220;raised my voice&#8221; to discipline the children; Dr. McClintock spoke of the need for the family to develop &#8220;more settled functioning&#8221; should they return, suggesting a lack of &#8216;settled functioning&#8217; in the past.  Thus, while the boys had spent almost all of their childhoods habitually resident in New Zealand, for the reasons set out in this and the foregoing paragraph, I was left with the impression that their roots were laid there in somewhat unnourishing and emotionally impoverished turf.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, over the first five months of this year, the children re-kindled relationships with the maternal family, including notably their maternal grandparents who lived close by.  The wider maternal family (specifically and aunt and uncle) also lived close to the home which the mother had rented; the boys were able to forge bonds with their similar-age maternal cousins, which I am satisfied they have done.  The mother describes a community of friends surrounding the boys (and her) on their return to this country, with whom the boys comfortably and easily related.  The boys expressed to Ms Callaghan, and to their GP (attendance in June 2024), how much they preferred (and continue to prefer) life in England (&#8220;really enjoying it&#8221;: per GP) which indicates a degree of subjective integration.  I take into account the father&#8217;s case that the mother may have sought to influence the boys in the expression of their views; however, Ms Callaghan is satisfied, and I do not doubt on the evidence presented, that this is their genuine view; the absence of cogent reasoning for this view reflects, perhaps, their relative lack of maturity.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fourthly, had the boys been in mainstream schooling in England over the first five months of this year, this would be likely to have buttressed a finding of social integration in their new environment; they have of course been home-schooled in this country (as they were in New Zealand), and this argument does not therefore arise.  Indeed, the home-schooling arrangement in both countries creates an essentially neutral factor in my overall evaluation.  That all said, the evidence reveals that the boys have become part of a wider friendship group of young children in the locality in England, many of whom are also home-schooled, whom they meet at least weekly; they attend a &#8216;Home Education Group&#8217; of young people from fourteen families.   Will attends two &#8216;young engineers&#8217; groups which together meet twice per week, where he has made friends; both boys attend a &#8216;Ninja&#8217; activity group once per week.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fifthly, it is of some significance that these boys are dual nationals, born to an English mother.  It is also relevant that the mother herself &#8211; the children&#8217;s primary carer &#8211; was, over the first five months of this year, considerably happier, more relaxed and settled than she had been in New Zealand.  Will noticed this.  This will probably have impacted favourably on the boys&#8217; experience of their first few months here and helped them to settle.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Sixthly, I attach some significance to the fact that Murphy travelled with the boys and the mother to England (albeit on flight one day later); the decision to bring the beloved family pet on this visit reflects an unusual degree of commitment on the part of the entire family to the success of the temporary relocation for the mother and the boys.  The boys are plainly extremely attached to Murphy, and describe him as a member of the family; his presence in their lives in this country has served, as the boys themselves have described, to facilitate their sense of being &#8216;at home&#8217;, and has enhanced their sense of belonging to their new environment.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother raised a range of other factors which, she argued, demonstrated integration of the boys within their new environment in England. For instance, the children were registered with medical, dental and optician services, and attended for appointments and vaccinations; additionally, the boys have attended a &#8216;Teens in Crisis&#8217; counselling group.  These points offer some, though even cumulatively relatively limited, support for my ultimate conclusion.    The mother raised other points (not discussed here) which for completeness I should say have not affected my conclusion whatsoever.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A point which has troubled me while reflecting on the evidence for the purposes of this judgment is whether the mother misled the father about her intention to return to New Zealand when they agreed the six-month visit and she set off with his blessing in December 2023; specifically I have considered whether it was always in her mind that she would not return to New Zealand.  I found nothing which pointed to a deception of this nature; indeed, while I am satisfied that she was unhappy in New Zealand particularly in the tail-end of 2023, I consider it more likely than not that she saw the six-month visit to England as a respite (see her messages to her family above) and it was only when she had arrived in this country did she start to see her and the boys&#8217; longer-term future differently.</p>

Had any (even minor) aspect of this case been different in any material way, I could well envisage having found differently &#8211; namely that the boys had remained habitually resident in New Zealand, even after their five months&#8217; stay in England.  Thus, my decision should not offer any encouragement to a parent on an extended visit to this country to argue that habitual residence changes by virtue of the passage of time, and/or by reference to any one or more of the other factors which have been relevant in my decision here. </p>

Will was described by Ms Callaghan as sensitive and articulate; both boys are described as sociable.  Ms Callahan described them as having age appropriate understanding of the proceedings, and their respective levels of maturity were generally consistent with their chronological ages. She felt that both boys were quite &#8220;balanced&#8221; when talking about their parents. I find that they both have acquired an age and degree of maturity at which it would be appropriate to take account of their views.</p>

In my opinion she has experienced an adjustment disorder, also known as reactive depression, in response to the stresses which arose in the relationship with her former partner, her attempts to extricate herself from that relationship and to build a new life for herself and the children in the United Kingdom. When the current proceedings commenced, this acted as a further stressor and at interview she was clearly distressed, very anxious, there was some evidence of a relative lack of personal care and the thought of returning to New Zealand has compounded her distress&#8230;</p>

Although it is for the Court to decide on how the parents have treated one another, I did not feel that the clinical picture was one of, for example, post traumatic stress disorder and instead, the most prominent symptom was one of anxiety, with prominent thoughts of how she had reportedly been treated by the father and a concern about how she would cope if required to return to New Zealand&#8221;.</p>

Antidepressant medication is often used for patients who have marked levels of anxiety and such medication has the bonus of helping to treat any underlying depressive episode which may not have been apparent to the clinician. The choice of antidepressant is up to the general practitioner to decide upon, but it should be prescribed, at a clinically effective dose, over at least the next year as [the mother] deals with the stress of the current proceedings and the impact of the decision regarding where the children should be placed&#8230;.</p>

If she is permitted to remain in the United Kingdom with the children then it is highly likely that this combination of medication and talking therapy would lead to a significant clinical improvement, probably over a period of a small number of weeks&#8221;.</p>

Dr McClintock was of the view that if the mother is required to return to New Zealand, &#8220;there will be a deterioration in her mental health but I cannot quantify it&#8221;; as I mentioned in &#167;75 above, Dr. McClintock was clear that the mother would need to undergo some intensive chemical and talking therapy in the next few weeks before she would be well enough to return to New Zealand.  The success of that therapy could plainly not be assured.   Dr. McClintock also advised that, in the event of a return, it would be beneficial for there to be an assessment of the family unit conducted by a child psychiatrist or psychologist, with a view to addressing in particular the father&#8217;s concerns that the mother and children have perhaps a particularly strong emotional mutual dependency.  He hoped that a child mental health expert could make recommendations about, for example, family based therapy with a view to achieving &#8220;more settled functioning&#8221;.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father has offered a wide range of protective measures to mitigate any intolerability in the children&#8217;s situation.  It is unnecessary for me to rehearse these proposed measures here; they responsibly and appropriately meet many of the concerns of the mother, but they ultimately would have failed to address the significant vulnerability of her particular situation given the combination of factors which I have set out at &#167;75 above.  I can confirm that the mother&#8217;s case in relation to Article 13(b) was, in my judgment, on balance established.  There was a significant question mark over whether she would ever have been well enough to return to New Zealand; had I been required to exercise my discretion in light of my findings in this regard, I would not have returned the children.</p>

I am convinced that he has a vital role to play in the lives of these two young boys.  I hope that he is able to reflect on some of the evidence which has been filed, which describes his behaviour, and (although I realise that he disputes it) consider how he may address what the mother has said.  I am hopeful that he can build on the success of his recent trip to England to see the boys, by making further visits here over upcoming months.  It would be wrong for me to make any comment about the mid to long term future for this family, which is likely to be the subject of further discussion, possibly mediation, and in the event of continuing dispute, further litigation.</p>
