However, the consent box in section 3 has been ticked and the second page, which contained section 3, has been signed at the foot by X. The loss of the third page, or any original error in relation to section 5, are irrelevant; X&#8217;s signature at the foot of the second page is sufficient to satisfy the statutory requirement: see the authorities referred to in paragraph 10 above.

However, the evidence of both X and Y in their joint witness statement is that Y signed the Form WP at the same time as X signed the Form PP. That evidence has not been challenged. There is no reason to doubt. It is to an extent corroborated by the clinic&#8217;s evidence as to its standard practice. I accept their evidence. The Form WP has, I find, been lost or mislaid.
