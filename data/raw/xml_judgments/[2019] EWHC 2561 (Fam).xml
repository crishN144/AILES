	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">This judgment represents another instalment in the long-running litigation consequent upon the breakdown of the marriage of Tatiana Akhmedova [&#8220;the Wife&#8221;] and Farkhad Teimur Akhmedov [&#8220;the Husband&#8221;]. In December 2016 Haddon-Cave J (as he then was) ordered the Husband to pay the Wife the sum of &#163;453,576,152 in settlement of her financial claims in respect of the marriage. Regrettably, the Husband has not voluntarily paid a penny of that award and, to date, enforcement has only been possible in respect of a very small proportion of that sum (around &#163;5 million or so). In a judgment dated April 2018, Haddon-Cave J described the Husband as engaging in an &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">elaborate and contumacious campaign to evade and frustrate the enforcement of the judgment debt against him</span>&#8221;. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The English court has already granted orders against various offshore companies and other entities used by the Husband as part of this campaign of evasion, namely against the Second to the Seventh Respondents. This application seeks similar relief against two Liechtenstein trustees which have been used to hide and thus &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">protect</span>&#8221; the Husband&#8217;s assets: the Eighth Respondent, &#8220;Counselor&#8221;, and the Ninth Respondent, &#8220;Sobaldo&#8221;. The application relates to a portfolio of cash and securities worth approximately US$650 million in December 2016 which was previously owned by the Husband (through Cotor Investment SA, &#8220;Cotor&#8221;, as his nominee) and held at UBS in Switzerland [&#8220;the Monetary Assets&#8221;]. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Shortly after the conclusion of the trial before Haddon-Cave J in December 2016, it was discovered that, during the course of the trial, the Husband had caused the Monetary Assets to be spirited away to Liechtenstein in order to ensure that the Wife would not be able to enforce a judgment against them. Such was the success of that scheme that, until recently, the Wife had been unable to ascertain what had happened to the Monetary Assets after they reached Liechtenstein. However, the Wife now has information which suggests that some or all of the Monetary Assets have been transferred into a number of Liechtenstein trusts of which Counselor and Sobaldo are trustees. Counselor and an entity under common control, WalPart Trust Reg., are Liechtenstein licensed trust companies which claim to specialise in, amongst other matters, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">asset protection</span>&#8221;. Counselor and WalPart are associated with a Liechtenstein law firm, Walch &amp; Schurti. Sobaldo appears to be associated with both Counselor and WalPart in that its registered address is care of WalPart and its board of directors is made up of three individuals who are or were also directors of Counselor. Counselor, WalPart and Walch &amp; Schurti appear to have played a key role since late 2016 in holding the Husband&#8217;s assets in a way which frustrates enforcement of the English court&#8217;s judgments and orders. I note that the Counselor entities are responsible for managing other Liechtenstein entities which have already been found by Haddon-Cave J to have entered into transactions intended to put assets beyond the Wife&#8217;s reach. </p>

This process revealed that two Liechtenstein Anstalts, Qubo 1 and Qubo 2, had recently been established and had taken ownership of (at least) the Artwork. Haddon-Cave J joined Qubo 1 and Qubo 2 to the English proceedings and concluded that they were no more than the Husband&#8217;s ciphers and alter egos. He made Qubo 1 and Qubo 2 jointly and severally liable for the sum of &#163;350 million and granted freezing orders against them. On 28 December 2016 the Liechtenstein Court granted payment orders against Qubo 1 and Qubo 2 (thereby effectively enforcing the English order) as well as making its own freezing orders. Both English and Liechtenstein orders were served on Qubo 1 and Qubo 2 on 29 December 2016. However, at this time, the Wife did not know that the Vessel had been transferred to Qubo 2; </p>

In 2018 Haddon-Cave J concluded that the transfer was in breach of both the English and Liechtenstein freezing orders. I note that this is disputed by Counselor since a criminal complaint has been made in Liechtenstein against the wife&#8217;s Liechtenstein lawyer, Mr Arnold, for providing a declaration in proceedings in the Marshall Islands in which he stated that the transfers were in breach of the freezing orders. In any event, as Ms Dilnot submitted, the Wife does not need to rely on Haddon-Cave J&#8217;s finding. On any view, the transfer was undertaken by Qubo 2 at a time when it knew that it was subject to an English judgment as well as a Liechtenstein payment order which it could only satisfy using the value of the Vessel. The transfer was undoubtedly intended to prevent enforcement of the English and Liechtenstein orders against the Vessel as has subsequently been admitted by one of Counselor&#8217;s directors, Dr Schurti; </p>

She thus sought commensurate relief against Straight. Haddon-Cave J concluded that the transfer of the Vessel to Straight was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">part of H&#8217;s continuing campaign to defeat W by concealing his assets in a web of offshore companies</span>&#8221;. He granted a further order on 21 March 2018, pursuant to which he (a) pierced Straight&#8217;s corporate veil, (b) declared Straight to be the Husband&#8217;s alter ego, (c) ordered that the Vessel be transferred to the Wife, and (d) granted an order requiring Straight to pay the judgment debt up to the current value of the Vessel to the Wife.   I record that, in contempt of court, the Husband and Straight have failed to transfer the Vessel to the Wife and have paid no monetary equivalent to her. In fact, the Husband and his associates appear to be doing all they can to prevent the enforcement of the English court&#8217;s orders including challenging all attempts to restrain the Vessel in Dubai and opposing the enforcement proceedings in the Marshall Islands; </p>

To date, Straight has failed to comply with my order and it would appear that the positive steps required by my order have not been taken. Accordingly, the Wife applied on 21 May 2019 for declarations that Straight and Counselor are in contempt and for orders of committal against the individual directors of Counselor. This application is listed to be heard on 25 October 2019.   </p>

Furthermore, Ms Dilnot submitted that Liechtenstein was chosen as a suitable venue because, unlike Switzerland, it is not party to any enforcement convention with the United Kingdom. It is thus difficult to enforce English judgments and orders there as, for example, the judgment debtor has a right to re-litigate the underlying dispute on the merits before the courts in Liechtenstein; </p>

Copies of these complaints were provided by the Constitutional Court (apparently in error) to the wife&#8217;s Liechtenstein lawyers, Gasser Partner, in June 2018. Gasser Partner have confirmed that there is no restriction on using this material as a matter of Liechtenstein law and have also confirmed that WalPart has been notified that the Wife was sent a copy of both complaints. Ms Dilnot accepted that it was possible the Respondents might argue that the English court should exercise its discretion under Civil Procedure Rules 1998 r.32.1(2) [&#8220;the CPR&#8221;] to exclude this evidence as it is confidential information provided to the Wife in error. She submitted however that this was relevant and significant evidence obtained without any impropriety on the Wife&#8217;s part and it should not be excluded, especially given that it is information being wrongly concealed by the Husband in breach of his obligations to the English court. I accept that submission for the reasons advanced by Ms Dilnot. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The context of both complaints requires some brief background to the Liechtenstein criminal proceedings. In May 2017 the Wife filed a criminal complaint with the Public Prosecutor against the Husband, Cotor and persons unknown based on a suspicion that the offence of prevention of enforcement had been committed contrary to section 162 of the Liechtenstein Criminal Code. That section makes it an offence punishable by imprisonment for a debtor to conceal, discard, dispose of or forfeit any part of his assets, or to acknowledge a non-existent liability, or otherwise to actually reduce the appearance of his assets, thereby preventing or reducing the satisfaction of a creditor by way of foreclosure in pending proceedings. Essentially the complaint was that the Husband and Cotor had transferred the Artwork and the Monetary Assets away from Cotor knowing that enforcement proceedings may take place in view of the pending court proceedings in England. The Liechtenstein courts thus opened a criminal case and, during the course of his investigation, certain orders were granted to the Public Prosecutor.  </p>

These orders were made under section 97a of the Liechtenstein Criminal Procedure Code which permits the court, on the request of the Public Prosecutor, to freeze assets where it is feared that, otherwise, steps might be taken which would jeopardise a subsequent order for the forfeiture of assets obtained for or under the commission of a criminal offence. </p>

The obvious inference was that these transfers were settlements of the Monetary Assets into trusts associated with the Husband and/or his family. </p>

The court found that the Husband had conducted an &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">elaborate and contumacious campaign to evade and frustrate the enforcement of the judgment debt against him</span>&#8221; and that he had engaged in a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">continuing campaign to defeat W by concealing his assets in a web of offshore companies</span>&#8221;.

Given these findings, the transfer of the Monetary Assets into Liechtenstein structures during December 2016 and in 2017 appeared to form part of the same overall strategy as the transfer of the Artwork and the Vessel into Liechtenstein structures. It can therefore readily be inferred that the transfer of the Monetary Assets was carried out with the same prohibited purpose as those transfers. </p>

The Husband had been using Cotor as his &#8220;piggy bank&#8221;, holding assets at UBS in Switzerland since at least 2013. The only credible explanation for the sudden movement of assets to Liechtenstein and into multiple Liechtenstein trusts - at precisely the time when judgment in England had become imminent and was then delivered - is that the Husband had decided to fortify his defences against enforcement of that judgment. That is particularly so given that all his other substantial assets also moved to Liechtenstein at the same time. Ms Dilnot submitted that it would be unreal to think that the Husband coincidentally decided at that time to move substantially all of his assets to Liechtenstein for an innocent purpose (for example, tax or estate planning) rather than because he was about to be, or had just been, found liable to pay &#163;350 million to the Wife. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Fifth, it appears that the funds received by the Arbaj Trust, the Longlaster Trust and the Carnation Trust may not have come directly from Cotor. Ms Dilnot submitted that this did not matter because, where a transaction infringing <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/423" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.423</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45" uk:canonical="1986 c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">IA 1986</ref> had taken place, the court was permitted to make orders not only against the immediate recipient but also against subsequent transferees of funds. Thus, if the initial transfer from Cotor to trust X was susceptible to challenge under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/423" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 423</ref>, then an order could also be made against anyone to whom trust X transferred those same funds (such as one of the Known Trusts).

Ms Dilnot argued that it was overwhelmingly likely that the Known Trusts (a) did not acquire the money &#8220;for value&#8221;, and/or (b) had notice of the relevant circumstances, such that orders could be made against them as subsequent recipients of the funds. In the alternative, Ms Dilnot submitted that, if Cotor transferred money to trust X which later transferred that money to one of the Known Trusts, the subsequent transfer between trust X and the Known Trust would itself be open to challenge under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/423" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 423</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45" uk:canonical="1986 c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">IA 1986</ref> given that it could safely be inferred that at least one purpose of the further transfer would be to prejudice the Wife&#8217;s ability to bring a claim against trust X on the basis that it had received the funds as part of a scheme to prevent the Wife enforcing her judgment. </p>

Given that the conduct in this case was intended to frustrate an imminent and then actual judgment of the English court and that judgment was granted in divorce proceedings taking place in England in respect of which the Husband had submitted to the jurisdiction and that the intended and only victim of these acts is an English resident, namely the Wife, there is plainly sufficient connection with England. In coming to that view, I have considered all the circumstances which are set out in paragraph 57 of the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Orexim</span> judgment cited above. </p>

However, the reason she cannot do so is because those transfers were deliberately undertaken in secret as part of the strategy of concealing assets from the Wife. The details of the transfers ought to be revealed by disclosure or factual evidence in these proceedings. However, in the event that the Husband, Counselor and/or Sobaldo refused to provide that information, the Wife would be entitled to invite the court to draw appropriate inferences. The court cannot allow its process and orders to be defeated by recalcitrant parties. As described above, there appears to be a solid evidential basis on which the court can properly and reasonably infer that the Known Trusts have received the Monetary Assets as part of a scheme to </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">First, Counselor and Sobaldo may contend that they have a defence to the claims on the merits. The Wife&#8217;s position is that there appears to be no realistic defence to this claim at all but, critically for present purposes, she contends that there is nothing which would deprive her of a good arguable case (which is all that she is required to show for present purposes). In particular, Counselor and Sobaldo may dispute that the transfers were carried out for the prohibited purpose since it might be argued, for example, that the transfers were simply a restructuring of the existing Bermudan trust or were carried out for other purposes such as estate or tax planning. Given the matters set out above, the evidence certainly discloses a good arguable case that the transfers were - at least in part - intended to put the Monetary Assets beyond the Wife&#8217;s reach. Counselor and Sobaldo may also dispute that the Wife is able to prove the existence of the relevant transactions, namely that the Known Trusts can be shown to be recipients of the Monetary Assets. The Wife has addressed this point in some detail as set out above. Finally, it might be argued that the transactions are not sufficiently connected to England because they involve Liechtenstein entities transferring assets located in Liechtenstein, such that the court should not exercise jurisdiction or grant relief over Counselor or Sobaldo. Once more the Wife has addressed this point as set out above. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Second, Counselor may argue that it is a professional trust company, licensed in Liechtenstein and whose principals are primarily Liechtenstein lawyers. Though it is not itself a licenced trust company, Sobaldo may argue that its directors are Liechtenstein lawyers or, in the case of Mr Hanselmann, a licensed trustee. Both entities may contend that this negatives any risk of dissipation and may also argue that the grant of a freezing order would cause reputational damage or interfere with their business for other clients. In response, the Wife asserts that there is compelling evidence of a risk of dissipation for the reasons set out in this judgment. It seems that Counselor and its related entities have previously engaged in transactions for the specific aim of frustrating the enforcement of orders of the English court: Ms Dilnot submitted this was the only credible explanation for the transfer of the Vessel from Qubo 2 to Straight after judgment had been obtained in England (and had been made the subject of a payment order in Liechtenstein). It, therefore, cannot be assumed that Counselor and its related entities, or its principals, would not act so as to frustrate an English order, at least absent an injunction specifically prohibiting them from doing so. In that context, it is also telling that the Public Prosecutor appears to be investigating Counselor and Sobaldo for the potential laundering of the proceeds of criminal acts of evasion of enforcement.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">would be surprising if Counselor and its related entities did not try to protect the assets unless they were subject to an injunction which prohibited them from doing so. There is no reason why the grant of a freezing injunction should cause any damage to the business of the Counselor entities or interfere with other clients&#8217; affairs. The freezing injunction is directed only to trusts in which the Husband has an interest or which received, either directly or indirectly, the Monetary Assets. The Wife will not publicise the fact of the injunction so there is no reason to think that it will cause any reputational damage. </p>

Ms Dilnot submitted that this could not provide an answer to the present application otherwise the English court would be powerless to prevent the use of asset protection structures to defeat its own judgments. In any event, this is a risk to which both entities exposed themselves by becoming involved in steps to defeat orders of the English court and, if they are ultimately shown to have done no wrong, they have the benefit of the cross undertaking in damages. Moreover, if there are such difficulties, they can apply to vary the orders and/or argue that any breach should not be penalised. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Fourth, Counselor and Sobaldo (or their directors) may contend that giving asset disclosure would require them to breach trustee confidentiality in a way which involves a disciplinary or criminal offence. This risk, as well as the defences are addressed in the affidavit supporting this application which, amongst other matters, considered that there was a good chance of a defence being available if disclosure were made pursuant to an English freezing injunction (though much would depend upon the attitude of the Public Prosecutor and the Liechtenstein criminal court). Ultimately, the English court has power to order disclosure even if doing so may involve an offence under foreign law (see <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Bank Mellat v Her Majesty&#8217;s Treasury</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2019/449" uk:canonical="[2019] EWCA Civ 449" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] EWCA Civ 449</ref> at [54]-[63] relating to the disclosure of documents) and &#8211; taking into account both the limited risk to Counselor/Sobaldo and the significant importance of the information to the Wife if she is to obtain effective relief in respect of a dishonest campaign of evasion - such disclosure should be ordered. The Husband should not be permitted, having chosen to use trustees in Liechtenstein as part of his fraudulent scheme, to put the whereabouts of his assets behind a veil of secrecy. Whether or not to make an order in this context is a matter for my discretion. In coming to my decision, I have taken into account and balanced the actual risk of prosecution set against the importance of the documents to the fair disposal of the Wife&#8217;s application.  </p>

However, the existence of the orders obtained by the Public Prosecutor is insufficient because (a) it does not appear that the Public Prosecutor has frozen the assets of all the Known Trusts (including those which the wife has identified through the discovery obtained in New York); (b) those orders are being challenged by Counselor and Sobaldo before the Liechtenstein Constitutional Court and may be set aside without any prior warning to the Wife; and (c) the Wife has a legitimate interest in obtaining the relief so that for example she can obtain disclosure of where the Monetary Assets have gone, can freeze assets outside Liechtenstein and has standing to take steps herself, including through committal proceedings, in the event of any breach. </p>

She does, however, have a house in Surrey with an estimated value of &#163;8,500,000 as at July 2016. There is no mortgage over the property which ought therefore to be sufficient to give real substance to the cross undertaking. Counselor and Sobaldo may argue that the cross undertaking should be fortified, for example by provision of security from Burford Capital which is funding this application. The Wife submits that this would be inappropriate given that she is an individual, resident in England, and with assets of some value in this jurisdiction. The harm which might be caused by the freezing injunction, if any, would be very limited especially in the short period until a return date. Accordingly, there is no need for fortification at least for the time being and Counselor and Sobaldo will have an opportunity to seek to prove at the return date that they are exposed to greater losses for which fortification ought to be provided. </p>

The Husband might argue that the Wife should have returned these documents to him and/or sought directions from the court. Ms Dilnot stressed that the Wife has not relied on those documents to support this application and any such arguments therefore ought not to affect her entitlement to the relief being sought. Further, the Wife intends to make an application to the court in the light of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Tchenguiz v Imerman</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] Fam 116" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] Fam 116</ref> for directions to determine what should happen to those documents.

There is, therefore, a risk that Counselor and Sobaldo have already been alerted to the fact that the Wife might seek orders against them in respect of the Known Trusts (save for the Arbaj Trust) and have taken steps to put the Monetary Assets further beyond her reach. However, that is not a reason for refusing to grant the order sought, not least because the orders obtained by the Liechtenstein authorities may have trapped some of the assets and because the existence of the criminal proceedings in Liechtenstein may have given Counselor and Sobaldo pause for thought before taking further steps to dissipate the Monetary Assets. It may also be the case that Counselor and Sobaldo will not have reason to suppose the Wife has any meaningful information in relation to the trusts or their assets. </p>
