	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">MR JUSTICE FRANCIS:  This is my final judgment in care proceedings which have been brought by the local authority, Cardiff City Council.  The mother and the children were all born in Poland and lived there until November&#160;2015 when they came to Wales.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">K was born on 2&#160;May 2009 and is therefore 8,&#160;almost 9&#160;years&#160;old.  He was in Poland for the first six&#160;or so&#160;years of his life.  O&#160;was born on 17&#160;February&#160;2011 and is therefore just 7&#160;years&#160;old.  He has special health needs, having a diagnosis of cerebral palsy and substantial global developmental delay.  He, unfortunately, has not been well but is being well cared for in Wales.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">The application for a care order was issued on 7&#160;October&#160;2016 because there was nobody with parental responsibility residing in the United Kingdom and because&#160;O, as indicated, had substantial health needs which required regular medical attention.  An interim care order was made on 25&#160;October&#160;2016 and has remained in force ever since.  The boys have remained in the same foster placements since 23&#160;September&#160;2016.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">Concerns were reported to Children's Services in respect of&#160;K and&#160;O on 22&#160;September&#160;2016 when their stepfather, Mr&#160;S, attended Cardiff Bay Police Station to report concerns of sexual abuse to the children perpetrated to them, he said, by the children's mother.  Due to Issues of translation and the police officers' availability, Mr&#160;S was requested by the police to return on 23&#160;September&#160;2016, when he repeated the very serious allegations.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">On 30&#160;September&#160;2016, information was received from Poland Children's Services that the mother and her daughter,&#160;J,&#160;had arrived in Poland on around 26&#160;August&#160;2016.  They apparently travelled to an address in the Zlotow area where they had been staying, at a house that belongs to the mother of Mr&#160;N, where she has been staying since.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">Information was also provided that the mother and Mr&#160;N were planning to get married in November&#160;2016 in Poland.  The mother's mother, Mrs&#160;G, informed Poland Children's Services that the mother was planning to travel to the UK to come and collect&#160;K and&#160;O and then take them back to Poland with her.  Poland Children's Services also confirmed that they had reported the concerns of&#160;J's safety and wellbeing to the local equivalent of our Crown Prosecution Services.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_7">
	  <num>7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">The case put forward by the local authority is that&#160;K and&#160;O have suffered significant harm by means of possible sexual harm, neglect and abandonment and by virtue of there being no known persons in the UK with parental responsibility for them.  In this case, as in all such cases, the burden of proof is on the local authority.  They have to satisfy me on the balance of probabilities that the case that they put forward is made out.  In fact in this case, as I shall set out shortly, almost all of the threshold allegations and threshold criteria put forward by the local authority and relied upon by them in these proceedings are accepted by the mother.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">There was at one stage going to have been a substantial issue for judicial determination about an Article&#160;15 request that had been made for the return of these two boys to Poland and for the Polish courts to be the forum determining the issues relating to their welfare.  It is no longer necessary for me to spend very long on that issue because that request has not been pursued.  Certainly, given the passage of time, in my judgment that was the right decision for her to make.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">Moreover, at the commencement of these proceedings last week she indicated to me, through her counsel, that she was no longer pursuing permission to take&#160;O back with her to Poland, recognising that the care that he is receiving here for his complicated medical issues is care that she would not be able to secure for him in Poland.  I have no doubt that for her it was with immense difficulties and with a very heavy heart that she made the decision that she did in respect of her son,&#160;O, albeit that she had to all intents and purposes already abandoned him here for some considerable period of time in circumstances to which I have just referred.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">When the local authority's attention was first brought to these two young boys,&#160;K presented as having his personal care and hygiene neglected.  He was observed on 23&#160;September&#160;2016 to have very dirty and long finger nails.  He had an infected cut on his finger and he was suffering from significant tooth decay.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">It is understood that the mother had travelled from her country and left&#160;O and&#160;K in the care of Mr&#160;S, who did not have parental responsibility for the children.  And it seemed at the time that the mother had effectively abandoned the two children in this country in the circumstances to which I have just referred.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_12">
	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">There were also significant concerns that&#160;K and&#160;O had been subjected to harm by both their mother and their stepfather, Mr&#160;S.  It seems that Mr&#160;S had known about the disclosures of harm from&#160;K for a number of months or at least the allegation that he was making, but he did not report this to the police previously.  It seems that either he was, himself, the perpetrator of harm or he had been aware that the children had been subjected to harm and had failed to protect them.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_13">
	  <num>13.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">The local authority reported early concerns that Mr&#160;S stated during discussions at Cardiff Bay Police Station on 23&#160;September&#160;2016 that he chose to believe that the numerous disclosures made by&#160;K were untrue and chose to be cold with him as a result.  The local authority took an early view at that stage that the mother and Mr&#160;S had subjected both children to significant harm.  It is the local authority's position that the children would still be exposed to the risk of significant harm if they were to be returned to their mother's care and I shall, of course, deal with that in the course of this judgment.</p>

	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_14">
	  <num>14.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">The local authority's view is that so far as&#160;K is concerned, unless he is cared for in a stable and consistent manner by carers who provide positive and secure care to him; who are able to meet his emotional needs; and allow him to develop a sense of belonging that there is a risk that he could suffer from poor mental health; or substance misuse; become a victim of or perpetrator of abuse; and become involved in criminal activities which would be likely to result in poor lifestyle opportunities with regard to employment, housing, health and family life.</p>

	  <num>15.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">K&#160;has expressed different views at different stages.  At one point, the evidence of Gemma Thompson, the social worker, was that he had changed his mind on three occasions.  When we examined that, it seemed to me that it was not as many occasions as that but certainly&#160;K did express a wish at one point to return home.  Certainly he has said that if he is to return to home to Poland to go into care, he would much prefer to stay in Wales.  As to whether he would wish to go and live with his mother in Poland or remain here, his views have vacillated.  But certainly it is clear from the evidence that was given to me by Ms&#160;Thompson that he has shown considerable interest in planning the future with Mr&#160;and Mrs&#160;O and their wider family, to which I will refer later in this judgment.  And that on occasions when he has spent time with his mother, he has seemed to be detached from her.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_16">
	  <num>16.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">One thing that is completely clear to me on the evidence that I have heard is that&#160;K is thriving in the care that he is being given by Mr&#160;and Mrs&#160;O, his current foster carers.  He is playing football.  He is doing well at school, he is doing particularly well at maths.  And for a boy who had the difficulties that he had less than two&#160;years ago and who came to this country speaking almost no English, it is, if I may say so, a remarkable tribute to the care that Mr&#160;and Mrs&#160;O have provided for him that he has thrived in this way.  I will return to say some more things about Mr&#160;and Mrs&#160;O and the many people that live in their house later in this judgment.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">I have been greatly assisted in this case by the independent social worker report of Arthur Gajewski.  Mr&#160;Jones, who has represented the mother has, if I may so, done absolutely everything that he could have done on behalf of the mother in this case.  Mr&#160;Jones was hampered by not having been able to meet the mother until last week and he has had to react very quickly to the instructions which he has been given at the last minute.  And he has carefully navigated a wise course between careful and effective cross-examination and realising that the evidence was very substantially against the client that he was representing.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">Mr&#160;Jones had suggested to the independent social worker, Mr&#160;Gajewski, that his report was not as effective as one would have wished in a case such as this and that he had relied upon local gossip and hearsay.  I understand the reasons why those suggestions were put to Mr&#160;Gajewski but it is certainly, in my judgment, not the case.  Mr&#160;Gajewski's report is extremely thorough and is very clear.  And indeed, I think I can say that I have seen very few cases where I have seen the independent social worker, the local authority social worker and the guardian so completely on all fours as that trio of people are in this case.  They all have formed the very clear conclusion that both children would be at substantial risk of significant harm if they were to be returned to the care of their mother in Poland.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.76in">"In this case the deficits were so striking that I could reach a very clear conclusion.  I am of the firm opinion that&#160;K's needs would not be met and could not be met by his mother.  It wouldb a disaster for the boys.  It would be a considerable disaster and&#160;K would be at immediate risk of significant harm on various fronts."</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">The reason, of course, why he was referring in that statement to&#160;K rather than both boys was because of the concession to which I have already referred that the mother accepted that&#160;O would now be staying here in Wales rather than returning to Poland with her.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">Mr&#160;Gajewski in his report has highlighted some of the difficulties that have arisen in liaising with the Polish Central Authority.  Although communication was made promptly and properly and immediately with ICACU in September&#160;2016, it took until 20&#160;March&#160;2017 to receive any form of communication from the Polish Central Authority.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">I am always extremely careful when dealing with other jurisdictions not to criticise that other jurisdiction.  In this case, there has been some discussion about the Child Protection Services in Poland and although comments have been made which could be said to suggest that they are less than we would have wished them to be here, it is frankly none of our business to criticise Polish Child Protection Services.  I have heard no proper evidence about it and I make no comment about the Polish Child Protection Services.  I do, however, wish to say here that if the Hague Convention and the proceedings that the Hague countries so often have to take is to be effective, it is essential that there is prompt and effective reaction from the member states.  And it is, in my judgment, scandalous that it took the Polish Central Authority so long to react in this case.</p>

The matter came before Moor&#160;LJ on 19&#160;May&#160;2017, who gave a judgment which is in the file, in which he accepted that there had not been a valid transfer request to Poland under Article&#160;15 and that jurisdiction remained in England and Wales but ought to be considered further.  He gave directions to try and engage the mother in the court process and to try and obtain from Poland clear information as to how they wished to proceed to provide care for the children.  The mother repeatedly failed to engage with solicitors in Cardiff or to travel to Cardiff for contact and attendance at court.</p>

It is, however, striking that she left the children alone in this country for as long as she did.  Having observed the mother give evidence, it is obvious to me that she is an anxious woman who has been subjected to a very difficult life in Poland.  She has, it seems to me, been subjected to an abusive relationship or maybe a series of relationships, that she has now a husband who if he is no longer an alcoholic certainly has been engaged in extremely heavy bouts of drinking.  And his mother, that is her husband's mother who also lives with them in their small flat in Poland, it seems has been in the past, if not still is, an extremely heavy drinker.  There was reference to her drinking as much as two bottles of vodka a day.  I do not know whether that is correct or not but it is obvious that if it is correct, it is an extraordinarily large amount of alcohol.</p>

I am told that the social worker, Ms&#160;Thompson had tried to have telephone conversations with her and that the boys' circumstances were fully explained to her.  She has, consistently, since those telephone calls asked for the boys to be returned to her care and did ask for contact, including by email and Skype, although Ms&#160;Thompson, the social worker, said that the mother did not provide contact details to enable that to take place.

Quite why the mother did not fly from Poland remains a mystery to me.  She told me in evidence that she was not able to get to the relevant airport by 6&#160;am for a flight to, I think I was told, Bristol she could have flown to.  I do not think that I will ever get to the bottom of that particular mystery and maybe it does not matter but I would have thought that getting to an airport by 6&#160;am, even if you have to get there the night before and spend some time at the airport is preferable to 27&#160;hours on a bus.  I also think it is at least possible if not likely that there are flights later than that in the day.  But nevertheless the mother has been here.  She has engaged.  She has fully instructed her counsel, Mr&#160;Jones, and I am satisfied that, as I have said, that everything that could have been said on her behalf has been said.</p>

We had no alternative but to adjourn and here we are now in March dealing with these proceedings and so they are appalling outside the target time limit of 26&#160;weeks.  I was satisfied when I adjourned this matter last year and I am satisfied now that the decision was right that the risks of an adjournment were not that substantial given that the boys were to remain with the same carers throughout.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">I also bear in mind the authorities to which Mr&#160;Jones has referred to me where numerous judges on numerous occasions have said that we must not impose our own views on what we think is right about the way to bring children up that society must embrace a variety of different lifestyles and different ways of doing things.  I fully subscribe, of course, to that.  But this is not about an exceptional or an odd or an unusual but nevertheless safe environment.  This is a case about an environment which has been described as unsafe and the words, "significant harm" are apposite to it.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">I remind myself of the paramountcy principle and of the welfare checklist and I briefly set out my position <span style="color:#222222;background-color:#FFFFFF">in relation to</span> the checklist in section&#160;1(3) of the Children Act.  I have to have regard, in particular, the ascertainable wishes and feelings of the child concerned, considered in the light of his age and understanding.  While I bear in mind that&#160;K is not yet 9&#160;years old, at that age he of course is old enough to express a view but it would not be a view that would be determinative of his future unless it was consistent with the views of the professionals.  While&#160;K's view has, as I have indicated, not always been consistent, one thing that is clear is that he does not want to be in care in Poland.  That would be a disaster for him, given the opportunities that he is able to enjoy here.  I cannot rule out the possibility that he might end up in care in Poland if he were to be there.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">K&#160;has, of course, from time to time expressed the view that he would wish to be with his mother and I have no doubt that he loved and loves his mother.  I have also no doubt that his mother loves him.  But, as I have indicated, the pressure that his mother has put him under, for example in that letter, is frankly intolerable for him.  I take into account that&#160;K appears to be settled with the O&#160;family, which he now considers to be his family.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">I have to consider the likely effect on him of any change in his circumstances.  It is fundamental to this case.  K&#160;has had the most deeply troubled young childhood and yet for the last 18&#160;months or so he has now been in a settled environment with a family that seems to be surrounded by love and support.  And the consequences of a change in his circumstances would be devastating for him and it is not a risk that I am prepared to take.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">I take into account his age, sex, background and any characteristics of his which the court considers relevant.  While I have referred to him as being nearly&#160;nine, he is a Polish boy and it is important to have regard to his Polish heritage.  I understand that there are Polish neighbours with whom he can converse and that funding is going to be made available by the local authority for him to have Polish lessons.  It is, of course, essential that he grows up in touch with his Polish heritage and I encourage Mr&#160;and Mrs&#160;O to allow him to mix with other Polish children if that is possible, so that he can learn about his country or continue to learn about his country and speak Polish with them.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">I have to consider any harm which he has suffered or is at risk of suffering.  It is absolutely clear from everything that I have read and which I have summarised in this judgment that he has suffered harm.  He was abandoned in this country for many, many, many months by his mother.  The mother has given different reasons for that, one of them being to do with her need to renew her identity card.  I do not think that, again, anyone will ever get to the bottom of that piece of evidence but accepting as I shall that she did return to Poland because her identity card needed to be renewed, the fact is that she did not return.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">Much more importantly than the past, of course, is the future and I have already recounted the views of the three key professionals in this case that&#160;K is at risk of suffering significant harm if he returns to his mother in Poland.  I have to consider how capable each of his parents and any other person <span style="color:#222222;background-color:#FFFFFF">in relation to</span> whom the court considers the question to be relevant is of meeting is needs, although there is no father on the scene to consider.  I have already explained the mother's circumstances and formed the sad conclusion that she is not capable of meeting his needs.  It is absolutely clear to me that Mr&#160;and Mrs&#160;O have been meeting his needs and will be able to continue to do so.</p>

While I have already indicated that I am going to make a supervision order, which will provide additional protection for&#160;K during the coming year.  I am not going to recite for the purposes of this judgment the matters set out in the threshold document because they are almost all agreed.  The mother, as I have indicated, crucially has accepted that the children have suffered emotional harm, sexual abuse and neglect.</p>

Number&#160;4(b) is that the children's dental health has been neglected and/or the mother failed to provide them with a healthy and nutritious diet and as a result&#160;O has subsequently required six&#160;teeth to be extracted and&#160;K has also required dental treatment because of tooth decay.  In many respects, in the context of the findings that I have made, that is not a particularly significant matter but it is clear to me that the children have suffered from tooth decay, they have had teeth extractions, their personal hygiene was poor and they were not given a nutritious diet.</p>

I asked them to give short evidence, not because there was any particular desire by anybody to cross-examine them but I thought that it was important that I heard directly from them and they both gave sworn evidence, sitting in the witness box together.</p>

They have fostered an enormous number of children and have a number of children living in their house at the moment.  They have fostered an Egyptian boy, a Portuguese boy and so they have considerable experience, not only of fostering British children but foreign children as well.  I am completely satisfied that they will do everything in their power to ensure that&#160;K grows up with full knowledge of his Polish heritage.</p>

They have agreed to, and I am satisfied that they will, promote contact between&#160;K and his brother and promote contact between&#160;K and his mother when she comes from Poland.</p>

And I want to thank them on behalf of this court for the work that they do.  Without people doing the work that they do, I cannot imagine how Children's Services would cope and so I thank them for that.  I have no doubt at all that the special guardianship order that they seek should be made and I make the order that they have requested.</p>
