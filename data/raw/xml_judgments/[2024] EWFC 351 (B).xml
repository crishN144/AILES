The case concerns a decision made by District Judge Harrison at the final hearing on 12 February 2024.  The learned judge&#8217;s decision was handed down on 22 February and that judgment starts in the bundle which I have read at page 391.  The appeal notice was filed on 23 February 2024.  That is at page 407 of the bundle.  A copy of the final&#160;order being appealed is at 387.  The appellant seeks that the final order is set aside and that the Court makes an order for the final order to be reheard again, with some consequential directions.  The contact provisions within that order are at paragraphs three and four and the schedule to the order by way of recitals, at paragraph seven and also provision for no further application by the father in respect of any DAP course at paragraph nine as part of that recital.</span></p>

Father was seeking to spend time with P.  I should also say the parties met in July 2017 and they separated in March 2019.  It appears that the non-contentious part of the proceedings is that there is a live&#160;with order for P to live with the appellant mother and that is reflected in paragraph two of District Judge Harrison&#8217;s order.</span></p>

There was a First Hearing Dispute Resolution Appointment before District Judge Parker.  The father contested the allegations in the mother&#8217;s schedule and a fact-finding hearing was directed.  I understand that the mother was not represented during that hearing due to the case not qualifying for a qualified legal representative.  The mother&#8217;s questions were presumably put through the judge.  I do not have a transcript of that hearing but the fact-finding hearing took place over 14&#160;and&#160;15&#160;December 2022 and the judge made serious findings against the father.  A section&#160;7&#160;report was ordered and that was filed on 13 April 2023.  On 19 June 2023, there was a Dispute Resolution Appointment before District Judge Harrison and the mother was not represented at that hearing.  The final hearing was listed on 12 February 2024.  From that brief chronology, it is clear there has been some delay in this case which is unfortunate.  </span></p>

The appellant has not set out what the appellant asserts was such a material change in the Cafcass recommendations at the final hearing from the recommendations in Mrs Jones&#8217; section 7 report.  That means the weight the learned judge correctly attributed to the professional views was not wrong.  On the whole, the recommendations of Mrs Jones at the final hearing remain as per her recommendation contained within the section 7 report available at the time of the DRA hearing on 19&#160;June&#160;2023.  The change in Mrs Jones&#8217; recommendations was now that access to a DAP is available in an area approximate to the respondent&#8217;s home before a progression of contact, for example, for contact at the respondent&#8217;s home and overnight stays.  The respondent is to complete a DAP course and the respondent is willing to complete a DAP&#8221;.</span></p>

P must not be exposed to domestic abuse as it will have a significant negative impact on her mental health, her social and emotional development and her ability to form safe relationships in the future.  Due to this risk, I cannot recommend P currently has staying contact with her father.  I recommend that F completes work that explores his past behaviours and his relationships to build on his self-awareness and reduce the risk of future harm&#8221;.</span></p>

The issue of the referral by the Local Authority was considered.  The issue of not seeking the probation or any police assessments of the father&#8217;s notification requirements and also the police records, the learned judge was aware of those issues.  I understand that there was one arrest when the father had failed to sign on but there appears to be no breach of his notification requirement, and later, I think, the document provided along with the standard notification condition did not add anything new.  </span></p>

How that would factor in the father&#8217;s position for overnight weekend stays and holidays with his daughter and possibly with other children was not evaluated in the learned judge&#8217;s judgment.</span></p>

It is essentially concerning the order as a final order with the father having contact in the community on alternate Saturdays for seven hours a day and not moving onto unsupervised contact at his home or overnight stays or holidays.  In examining that, fundamentally, the Court starts from a position of no order under the no order principle under section 1(5) of the Children Act 1989.  In addition, the Court needs to consider that any order it makes is an interference with the child and the parties&#8217; Article 8 rights and any interference with those rights needs to be necessary and proportionate to secure the welfare of the child.</span></p>

Also, section 1(2B): &#8220;&#8216;Involvement&#8217; means some kind of either direct or indirect but not any particular division of a child&#8217;s time&#8221;.  Accordingly, the start point is that there should be no order or restrictions.  In this case, though, there are restrictions; restrictions that there can be unsupervised contact with the father, restricted in the community unless he completes a DAP course.  That is due to the father&#8217;s perceived risk to the mother and the risk of the child being exposed to domestic violence by the father.</span></p>

Also, allegations of coercive behaviour.  The father has a conviction for rape in 2011 which resulted in a lengthy custodial sentence and that being subject to the notification requirements I mentioned earlier.  Again, due to the length of that sentence, these are indefinite notification requirements although they are subject to review by the police and the Courts potentially in the future.  </span></p>

There is also the issue of the requirement of notification of the father being present with children under the age of 18.  The safeguarding letter from Cafcass considered that a specialist psychological assessment of the father may be appropriate.  In the final hearing, the section 7 reporter considered a DAP programme outside these proceedings may be appropriate.  There was an issue over the availability and whether the course needed to be 12 months clear of proceedings for the father to commence the start.  No particular course appears to have been sourced or information obtained.  Therefore, in reality, there is still an unassessed risk of the father towards the mother and P.</span></p>

This is relevant, of course, because after the fact-finding hearing, Practice Direction 12J from paragraphs 32 to 34 is engaged in respect of assessment of risk.  Practice Direction 12J, 33(a) provides for a wide range of safety reports and psychiatric and psychological reports, those reports to address the relevant factors in paragraphs 36 and 27 of 12J.

The order restricts the time that the father spends with P due to risks that are not fully clear at the moment.  The DAP course and the conclusion have been obtained but there is no other assessment save for the section 7 report.  The future of the order as made by District Judge Harrison has two scenarios: the first is that Father completes a DAP course in his own time and pays outside these proceedings.  Thereby, it follows from his statement which was filed at the final hearing, that he would expect substantial contact with P.  If not agreed by the mother, then the matter would come back to court.  This would, in effect, affect the mother because there would have to be some negotiation and some pressure that unless she agreed to the father&#8217;s proposals having completed this course, that the matter would come back to court, and also, possibly on P as she gets older of prolonged court&#160;proceedings starting again.</span></p>

It may well be that there is a course that is not suitable for him to attend or complete.

The judgment does not appear to consider the parameters of disclosure of information to any third-party provider.  The learned judge details how the father has a close bond with P and that the contact regime has been continuing now for over seven months at the time of the final hearing.  That is important.  However, it is still a relatively short time over the period from now until P turns 16 or ends her majority.  The order exists with a high potential of these parties being involved in proceedings again over the uncertainty of the DAP course.  This leaves an open-ended position outside these proceedings after a final order with a recital for a course that may or may not start or be completed.</span></p>

The Cafcass officer goes essentially from no course and essentially, &#8220;Time will tell if nothing happens&#8221; to a course in 12 months.  It appears to be a solution for expediency with due respect to the learned judge rather than a factoring in of Practice Direction 12J, paragraph 32 right through to paragraph 40.  The learned judge does not appear to weigh this change of position as to whether it undermines the section&#160;7 report and consideration of Practice Direction 12J, paragraphs 36 and 37.  Also, no consideration of any other risk assessment that might be achieved sooner which may be appropriate in this case save for the inconvenience of the letter of instruction between the parties and the possible costs.</span></p>
