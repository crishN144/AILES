	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">The Applicant father and the Respondent mother met in 2010 in Nigeria.  They began living together in 2011 when the mother moved to the father&#8217;s property in Lagos.  The father was born in England but has always had dual British/Nigerian nationality.  The mother was born in Nigeria and has Nigerian nationality.  They have never married.  The couple have two children, DA, a boy, who is just five years old, and JA a girl who is now 18 months old.  Both children were born in the United Kingdom and, like their father, they are of dual British/Nigerian nationality. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">In Nigeria the family have continued to occupy the father&#8217;s property in Lagos.  Since August 2017 the mother and the two children have lived in a property, purchased by the father, in Grays, Essex.  DA has started at a local primary school and the father has travelled back and forth when he can.  It is the father&#8217;s case that Nigeria is, and remains, their family home and, but for the mother&#8217;s refusal to return to Nigeria with the children last year, they would be back there now where DA has a school place waiting for him.  It is the mother&#8217;s case that with the consent or acquiescence of the father, she and the children have relocated to England. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">The father applies for the children to be made wards and for the Court to order their summary return to Nigeria, where issues of welfare can be resolved by the Nigerian Courts.  The mother opposes that application and, although she has issued no formal application herself, she argues that she and the children have already relocated.  They are settled and, in the circumstances of the case, any welfare decision should be taken here. </p>

I would prefer that they did so in the care of their mother and I will invite counsel to consider, at the end of this judgment, how that can be best achieved.  Let me explain. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">In an application to invoke the inherent jurisdiction the English Court has jurisdiction on the basis of the child&#8217;s presence here.  If the Court has jurisdiction then the welfare principle applies unless it is excluded.  One way in which it might be excluded is by application of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985</ref> giving effect to, amongst other things, the Hague Convention.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">How does a judge set about making that choice?  Baroness Hale highlights in the judgment a number of factors which may be of relevance.  This is a non-exhaustive list of factors.   </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_10">
	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">Baroness Hale warns that there is no warrant for introducing a convention type approach, and the most that one can say is that in a case in which there has been a &#8216;removal&#8217;, the judge may find it convenient to start from the proposition that it is likely to be better for a child to return to his home country for any disputes about his future to be decided there.  A case against doing so has to be made, but the weight to be given to that proposition will vary enormously from case to case. </p>

	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">The second point she highlights is that focus will undoubtedly be upon the degree of connection of the child with each country.  With which country the child has the closer connection: which is his home country?  Factors such as his nationality, where he has lived for most of his life, his first language, his race or ethnicity, his religion, his culture and his education so far will all come into this. It will be important to consider the length of time that he has spent in each country and whether he has been in this country for some time without objection.   </p>

	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">The differences between legal systems can be relevant.  The effect of the decision on the children&#8217;s primary carer is also something that can be significant.  Whilst the Courts are reluctant, Baroness Hale said, to allow a primary carer to profit from her own wrongdoing by refusing to return with the child, sometimes it will be necessary to consider whether it is reasonable to expect her to return and what is to happen to the child if she does not. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">These factors must all be considered together with any other relevant factors and they may lead to a decision that there should be a swift return to the child&#8217;s home country, but they may equally lead to a decision that the child&#8217;s interests would be better served by allowing the dispute to be fought and decided here. </p>

It is necessary then for me to determine the dispute between the parents on this issue. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">I found the father to be an entirely straightforward witness.  He is an organised and focused man, who is clear in own mind about his views and his priorities in life.  He has very clear views about the importance of education from an early age and about how children should be brought up.  It is worth remembering that he is some 20 years the mother&#8217;s senior. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">The relevance of this can be seen in their differing approaches to life.  He has an established career.  He is in a comfortable financial position for which he has worked hard.  He is used to being the decision maker.  He has been generous in his support of the mother, financing her further education and a business venture that seemingly came to nought. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.07in">I did wonder whether he was much of a compromiser.  What I mean by that is that he struck me as a man who has been used to making decisions in his life, and the lives of his dependents, and I wonder whether he is fully able to see the importance of allowing those dependents to have their voices heard.  Whilst the sort of financial support that he has offered the mother is of significance I am not sure he always sees how potentially restricting or stifling it might be for a young woman like the mother to be constantly beholden to him.  I should add that I do not have the sense that he has offered his generosity in order to deliberately restrict her. </p>

I consider his conservatism makes him respectful of her as their mother.  I am also clear that he loves his children, and they are undoubtedly at the centre of everything that he does and he would not have planned a life which would involve him being parted from them for extended periods of time, in my assessment of him, or them being parted from her for that matter. </p>

His accounts have contained far greater detail than the mother&#8217;s and they are more often supported by documentary evidence.  Further my assessment of him as an organised and focused man makes his version of events more believable in the context of how they lived their lives and significantly it makes the mother&#8217;s version of events difficult to believe. </p>

However, she was a very poor witness of events.  She has not been assisted by the fact that her first witness statement contained precious little detail, of the sort necessary to raise the issues that she seeks to raise.  Worse the arrival of her second witness statement changes some of her accounts and conflicts with the first.  Her accounts were lacking in detail, even at the second telling.  Finally her account of events did not make sense and simply did not seem likely given the personalities involved. </p>

However, after discussing the issue with the father they resolved their differences and she and DA returned to Nigeria, to finish what she maintained was a holiday there, and during that time it was agreed that she and DA would return to Nigeria permanently.  Accordingly, in June 2015 she, the father and DA returned to the United Kingdom, packed up and went back to Nigeria to live.  Nevertheless she goes on to say that following that time she had two &#8216;homes&#8217; in the United Kingdom and Nigeria and would regularly travel between both. </p>

The idea that they would secure a place for DA at a school in Lagos from September through to the end of the year at a significant cost, travel to the United Kingdom to make arrangements to relocate, come all the way back to Nigeria, have him start school, confusingly in Nigeria, and then travel all the way back to the United Kingdom in the New Year to complete the relocation does not seem to make sense to me.   </p>

As his business interests and his life was in Nigeria he told me in his evidence that he fairly swiftly: </p>

Any concerns that I might have had about the purchase of property are dealt with by him in his evidence.  The purchase of the property at Grays, he told me, was for use when they visited the United Kingdom for holidays.  He pointed to the fact that he has organised for there to be monitoring of the property, through ADT a security company, and he points out that he would not have arranged that had the intention been for them to live there permanently.   </p>

The registration of the school place is in my view more in keeping with his account than the mother&#8217;s. </p>

She fails to explain why that would be?  It was not the plan, even on her evidence.  What could this father have possibly gained from changing his mind?  Living separately from his children?  Particularly as he was spending money on a place for DA at school in Lagos.  The mother goes further stating that by 2 September she was begging him to allow them to return to Nigeria but he refused saying <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">she</span> and the children must stay.  Again this does not make sense.   </p>

The dates for the funeral coincided with half term and the mother and the children attended the funeral in Nigeria.  Had she wanted to stay in Nigeria then she could have done so then.  On 3 November the whole family returned to the United Kingdom.  They all had return tickets for 11 November, but those flights were not taken up. </p>

He is clear, however, that he placed no embargo upon their return to Nigeria and this is demonstrated by the fact that she did return to his father&#8217;s funeral. </p>

He said that he thought that they would return.  Apart from anything else, he told me, she had not packed up everything, leaving clothes in the wardrobe for instance.  This was confirmed by her in her own evidence.  In fact, as I have already said, the tickets to return on 11 August were taken up by none of them.   </p>

On the same day the mother sent the father a list of documents needed for her application for leave to remain.  Her evidence was that the father had agreed that she should apply in furtherance of his wishes that she remain.  He denies that.  Those documents were never provided by the father.  Indeed, on 15 December the father wrote to the Home Office to notify them that the mother was continuing to reside in the United Kingdom and that he did not support her application.  The father says that he never agreed to support this application, as is demonstrated by his refusal to assist and I accept that. </p>

There is a complete absence of any confirmatory detail in the mother&#8217;s first statement setting out these events and her second statement begs more questions than it answers.  I consider that the absence of any detail is demonstrative of the fact that she is not telling the truth about these events.  The convoluted explanation given as to the arrangements and agreements reached are created in order to explain the things that she was otherwise unable to explain in my view. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0in">I am satisfied that there was no agreement to relocate.  The family came here in July for a holiday, intending to return so that DA could take up his school place at the Priory in Lagos.  They did not return in time for that because the mother refused to go.  The father did not insist that she should remain because he intended and wished for her to return.  I am satisfied that after she had indicated her refusal he chose, as he is entitled to, to try and persuade her through the assistance of family and friends.  He was no doubt buoyed up by her return together with the children for his father&#8217;s funeral in the October half term. </p>

Again, I accept his evidence that he sought to persuade her, through the assistance of friends and family, until by January of this year had come around he realised that he had to take alternative action.  In February, I think 6 February, he issued proceedings in the Nigerian Courts which he subsequently withdrew realising, and being advised, that that would take him some time and so he issued his application to invoke the inherent jurisdiction in this Court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;margin-right:0in">The factual background to the application, as I have found, is that these children have been removed from Nigeria without the consent of their father.  Further, in my view, the place with which they have the greater connection is and remains Nigeria.  In considering where their &#8216;home&#8217; or greater connection is, it is the child&#8217;s life and experience to date which is material.  In trying to make sense, from their perspective, of where their sense of home belongs one must be informed by a variety of factors.  Their past experiences, for example.  DA and JA have very different experiences because of their ages. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;margin-right:0in">It is my very clear view that the country with which DA has the greater connection is Nigeria.  Nigeria must be the place where he has the greater number of friends and family and greater strength of connection still.  He has a history of Nigeria within his memory. In keeping with this the father told me in his evidence that DA is confused and he asks when he will return to Nigeria.  That was not challenged but it is unsurprising.  It underlines the importance in his mind of that place.  It remains his home.  I remind myself that, for DA in particular, spending extended periods of time in the United Kingdom has happened before in circumstances in which he has had access to services such as health and education in this country.  So for these children there is an argument that the length of time spent here, pending this determination, does not diminish their connection to Nigeria in the way that it might for children who had not travelled as frequently.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;margin-right:0in">JA&#8217;s position is a little more nuanced.  On a strict calculation of days lived in this country, she has spent a greater proportion of her life here than DA has.  However, the assessment of connection is not limited to days spent.  Just as her brother she has dual nationality. Culturally she is Nigerian, just as her mother, her father and brother.  By virtue of her age, her connection to a geographical location is influenced by how connected her primary carer is.  It seems to me that this mother continues to be connected to Nigeria through her culture, her race, her ethnicity and the fact that she continues to be a Nigerian national living in the United Kingdom.  The children&#8217;s cultural identity has been maintained also by the visits from their father which have been frequent. </p>

The father has offered to secure that agreement in Nigeria so that she can be satisfied that it will not be withdrawn pending a determination of the children&#8217;s futures in the Nigerian Courts.  As it happens I am prepared to accept his word on this, but I would be interested to know how long it would take to secure that agreement. </p>
