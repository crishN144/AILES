Her mother is J. Her father is not taking part in these proceedings.  E is represented through her Guardian.  This hearing has been listed for me to determine the threshold and findings of fact sought by the local authority.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">E is the youngest of three children. No concerns have been raised as to her older siblings. During the first year of E&#8217;s life she suffered from an episode of acute bronchiolitis for which she was treated in hospital for several days.  Nothing else notable from a medical point of view happened so far as E was concerned until she was about 18 months old when she suffered from what were diagnosed to be febrile convulsions for which she was admitted to hospital for two days.  A month after that,  she was again admitted to hospital briefly after suffering a probable febrile convulsion </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">During 2010, there were more episodes.  In February she was admitted via ambulance for another febrile convulsion when she had chickenpox.  In July the mother reported to the GP that she believed that previous convulsions may have been due to E taking penicillin.  On 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December, E was admitted to hospital via ambulance as a result of seizures, discharged the same day, and then admitted again the following day (once more by ambulance). The mother said that E had gone blue whilst fitting and had urinated.  It was described as a generalised tonic clonic seizure (GTCS), and the diagnosis was of complex febrile convulsions.  The hospital notes record the mother as stating that E&#8217;s brother had had vacant episodes as a child, but had grown out of them.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">Early in 2011 E was admitted again for fits, some of which were said to have been witnessed by the ambulance crew. The mother reported that E&#8217;s sibling had had a fit at the age of 15, and possibly the father had had fits.  Then two months later she was admitted again by ambulance for fits, and a diagnosis of seizure disorder was made. Whilst in hospital the mother pulled the emergency buzzer to say that E had been seizing for five minutes. Buccal Midazolam was administered, and she had a high temperature. The hospital notes, written by a nurse, record that the fit was witnessed by the Registrar, although her/his name is not given and there is no note from that person which one would expect.  E was discharged with a prescription of Midazolam (which is a rescue medication) to be given as needed when seizures lasted for longer than five minutes.  In June an MRI scan was performed where there were multiple small areas of high signal found in the white matter which were relatively soft and ill defined.  The cause of this was not clear, as these findings would be expected to be more pronounced for a toxic or metabolic disorder, nor was it typical of a mitochondrial disorder.  Meanwhile, E was said to be suffering from more fits and staring episodes, and also nosebleeds.  She was prescribed with Epilim and midazolam for when it was necessary. E and the mother saw the Consultant Paediatrician at Y Hospital, Dr M , and E was referred for some metabolic tests as a result of the MRI findings, which showed nothing specific.  In August 2011, E was found to meet the children with disabilities criteria by the Y Allocation panel, but she did not meet the criteria for a continuing care package following an assessment by RM.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">Meanwhile E was said by the mother to be suffering from continuing seizures although they were in clusters with several weeks sometimes passing in between. The general seizures were said by M to almost always require Midazolam to stop and by the end of 2011 they appeared to be increasing and the dose of Epilim (daily) was increased. Because of safety concerns she was referred to obtain a soft helmet and had a baby monitor by her bed. Her physical development was said to be normal, but the mother did say that E had bouts of aggressive and destructive behaviour; and Dr.  was asked by the GP to consider an assessment for autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) by the CDC.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">During 2012, there were a number of episodes, and the mother continued to report that E had seizures, often requiring Midazolam. In April of that year the mother reported that E showed anxiety about change, that she was obsessed with routine and that she walked on tip toe, and during the course of the year she reported language delay and communication issues.  In September E started at W Lower School but the mother was not happy with this and asked for her to be transferred to B.  At various points there were suggestions that E should be assessed at the Child Development Centre (CDC) and she was seen there on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> January by Dr. C. Various professionals were already beginning to record that E had ASD (for example the education tribunal notes show this). Dr. C recorded a list of problems at the head of the letter that she wrote to Dr.  after seeing E and the mother in the clinic, which included at number 1 &#8216;Autistic Spectrum Disorder&#8217;, before going on to set out the mother&#8217;s descriptions of E&#8217;s behaviour below.  There was no independent assessment of E&#8217;s behaviour but it is clear from what happened thereafter that Dr. C&#8217;s letter was taken as confirming a diagnosis of ASD by all the professionals thereafter (although there are references in some documents to the need to confirm if E did have the diagnosis).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">During the course of 2013 the mother reported wide-ranging problems with E, including repeated seizures, nosebleeds, bowel and bladder problems, excessive sleepiness, and some wobbliness meaning she could not walk long distances (E was provided with a wheelchair later in the year). The mother was not happy with B school and wished for E to be moved to R (which she did in September). In July 2013 E had a Statement of Special Educational Needs, during the course of which the mother reported that E was having 3 to 4 drop seizures a day, and one or two tonic clonic seizures a week. Her medication was increased following a consultation with </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0in">Addenbrookes.  Following the appointment with Dr. K in September, E underwent an EEG which showed no epileptiform abnormalities, and normal responses to photic stimulation and hyperventilation. In October E was admitted to hospital again for fits, and had an MRI under general anaesthetic. This showed multiple small sub-cortical lesions, predominantly in the frontal lobes. The Consultant Radiologist stated that although the appearances were not typical of tuberous sclerosis, this was the most likely differential diagnosis, and when E and the mother saw Dr. K again in November 2013 she referred E for genetic tests which were found later to be normal.  At the very end of the year, E was admitted to hospital as an emergency because she was said not to be passing urine.  </p>

She was advised to allow E to sleep in a more upright position and reported that E&#8217;s fits improved thereafter (although absences continued). In June she was admitted to hospital as an emergency because she was said to have had a fall during an absence seizure whilst climbing over a stairgate. During the course of the year, there were a number of investigations to see whether or not E had TS, including genetic tests, an ECG, optical examinations and an ultrasound scan of kidneys and bladder. All came back as normal and in September, Dr. C, Consultant Clinical Geneticist reported that a diagnosis of TS was unlikely. She noted on examination that E was hypermobile, and stated in her conclusions that E appeared to have a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with complex epilepsy, learning difficulties and autism.  In November she was admitted for a coblation adenotonsillectomy which appeared to go well although M reported that E suffered from repeated nosebleeds for which she was cauterised.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">In 2015 E was weaned off Sodium Valproate, but the mother was concerned that her seizures worsened. She also asked to be referred to Dr. P, Consultant Paediatric Neurologist at Addenbrookes, who ran TS clinic.  A Child and Young Person Continuing Care Process Assessment was undertaken by SN nurses, HL and GM, which concluded that E did not meet the criteria for continuing care. E was also referred to Speech and Language therapy following concerns of a stammer, which concluded that she presented with an understanding of spoken language and expressive language skills appropriate for her age, but that she would benefit from regular speech and language therapy to develop her awareness and confidence and to learn techniques to improve her fluency.  E saw Dr. P in August, and taking into account the history from the records and what the mother told him, he concluded that TS was the likely diagnosis, albeit it was atypical.  In the event that seizure control was to deteriorate, consideration would be given to a trial of Vigabatrin and/or a keto diet.  In November Dr. P noted that E was still having troublesome seizures although the frequency had settled, and recommended the cautious introduction of Vigabatrin. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">At the beginning of 2016 the mother noted that following the seizures initially becoming &#8216;haywire&#8217; they improved a great deal. She was, however, concerned about E&#8217;s speech and language, her behaviour and as to way in which she was being managed at R School. E was referred to the Continence Service in May, and in the same month she was admitted to hospital because of noisy breathing at night (which seems to have been seen when she was on the ward as well as reported by the mother). The mother reported to Dr. P that breathing difficulties triggered episodes and he suggested that she should video them so they could be reviewed in the clinic.  E&#8217;s school placement was considered at an Educational Tribunal in June, as the mother wished her to be placed at St E School. Relations between the mother and R School became more and more tense because the school did not feel that E required the amount of monitoring over her bowels and bladder and eating that the mother was asking for, and by the end of November the mother was removing K before lunch every day. The mother reported serious difficulties for E with constipation and passing of urine, and that when laxatives were reduced, she had had a seizure.  The week before Christmas, E was admitted briefly  to hospital as she was said to have stopped drinking and had reduced feeding too. She appeared well on examination and was discharged.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">In February 2017 a decision was made to start E on a ketogenic diet in March, as a result of a return in her drop seizures, an increase in GTCS to three or four a month usually requiring Buccolam, and absences between 7 and 15 times a day.  The idea was that E would be weaned from her other medication including Vigabatrin.  She was admitted on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March for three days. E seemed to tolerate the diet well although she did have two symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes.  After this admission the mother did not return her to R school, and indeed she objected when the school nurse contacted the hospital directly without informing her. The mother reported difficulties with controlling E&#8217;s blood sugars. She also asked for E to be discharged from the continence service as she did not believe that they were being supportive.  In April, by consent, it was agreed to revise E&#8217;s SEN statement and that she needed a school catering for children with a wide range of learning difficulties and complex medical conditions such as epilepsy. E was home schooled and during the summer the mother pressed for her care plan to be updated, although she did not wish to have the involvement of the R nurses, who she said did not understand E&#8217;s needs and did not accept help or advice from specialists. The seizures appeared to improve, with about 2 to 4 TCS a month, and less frequent drop attacks. M said that E continued to have about 11 absences a day. In September E was admitted to Addenbrookes for assessment, and the mother reported improvements in seizure control. She did not want to withdraw from the keto diet because of the benefits to E.  In October there was an emergency admission because of concerns that E was not drinking but she looked alert and active with moist mucus membranes, and was discharged with a prescription for antibiotics for a suspected UTI. The mother also reported that K was constipated but declining Movicol. She was admitted again at the end of the month with a fever and a history of poor food and liquid intake and was fitted with a nasogastric tube. Worryingly, the mother described increasing seizures as well. E was discharged with the NG tube in situ, and the mother made contact with HC from Addenbrookes asking for NG tube supplies, and also asking for training so that K could be given feeds by a pump. The NG tube remained in place for a few weeks, and by the middle of December it was being used first thing in the morning, and then later on in the day. The mother told the community nurse that E had been referred for a gastrostomy at Addenbrookes. At the end of the year, further submissions were made to the Educational Tribunal as to the correct school place for E.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">At the beginning of 2018, E was admitted to Y Hospital for the replacement of her NG tube. This was a very distressing event, for E was distressed and agitated, and it was not possible to put in the tube, even when E was sedated.  It was decided that she would have to undergo a general anaesthetic. On the ward, E was said to be alert, talking, walking, eating and drinking, but she refused to go to the theatre. She was discharged home. At about this time it is clear that concerns were beginning to be raised about the mother and whether she was over medicalising E.  </p>

When she had a NG tube put in, she had a seizure and a hypo and it came out.  It was decided that E should be cannulated, but Addenbrookes said it was not appropriate to do it at home. On 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, E was taken to Y hospital with the same issues, and the mother was told of the options which included another NG insertion (which was not thought likely to be successful) or a permanent PEG insertion. In any event she would need IV fluids in the meantime.  There appears to have been a significant disagreement between the mother and the clinicians, and the social worker was contacted.   </p>

The hospital staff thought her fluid intake was acceptable even if poor. No seizures were noted. E was discharged and the plan was to continue with a non keto diet. It was said that the mother had become aggressive when she was asked if E could remain in hospital for a few more days, and refused. After E was discharged, the mother told the GP that she was concerned as to how E would be weaned off the keto diet, but when she contacted Dr. P, the latter stated that E did not need to be weaned because she had managed without it at Addenbrookes without any ill effects.  </p>

This was undoubtedly because the professionals were beginning to question the various diagnoses that E appeared to have had, and the evidence underlying them. During the course of the year there appeared to be something of a standoff with the mother stating that E was still on the keto diet from which she needed to be weaned off with the assistance of a specialist centre, and  Dr. P at Addenbrookes saying that she was not on it, and therefore no weaning was needed . Some of the other doctors were caught in the middle.   </p>

The chronology records the mother as reporting that E had started suffering from seizures again shortly after her discharge from Addenbrookes and there are some other references to the mother stating that E was having problems with disfluency and some trouble with swallowing. Reports of seizures were also made in June after what was said to be a period when they were well controlled (E remained on medication, including Vigabatrin), but after that reports of seizures were much reduced again. The mother attributed this to the keto diet.  E had not been in school for a year whilst the tribunal process was in train, and the mother&#8217;s hope was that she would obtain a place at St. E.  </p>

Dr. Kate Ward was appointed to prepare a report.  The question as to whether or not E was on a keto diet and if so, how she was to be weaned from it was a matter of discussion over many months.  By November the professionals were moving towards an emergency care plan whereby E was admitted to Y Hospital so that it would be possible to see and treat any seizures that she might suffer in the course of moving to a normal diet.  E had begun to attend school, and the mother was said to be concerned that the school team did not have a care plan for epilepsy, and that she could not therefore allow her to be at school full time.  </p>

They may arise for a number of reasons.  One possibility is of course that they are lies designed to hide culpability.  Another is that they are lies told for other reasons.  Further possibilities include faulty recollection or confusion at times of stress or when the importance of accuracy is not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the recordkeeping or recollection of the person hearing and relaying the account.  The possible effects of delay and repeated questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one person of hearing accounts given by others.  As memory fades, a desire to iron out wrinkles may not be unnatural &#8211; a process that might inelegantly be described as "story-creep" may occur without any necessary inference of bad faith&#8221;.

		    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">One highly important aspect of the Lucas decision, and indeed the approach to lies generally in the criminal jurisdiction, needs to be borne fully in mind by family judges. It is this: in the criminal jurisdiction the &#8220;lie&#8221; is never taken, of itself, as direct proof of guilt. As is plain from the passage quoted from Lord Lane&#8217;s judgment in Lucas, where the relevant conditions are satisfied the lie is &#8220;capable of amounting to a corroboration&#8221;. In recent times the point has been most clearly made in the Court of Appeal Criminal Division in the case of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">R v Middleton [2001] Crim.L.R. 251</span>. In my view there should be no distinction between the approach taken by the criminal court on the issue of lies to that adopted in the family court. Judges should therefore take care to ensure that they do not rely upon a conclusion that an individual has lied on a material issue as direct proof of guilt&#8221;.</p>

Nor was there any concern about the mother&#8217;s presentation of E to medical professionals in the months after her birth.  The first recorded seizure was in September 2009, when she was 17 months old, and she did thereafter suffer from a cluster of seizures between then and early 2010, and then further febrile convulsions at the end of 2010 and then again in early 2011.

By the beginning of 2018, and just a few months before care proceedings were started, E had been diagnosed with probable Tuberous Sclerosis and epilepsy and Autistic Spectrum disorder. There were times when the mother reported that she had very frequent fits and several absences a day.  She was prescribed Vigabatrin, Clobazam, and also Buccal Midazolam as an emergency medicine.  She was supposed to be on a ketogenic diet. She had a statement of Special Educational Needs and attended R school which was a school for children with physical disabilities, medical conditions and associated communication difficulties, until March 2017.  An independent OT report described E as having learning difficulties, behavioural difficulties, obsessive behaviours, sensory processing difficulties and physical/motor difficulties. She had a wheelchair (and was transported to and from school in it), and there was medical equipment in the home such as a ceiling hoist which Dr. Ward stated was what might be expected for a profoundly disabled child.  E had attended some events with the Y Cerebral Palsy society. She had been withdrawn from R and the mother was pursuing a place elsewhere, such as St. E which caters for children with epilepsy.   </p>

In late 2017 the mother was reporting that E was refusing to eat and drink and she was fitted with a naso-gastric tube as a short term measure.

The MRI scans conducted in July 2011 most certainly showed abnormalities, the aetiology of which was (and is) very difficult to know.  Moreover it is difficult to know what the consequences of such abnormalities as seen would be, save to say that they remain now, and E does not seem to be suffering any ill effects.

Dr Ward was also concerned as to the use of a wheelchair for E.  Dr. Ward was not able to say whether the history of seizures was completely fabricated, exaggerated, or accurate, and although she had identified areas where there was evidence of fabrication and exaggeration, she was not able to say that all of E&#8217;s symptoms were fabricated, or at least a result of the mother providing misleading information. </p>

In her report and her oral evidence she pointed out that incidental intracranial findings on MRI of the brain were a topic of interest in the profession and that in control groups of healthy children unexplained white matter hyper-intensity was found in children who were considered to be neurologically and medically intact.  Given the lack of progression of the lesions and E&#8217;s current status, there is no reason to anticipate future deterioration or consequences.  </p>

She noted that between September 2018 and July 2019 the blood ketones were frequently below 2mmol/L often falling below 1.  She stated that this suggests that a therapeutic ketogenic state was not maintained during this period and that compliance and efficacy of the diet was inadequate.  These findings, she concluded, support the opinion of Dr. P to that effect.  Dr. Ward also said that adequate ketosis was not maintained prior to E&#8217;s admission to Young Epilepsy, although there was some improvement in blood ketone levels prior to admission in September 2019.  She stated that it was entirely reasonable for Dr. P to suggest that the ketogenic diet should be discontinued on discharge from Addenbrookes in February 2019.   E had been subject to some dietary limitation as well as the regular blood testing which would have caused some discomfort, and her attendance at school had been limited by her mother&#8217;s insistence that there should be blood testing equipment there, and that the staff needed to be trained.  </p>

When questioned about Dr. Ward&#8217;s analysis of the blood results from September 2018 to July 2019, she said that she was using the ketogenic diet to the best of her ability and that she had been advised to keep E&#8217;s blood ketones at around 2 to avoid hypoglycaemia (Dr. Ward stated that having blood ketones below 2, which they frequently were, suggests that a therapeutic ketogenic state was not maintained during this period).  </p>

In  April 2011 E was diagnosed with a seizure disorder, and in July of that year that she had an abnormal MRI.  These are all genuine events;  none of them brought about as a result of anything done by the mother.  Whilst we </p>

The seizures/convulsions must have been extremely frightening, and coupled with an abnormal scan the mother must have feared the worst. Added to this the mother was going through a very difficult time with the breakdown of her marriage and harassment from E&#8217;s father. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.01in">This being said, for the reasons I set out below, it does appear that at some point around or shortly after the diagnosis in 2011, the mother developed a pattern of exaggerating and sometimes fabricating E&#8217;s symptoms and behaviour.  With so many medical and other professionals involved in E&#8217;s life the mother&#8217;s repetition of inaccurate information from one to the other had a snowball effect.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.01in">Some of the mother&#8217;s exaggerations are minor and by themselves would have little significance (indeed I suspect a measure of misinformation and exaggeration is not uncommon in the general population). One good example of such is the mother&#8217;s saying (as I find) that E&#8217;s older brother had been investigated for seizure or possible epilepsy.  Other examples include her repeated statements to professionals that E had had septicaemia in May 2013, that E had spent most of May 2013 in and out of hospital (when she had spent five night there in all), that E had been diagnosed with Doose syndrome, that E had an unknown blood disease, that she had liver damage and that she was being monitored for anaemia. The mother denied much of this, but these statements were recorded contemporaneously, and often by more than one witness. Cumulatively they begin to have more significance, as they also do when it can be seen that a misleading statement contributed to a doctor making a diagnosis of and then treating, an illness or disorder.  An example of that is the mother stating to Dr P that she had a cousin in Canada who had been diagnosed with Tuberous Sclerosis.  </p>

The mother said in her evidence that it was others who suggested that E should have a wheelchair, for example the school or &#8216;wheelchair services&#8217; who had assessed E and suggested that the Action Junior wheelchair would be suitable. She also stated that the wheelchair was not regularly used, save for when the family went on long trips or when requested by the school. An analysis of the contemporaneous records and the evidence of other shows, however that it was the mother who was the driving force behind obtaining and using the wheelchair. The mother repeated to various professionals that E needed a wheelchair because she was often very tired, which in itself triggered seizures. She also said that E would become unrousable once she had fallen asleep (something she repeated in her oral evidence). The mother&#8217;s account that it was R School who requested that E come into school in her wheelchair was rejected by Ms R, the Deputy Head of R who said that she came in the wheelchair at her mother&#8217;s request, evidence which I accept. There is a wealth of evidence that the mother was portraying E as being dependent on a wheelchair.  Ms J, E&#8217;s social worker recorded in a report for E&#8217;s EHC plan  on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> June 2017  that &#8216;E is totally reliant on her wheelchair when out of </p>

When she is unable to walk she uses the wheelchair in the house. She also has to wear her epilepsy helmet&#8217;.  In her oral evidence Ms J stated that she had taken this information from what the mother told her. By 2015 the mother was seeking to obtain a tilt wheelchair for E on the basis that she used it on a daily basis and the current wheelchair was not good for her to sleep in.  Although I accept that the use of the wheelchair declined during 2018, it was still being used on occasion up and until the admission to Young Epilepsy.  </p>

I also note what Dr. Ward and Dr. Williams said about the hoist in the home, something that you would only expect to see for a child who had serious mobility issues. In the experts&#8217; meeting, Dr Williams commented of his visit to the family home that &#8220;I kind of kept looking around expecting to see a child with major quadriplegia&#8221;.  </p>

At the top of the letter he wrote to the paediatrician after the appointment he set out a list of problems, the first of which was stated as &#8216;autism spectrum disorder&#8217;.  Although no formal assessment had been carried out, it was assumed by other professionals including Dr. A and Dr. R that the description at the top of the letter meant that there had been a diagnosis.  The history which led to the referral to the CDC, and indeed the description of autistic spectrum disorder as a problem, was, however, obtained as a result of the history given by the mother. The mother told Dr .A  that E was obsessed with routine, anxious about change and that she walked on tiptoes. Dr A described this history as containing some </p>

Records of her conversations with professionals and emails she sent them are replete with statements about E having autism. I think this led to a situation whereby all those involved lost sight of the source of the diagnosis and the evidence (or lack of it) which underpinned it. The behaviours recorded by the mother were not independently noted by others who had contact with E, most notably at R School, which E attended for about three years from September 2013. </p>

Indeed the opinion of most of the staff was that the mother was underestimating her ability and exaggerating her problems.  Ms R stated &#8220;E was able to communicate very clearly and her speech was very good in school. She was able to read the body language of peers and adults alike. She had excellent communication skills&#8221;.  She said that the school did not agree with the diagnosis of autism (they had two teachers who were particularly experienced in the field) and that E did not need the visual timetable or schedule the mother wished her to have, nor did she need to have supervision over her toileting. They told the mother so, but she chose to reject their opinion and to argue very persistently that the school was failing to meet her needs.  </p>

The issue was raised again by the mother in 2014, and it appears that she repeatedly chased the professionals to ensure that E had been referred to an ENT specialist.  When E was first seen by the ENT surgeon at hospital,  Mr. H, he was sceptical about the benefits of surgery, but the mother opted to see Mr. J for a second opinion (I should note here that the referral to A hospital was also because of E&#8217;s epilepsy and need to be seen in a tertiary referral centre). On 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2014 E&#8217;s paediatrician, Dr. R, advised the mother not to rush into surgery but notwithstanding this E underwent an adenotonsillectomy in December of that year.  Dr. Ward noted that before there was an opportunity to assess the effect of this operation, the mother was suggesting using oxygen therapy, something that was highly inappropriate, and also that the mother had told Dr. R that E had been taken to R Ward and give oxygen as an emergency (there is no record of this).  As with other aspects of E&#8217;s health and behaviour, the mother was pushing for medical interventions for E in relation to sleep apnoea, and I do not accept her contention that she was simply following the advice of the doctors. Although the mother did seem to turn her attention to other matters following the operation in 2014, it is instructive to note that the issue did not entirely go away.  In 2016, for example the mother told Dr. R, that the problem had recurred and that E seemed to swallow less, have increased secretions (if she did not use this term she used something to indicate this), and that this could or would lead to E suffering seizures.  </p>

On 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2014 the mother requested a referral to a speech therapist, saying that she felt that there had been a change in E&#8217;s speech. During   2015 and 2016 E underwent a number of SALT assessments.  In her oral evidence the mother minimised her own role in instigating these, suggesting that language difficulties had been noticed by others, particularly the school. She suggested that it was E&#8217;s teacher who had expressed concerns about a stammer, and the school who had made the original referral to SALT. The SALT initial report in April 2015 does state that the class teacher made the referral, although the body of the report demonstrates that the mother was giving an account of a severe stammer at home.  The class teacher stated that E used initial sound repetitions when she was </p>

The mother also said that there were many references to it in the communication book between the mother and school, copies of which she had but have not been produced in these proceedings.  The records produced by the local authority demonstrate the mother reporting to various professionals (for example Dr. B, Dr. R, MC, CMW),  that E had problems such as stammering or dysfluency, but when she was independently assessed the problems were not considered to be particularly significant. An assessment in March 2016 recorded that when E was observed in the classroom and playground her speech was fluent at all times and did not impact upon her ability to communication functionally. In a one to one situation when the language demands on E were increased, her stutter did become more apparent, characterised by part and whole word repetitions of which she did not seem to be aware.  It was recommended that it was not appropriate to work on E&#8217;s fluency at this time, although some strategies were put forward to assist, for example for the adults to slow down their speech to provide a positive role model.  Despite this advice, there are later records of the mother seeking speech therapy for E, and becoming combative with Y Speech and Language therapy when this was not provided &#8211; for example in April 2018 where there is a record of the mother complaining that nothing had been done for the past year.   </p>

Mr Ekaney QC and Ms Easton for the mother point out that on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2013, the Consultant Radiologist, Dr. S, stated that the most likely differential diagnosis for the findings on the MRI scan was tuberous sclerosis.  This was without the mother giving any description of E&#8217;s symptoms, and before any referral to Dr. P.  I accept their submission that the mother was not responsible for E being diagnosed with this condition, or indeed with epilepsy. No doubt this caused her great anxiety.   </p>

This was the day after a consultation with the Dr. K, the Paediatric Neurologist, who was clear that she had never said such a thing to the mother. Indeed Dr. K&#8217;s letter to Dr. A is careful to say that the findings on the MRI <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">may</span> represent tuberous sclerosis rather than that they did.

I reject the mother&#8217;s case that she simply told him that her cousin had suspected TS for  I do not think Dr. P would have had any reason to state the diagnosis so confidently in the contemporaneous documents if this was not what he had been told.

After the first occasion when she was about 18 months old she suffered repeated seizures when she was 20 months old, 22 months old, and then on at least two occasions when she was over two . These seizures appeared to last for several minutes. They were associated with E having a high temperature, and the episode in February 2011 was witnessed by the ambulance crew.  In April 2011 E was diagnosed with a seizure disorder; and prescribed medication. These episodes and the diagnosis appear to be entirely genuine.

I note that absence seizures may be very easy to misconstrue, but the witnesses also noted occasions when E dropped to the ground. I accept that this did happen on occasion, but I believe that if it had been a frequent event, it would have been noted by others in other settings (such as school or in hospital).

I note that E&#8217;s current carers believed that she might have suffered a drop seizure when falling over in the shower, but that has been discounted and in any event has not recurred. The mother&#8217;s case is that there have been no further seizures because E&#8217;s condition was transformed by the ketogenic diet.  I have to say that I find this an unlikely explanation for the evidence suggests that she was not on it strictly or for very long. I accept the evidence of Dr. P that E did not appear to have been following a strict ketogenic diet prior to her admission to hospital on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2018, and that she did not follow it in hospital. I also accept Dr. Ward&#8217;s evidence that for much of the time from July 2018 to September 2019 E was not in a state of therapeutic ketosis.   In any event, even after the start of the diet in 2017 the mother continued to report E as suffering from seizures although I entirely accept that it was reported they had become far less frequent.  In May 2017 she reported that &#8216;last Sunday&#8217; E had about 40 drop seizures in one day, and also that she had 2 to 4 tonic clonic seizures a month.  In October 2017 the mother reported that E was having increased seizures again (with illness), and in January 2018 the mother reported that E had had a generalised tonic clonic seizure (again with a recognised illness). She reported in June and July 2018 that E had had more seizures, including one when she was said to have fallen off her scooter. </p>

E has had a number of genuine seizures, and additionally she has also exhibited behaviours from time to time which a lay party might well construe as either an absence seizure or a drop seizure. On the other hand, there is a very significant discrepancy between the mother&#8217;s reports as to what she saw and what was seen at school and elsewhere.   </p>

In saying this, I do bear in mind that she had good reason to believe that E was suffering from epilepsy and either tuberous sclerosis or some other rare condition, and as a result, there is a danger of &#8216;hindsight bias&#8217;.  The mother&#8217;s exaggerated accounts of E&#8217;s seizures led to her taking significant amounts of medication over several years, and to her being placed on the ketogenic diet.  </p>

Later she was prescribed Vigabatrin by Dr. P on the basis of the working diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis and the fact that the other medication did not appear to control her seizures. When this did not appear sufficient, E was commenced on a ketogenic diet in March 2017. The ketogenic diet is a high fat specialist diet which  not only requires the parent to cook very particular food, but also to carry out very regular monitoring of the child&#8217;s blood sugar and ketones. The diet was commenced by admitting E as an inpatient to Addenbrookes for two or three days. Following her discharge she was kept off school (R) as the mother reported she was having major issues with control of her blood sugars, and was arguing in any event that R was no longer suitable for her. </p>

E was also suffering from a fever, the mother said she had not passed urine for two days and she also reported that E was experiencing increased seizures. The decision was made for E to be fitted with a nasogastric tube to ensure a sufficient intake of food and fluid. It was intended to be a temporary measure for about 7 days, and E was discharged with the NG tube in situ. Two weeks later, however,  the mother was requesting further supplies and </p>

The mother also told various professionals that E was waiting for an appointment for a gastrostomy (or stomach PEG) at Addenbrookes, something that was quite untrue. The mother denied saying this to anyone but I am confident that she did.  As in so many instances in this case the contemporaneous records are very clear, and compiled by individuals who are unlikely to have recorded a positive assertion that was never made. Also, similar recordings were made by different people at different times.  A single professional might make an error or misunderstand something, but it is very unlikely that two people acting independently of each other would do so.  </p>

I am not sure how this came about, but it was obviously sanctioned by the doctors at Y . E was very resistant to this procedure and because of her distress, it failed. Another attempt was made to insert the tube whilst she was under sedation, but this still did not succeed.  The event was obviously highly distressing for E and it is to the mother&#8217;s credit that she refused to agree to any further attempts.   </p>

It is also quite properly pointed out by Mr Ekaney and Ms Easton that E was genuinely ill and blood tests showed signs of moderate dehydration. Nonetheless the history given by the mother went somewhat further than the evidence demonstrated, and it without doubt had a bearing upon the decision for E to undergo such an invasive procedure.  Once fitted with the tube, the mother appeared keen to keep it, until E resisted the insertion of a replacement so forcefully in January 2018.  </p>

She was weighed on admission to Addenbrookes and was said to be the same weight as she had been on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January (although there is a record of 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January at O244 suggesting that she had lost weight) and she did not show clinical signs of dehydration when she was admitted.  She also did not seem to be in a state of significant  ketosis, and ate non ketogenic foods from the trolley on the ward.  E was observed to be drinking (albeit not large amounts) although the mother stated that she was not.  After three days, E was eating a normal diet without any obvious ill effects and when she was discharged the mother was advised by Dr. P not to resume ketogenic feeding.  The mother stated that E was on a version of the ketogenic diet called the MAD diet, which was a less rigorous version, but Dr. P rejected this, and so do I.  </p>

The mother insisted that she needed assistance for E to be weaned, but Dr. P equally insisted that there was no weaning to be done. Nor had E had any seizures as an inpatient.  This argument took an enormously long time to unravel, so that it was not until E was admitted to Young Epilepsy eighteen months later that she was finally and unarguably weaned from it (and indeed all her other medication). Despite the mother&#8217;s assertions, Dr. Ward&#8217;s analysis of the blood results shows that E was not in a state of ketosis for much of the time between February 2018 and October 2019.  </p>

I simply cannot accept that the difference can be ascribed to the ketogenic diet, or even the passage of time for conditions such as ASD do not just disappear.  In her evidence the mother was very resistant to acknowledging this, but the truth is that she was bringing E up and presenting her to the world as a disabled child with a life-limiting condition, who needed a wheelchair and other special equipment, a special school, speech and language therapy, a ketogenic diet and for a while at the end of 2017/beginning of 2018, artificial feeding.  It is not difficult to see how the mother could have been very worried that E did have a serious condition because of her seizures and the MRI findings, but somehow this escalated and snowballed, so that the mother convinced most of those around her that E suffered from not just one, but many debilitating conditions.  I do bear in mind that E was taken on outings and holidays by the mother, and that she was allowed to be active within that context. I also bear in mind that E has shown herself to be a delightful child, something for which the mother must take credit. Still, the overall picture portrayed was a very worrying one and affected every part of E&#8217;s life.  </p>

E was with her mother all the time, and even without the benefit of hindsight bias it should have been apparent to the mother (as it is to everyone now) that she was not the child that was being presented to the world.  I cannot say at this point what was driving the mother to portray her child as having so many problems &#8211; whether it was a distorted belief system prompted by anxiety, a yearning for help in some way or another, a manifestation of more widespread distress or something else entirely.  This is something which will fall to be assessed at the next stage of the case.   </p>

E is still at risk of suffering significant harm.  As a result of the mother&#8217;s exaggeration of her behaviours and symptoms, she has been subjected to excessive investigations and assessments, she has been given medication that she might otherwise not have been prescribed (including Vigabatrin which could have affected her eyesight), and she has had severe disruption to her schooling.   She was led to believe she needed a wheelchair, and all sorts of other unnecessary equipment and portrayed as a profoundly disabled child.  There is a clear risk that without some change in the way that the mother treats and/or perceives E, that she will suffer significant harm in the future, both physically and emotionally, and by the impairment of her development.  </p>
