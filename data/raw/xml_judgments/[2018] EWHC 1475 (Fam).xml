	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This is an application under the Hague Child Abduction Convention for the summary return to Israel of 1 child, who I shall refer to as D. D was born in April 2012 and is now 6 years old. It is agreed between the parties that, prior to her removal on 29 November 2017, D was habitually resident in Israel. The applicant is D&#8217;s father and he seeks the immediate return of D to Israel. The respondent is D&#8217;s mother who opposes that application. </p>

Firstly, that the father consented to the child&#8217;s removal; that consent having been included within the agreement reached between the parents when they divorced some 6 years ago. Secondly, the mother argues that a return of D would expose the child to grave risk of psychological harm or otherwise place her in an intolerable position.</p>

The words of article 13 are quite plain and need no further elaboration or "gloss".</span><br/><br/><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">32. First, it is clear that the burden of proof lies with the "person, institution or other body" which opposes the child's return. It is for them to produce evidence to substantiate one of the exceptions. There is nothing to indicate that the standard of proof is other than the ordinary balance of probabilities. But in evaluating the evidence, the court will of course be mindful of the limitations involved in the summary nature of The Hague Convention process. It will rarely be appropriate to hear oral evidence of the allegations made under article 13(b) and so neither those allegations nor their rebuttal are usually tested in cross-examination.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">33. Second, the risk to the child must be "grave". It is not enough, as it is in other contexts such as asylum, that the risk be "real". It must have reached such a level of seriousness as to be characterised as "grave". Although "grave" characterises the risk rather than the harm, there is in ordinary language a link between the two. Thus a relatively low risk of death or really serious injury might properly be qualified as "grave" while a higher level of risk might be required for other less serious forms of harm.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">34. Third, the words "physical or psychological harm" are not qualified. However, they do gain colour from the alternative "or otherwise" placed "in an intolerable situation" (emphasis supplied). As was said in</span><span class="apple-converted-space" style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">&#160;</span><span class="Emphasis" style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">In re D</span><span class="apple-converted-space" style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">&#160;</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 1 AC 619" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 1 AC 619</ref>, para 52,</span><span class="apple-converted-space" style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">&#160;</span><span class="Emphasis" style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">""Intolerable" is a strong word, but when applied to a child must mean "a situation which this particular child in these particular circumstances should not be expected to tolerate"."</span><span class="apple-converted-space" style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">&#160;</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">Those words were carefully considered and can be applied just as sensibly to physical or psychological harm as to any other situation. Every child has to put up with a certain amount of rough and tumble, discomfort and distress. It is part of growing up. But there are some things which it is not reasonable to expect a child to tolerate. Among these, of course, are physical or psychological abuse or neglect of the child herself. Among these also, we now understand, can be exposure to the harmful effects of seeing and hearing the physical or psychological abuse of her own parent. Mr Turner accepts that, if there is such a risk, the source of it is irrelevant: e.g. where a mother's subjective perception of events leads to a mental illness which could have intolerable consequences for the child.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">35. Fourth, article 13(b) is looking to the future: the situation as it would be if the child were to be returned forthwith to her home country. As has often been pointed out, this is not necessarily the same as being returned to the person, institution or other body who has requested her return, although of course it may be so if that person has the right&#160; so to demand. More importantly, the situation which the child will face on return depends crucially on the protective measures which can be put in place to secure that the child will not be called upon to face an intolerable situation when she gets home&#8230;"</span></p>

It is, as Art 13(b) makes clear, the return to the requesting state, rather than the enforced removal from the requested state, which must have this effect. Thus the English courts have sought to avoid placing the child in an intolerable situation by extracting undertakings from the applicant as to the conditions in which the child will live when he returns and by relying on the courts of the requesting state to protect him once he is there. In many cases this will be sufficient. But once again, the fact that this will usually be sufficient to avoid the risk does not mean that it will invariably be so. In Hague Convention cases within the European Union, Art 11.4 of the Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility, repealing Regulation (EC) No 1347/2000 (Brussels II Revised) (2003) OJ L 338/1 expressly provides that a court cannot refuse to return a child on the basis of Art 13(b) &#8216;if it is established that adequate arrangements have been made to secure the protection of the child after his or her return'. Thus it has to be shown that those arrangements will be effective to secure the protection of the child. With the best will in the world, this will not always be the case. No-one intended that an instrument designed to secure the protection of children from the harmful effects of international child abduction should itself be turned into an instrument of harm.&#8217;</span></p>

He described the drafting of this divorce agreement as &#8216;atrocious&#8217; and is firmly of the view that it cannot have been drafted by a lawyer. The parents agree it was not drafted by lawyer but was written by a Rabbi acting as mediator. In her oral evidence, the mother said that she had not communicated directly with the father since their separation; as such communication is prohibited by the expectations of their community. It was clear from the mother&#8217;s evidence, and I so find, that the negotiation that led to this agreement being drafted was an &#8216;arm&#8217;s length&#8217; negotiation in that both the mother and the father relied on others to inform them of the expectations and understanding of the other. The mother was asked if the negotiations were lengthy but her response was &#8220;my father spoke with his father and we reached this agreement. It was quite straight-forward&#8221;.</p>

In default of resolution by the mediator, it further records an agreement that disputes would be determined by a religious tribunal rather than a civil court.

F issued proceedings before the Family Court of Jerusalem in June 2016. M sought to defend those proceedings on the basis that the Family Court did not have jurisdiction.

The Application refers to the divorce agreement that, the mother argues, provides her with permission to relocate away from Israel without any notice being provided to the father. Indeed, during my hearing of limited oral evidence, it was put to the father on behalf of the mother that the agreement provides, in the event of the mother remarrying a man who lived abroad, that the mother could leave Israel with D without having agreed arrangements for D to see the father, as the agreement permitted such arrangements to be made following the mother&#8217;s departure. </p>

On 19 December 2017, the Rabbinical Court granted a stay of its order, although the utility of that stay was limited given that D had already been removed from Israel. The mother applied for the stay to be lifted and the Rabbinical Court ordered the father to file a response to that application. The father did not engage further with the Rabbinical court but made an application to the Family Court of Jerusalem. That court sought clarification from the father as to whether he was to make an application to the central authority for D&#8217;s return to Israel pursuant to the terms of the Hague Convention. The father then made that application on 25 December 2017. He also made a formal complaint about the conduct of the Rabbi in the Rabbinical Court who made the order declaring that the mother was at liberty to remove D from Israel, a complaint that was upheld.</p>

The father denies this to be the case but given the evidence I have heard from Mr Katzin, and for the reasons I will describe, whether or not amendments were suggested does not now assist me with determining the meaning of the agreement or the intentions of the parties at the time. It is the mother&#8217;s case, as set out in her statement, that the &#8220;permission agreed for my relocation included D as she was in my sole care&#8221;. At &#167;11 of her statement, the mother states &#8220;this clause was inserted in the divorce agreement to avoid any conflict upon my remarriage, which was extremely likely given my young age at separation. At the time when the agreement was entered into, it was made very clear to both the father and I that the insertion of this clause in the agreement meant that there was no bar to D&#8217;s relocation abroad in the event that I remarried. As I was now divorced, the likelihood of finding a partner abroad increased as most divorcees like me marry a foreign national as there can be stigma within the community in Israel for a divorced woman as divorce is still quite rare&#8221;.</p>

He said the agreement refers to visitation and provides that for the majority of the time D was to be in the care of the mother. It was his evidence that the relocation of a child is, under Israeli law an issue of guardianship, and not of custody or for who has physical charge of the child. It was his evidence that, absent a clear and unequivocal agreement, the permission of the court in Israel is required to relocate a minor.</p>

Mr Katzin was referred to a Rabbinical Court case report where that court considered that it retained jurisdiction concerning a financial agreement between spouses.

This is not what I agreed to and would not make sense in the light of the significant contact I was to have as per the agreement&#8221;. The father says that it was his understanding that if either parent was to move abroad, the other person had to fully cooperate in discussing arrangements for D. The father goes onto describe that the mother would need to apply to the court, so there could be careful examination of her proposals for D if she wished to move abroad.</p>

In his oral evidence, the father accepted that he knew the mother would remarry and said, from the moment of the divorce, she was free to remarry whomever she wanted. Ms Papazian put to him a document found within the bundle that the mother was free to remarry any man, other than a Cohen, when D reached the age of 24 months. The father&#8217;s response was that he did not recall D reaching the age of 24 months as being discussed during the negotiations. When the mother gave her oral evidence, she said that this was a term of Jewish law and not a matter that was included within the agreement. </p>

She sought an increase from 1250 shekels a month to 5500 shekels a month. This application was heard less than 4 weeks before the mother left Israel with D. She did not inform the court or the father that she was intending to leave. When asked why not, the mother again said she was advised against it. The court increased the payment to 1800 shekels per month but it is clear from the documentation that, when the mother left the jurisdiction, the father stopped paying.</p>

I do not agree. As submitted by Mr Jarman, the mother chose to rely on the divorce agreement when she believed it suited her and then ignored it at times when it did not. The mother gave no credible reason for not allowing D to see her father on the day before the mother removed her from Israel. I do not have enough information to find one way or the other whether D had a serious eye infection but as it was not so serious to prevent D flying from Israel to London on a flight that left Israel at 05.20 the following morning, and was an indirect flight via Zurich. I do not accept that D&#8217;s illness was an adequate reason to prevent the contact taking place, no matter what medication the doctor may have prescribed. If a mother believed she had the freely-given consent of the father, allowing the child to say goodbye to the father, particularly given the frequent contact that had taken place, would be behaviour much more consistent with the belief that there was no impediment to departure.</p>

I have been provided with no explanation for why family support would not be available to the husband to visit Israel to visit at times when he is able. I also take into account that the mother received from the father, on 14 May 2018 arrears of child maintenance that amounted to some &#163;3600. I have been told that some funds have been used by the mother for legal proceedings in Israel but given the relatively small cost of flight to Israel of &#163;365, this being the cost of a flight that was booked at very short notice when the mother wrongfully removed D on 29 November 2017, I am not satisfied that the mother&#8217;s husband would not be able to visit Israel during the period of any Israeli court proceedings that might following D&#8217;s return.</p>

In the closing submissions on behalf of the mother, a generous interpretation of word &#8216;forthwith&#8217; was requested to enable any return to take place after D has finished school on 12 July 2018. I remind myself that the father has not now seen his daughter for 7 months. I am told the school term in Israel has already ended so D would not be attending school immediately in Jerusalem if she was returned within days rather than the 5 week delay requested by the mother. I recognize that the end of summer term is an enjoyable time for a child of D&#8217;s age but I have to balance whatever disappointment she may feel by missing end of term activities against the desire of the father to see his daughter, my findings that D was wrongfully removed by the mother and my duty under the convention to make an order providing for the child&#8217;s return &#8216;forthwith&#8217;, which to my mind means immediately and without further delay, and I will so order.</p>
