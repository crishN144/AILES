      <p class="Heading1" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:13pt">Short judgment </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">Tilly [</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:13pt">not her real name</span><span style="font-size:13pt">] is a happy, healthy fourteen-month-old little girl.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">Her mother Amy [</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:13pt">not her real name</span><span style="font-size:13pt">] loves her more than anything.  Tilly is her whole world.  </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">Amy is a kind, warm and caring person.  She has done all she can to try to keep Tilly in her care.  She has done her best to work with social workers and to listen to their advice.  </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">Amy showed courage, honesty, and strength of character when she gave evidence in Court.  She was very good at explaining her feelings.  She talked powerfully about the impact of her life experiences on her mental health, and on her relationships with others.  She was able to reflect on how at times this has affected her ability to care for Tilly.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">Amy has a strong loving bond with Tilly.  Amy has lots to offer as a parent. With help and advice she has made some changes since the time she was caring for her first child, Beth [</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:13pt">not her real name</span><span style="font-size:13pt">]. There have been times when she has been able to meet Tilly&#8217;s needs.  </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">At other times Amy has not been able to care for Tilly in the way she needs.  Parents need to give their children stability and security, and as much as possible, to maintain the level of care that they are giving their children.  To be consistent.  For Amy, there has been a pattern of things getting better with help, but after a time things get worse, and issues that were there in the past come up again. </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">Amy would never intend to hurt Tilly.  But if Tilly were to go back to Amy&#8217;s care, Tilly would be at risk of physical harm and emotional harm.  This is because Amy cannot consistently provide Tilly the care that she needs.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">The main risks to Tilly come from Amy&#8217;s mental health, her difficulties in working with others, and from Amy&#8217;s choices around relationships.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13pt">Amy&#8217;s mental health</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">Amy has suffered devastating losses in her life.  Her mother died when she was only twelve.  Her first daughter Beth was adopted.  Her second daughter Emma  [</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:13pt">not her real name</span><span style="font-size:13pt">] died of a lung condition when she was only two months old.  Amy has experienced miscarriages in the past, and in November last year, she had a termination of a pregnancy at fourteen weeks.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">All these losses have affected Amy&#8217;s mental health.  Amy has a diagnosis of a recurrent depressive disorder, with symptoms linked to post-traumatic stress.  Amy also suffers from anxiety, particularly when she feels others are judging her.  It was brave of Amy to talk about how her mental health affects her every day.  </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">When Amy&#8217;s mental health is poor, she can&#8217;t take good care of herself, or Tilly.  It is not Amy&#8217;s fault that she has depression and anxiety.  It is because of the experiences she has had in her life.  </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">Amy needs to find a doctor who she can trust and who can get her the right medication.  She needs to have therapy that will help her process and recover from the losses she has suffered.  There is a good chance she will benefit from treatment.  She has experienced some positive change through her work with JB and this has motivated to get more help.  She is very good at recognising and explaining her feelings.  But it will likely take a long time and will be a hard journey.  It is very likely that Amy will continue to struggle with her mental health while she is on this journey.  </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">While Amy&#8217;s mental health is affecting her in this way, she cannot take care of Tilly in the way that Tilly needs.  Tilly needs to be cared for safely now. It would not fair on Tilly to wait for Amy to complete treatment for her mental health.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13pt">Working with others</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">Amy does not always find it easy to accept advice from professionals.  She can get defensive and angry and can take things personally.  Her defences come up and she is not able to listen to any more advice.  This is not helpful for Tilly.  </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">Firstly, because it is not good for Tilly to be in a place where her mother is angry and shouting.  It will make Tilly frightened and feel unsafe. </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">Secondly, if Amy is distracted by an argument, it will take her attention away from Tilly, who needs constant supervision and attention from her mother to stay safe.  </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">Thirdly, if a professional is trying to tell Amy something about how to keep Tilly safe, but Amy is not able to listen and take it on board, then Tilly will not get the care she needs, and may be put in danger.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">Amy has made some progress since she was a parent to Beth, and after five months of working with Willis Palmer she did make some changes.  But even with a very high level of support from the local authority she was not able to maintain those changes.  </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">If Tilly were to return to Amy, there would have to be a very high level of support again.  This is not workable.  It would not take away the risks to Tilly that come from the times Amy feels challenged and judged, and responds with anger.  It has been said that Amy would manage better if she was praised and not challenged.  But if social workers are worried about Tilly, they have to say what they see.  Amy has to learn to hear the concerns, and not take them as personal criticism of her.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">It would not be reasonable to ask Amy to live her life with the level of social work involvement that would be needed to keep Tilly safe.  </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">The local authority has done all it can to find a way for Amy to care for Tilly.  It would not be reasonable for the local authority to keep providing support at the level needed to keep Tilly safe.  </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13pt">Domestic abuse</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">Amy was only a child when she started having adult relationships.  She has experienced domestic abuse.  Amy needs some support to recognise abusive patterns of behaviour, to understand the impact of domestic abuse on any child in her care, and to recognise what a safe, healthy and respectful relationship looks like.  Amy has not always been able to put her children&#8217;s needs before her own need to have a relationship.  She has not always made good choices in her relationships.  </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">There is a risk that Amy might choose a partner who was not a safe person for Tilly.  Or Amy may have a relationship that took her attention and focus away from Tilly.  </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">Amy has not yet been able to benefit from a course that would help her to protect herself and Tilly from the risk of domestic abuse in the future.  If Tilly is in her mum&#8217;s care, it will take some time for Amy to find a course that works with childcare and travel arrangements.  I do not think that if is fair for Tilly to wait for her mum to find a suitable course, and to see if it does bring the changes that would be needed.  </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13pt">Conclusions </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">I have thought very carefully about my decision.  I have thought about the advantages and disadvantages for Tilly of going home to Amy, and the advantages and disadvantages for Tilly of being adopted.  </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">Amy has a lot to offer Tilly as a parent, and she will love her for her whole life.  </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">But there are also serious risks to Tilly if she were to return to Amy&#8217;s care, for the reasons I have explained.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">Tilly loves Amy.  She will miss her mum if they are separated.  She may be sad and confused about why she could not be raised in her own family.  These feelings may last with her for all her life.  </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">If Tilly were adopted, there is a high chance that she would be parented in a loving and consistent way, that her adoptive parents could keep her safe, and she would find the security and stability that she needs.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">I have decided that the only way to keep Tilly safe, and to meet all her needs now and for her future, is to make the orders the local authority asks me to do.  I will make an order placing Tilly in the care of the local authority, and anther order authorising the local authority to search for an adoptive family for Tilly.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">I am sorry to cause to be the cause of pain to Amy, who has lost so much in her life, and to Tilly.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">Amy has shown great strength of character.  I sincerely hope that she will now get the help and support she needs to process and begin to recover from the experiences she has had in her life, and to build a new future for herself.  I wish her well. </span></p>

The local authority was concerned that Amy did not have the maturity and skills as a parent that she needed to be able to take care of Beth  and to keep her safe.  The concerns at that time were lack of a structured routine, lack of stimulation and play, poor diet, inability to manage money and her tenancy, Beth  being left alone crying, and an untidy, unhygienic home environment.   </p>

Professionals felt that Amy would prioritise her relationship with [Mr X] before her need to take care of Beth.  They were also concerned about whether the relationship was safe.  There was domestic abuse in the relationship; [Mr X] had been convicted of assaulting Amy, but she chose to stay in a relationship with him.  There were concerns that he was misusing drugs.</p>

She told me that following receipt of Ms Phillips recommendations she had a number of meetings including with Amy, to come up with a support plan. Willis Palmer had been living with Amy for four and a half months, and her care of Tilly had been continuously supervised.  There needed to be a plan to allow Amy to have increasing amounts of time on her own with Tilly, but also to remain supported by professionals.  The local authority funded the Willis Palmer team to stay in place for another month while the support plan was worked out, but Willis Palmer could not reasonably be there indefinitely.  It was better for the support to be provided by the local authority, with workers who were managed by CI.  </p>

Ultimately, and having talked it through with her sister, she did make the decision that was very painful for her.  The termination she then underwent on 10 November 2022 when the pregnancy was at fourteen weeks, has been another significant loss for Amy to face. </p>

There is a certain level of frustration in the report about the way that Amy went about seeking out [Mr X], even though he has repeatedly rejected her.  Ms Phillips was concerned about Amy&#8217;s lack of honesty with herself or others about why she did it, and how this all led to her becoming embroiled in a relationship with [Mr X]  that was unhealthy for her, and which led to a pregnancy which then created a really difficult situation for her to manage emotionally, and compromised her ability to care for Tilly.

Ms Phillips recommended that Amy should be referred to the Freedom Programme, which should help her to recognise abusive patterns of behaviour, to understand the impact of domestic abuse on Tilly, and to recognise what a safe, healthy and respectful relationship looks like.  Further, that Amy should be referred for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy that had been recommended by Dr Preston, the psychologist who assessed Amy within the proceedings, and that support for Amy should remain. </p>

She would then need to take another bus to the course venue, travel back to Gemma&#8217;s, and then the hour and a half home again with Tilly.  She would have been on public transport for a whole day to attend a course of an hour or so.</p>

The local authority raised the level of visits to every day, but Amy was cancelling a lot of the visits.  Professionals did not always know where she and Tilly were.  When they did visit, they were concerned about the state of the flat, and about the care that Tilly was receiving from her mum.  All previous issues of concern from before were there, that Tilly was being left in her high chair or in front of the TV for long periods, that she was not in a routine, her mum was finding it hard to get up and out of the house, to give her healthy food, or to maintain basic hygiene around bottles and feeding.  There were worries that she was not able to supervise Tilly properly and make sure she was protected from hazards.  By the end of February 2023 professionals were significantly concerned about Tilly&#8217;s immediate safety in Amy&#8217;s care.  The local authority applied to the Court seeking approval of a change in interim care plan, for Tilly to be separated from her mum and placed in foster care.</p>

Amy has done all that she can to try to be the best mum to her daughter.  She has accepted a very high level of intrusion into her life from social workers and other professionals.  Most people would struggle with this level of intrusion for even a week.  Amy accepted it for a whole year.  She has gone to parenting courses, and taken part in all the assessments that she had to for these Court proceedings.  She has gone to all the meetings and all the Court hearings she had to.  Since Tilly has been in foster care, Amy has gone to each of the contact sessions, put her own feelings of sadness aside, and made sure that Tilly has had a happy, loving time with her, making the best use of the time they have had together.  The loving bond between Amy and Tilly is clear from the descriptions of their interactions, and has been commented on by a number of professionals. </p>

Dr Preston has diagnosed Recurrent Depressive Disorder (RRD), with symptoms linked to post-traumatic stress.  She also has anxiety related to her fear of negative judgment.  At times of low mood and high anxiety, Amy can struggle with some parts of parenting.</p>

She told me she can overthink every tiny little detail, and she can&#8217;t push those thoughts away.  When she is depressed, she finds it hard to sleep, and hard to eat well. She can find it hard to even get out of bed in the morning, or to manage day to day tasks, like keeping the flat tidy.  At those times, making sure that Tilly has nutritious food, is in a healthy routine, is getting fresh air and is stimulated and active throughout the day can feel extremely difficult to do.  When she has felt criticised or undermined as a parent, she takes it personally, and doesn&#8217;t always react well.  In her words, that is when <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;she puts her walls up&#8217;</span>.  She becomes argumentative, or she might disengage.  At these times Amy has not felt able to work with the professionals who have been visiting her and trying to put the support in place to ensure Tilly gets the care that she needs.</p>

They gave Amy space at the time she had found out she was pregnant, but at the same time made sure she was aware that support was available if needed.  I do not consider they put any pressure on Amy to make the decision to have the termination or expressed any views, but let her make her own decision.  I am satisfied that over many visits and in many different ways TH was able to convey clearly to Amy what things would need to change in order for Tilly to be cared for in a way that would meet her needs, and gave support to Amy to try and put those changes in place, and to sustain them.

Once Ms Phillips had filed her report it is clear from the recollections of CI, TH and the guardian that Amy at that time was very frustrated with having any kind of supervision at all, and, perhaps understandably, was seeking much more freedom much more quickly, to be able to go and meet her friends, and live a more normal life.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">FM is not helped by the current version of the social work template which has a more basic version of the &#8216;realistic options analysis&#8217; than what went before.  The table invites the social worker to state if an option is regarded as &#8216;viable&#8217; or &#8216;discounted&#8217;, and then asks for reasons why it is viable or discounted.  There are no separate columns for the pros and cons of each option considered.   The effect of this is that the option of placement with mother is presented as only negative, and the option of adoption presented as only positive.  Plainly there would be a number of positives for Tilly of growing up within her family of origin, and of being cared for by her mother who loves her and who she loves.  Conversely, permanent separation from her mother will have lifelong consequences for her, particularly given she Lived the first year of her life solely in her mother&#8217;s care.   FM accepted that the social work statement should have acknowledged the positives that are undoubtedly there in respect of Amy&#8217;s love and commitment to her daughter.  She has engaged with the assessments to the best of her ability, and with the Court proceedings, and at times has been able to meet her daughter&#8217;s needs.  Likewise, the statement should have acknowledged the undoubted potential negatives of the local authority&#8217;s proposed care plan for adoption, notwithstanding his final conclusion that on balance nothing but adoption will do to meet Tilly&#8217;s welfare needs throughout her childhood and her whole life. </p>

With the benefit of intensive support, coaching and monitoring, Amy&#8217;s parenting capacity is different from when she was parent to Beth, and she has made a great deal of progress.  Nonetheless, the concerns that are evident throughout the notes from Willis Palmer and the assessment of Sarah Phillips were resonant of the same concerns that existed for Beth.  Those concerns continued throughout the period of time that the local authority support plan was in place, despite frequent and lengthy visits from social work practitioners.  At times Amy has cared for Tilly well, but she has not been able to sustain improvements made.  She has shown more maturity in some respects, but in others, the fact that her childhood was cruelly cut short, shows through. </p>

Tilly is much less at risk of an adoptive placement breaking down than if she were to be placed in foster care.  Tilly is only fourteen months old and if placed in long-term foster care, she may be at risk of one or more placement moves throughout her childhood.  Foster carers often have other children coming in and out of the placement which could be challenging for Tilly to manage.  Foster care comes to an end at the age of eighteen, adoption is for life.  Adoption represents family life, as does foster care, but the difference is that the local authority is a corporate parent, so social workers are the ones who have to sign off on decisions for the child, and there are frequent review meetings and reports, all of which represent a significant intrusion in a child&#8217;s life, and a difference compared to most other children at school.</span></p>

These are indications of her having capacity to support her daughters to settle and thrive in their new family settings.

A pre-birth assessment was carried out in respect of Beth  following the concerns raised by the midwife. The mother who was only 18 years old at the time, presented as being very immature for her age, there were poor home conditions, poor money management, and the mother continued to smoke during her pregnancy, although she says she cut down. Beth  was made subject to a child protection plan in the category of neglect on 30th August 2018 and pre-proceedings were initiated. Beth  was born on [x] September to the mother and B, A&#8217;s older brother. </p>

During some home visits by the social worker Beth  was noted to be dirty and smelly. On 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2019 the house was messy, with empty alcohol bottles strewn about, and the remains of a takeaway meal in the bedroom shared by Beth and her mother. The maternal uncle reported that Beth had recently slept in his bedroom on a corner of his bed because the mother was drunk. The mother states that she was anxious and suffering from low mood which contributed to the deterioration in the home conditions and her care of Beth .</p>
