This led to the husband commencing proceedings in Austria which were resolved in July 2010 when, on appeal, the wife was permitted to retain the sum she had removed from the joint account.  During the course of its judgment, the Austrian court referred to there being &#8220;distributable assets of at least &#8364;14 million.&#8221;  This was, it appears, in addition to the sum withdrawn by the wife.</span></p>

The judgment also records that the husband is &#8220;explicitly against the court&#8221; dealing with real estate or shares in companies located abroad.

The other is this.  Whether the application for leave is dealt with at a without notice hearing or inter partes, the hearing should be given an appropriately short listing.

I would remind those thinking of making such applications, as the note in the White Book reminds them, that this is not an opportunity to have an early shot at knocking out a weak appeal or an appeal which is now thought to be weaker than it once was.  But it must be the case that if a respondent can show the court that the judge was misled by an appellant, not necessarily deliberately, into giving permission to appeal, that may well be a compelling reason within the rule.  It must, however, it seems to me, involve showing (a) that the materials put before the judge were inaccurate or incomplete; (b) that these deficiencies had a bearing upon the grounds on which permission to appeal was given; and (c) very importantly, that but for them permission to appeal would not have been given.&#8221;</span></p>

While some of the matters referred to in that judgment are clearly relevant to an application under Part III for leave, there are, in my view, significant differences between an application for a freezing order and an application for leave under Part III.  I consider that the guidance given by the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal, in the decisions to which I have referred, are of more direct application and should guide me in the exercise of my discretion in this case.  </span></p>

It is an important obligation and it is clear that, when it has not been discharged, the court may set aside the grant of leave.  This is in part to protect the court&#8217;s process from abuse.  </span></p>

Although it is open to the court to do so, to protect its own process from abuse, to deter others and to reflects its views of the nature and extent to which the court in the particular case has been misled, I am not persuaded that this would be the right response in this case.  </span></p>

It is clearly not an unmeritorious claim, given, crucially, that the Slovenian court has no jurisdiction to deal with non-Slovenian assets, which appear to be very substantial in themselves.  If Eleanor King J had known that the parties&#8217; appeal or appeals were due to be heard in September 2013, she might have adjourned the application for leave until after then.  However, once the appeal had been determined, I have no doubt that leave would have been granted.

That, however, is a consequence of the limitation of the Slovenian court&#8217;s powers.  It may be necessary to consider whether this court&#8217;s adjudication should await determination of the wife&#8217;s claims in Slovenia, but I do not consider that I am in a position to determine this issue until I have a better understanding of the parties&#8217; resources and where they are located.  Accordingly, I propose to order that the husband must file his Form E expeditiously and I will list the application for a directions hearing before me at some point in the New Year.  </span></p>
