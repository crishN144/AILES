A small frontal fracture on the left hand side above her eye, and bilateral parietal fractures: that on the left has been described as complex, being in a &#8216;dog-leg&#8217; shape, and the one on the right as &#8216;simple&#8217;, being in a straight line across the bone.</p>

Previously, and almost immediately after &#8220;the drop&#8221; the parents and locum registrar had noticed a red mark or bruise on the child&#8217;s forehead, and the parents had noticed a small nosebleed.  On examination at hospital there was a small bruise to her left nostril, and another bruise over the lateral aspect of her left upper eyelid.  A skeletal survey was undertaken and no other fractures or abnormalities were noticed.  There was no injury or abnormality in her eyes, and no other marks were seen on her.  Various tests were performed which were able to exclude other causes for the injuries found on J.</p>

Nor were they satisfied with the later explanation by the father that before she reached the floor her head had struck a low coffee table.  A suspicion of there being Non- Accidental or Inflicted injuries arose.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Currently, and ever since her discharge from hospital on 22 August 2008 with the parents co-operation and acceptance given the circumstances, J is being cared for by her paternal grandmother, with assistance at times from a maternal Aunt.  The parents, particularly the mother now she is not in employment, have extensive contact to the child and are able to care for her, feed, bath, change her under the supervision of the family member.  As a result the parents have been able to play a very active role in J&#8217;s life and not only maintain the parental/child bonds, but to build on them and develop genuine parent/child relationships.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whatever my decision I have been enormously impressed with the sensitivity, consideration and co-operation between the Local Authority, the parents and extended family in what must have been extremely difficult circumstances.  It is greatly to the credit of all concerned, and as a result J has benefited:  while her security was guaranteed she has been able to maintain and develop close links with her parents and other family members.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case also I have been impressed by the Local Authority&#8217;s approach.  On any basis the medical evidence is not straightforward.  It has been described by the medical experts as &#8216;unusual&#8217; whether accidental or non-accidental.  The experts have not been able to say with any certainty whether it was one or the other.  Bearing this in mind the Local Authority, given the severity of the injuries and the possibility that they were non-accidentally sustained proceeded throughout with this case in an open, fair and independent manner.  The conduct of the Local Authority and of Counsel during this hearing cannot be criticised.  They felt the matter should be put before the Court for an independent adjudicator hearing all the evidence to decide. In doing so the allegation that J had suffered non-accidental injury had to be made and pursued, but it has been done with openness and fairness.  The Local Authority and legal team are to be commended.  Indeed, the parents&#8217; Counsel acknowledged that this was the situation.</p>

It is accepted that there were no other injuries or marks on her, and no other apparent cause for her injuries.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Given the developing swelling over the parietal regions and fractures on the evening of 17 August, the history of the nosebleed consistent with the bruise to the left nostril, recent bruise to the eyelid, and a red mark being observed by the mother and the first doctor (the locum registrar) who saw her, the experts are of the same opinion that the injuries were all recent, and consistent with an incident happening within a few hours of first presentation to the hospital.  A birth injury has been excluded as being most unlikely.</p>

Thereafter for a period they sat together watching television with J still in her car seat asleep beside them on the floor.  In due course she woke; the mother took her out of the car seat, and at his request gave her to the father who, lounging along a sofa with his head on one arm and feet over the other, placed J on his chest.  </p>

J continued to cry and the father called the mother to ask if it was near her feeding time.  The mother realised the feed was due, returned to the kitchen where she filled and turned on the kettle to boil so she would be able to warm the bottle.  While in the kitchen preparing the bottle she heard the father call.  She assumed it was because J was crying and had become louder, and he was anxious about the feed.  She heard the father call again, this time she heard panic in his voice and rushed into the living room where she saw the father on his knees, shaking.  &#8220;He looked panicked and upset&#8221;.  He was cradling J who was lying across his knees.</p>

The mother took J off him because &#8220;he was in such a state&#8221; and J was screaming, and saw a dribble of blood from her nose.  According to her the father jumped up and said they had to take J to hospital.  The mother tried to calm him down, but he insisted they needed to go to hospital.  She tried to find out what exactly had happened but to no avail - &#8220;he was in shock, and panicked and very worried&#8221;.  They collected a few bits, the car seat and took J straight to hospital where they were seen quickly.</p>

Before leaving the hospital the mother fed J who by then was hungry.  The parents were unsure and unconvinced by the doctor&#8217;s examination and diagnosis.  They decided to take J over to his mother to see what she thought.  On the way to her grandmother the mother noticed J&#8217;s breathing slowed, stopped for a short period, and went pale.  The father turned round and returned to the hospital as soon as they could.</p>

The frontal fracture suggests a direct blow to that region.  The bilateral parietal fractures could be the result of a posterior mid line impact with deformation of the skull and resultant bilateral fractures.  Alternatively they could have been caused by two separate impacts.  There was a third possibility for all fractures in that a compressive force was applied to the skull resulting in multiple fractures.  The configuration of the fracture of the left parietal bone suggested a possible site of impact.  It was likely that all three fractures were sustained at or around the time of the incident described by the father.</p>

He said it was a possible mechanism and could account for the frontal fracture, but he was concerned by the presence of the bilateral fractures.  They were not symmetrical, the left fracture was &#8216;complex&#8217; and the apex of the &#8216;dog-leg&#8217; shape was the likely site of impact.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I could not have contemplated forcing a five day hearing into a four day slot without the co-operation of the legal teams, and the knowledge that Counsel were experienced in care work.  As it was I required detailed skeleton arguments in advance and subsequently written submissions to which Counsel could, and did, speak.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The evidence with full cross-examination was contained and focussed, and concluded on time.  By the end of the third day of the hearing I had heard the evidence and submissions, which enabled me to prepare and give Judgment on the fourth day; albeit because of time restraints I only gave my conclusions in Court, but simultaneously e-mailed to the parties&#8217; Counsel the full Judgment.  In due course the Judgment will be handed down.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The use of experienced Advocates in complex care proceedings is essential.  All parties are entitled to high quality legal representation, particularly parents where there is a serious challenge to the medical experts&#8217; evidence, or other complicated issue of fact.  This case is a prime example.  Counsel remained committed to the agreed timetable, focussed on the relevant issues, and in so doing assisted the Court.</p>

It also had the happy consequence that the child, only 7 months old, was returned to her parents, and she and the family suffered less disruption than might otherwise have occurred.  Had my Judgment been different the case would have proceeded to a final disposal hearing and the decision relative to the child&#8217;s future would have been made earlier than planned with the original timetable.</p>
