This is not a case where there is &#8216;no smoke without fire&#8217;, this is a case where a family court and the expert who advised it got it wrong.  The parents have no case to answer but their son spent 12 months of his very young life away from their care while the family courts acted to correct the error.  K&#8217;s parents deserve an explanation as will K when he is older.  It is not surprising in these circumstances that there are lessons to be learned.</p>

Nevertheless, in light of the importance of some of the issues that have been raised, I hope I may be forgiven for venturing my own recommendations for the future.  Accordingly, in the body of this judgment I shall pose some of the problems that were identified and suggest solutions.</p>

The birth was relatively uncomplicated, though the mother&#8217;s membranes had ruptured some 24 hours previously and because of the rupture, K was given antibiotics to guard against infection. K&#8217;s stay in hospital was largely unremarkable save that he was observed to have a swelling over his left eye and his right eye was bloodshot. A swab was taken of the eye which revealed nothing of note: the possibility of infection was considered and not excluded.  K was breast-fed.  Both he and his mother were discharged home on the 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2004.</p>

This had been the professional opinion during the couple of weeks after his birth i.e. the midwives and health visitors who regularly saw the family were happy with K&#8217;s progress. They were impressed with mother: she was described as settled and confident with the care of the baby and as coping well.   She was continuing to breast-feed.</p>

K was left with his maternal grandmother and mother had expressed milk for him. The parents returned home in the early hours of the 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> November and picked up K later that day. A midwife arrived at about 11.00 am and stayed for around half an hour. She observed that mother and baby were well: K was bright and alert and fed well.</p>

In their statements to the court the couple said that K was asleep for most of the afternoon and that little remarkable had happened. Mother went for a sleep for a couple of hours from around 4.00 pm and K slept on his father&#8217;s chest as he watched television. Father&#8217;s brother visited for a short while during the afternoon but he at no time had care of the child. At around 6.00 pm mother awoke and attempted to feed K but he did not seem hungry. He slept through the early evening but at some point at night K awoke and was said to be floppy and his eyes were rolling. Concerned, father was despatched to his mother (K&#8217;s paternal grandmother) to seek advice. She suggested K might be too warm and so layers of clothing should be removed, and perhaps a cool bath given. </p>

The ambulance arrived at one minute before 1.00 am; K&#8217;s pulse was 160 per minute and his respiratory rate 40 per minute. By 1.24 am K was in the accident and emergency department of the hospital.</p>

K, however, continued to fit and phenobarbitone was prescribed and administered. At 1.45 pm on the 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> November a cranial ultrasound was reported to be normal with no evidence of intraventricular haemorrhage and no parenchymal abnormality.  K&#8217;s seizures were regular and very distressing for him and his parents. Dr Odeka, Consultant Paediatrician, requested an EEG.  This was reported to be severely abnormal. It showed a moderate amount of inter-ictal epileptiform activity localised to the left posterior quadrant.  Such a localised seizure was thought to be secondary to focal, cerebral dysgenesis, and/or a neuronal migration defect: essentially it was thought to be due to a structural abnormality where K&#8217;s brain had developed in the wrong way.  A CT or preferably an MRI scan was advised.</p>

Dr Kumar, Consultant Radiologist, reported that there was a focal area of high density in the left parietal region measuring 5mm x 5mm with no gross peri-focal oedema. The rest of the brain parenchyma was said to be unremarkable. There were no signs of hydrocephalus or herniation. Dr Kumar said that appearances suggested a small focal haemorrhage and queried whether it may be due to a prominent vessel.</p>

He found a well-defined &#8216;cystic&#8217; abnormality in the subcortical white matter of the left parietal lobe in the region of the pre-central sulcus. In addition, there were fairly symmetrical areas of high signal intensity in the subcortical white matter of both parietal lobes consistent with subacute haemorrhage. There was also evidence of a tiny, thin, subacute subdural collection over the parietal-occipital convexity. These appearances were consistent, Dr Forbes felt, with a previous subcortical white matter tear in the left parietal region with evidence of subacute haemorrhages in the subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemispheres. These appearances, he said, raised a possibility of non-accidental injury.</p>

This involved an application to adjourn the hearing. The Court was told that Dr Stoodley could report within 8 to 10 weeks of instruction. Dr Ward&#8217;s comment that a radiological consensus was essential to the paediatric opinion was brought to the court&#8217;s attention. The unusual features of the case were also raised: the white matter tears themselves were very rare signs; Dr Herwadkar felt it to be an unusual site for traumatic lesion and Dr Kumar had considered the possibility of a prominent vessel being responsible for the bleed; the absence of retinal damage; the absence of significant subdural haematomas; and the absence of bony or soft tissue injury. It was argued that such unusual features meant that it was not safe to proceed on the basis of one expert opinion only: Dr Forbes&#8217; opinion was the mainspring of all that followed, all other experts deferred to him as to the identification of the white matter tears and Dr Ward had said that a radiological consensus was essential to the paediatric opinion.</p>

Their explanation of any activity that might have caused K harm, in particular a twirling movement that was demonstrated in court was not sufficient to persuade the experts of any innocent cause of K&#8217;s presentation.  Neither parent sought to blame the other.   Neither parent believed the medical evidence as to the presence of the subcortical injuries and their causation.  An &#8216;innocent&#8217; parent caught in the glare of accusation and without medical knowledge or support is in a difficult position.  Their attempts to find anything that might explain what had happened will inevitably have had something of the character of desperation if not hopeless conjecture.  There is little that even an experienced judge can do other than to remind himself or herself of this possibility when considering the credibility of their evidence in this difficult context.  The solution lay in an earlier decision to permit them access to a second opinion.</p>

Judge Newton delivered her Judgment on the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April.  In a judgment that is, if I may say so, a model of clarity, reason and analysis of the evidence put before her, she accepted what was described as the consensus of medical opinion and found that the white matter tears and the subdural collection were caused non-accidentally when the child was in the care of the parents. She was unable to say which parent was the perpetrator: both were &#8216;in the frame&#8217;, neither could be safely excluded.  The Judge refused permission to instruct Dr Stoodley. She held that the delay which would ensue would be unacceptable for the child in the context that there was no realistic prospect of Dr Stoodley coming to a dramatically different conclusion.<span style="font-weight:bold"/>Whatever the strength of the submissions as to the need for a second opinion given the unusual features of K&#8217;s presentation, at that late stage in the case and having regard to the evidence that was before her, Judge Newton could have come to no other conclusion.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Firstly, K was relatively asymptomatic upon his admission to hospital, becoming ill the next day. An evolving picture of symptoms was seen but at the less severe end of the NAHI spectrum. The presence of subcortical shearing injuries suggested to him a non-accidental injury at the more severe end of the spectrum but that was not compatible with K&#8217;s presentation. A child suffering shearing injuries would have severe symptoms at the time of admission with obvious signs of severe encephalopathy. Secondly, there was no evidence of multi-focal acute subdural blood to suggest a shaking. Thirdly, the pattern of brain injury seen in the scans of K&#8217;s brain is more that of an acquired hypoxic-ischaemic insult or metabolic abnormality. Dr Stoodley favoured the former. He stated that he had never seen such a pattern of brain injury in the context of non-accidental injury. He added that in his view Dr Forbes&#8217; opinion &#8220;is not correct, is fundamentally flawed &#8230; and &#8230; is incapable of withstanding logical analysis.&#8221;</p>

The likely delay in determining the future of a very young child was by then a real issue.  The question that had crystallised with the recommendation of Dr Kumar on the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April was the same question that had not been pursued on appeal on two previous occasions, namely that of all the clinicians involved, Dr Forbes was the only radiologist who held himself out as able to interpret and assess the MRI scan.  The apparent medical consensus on which Judge Newton relied was not a real consensus at all in that it depended on the opinions of Dr Forbes being correct as all the neurologists and neuroradiologists then involved deferred to him.</p>

He considered that Dr Stoodley stepped outside his field of expertise in hypothesising that the child suffered a profound asphyxial insult, and advised that the opinion of appropriate experts be sought. He said that focal cystic changes are &#8220;uncommon to say the least&#8221; in cases of profound asphyxial insult. Focal atrophy or more rather generalised cerebral atrophy is the norm, he said, rather than focal areas of cystic encephalomalacia as postulated by Dr Stoodley. </p>

The pattern of damage noted in K&#8217;s brain is quite similar to that of damage caused by an episode of profound asphyxia lasting more than 10 minutes but less than 20-25 minutes. An alternative but much less likely cause, neurometabolic disease, must be considered, but the specific pattern of signs in K&#8217;s brain has never been reported in neurometabolic diseases.

He was unable to identify any incident or event before, during, or after the neonatal period which could explain all the findings. In his opinion both severe shaking injury and a congenital neurometabolic disorder are very unlikely to account for the combination of clinical and imagining findings in this case. The possibility remains that there was an intrauterine cause of the brain injury, including asphyxia some days or weeks before birth. While there is no obstetric evidence to support that, there are well-documented cases of similar patterns of brain injury thought to be caused by unknown processes in the antenatal period leading to focal scarring in the perirolandic regions, which Professor Wyatt believed could account for K&#8217;s clinical presentation on the 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> November 2004 and the subsequent seizures.</p>

Dr Forbes noted that there was no evidence for the incident of profound asphyxial insult and thought that an infant who had sustained such an insult would be in poor condition at birth, unlike K.

In essence, they should take the court through the differential diagnosis highlighting any contradictory or inconsistent features.  This balance sheet approach is used in many expert disciplines and areas of litigation and is almost universally of assistance.  The court and experts generally may have become too focused in trying to reach agreed solutions to difficult problems.  Experts are asked to inform the court of their agreements and their disagreements: the latter can often be as important as the former.</p>

The language of his first report was too absolute although I do not forget that he was answering a series of focused and direct questions.  If the absence of supporting features for his conclusion had been analysed in context, other possible explanations for K&#8217;s presentation could have been taken more seriously.  The unusual nature of the conclusion in the absence of these supporting features should have been brought to the attention of the court by Dr Forbes.  Dr Forbes was entitled to his opinion based upon his own experience but the other possibilities should have been debated with the parties and the court.  Likewise the very limited experience upon which he and any other expert could have relied should also have been made clear.  It was after all that very disclosure by Professors Flodmark and Wyatt that tipped the balance into the new medical consensus.</p>

One clear reason is that the research and experience disclosed by Professors Flodmark and Wyatt was not in the knowledge of Dr Forbes.  That is in the nature of cutting edge medicine. Dr Stoodley to his credit had come to the same conclusion but that does not detract from the highly unusual nature of the problem.  There was no answer to Dr Forbes&#8217; question before Professor Wyatt had reported i.e. it was only Professor Wyatt who could explain the lack of evidence of pre-birth or birth incident.  Furthermore, prior to Dr Stoodley&#8217;s evidence, the experts, like the courts before them, agreed that there can be non-accidental injury in the absence of some or all of the classic features and it is in the consideration of this hypothesis that the critical error was made.  In my judgment the imperative of child protection overtook scientific i.e. medical analysis in an attempt to explain the unknown.</p>

In my judgment, he and the court at first instance fell into error when Dr Forbes unconsciously strayed from the role of expert into the role of decision maker and the court failed to detect that that was what had happened.

He assumed the role of child protection that every clinician has to undertake in consultation with his colleagues who agreed with him.  However, when proceedings are commenced and when documents are prepared for the purpose of those proceedings a clinician must allow the court to take the responsibility for protecting the child and if appropriate for coming to a different conclusion.  I got the distinct impression on more than one occasion that Dr Forbes was defending a child who had potentially been seriously injured and who needed protection.  That is not the same as being defensive of his own position, an allegation I reject.</p>

I shall make recommendations in judgment that I hope will assist to try and prevent too great a focus by a clinician who is also an expert witness in a family court on what is in essence a child protection decision and which will emphasise a return to good medical practice by asking instead for the basis for the differential diagnosis and the supporting and differentiating factors.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I have remarked in judgment the distinction between a child protection recommendation or decision and a treating or forensic expert&#8217;s opinion is of singular importance.  Those agencies and individuals charged with child protection functions operate within statutory processes, with powers, duties and responsibilities that are set out in primary and secondary legislation or in codes of guidance that sometimes have statutory force (see, for example guidance issued under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1970/42/section/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 7</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1970/42" uk:canonical="1970 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Local Authority Social Services Act 1970</ref> which must be followed absent exceptional circumstances by local authorities) and may otherwise operate through the terms and conditions of employment or the code of conduct of the professional concerned.  There are specific guidance documents that relate to more complex medical and social circumstances and the way they need to be managed.  The court should be vigilant not to disturb these carefully crafted processes without very good reason.</p>

It is not uncommon that health and social care professionals have very different perspectives to bring to cases and families and they should not be constrained from raising questions that they believe are relevant and sometimes fundamental to whether a child&#8217;s welfare is being or is likely to be safeguarded.</p>

It is the court&#8217;s function to identify key issues and to decide what evidence is relevant to the issues identified.  The identification of the issues that are relevant to the threshold and welfare questions which the court is required to determine is the case management skill of the judge and the lawyers involved and that involves a heightened scrutiny of what is agreed and not agreed including experts&#8217; agreements and disagreements.  An over-riding desire to promote agreement can lead to key issues being obscured and thereby not investigated by the court.</p>

That will of necessity lead the family courts into more sophisticated, judicially controlled case management hearings during which advocates can expect to be challenged as to the admissibility and quality of the materials before the court and the relevance or otherwise of agreements and disagreements between professionals.  Agreements and disagreements have to be scrutinised for what they are: an exercise in skilled and pragmatic deductive reasoning not a substitute for the court&#8217;s duty to make its own decision.  Inter-disciplinary processes are essential to the family justice system but they are not substitutes for the court&#8217;s function.  </p>

On the basis that it was asserted that there is causative significance in the reliance on clinical opinion in this case, the court has been asked to give guidance that might lead to the evidence of witnesses of fact and opinion who were and/or are the treating clinicians being dissuaded from giving expert evidence in family proceedings.  The conventional argument in support of this proposition can be found in the report of Baroness Kennedy of the Shaws on &#8216;Sudden Unexpected Death in Infancy&#8217; (September 2004):</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;it is our view that paediatricians involved in the acute management of patients should not be expected to give expert testimony in cases involving those patients.  It is a sine qua non that doctors treating patients must develop partnerships with them and with the immediate family to ensure the best medical outcome.  This will inevitably result in a degree of intimacy and therefore subjectivity when evaluating the case as a whole.  This is the opposite of what is required of the expert witness, who should be objective, impartial and detached&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It should be noted that reliance is placed on this proposition to demonstrate an obverse circumstance: in this case it was the child protection imperative that provided the subjectivity  i.e. it is the human response to the need to protect a vulnerable child rather than the professional relationship with a parent that is under scrutiny.  It is what Booth J. used to describe as the inevitable partiality of social and health care witnesses towards a child who is in their professional care.  Their partiality is not a matter for criticism, it is simply a factor that has to be considered when assessing the cogency of their materials.  A function that is hardly new to judges of this Division and is not a reason for the exclusion of treating experts.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">While acknowledging that the court should have in mind the distinct roles of treating expert and forensic expert (particularly in the field of mental health where the doctor / patient relationship may be more complex: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (Sexual Abuse: Expert&#8217;s report)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] 1 FLR 871" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] 1 FLR 871</ref> CA) and should be careful to scrutinise the purpose for which each expert&#8217;s report is provided, this court should not do anything to dissuade experts from providing the assistance that the court needs.  Both forensic and treating experts will be subject to the same duties to the court: treating experts of fact and opinion often provide the most valuable of original materials including the immediate examination, recorded history and tests that may be difficult or impossible for a forensic expert to replicate.  They are and should be the first port of call for the local authority when it needs to commission specialist assessments and reports to inform its knowledge of the background and precipitating circumstances and its core assessment.  They are often called upon by the court to provide such materials when for whatever reason they are missing from the proceedings.</p>

In my judgment, the same problems would have arisen in this case had he been independently instructed as a forensic expert.  The mischief was that the court allowed its identification of the key issues to become obscured by an apparent agreement between experts.  Whatever the similar debate may reveal in respect of the criminal justice system, about which I make no comment at all, the proposition that treating experts should not be expected to give evidence in cases involving their patients does not apply nor should it apply to the family justice system save in the terms explained in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B</span> (supra) i.e. that their role is distinct, is recognised to be so and should not be confused with the forensic expert&#8217;s role.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It may be that in due course the opportunities that exist in family proceedings for case management, issue identification and dispute resolution hearings can be developed to further enhance the scrutiny of experts&#8217; evidence by the court prior to the ultimate resolution of the issues in a case at a full hearing.  For example, there may be merit in considering the approach of the courts in the United States of America as derived from <span style="font-style:italic">Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc </span>(1993) 509 US 579.  But at the end of the day whether it be during case management, issues resolution or at a contested hearing the court must engage in the process described by Stuart-Smith LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Loveday v Renton</span> [1990] 1 Med LR 117 at 125:</p>

The mere expression of opinion or belief by a witness, however eminent, &#8230; does not suffice.  The court has to evaluate the witness and soundness of his opinion.  Most importantly this involves an examination of the reasons given for his opinions and the extent to which they are supported by the evidence.  The judge also has to decide what weight to attach to a witness&#8217;s opinion by examining the internal consistency and logic of his evidence; his precision and accuracy of thought as demonstrated by his answers; how he responds to searching and informed cross-examination and in particular the extent to which a witness faces up to and accepts the logic and proposition put in cross-examination or is prepared to concede points that are seen to be correct; the extent to which a witness has conceived an opinion and is reluctant to re-examine it in light of later evidence, or demonstrates a flexibility of mind which may involve changing or modifying opinions previously held; whether or not a witness is biased or lacks independence&#8221;.</p>
