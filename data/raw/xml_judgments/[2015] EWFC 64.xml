I propose to call them the Wife and the Husband respectively for the sake of convenience, even though they have now been divorced for some time. I mean no disrespect by so doing.</p>

It is right that the Wife signed the deed and that it did say that HA Trust and EA Trust were &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">settlements for [the Husband] and his family</span>&#8221;.  This fact was confirmed in Note 18 of the company accounts for the year ended 31st July 2008.  The accounts were signed by the Wife as Company Secretary on 30th December 2008.  On 10th March 2009, the loans were assigned from the company to the Husband personally.  It is not alleged that the Wife knew about that at the time.</p>

LG&#8217;s parents are the Trustees and LG and KG&#8217;s children are in the class of beneficiaries.  Neither LG nor KG can benefit under the Trust and LG is neither a director nor a shareholder. I therefore do not expect that an independent report on this shareholding would be considered necessary, though details of the Trust should be exchanged during the disclosure process in the usual way.&#8221;</span></p>

Moreover, I contrast it with something said by the Husband in a statement for this case.  He said that he was keen to do the settlement properly as he was worried that, knowing the Wife&#8217;s character &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">given the slightest imperfection, there was a good chance (she) would be back for more in the future</span>&#8221;.</p>

In relation to the trust, they said they would need to have an idea of its assets and income.  The instruction of experts to value the various assets was put on hold in early November 2009 as the parties were discussing the matter themselves with their accountants, EX &amp; Co, assisting by assembling financial information. </p>

He was the family solicitor.  There is an attendance note between Mr QQ, who was Mr CC&#8217;s family law partner and the Wife which suggests that Mr QQ thought the Wife was going to instruct him but I am satisfied that was not really what was intended.  It certainly was not what happened.  Mr CC met with the Wife on 7th May 2010 and then with Mr SP on 11th May.  It was agreed that Forms E would not be exchanged.  The Husband&#8217;s solicitors suggested using the First Directions Appointment to approve an order or to agree a revised timetable.</p>

I will have to return to this in due course.  There is no doubt that the meeting went through a draft consent order and an agreement was reached.  It was subsequently signed by the parties and Forms M1 were exchanged.  So far as the Husband&#8217;s Form M1 was concerned, it was received by the Wife&#8217;s solicitors at 1709 on 28th May 2010.  The Wife did not see it over the weekend as she was away.  Monday 31st May was the Whitsun Bank Holiday.  The matter then came before Marco DDJ on Tuesday 1st June 2010.  By then both sides had seen the other&#8217;s Form M1, although I note that the Husband says in his statement, that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">given the time pressures I did not pay too much attention to this</span>&#8221;.

She was to receive a lump sum of &#163;4 million in instalments.  &#163;50,000 was to be paid immediately.  &#163;950,000 was to be paid within 30 days and &#163;2,000,000 was to be paid within 90 days.  The remaining sum of &#163;1 million was to be paid at the rate of &#163;10,000 per month.  This is 8 years and 4 months.  It has since emerged that the first &#163;950,000 was borrowed from the Husband&#8217;s father.  The &#163;2 million was borrowed from a bank, secured upon the HA and EA Trusts. The loans have subsequently been repaid by a distribution from the trusts to the Husband.  The Husband continues to pay the sum of &#163;10,000 per month.  The order also provided for child maintenance of &#163;10,000 per annum per child.</p>

It follows that the total award of &#163;7,250,000 was very close to half the disclosed assets.  It is entirely right to say that the Wife received liquid assets (albeit that the final &#163;1 million was to be paid over a significant period of time) whereas the Husband retained by and large illiquid assets, namely shareholdings in various companies although he did retain the Spanish property, valued at &#163;2.9 million net.  </p>

In such circumstances, each party is in a position to test the valuation evidence by reasonable enquiry and cannot complain if they fail to do so.  A more pertinent example would be a case in which there is &#163;100,000 in a bank account that happens to be in the joint names of the parties.  It is not disclosed by either party.  If the Wife knows that the account exists, she can make reasonable enquiry herself (as she is a joint holder of the account) and cannot complain if she fails to do so.  It is just possible, however, that she might not know about the account.  If that is the case, she cannot make reasonable enquiry herself and she must rely on her husband&#8217;s disclosure being full and frank.   </p>

She was reliant on the Husband making full and frank disclosure in that regard.  Her solicitors did ask questions but both parties (not just the Wife) decided to abandon the formal Form E procedure and negotiate.  In doing so, the duty of both parties to provide full and frank disclosure did not disappear.  A husband cannot simply rely on an offer to provide full disclosure in a future Form E.  He has to provide sufficient disclosure to give the wife a proper picture of his financial resources.  In such circumstances, a Wife is entitled to rely on the information that is provided.  </p>

I do, however, accept that she has no recollection of them being discussed.  It would have been far better if she had said that but she is not lying to me.  She has just misremembered.  </p>

I had to ask myself why Miss Bangay referred to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">poss non-disclosure</span>&#8221; in her email to Mr Ribet.  The Wife was adamant that the complaints related to the D Ltd litigation and the boys&#8217; position.

For Mr Amos to succeed in this respect, Mrs DS has to be complicit in hiding the fact that allegations of non-disclosure in relation to the trusts were raised with Miss Bangay.  Mrs DS was clearly telling me the truth when she told me that she knew nothing about &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the Press publicity in relation to the sale to Y plc&#8221;</span>.  She later said that she did not know what non-disclosure was and she did not tell Miss Bangay that the Husband had not given a full account.  I accept her evidence in this regard.  Mr Posnansky relies in addition on the fact that Miss Bangay has not given evidence to me.  I do not place particular reliance on this.  It may well be that Miss Bangay cannot remember the detail of such a brief conversation nearly three years ago.   </p>

The email was sent at 1330.  I have already noted that it was headed &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">D Ltd, the boys&#8217; trusts and sky collection letters.&#8221;</span> I am satisfied it contains the Wife&#8217;s complaints.  The email is not alleging non-disclosure.  It asks for information about the boys&#8217; trusts and is clearly predicated on the basis that she still thought they were the beneficiaries.  I reject as fanciful the suggestion that this was a dishonest trap.  It was what she genuinely believed at the time.  I therefore conclude that the Husband has not made out a case that the Wife must have known of the non-disclosure in September 2012 because Mrs DS raised it with Miss Bangay.</p>

She will have asked questions because she was interested and concerned but she would not have understood the significance of Note 18 to the K Ltd accounts.  I accept that she did not remember the references to HA Trust and EA Trust in the Deed of Loan.  Moreover, she did not know at the time that the loans had subsequently been assigned to the Husband.

At one point, his guard slipped and he referred to Burges Salmon as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">our solicitors</span>&#8221;.  This made it abundantly clear that he was approaching this negotiation very much from the view point of the Husband.  I accept Mr Posnansky&#8217;s submission that, in his evidence, he acted as an &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">apologist&#8221;</span> for the Husband and that, at the time, he did not ensure that the Husband complied with his duty of full and frank disclosure.</p>

Yet, he was constrained to accept that the Wife did not know about the existence of the Letter of Wishes or its terms.  He accepted that she did not know about the &#163;4.2 million cash placed in the trusts in February 2010.  He did not believe she knew the number of T shares in the trusts.

He basically said that he did not appreciate that discretionary trusts had to be included.  Like the Husband, he fell back on saying that they would have been included in the Form E but, even then, only after he had asked Burges Salmon if they had to be included, which clearly indicates that he was attempting to see if mentioning them could be avoided. He also fell back on not being the accountant for those trusts and not having the information available.  He excused the fact that the notes to the Form M1 were inaccurate on the basis that he was concentrating on the figures but this rang very hollow.</p>

It is, of course, right that the Wife denies that HA Trust and EA Trust were discussed in Switzerland.  Mr CC&#8217;s attendance note proves that they were.  His initial attendance note says &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Reference had been made to the EA and HA Trusts but it was agreed that no reference to those would be made in this document.&#8221;</span>  It was subsequently changed to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;in the consent order.&#8221;  </span>I reject Mr Posnansky&#8217;s submission that there is something suspicious about this.

The Wife was being led to believe that these trusts were for the children and nothing in the meeting corrected that impression.  If that was not the case, why would the existence of these trusts be ignored and not referred to in the consent order?  They were not mentioned because the Wife was being led to believe that any interest the Husband had in these trusts was not material and that they were for the boys.</p>

The first letter from Burges Salmon was not muddled.  It was completely false.  Either the Husband or Mr SP gave Ms Hallam that information.  The Husband saw the letter.  It was never corrected.  It was materially inaccurate.  When it refers to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the</span>&#8221; family trust holding shares in T, it says that the Husband cannot benefit.  Not only was this wrong, it was fundamentally wrong given the Letter of Wishes.  In circumstances where the Husband himself says in his statement that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">given the slightest imperfection, there was a good chance (the Wife) would be back for more</span>&#8221;, one can only conclude that this was deliberate.  </p>

The approximate wealth statement prepared by Mr SP in November 2009 makes absolutely no reference to HA Trust and EA Trust.  There was no disclosure of the number of shares in T held by the trusts. Equally, there was no disclosure prior to agreement being reached of the values attributed to those shares in 2008.  The value was not insignificant at just over &#163;3 million.  I reject the contention that the Husband and/or Mr SP disclosed that he was a beneficiary in November 2009.  I am by no means convinced that they did so in Switzerland either but, even if they did, the impression was undoubtedly given that this was a trust for the children.</p>

I consider this was likely to be &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">back covering</span>&#8221;.  The detail given however was just plain wrong.  I cannot accept that it was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">muddled</span>&#8221; for a second time.  It was wrong to say that the Husband was a potential beneficiary of both trusts.  He was a beneficiary and he had benefited.  It was wrong to equate the HA Trust with the 1997 A &amp; M settlement.  It was wrong to say that the children were the primary beneficiaries even if the sentence then tacks on that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">(the Husband) is also a beneficiary&#8221;.</span> Most fundamentally, it was wrong to give 2008 figures, given the very significant changes thereafter.  I will have to return to this in due course.  The disclosure in relation to EA Trust was much more accurate, although even there the Letter of Wishes is not disclosed and again the 2008 figures are used.  </p>

It was material.  I am not saying that the Wife would have received half of this sum.  I accept that the fact that the Husband was only the principal beneficiary would have to be factored in as would the source of the shares, although the money previously extracted from the trusts was included in the computation.  Moreover, the company was established during the marriage and the allocation by Mr MG of the shares to his brother also took place during the marriage.

She was not being deceitful.  She had no reason to lie.  This was what she thought.  She did not get a clear answer, notwithstanding that this was after the January 2012 deal with Y plc that had produced further cash of nearly &#163;9 million for the trusts and after the Husband had received over &#163;7 million.

This, of itself, indicates strongly that she did not have this information previously.  I reject the suggestion she waited until Y plc had paid up.
