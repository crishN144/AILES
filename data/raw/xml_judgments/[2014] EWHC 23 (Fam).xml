Given that, by the time of the hearing of the preliminary issue, there were 11 trial bundles and I was to hear oral evidence from 8 witnesses, this was plainly an inadequate time estimate and at the pre-trial review before Holman J on the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st </span>November, the time estimate was extended to 9 days, to include 2 reading days and 2 days for preparation and delivery of the Judgment.  In the event, the hearing lasted 8 days, not including reading or Judgment writing/delivery days, hence it was necessary for me to reserve Judgment.</p>

The Husband has been represented by leading and junior counsel but did not attend court at any stage of the hearing and so I have not had the benefit of his oral evidence, although he has filed some limited written evidence.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:Arial">The Husband is aged 72 and the Wife is 69. They were married in 1969 and have four children: Alexandra (40), Nicola (39), Christopher (36) and Fiona (30).  The Husband and the Wife separated in July 2012.  No one could fail to observe, and to be dismayed and saddened, by the fact that, after 43 years of marriage, this couple&#8217;s divorce has involved not only themselves but their adult children, with two of the daughters giving evidence in support of their mother&#8217;s case and the son Christopher giving evidence in support of his father&#8217;s case, and more importantly, in support of his own case as Intervenor.  It is, in fact, the Wife and Christopher who stand to gain or lose in respect of this preliminary issue, since the Husband does not contest Christopher&#8217;s case that he holds his RASH shares on behalf of Christopher.  I am satisfied that the polarised positions that many family members have taken has caused them on occasions to lose sight of the material issues in the case and, from time to time, to allow them to give evidence which is inconsistent with the truth.  Certainly, there are occasions, as I shall recite during the course of this Judgment, where family members have jumped to the wrong conclusion.  This is in part, I am sure, because the Husband, as all agree who know him well (from whom I have heard), has a tendency to say one thing to one person and something else to another.   In the light of these factors, I have paid particular attention to the contemporaneous documents.  I made it clear to the parties that I would find it difficult to attach substantial weight to the Husband&#8217;s written evidence, untested as it was by cross-examination, unless that evidence was corroborated by other oral or documentary evidence.</span></p>

First, the company would buy out the shares of the Graham family.  Secondly, our daughters&#8217; interest would be converted to loan notes and paid out on my death. Thirdly, Chris would receive the gift of some shares but would be primarily motivated by the prospect of inheriting my 50.22% shareholding on death.  Likewise, he would receive Susan&#8217;s shares on her death.&#8221;</span></p>

At that time, he says, it was widely agreed and understood by all of the shareholders in RASH that the Group and its constituent companies were more than likely to fail and go out of business.  Accordingly, he asserts that, following family discussions, he and the Husband agreed in principle that he (Christopher) would resign from his then current employment and would take over the running and management of the Shield Group, on the basis of the future growth of the business would be for his benefit.  He says that it was further agreed that the Husband would retain an ongoing role within the Group. </p>

The Husband is now cared for at the former matrimonial home, Queniborough Lodge.  His capacity to participate and provide instructions in these proceedings has been questioned throughout.  I must make clear, however, that (contrary to what appeared in some press reports following the hearing before Holman J on the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> November 2013), there is no suggestion that the Husband lacked capacity or suffered from any relevant ill health at the time of the company reorganisation between 2002 and 2005 and, in particular, at the time of the disposition of shares to Christopher and the alleged agreement with Christopher to leave the balance of his shares to Christopher in his Will.</p>

He has also for many years been a friend to the Shield family.  There have been occasions in the past when he has acted for the Wife in relation to private client matters.

Counsel suggested to me that it would have added at least a day to the hearing, which was already overrunning.  Some time earlier, the Wife&#8217;s advisors had prepared a detailed skeleton argument in support of an application to discharge Mr S on the ground of conflict and they had hoped to persuade Holman J to hear this application when the matter came before him on the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> November.  Unsurprisingly, the Judge decided that the application had been left too late, that there was insufficient time and he was unable to deal with it at that time.</p>

However, in the light of Mr S&#8217;s apology and his recognition of the situation that he was in, I feel able and indeed bound to express the view that Mr S allowed himself to be placed in a most difficult position and, however well intentioned, he probably should not have done so.  It would have been difficult enough, in the circumstances, for him to have assisted the Husband in the background, but to appear for him as his Litigation Friend was, as he recognised in evidence, putting himself into a most awkward position.  </p>

Suffice to say that, on the third day of the hearing, the 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November, I discharged Mr S&#8217;s appointment as Litigation Friend on the basis that it was clear from the medical evidence that the Husband had re-gained the capacity to conduct the proceedings.  Once the medical evidence had been received, no one opposed my suggestion that I should discharge the Litigation Friend.  However, Mr S did still give oral evidence and I deal with that evidence later in this Judgment.</p>

(At that stage RASH was essentially an engineering company and did not own the properties then held within Shield Properties Ltd.)  It is clear from all the evidence that I have heard that the failure to conclude that deal at a price acceptable to the Husband was a bitter blow and, to adopt the language used by Mr Graham, had &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">rather knocked the stuffing</span>&#8221; out of the business. </p>

He said that there was a real risk that the Perkins business would be lost altogether and that the business could have been looking at closure by 2003.  It is Christopher&#8217;s case that the combined effect of the failed Mackie deal and the waning fortunes of the company gave rise to the restructuring that followed and which is at the heart of this dispute.  Christopher says that his mother particularly wanted to take the pressure off his father and wanted to have more spare time and enjoy their lives without the constant pressure of the business.   The Wife now denies this and says that neither the Husband nor she was ready to retire at that time.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">In trying to establish the truth, it is helpful to start by looking at what is objectively verifiable by reference to agreed or readily established facts.  Once that framework is in place it becomes easier to distill the competing accounts of what was intended and why it happened.  It is a matter of record that, as a result of restructuring that took place between 2002 and 2005, Christopher&#8217;s shareholding was increased from about 0.05% to 50.36%, albeit with control remaining with the Husband because of the voting rights referred to at paragraph 30 above.  The reason for this is hotly disputed.  It is Christopher&#8217;s case that his parents asked him to move to Leicestershire to take over the running of the company.  He says that, in discussions with his parents, he made it clear that if he was to return to Leicestershire to run the family business he would not want the benefits of turning the business around to be shared with those who had no interest in the business. He said that he was aware that his Aunt, Jillian Graham, still retained a significant interest in the Shield Group even though she had no involvement whatsoever in the day-to-day running of the business.  He said that his mother often referred to this and resented the fact that her sister-in-law had a shareholding in the Shield Group without actually providing input into that business. </p>

Emma and he were aware, he says, of the risks of this decision which would involve them giving up their friends, their careers and their flat to move back and run a business which potentially had no realistic future.  This reliance is central to his case based on estoppel.</p>

He says that, following these discussions, what was needed was to put the structure in place with the benefit of tax/accountancy advice.  The kernel of the deal, he says, was that the minority shareholders were to be bought out (with the exception of his mother) so that in future he, Christopher, would own about half the company and his father the other half, save for his mother&#8217;s tiny holding, with his father having control through the mechanism dealing with voting rights.</p>

I am sure that the Wife would have been present during the principal discussions about the restructuring and I accept the evidence from Christopher and Emma that she was, and that she agreed with the principle that Christopher and Emma would move to Leicestershire from London, that Christopher was to receive about half of the shares in the company and that he would take a significant role in running it.  I do not need to decide whether it was agreed that Christopher would take over immediately, or in due course, and I can well see that it would be sensible for there to have been a handover period.

Alkie appeared to me to be angry and frustrated and when I asked her if she thought that it was fair for me to describe her as angry, she told me that she was &#8220;cross&#8221; with Christopher for upsetting their father so much.  Having heard her evidence, I am quite satisfied that she was doing her very best to tell the Court the truth, but that there was a considerable amount that she had not herself been told.  It is evident from all that I have heard that the Husband is an old-fashioned patriarch, who wanted his son, and not one of his daughters, to take over the reins of the business.  Alkie was quick to point out what she regarded as Christopher&#8217;s failings.  For example, she detailed how it was that Christopher had &#8220;been failed&#8221; in his university finals and that, but for her intervention with a long written submission on his behalf, he would not have been awarded his degree.  This may well be true; there are very many successful business people who have had unsuccessful academic careers but who went on to show great entrepreneurial skill.  Both Alkie and her sister Nicola are highly qualified and successful professionals, and I dare say that they each considered themselves better placed to run the family business than their younger brother.  Alkie explained to me that she had shared a house with engineering graduates and she knew that she would not need to be an engineer to run the company. Even when confronted with the obvious financial success of the business under Christopher&#8217;s stewardship, she was reluctant to give Christopher credit for this.  She was dismissive of her brother&#8217;s evident success, saying that at the time when he moved up to Leicestershire from London he had just been &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">larking about with the lads</span>&#8221; on a job where he was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">just paid commission</span>&#8221;.</p>

The fact that half of the shares were put into Christopher&#8217;s name makes it clear that something very important had happened.  I find that this is one of a number of examples of the Husband saying one thing to one person and something else to another, or perhaps simply withholding information which he did not wish others to know.  I therefore attach particular importance to the documentary evidence, to which I shall shortly turn.</p>

I accept her evidence, and so find, that the Husband said that he would retain control of the company.  This is not in effect an issue, for the voting arrangements do indeed mean that the Husband has overall voting control.  The issue is as to the balance of his shares and what would happen to those shares on his death.</p>

As things presently stand, and I return to this issue later, Christopher stands to inherit his father&#8217;s shares on his death and the daughters stand to inherit loan notes.  The key issue for me to determine, of course, is whether those shares are available as a resource of the Husband&#8217;s within the Financial Remedy proceedings, or whether they are already irrevocably committed to Christopher.</p>

She asserted that the Husband had always intended to have access to the value in the shares, in other words he could leave the shares to Christopher in his Will but they could by that stage have a greatly reduced (and presumably, no) value.

In her Points of Defence, she says that the making of a bequest of the shares to Christopher in his Will was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">merely one element of possible estate planning</span>&#8221;.

In that letter, Mr Graham recounted that he had met with Christopher &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">to assess issues that need to be addressed prior to his deciding whether or not to take on the management of the Shield Group</span>&#8221;.  At the end of the first paragraph of the letter to John Pridding he wrote the following: <marker name="tab"/><br/><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Without his full time involvement, at least for a period of five years, Chris believes (and I agree with him) that the group is likely to have to close down with the only value being the auction prices which could be achieved for the plant and machinery etc.&#8221;</span><marker name="tab"/><br/><br/>This lends further substantial support to the proposition that the company was in serious, and possibly terminal, decline.  This also corroborated Christopher&#8217;s case that he was being recruited to take over the reins of the company and puts into context the attempts by his mother and his sisters to describe him as &#8220;an apprentice&#8221;.  I am satisfied that, however young, inexperienced and untested he may have been, Christopher was chosen by his father to take on the mantle of &#8220;rescuer&#8221;, indeed that is precisely the word that is used by Ross Graham in his letter to John Pridding.</p>

In my judgment, there was an agreement to which the Husband, the Wife and Christopher were all party; that Christopher would take over the running of the company, that he would receive half of the value of the company now and that it was anticipated that he would receive his parents&#8217; shares by their Wills in due course.  What is also clear is that they absolutely did not reach any express and binding agreement regarding the receipt of shares by Will, for the clear advice from Mr Bartlett and tax counsel was that they should not reach such an agreement.  They could not say one thing to the Revenue and another thing to each other.  It is clear that the beneficial interest in the Husband&#8217;s shares remained with the Husband.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">I did consider at an early stage of this case whether it would be necessary to have an opinion from tax counsel as to whether Mr Bartlett and his instructed tax counsel were correct (and that is not to suggest that anyone has said that they were incorrect).  However, now that I have heard the case, I am quite satisfied that what matters is what the parties agreed, and I have already found that there was no express agreement that Christopher would receive the shares on his parents&#8217; death.  Indeed, on the advice of Mr Bartlett and tax counsel, they agreed that they had an understanding that fell short of agreement.  If there were any doubt at all about this, and I were required to imply the terms of their agreement, I would without doubt imply the terms that were advised and intended by Mr Bartlett, namely that there is to be no binding agreement about the transfer of the shares.  I have no doubt at all that Mr Bartlett intended that the beneficial interest in the shares remain with the Husband.  He did not consider what would happen in the event of divorce, or indeed bankruptcy.  However, he was eventually forced to concede in his evidence that if the Husband had become bankrupt then his RASH shares would pass to the trustee in bankruptcy.  This helps to provide a clear answer to the issue which I have to determine in this case.  Further, Mr Pridding conceded in cross-examination that he understood that there was no legal restriction as to what the Husband could do with the shares, albeit there was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">a moral one</span>&#8221;.  He added that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;as far as I was aware there was no formal agreement, there was an understanding.

Proprietary estoppel arises most commonly when an owner of property encourages another to act to his detriment in the belief that he will obtain an interest in that property. The underlying principle is that it would be unconscionable for the maker of the assurance not to give effect to his promise.

Here, in fact, I have found that they expressly agreed not to agree, for this is what they were advised to do.

He contends that the Husband is not a bare trustee but a constructive trustee of a common intention trust that was intended to pass the shares, with value, to Christopher on his death.  Mr Dyer says, and with this I agree, that it would &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">be absurd if Christopher obtained a different outcome from the Family Division as an Intervenor in 2013 in the divorce proceedings from that which he could later obtain in the Chancery Division if he brought a claim against the estate of his father</span>&#8221;.  I have already said, as is obvious, that I am applying exactly the same principles and the same law as that which would pertain in the Chancery Division.  I accept that the parties believed, as is probably the case, that if the Husband left his shares by Will to Christopher they would qualify for business property relief which would offset the otherwise payable Inheritance Tax.  That is not the same as saying that the Husband was bound to leave them to Christopher, or that he could not have sold, charged or otherwise dealt with them during his lifetime.  The moment it is accepted, as I do, that the Husband was free to deal with the shares during his lifetime, or that they are available to creditors during his lifetime, then the case as to constructive trust and proprietary estoppel falls away.</p>

Christopher had not, of course, contemplated the possibility that his parents would divorce, theirs had been a long marriage that seemed sure to continue.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">I can deal briefly, therefore, with the case that has been advanced in respect of detriment.  I have already found that there was no agreement, no common intention trust and no proprietary estoppel, and so I do not actually need to address the issue of detriment, but I do so as a great deal of time has been spent on it.  I have paid tribute to the success that Christopher has achieved.  I have criticised those family members who have not been prepared to recognise his significant achievements.  I have accepted more of what Christopher has told me than I have of any of the other family members that gave evidence.  However, I do not accept that Christopher&#8217;s case as to detriment is made out.  This is because, in 2001, Christopher was aged 23.  He had no significant track record of business or employment success.  Yes, he had a home in London and a partner who was employed there.  But what he secured from the reorganisation was half of the value of the company there and then with the strong prospect of the rest to follow on his father&#8217;s death.  He secured good employment at a salary which would have been the envy of most 23 year olds.  Then, later in the deal, he secured significant value from the introduction of the properties into the arrangement.  This was not originally going to be part of the deal but, for the reasons which I have recounted, they were introduced.  It is clear from what I have heard that the properties were introduced at an advantageous price in at least some cases.  By this, I mean that there is cogent evidence to support the proposition that the value put upon the properties on their introduction into RASH represented exceptional value for the company.  Christopher, now the owner of half of the company&#8217;s assets, gained one half of every pound of under-value.  </p>

However, much time was spent on issues surrounding the Husband&#8217;s Will, and a later codicil, which I deal with below.</p>

I am sure that both he and the Wife are desperately sad to see their family torn apart, and their children pitted against each other in such a public and ugly fashion.</p>

The Husband eventually executed his will on the 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2008, whereby he left his RASH shares to Christopher and the loan notes to his daughters.  The Wife executed her will on the 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2010, leaving her RASH shares to Christopher.  These Wills were consistent with the understanding that I have found they reached, but are not proof of any binding agreement.  Moreover, Wills can of course be changed at any time.</p>

	    <p class="Body" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in;border:none">Unfortunately, in 2010, the Husband was seriously ill and he was told that he had no more than two years to live.  Then, in May of that year, he collapsed at work.  The Husband says in his Form E that he had been put under great pressure by the Wife to change his bequest of shares.  Meanwhile, with their father&#8217;s ill health, Nicola and Alkie had made enquiries about the family situation and learned to their evident fury that Christopher was to be the beneficiary of his parents&#8217; shares.  They blamed Christopher for much of what had happened and gave little credit to Christopher for turning the company around, with Alkie describing that claim as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;a sob story</span>&#8221;.  </p>

The evidence given by the family members about this aspect of the case reveals the extent of the family split and I have no doubt that they felt it necessary to &#8220;vent their anger&#8221; about what had happened, but in my judgment the circumstances surrounding the codicil are of only marginal relevance to the issues that I have to decide.  </p>

	    <p class="Body" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in;border:none">On the 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2010, the day after he collapsed at work, the Husband executed a codicil to his Will in the presence of the Wife, Nicola and Alkie, whereby he revoked the bequest of shares to Christopher.  The codicil was prepared by Mr S.  Given that Mr S was not a party to the company reorganisation, the fact that he was the draftsman of a codicil changing the bequest of shares does little to inform me of what actually happened and what was agreed, or not agreed, at the time of the company reorganisation.  It was Mr S&#8217;s unchallenged evidence that he knew nothing at the time of the tax advice that had been given as part of the 2002-2005 reorganisation and that he only learnt of this in 2012.  Mr S said that the Husband explained to him that he wanted to deal with the shares differently from what was in his Will &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">as a buyback was on the cards</span>&#8221;.  I am not able to make much of this piece of evidence, either way.  It is conceivably some evidence in support of the proposition that the Husband knew that he was free to change his Will at any time.  However, given the Husband&#8217;s evident difficulties at that time, and since, and given the fact that the Husband has not given oral evidence and had a chance to explain, or be questioned about these events, I do not attach much weight to them.  As it happens, given my conclusions, I agree that the Husband was legally free to change the bequest of shares in his Will.  I agree with the submissions of Mr Dyer and Mr Duckworth, for the Husband, that the evidence about what happened when the codicils were executed in 2010 and 2011 is not very relevant to the issue which I have to determine, namely whether the Husband&#8217;s shares are held in trust for Christopher.  What is clear to me is that the whole position surrounding the Wills and the codicils has created untold misery and mistrust within this family.</p>

Mr S said that he has seen a great deal of the Husband since the breakdown of the marriage and that the Husband&#8217;s position is that he considers that his RASH shares are committed to Christopher, but that he wanted to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">create more equality</span>&#8221; among the children and that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">he was saying different things to different people</span>&#8221;.
