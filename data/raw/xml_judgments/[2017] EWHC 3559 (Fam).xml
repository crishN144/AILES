In order to determine it, I read evidence filed by both parties and I note that this material entirely filled two lever arch files and amounted to over 1,000 pages of statements and supporting exhibits.  Having read what the parties asked me to read prior to conducting the hearing proper, I refused an application by the mother to adjourn the proceedings and an application by the father that the court should hear oral evidence in order to ascertain where AB was habitually resident.  I gave brief reasons for refusing both applications which I do not repeat here.</p>

He holds both Russian and Swiss passports.  The mother was born on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 1987 in Redhill, England.  She is a British National.  It is clear that since childhood, the father has lived in a variety of European locations before moving to Switzerland aged about 10 years.  He later obtained Swiss nationality on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2004.  He moved to London in 2012 where he worked for a company called Glencore.  By occupation, the father is an oil trader and travels extensively abroad for his work.  The mother moved from England with her family to Switzerland aged 8 years.  She spent a year living in Germany at the age of 10, but was otherwise resident in Switzerland until 2006 when she began her studies in London.  She then took up employment in Switzerland in 2011 and was working there for the World Economic Forum when she met the father.  </p>

The mother&#8217;s address was noted to be  Chavannes-des-Bois in Switzerland.  That was a property owned and lived in by the mother&#8217;s parents, the mother&#8217;s father being a senior executive with an airline software company.  It is close to Geneva.  Thereafter, the parties are in disagreement about both where they resided and about much of their life together.  That disagreement extends to where AB spent most of his time.</p>

The tenancy commenced on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2016 for a two-year period.

The father responded to that email on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2016 stating that he and the mother had agreed to see a marriage counsellor weekly and that he would try his best not to travel any longer over weekends.</p>

All three returned to Geneva on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2017 with five cases of luggage.  The father asserts that by the end of June 2017, the parties and AB had relocated to Switzerland and that the trip to London on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June was to collect their personal possessions before vacating the London flat.  The mother denies that this was the case and said that the couple, together with AB, planned to return to London in September 2017 after a number of booked holidays during the summer.</p>

Nevertheless, he gradually, over this period of time, I find, became integrated into life in England and established a degree of stability there.  He and his mother attended the family members club at Maggie &amp; Rose Nursery from about November 2016 and also attended pre-nursery three times a week.  His mother seems to have made an effort to bring AB into contact with other children.

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, if the family had relocated to Switzerland at the end of June 2017, Ms Renton asked what was the purpose of the mother returning with AB to London on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2017 and again on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2017.  They stayed at the maternal grandparents&#8217; flat in Windsor which was available to them during those visits.  I heard nothing from Mr Perkins which might suggest why that was other than that the mother might have found it easier to fly to London rather than Geneva on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July when she left their family holiday in Greece following a row with the father.  I am afraid that simply does not explain, in my view, why the parents would be discussing on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> July 2017 the father coming to London in late July to visit the mother and AB (C304).</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">As far as AB was concerned, the evidence points to a planned continuation of his educational and social arrangements in England after the summer holiday.  A deposit for another term of pre-nursery was paid on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2017 and the final payment for that term was made on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> August 2017.  The mother says of her enquiry of the nursery in Switzerland raised by the father that she thought his might be useful for AB over the summer whilst he was on holiday with her parents, but she failed to make any such booking as the minimum booking for the nursery was for the duration of a month until mid-September 2017.  That would have conflicted with the booking for the nursery in the United Kingdom.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Standing back and looking at the evidence in the round, I have concluded that the family did not relocate to Switzerland at the end of June 2017 as the father suggested.  The evidence points more strongly towards a plan for the couple to live in London after the end of June and of mother and AB spending some time there in July 2017 between holidays.  This is, I find, inconsistent with a relocation to Switzerland.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Given my earlier conclusions, it follows that I find that AB remained habitually resident in England after the end of June.  His time away from London in July 2017 was for planned family holidays and he returned there for short periods of time, as I have already mentioned.  His time in Switzerland in August 2017 meant he was in a place already well known to him but his stay at his maternal grandparents&#8217; home was not part of any relocation to Switzerland when one considers the ongoing discussions between his parents about living in London and the absence of any discussion between them about a permanent relocation to Switzerland.  AB was not putting down roots in Switzerland during that time.  He was on holiday there and due to return in the care of his mother to England and to the Maggie &amp; Rose Nursery School in September 2017 where he was booked to attend.  </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">What is abundantly clear to me is that at the end of August 2017, the parents&#8217; relationship had foundered.  Lawyers were being copied into emails and the father stopped using WhatsApp to speak to the mother on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August.  Whatever the cause or causes for that final breakdown, they did not, of themselves, operate so as to alter immediately AB&#8217;s place of habitual residence at that end stage of the parents&#8217; marriage.  The maternal grandmother&#8217;s message at C458 needs to be read in the context of the breakdown of the parents&#8217; relationship, but I am not sure that, considered alongside all the other matters to which I have referred, it can constitute a definitive statement as to where AB&#8217;s home was on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2017 and, more importantly, where he was habitually resident.  Had it been in his mother&#8217;s mind as his main carer to stay permanently in Switzerland, I consider it likely that the nursery in  Mies  would have been secured and that Maggie &amp; Rose Nursery would have been told that AB would not be returning there in September 2017. </p>
