Both of those children were living with their parents when they began their relationship with each other in 2018. The local authority became involved with the family and concerns centred around domestic abuse, physical chastisement, poor behaviour management, not engaging with health appointments, neglect and lack of compliance with safety plans. In October 2018, there was an investigation into allegations of sexual abuse by &#8220;F&#8221; against his child, &#8220;Z&#8221;.</p>

At the final hearing in March 2020, it had been agreed that &#8220;PGA&#8221; would be assessed under the terms of the final care order. &#8220;PGA&#8221; is clear in her recollection that there was a hope and expectation that &#8220;A&#8221; would move to her home within six weeks of her having come forward. However, the world changed for everyone when the COVID pandemic disrupted every aspect of life, such that the plan was not put into effect. In addition, on the 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2020, &#8220;Mr and Mrs PA&#8221; gave Warwickshire County Council notice of their intention to adopt &#8220;A&#8221;.

She recommended that &#8220;M&#8221; and baby be placed in a residential setting. In fact, after &#8220;B&#8221; was born, he and &#8220;M&#8221; were placed together in a mother and baby foster placement. They have remained within that setting since that time, although there have been three different placements.

He would support &#8220;B&#8221; remaining with &#8220;M&#8221;. The mother fervently wishes for &#8220;B&#8221; to remain in her care.

Coventry City Council seeks a care order in order for &#8220;B&#8221; to live with &#8220;PGA&#8221; , and it is accepted that there will need to be a period of transition to enable that to happen. Warwickshire County Council supports &#8220;A&#8221; being adopted by the &#8220;Mr and Mrs PA&#8221;. This is opposed by &#8220;PGA&#8221; who wishes to be able to care for both children together.</p>

The SW at Warwickshire has asked for two weeks in order to file and serve an amended care plan. It is accepted that &#8220;A&#8221; could not move immediately to the care of her aunt, but that she would have to wait for a period of time in order to allow &#8220;B&#8221; to transition and settle, if &#8220;B&#8221; is to live with her also. The length of this period is uncertain. &#8220;A&#8221; would also require some preparatory work for about four weeks before she could move, but this could not start until the time frame was more certain. </p>

I think that it is fair to summarise that both the &#8220;Mr and Mrs PA&#8221; and &#8220;PGA&#8221;  acknowledge the role that contact will have for the children with all those of significance to them. &#8220;M&#8221;  questions why her contact with either child (if &#8220;B&#8221; is not living with her) needs to be supervised, given that she is currently free to leave the mother and baby foster placement for up to three hours per day. &#8220;F&#8221; opposes his current contact with &#8220;B&#8221;  (which had been twice per week before the recent change in placement) being reduced, and would wish for that to continue. Whilst his contact with &#8220;A&#8221; has not been as consistent, he wants to be able to see her wherever she is living. </p>

I understood that this was largely related to the concession that had been made on his behalf not to seek to put himself forward as a carer for &#8220;B&#8221;, but also in a failure to file a statement he had made which detailed his criticisms of &#8220;PGA&#8221;</p>

He saw how his case was being presented, and was aware that decisions were being taken not to challenge some parts of the evidence (for example, the assessment of the second ISW).

The reality of the position is this. &#8220;M&#8221;  and &#8220;B&#8221;  have been in a mother and baby foster placement for nigh on two years. They have had to undergo three changes of placement.

It follows too that children will inevitably have both very different experiences of parenting and very unequal consequences flowing from it. It means that some children will experience disadvantage and harm, whilst others flourish in atmospheres of loving security and emotional stability. These are the consequences of our fallible humanity and it is not the provenance of the State to spare children all the consequences of defective parenting.

The reality of the position was that parents who already had an existing relationship with their children were struggling to have any kind of face to face contact during the Summer of 2020, let alone members of wider family. &#8220;PGA&#8221;  said that she asked 62 times between March 2020 and April 2021 to be able to have contact with &#8220;A&#8221; and it was only at the end of that period that contact was finally arranged.

On the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2020, an employee of Warwickshire wrote to &#8220;PGA&#8221; to inform her that it was the authority&#8217;s view that &#8220;A&#8217;s&#8221; welfare was best met by her remaining in the care of the &#8220;Mr and Mrs PA&#8221;. Warwickshire also offered to fund some initial legal advice (up to a maximum of &#163;250) in order for &#8220;PGA&#8221;  to understand what her options were. Whilst I did not delve into what she was or was not told by the solicitor she engaged, again, I was concerned that it was her evidence that she was not informed that she could have applied to discharge the care order or make an application for a special guardianship order at that stage. </p>

The causal pathways to the comorbid are ambiguous and at best we can be reasonably confident the impact of adverse life events may have compounded an underlying developmental &#8216;self-regulatory&#8217; difficulty.

Further, whilst the children do have an attachment to each other, they have never lived with each other, or with another child of similar age. All of those factors are complications which will weigh heavy on &#8220;PGA&#8221;, however competent she has been assessed to be. As I noted, assessments can only go so far in being able to predict success. The reality of a situation can, sometimes, be very different from the proposal.

She has never cared for two children under four. &#8220;A&#8221; has always been the youngest child within her current home, and &#8220;B&#8221; has never had to share his carer with another child. At present, &#8220;PGA&#8217;s&#8221; contact with &#8220;A&#8221; is limited to once per month direct, and once per month indirect. I have been provided with the notes of those contacts, which I have read with care, and one is struck by the amount of support that &#8220;A&#8221; has required from &#8220;Mrs PA&#8221; in order to engage in that contact. Despite &#8220;PGA&#8221; behaving very positively at all times, &#8220;A&#8221; has continued to seek out &#8220;Mrs PA&#8221; for support and reassurance. It is my view that those notes give a valuable insight into how upset &#8220;A&#8221; is likely to be by having to say &#8216;goodbye&#8217; to her life with &#8220;Mr and Mrs PA&#8221;, and to continue to see them if she moves to &#8220;PGA&#8221;.</p>

Whilst there may well be some justification in her description of herself as a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;positive person&#8221;, </span>there was a significant element of unreality as to the extent of the challenge ahead of her, but more importantly, at the impact on &#8220;A&#8221; of a move. It was as if she did not think that there would be any difficulty at all in &#8220;A&#8221; leaving the care of &#8220;Mr and Mrs PA&#8221;.

The scale of the task is nothing short of monumental, in terms of managing contact between &#8220;A&#8221; and &#8220;B&#8221; and their parents, with &#8220;Mr and Mrs PA&#8221;, with &#8220;X&#8221; and &#8220;Y&#8221;, in the context of all the disruption that both children will experience. The inevitable risk of this over-confidence is that &#8220;PGA&#8221; may be poorly prepared for the challenge, and that over-confidence might then lead to the placement facing challenges, as possibly failing.

But secondly, that &#8220;PGA&#8221; may, having put herself forward in the way that she has, be reluctant to admit that she is struggling or to ask for help, which might lead to some of the children&#8217;s&#8217; needs not unmet. </p>

Without going into too much detail, there has been a rift in the paternal family as a result of &#8220;F&#8217;s&#8221; mother having accused &#8220;PGA&#8217;s&#8221; father of sexual abuse. Whilst &#8220;PGA&#8221; tried to maintain that this was not a complex dynamic, I do not think that she was being wholly truthful about that, and she was not willing to accept that managing the dynamics of "F&#8221;, his &#8216;side&#8217; of the family, and all the emotions that circle around that complex issue would be demanding and would place a strain upon her. &#8220;PGA&#8221; envisaged herself supervising all the birth family contact, without seeming to have any appreciation of how difficult that might be.

My impression was that her &#8216;battle&#8217; with Warwickshire has become a central issue for her, and that this has led to her failing to appreciate the issues from the perspective of &#8220;A&#8221;, or being able to hear the concerns and rationale of the professionals who do not support a move. </p>

Whilst I acknowledge that adoption is a draconian order, it is the only order that will allow &#8220;A&#8221; to truly benefit from the stability, love and security that &#8220;Mr and Mrs PA&#8221; are offering to her. Because the adoption will be an open one, adoption will also allow for &#8220;A&#8221; to benefit from a relationship with all of her birth family, including her mother and father. But most importantly, she will be able to form a strong and enduing attachment with &#8220;B&#8221; via regular and meaningful contact.
