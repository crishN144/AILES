I made clear in my judgment that L&#8217;s return was conditional upon my satisfaction that relevant and rudimentary steps had indeed been taken to put in place those measures.</p>

This was plainly crucial given that there was no likelihood of state-provided accommodation (see &#167;14 below), the mother&#8217;s closest family live in England, and the mother has no other support network in Belgium. Specifically, I recorded that the father had agreed (see &#167;28(v): <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2022/3427" uk:canonical="[2022] EWHC 3427 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2022">[2022] EWHC 3427 (Fam)</ref>):</p>

Mr Jarman, for the father, told me that the father had not in fact secured the property proposed as he could not rent it in his name for the mother, nor had he acquired suitable other accommodation for the mother and L.</p>

If &#8216;cosy&#8217; is meant to be a description of the room&#8217;s character, it is way wide of the mark; the accommodation appears spartan and unwelcoming, without proper cooking facilities, and not suitable, in my judgment, to accommodate a mother and 18-month old child;</p>

In his first statement, dated 1 July 2022, the father proposed that the mother and L should return to the flat which he was then occupying (inferentially, he would move out).  However, after signing that statement the father unilaterally surrendered the tenancy and moved back to live with his parents.  </p>

I gave him time to do so.  At a further hearing on 23 November, he presented some limited evidence about the availability of state-funded accommodation (&#8220;social housing&#8221;) which was not at all reassuring; indeed, the only tangible offer of support for state-funded accommodation was predicated on the basis that L would be returning to Belgium to live with the father not the mother.  He further presented particulars of private-rented <span style="font-style:italic">unfurnished</span> property; an <span style="font-style:italic">unfurnished</span> property would self-evidently be unsuitable for the mother and L in these circumstances.  At the final hearing on 12 December, the father put before the court details of a <span style="font-style:italic">furnished</span> duplex flat.  I indicated in my judgment (&#167;42) that <span style="color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">&#8220;the property proposed in my judgment appears suitable&#8221;.

More than a month has passed since my judgment, since which time he has known that this was a clear requirement of the court before the return would be effected.   In my judgment, he has failed to step up to the obligation on him to demonstrate an ability to deliver on the essential features of the protective measures which he himself has proposed; when a court hearing was convened for him to demonstrate his commitment to honour his promises he failed to attend without good cause.</span></p>

She is also effectively without anywhere to live; the temporary student bed-sit room proposed by the father is, in my judgment, unsuitable for this mother and L.  It is clear that the father is not at all well-placed to offer financial or emotional support to the mother; his casual engagement with this court process, evidenced recently by his failure to address the requirement to provide evidence of the protective measures in a timely way, and his absence for a crucial court hearing without proper reason, give me no confidence in his ability or willingness to step up in L&#8217;s interests. </span></p>

In reaching this conclusion I should make clear that I am not making any comparison with L's living circumstances in this country at present (about which I know relatively little); in making this assessment, I have focused on the &#8216;situation&#8217; which would be likely ton be faced by the mother and L in Belgium.
