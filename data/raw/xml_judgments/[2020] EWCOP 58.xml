	    <intro>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.55in;margin-right:0in">On the second day of the final hearing of this application, following the conclusion of the oral evidence of Dr Quinn, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, an expert instructed jointly by all the parties, the applicant informed the court that it did not consider that it could adduce sufficient evidence in relation to capacity to found declarations under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/15" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 15</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>. The applicant has not conceded that AG has capacity in relation to any of the decisions but rather that it could not rely on Dr Quinn&#8217;s evidence to prove that she lacks capacity, and there was insufficient other evidence to do so. There had been no assessments of capacity since January 2020 other than those conducted by Dr Quinn, and those other assessments did not address </p>

		<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.55in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">AG&#8217;s capacity in relation to all of decisions in question. Dr Quinn&#8217;s opinions were therefore crucial to the determinations of capacity that the court is being invited to make.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.55in;margin-right:0in">All parties readily agreed that although further delay in determining capacity was very regrettable, it was necessary for instructions to be given to a fresh expert to report to the court. This is not a case in which the application could simply be dismissed for lack of evidence. As Baker J, as he then was, said in <span style="font-style:italic">Cheshire West and Cheshire Council v P</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2011/1330" uk:canonical="[2011] EWCOP 1330" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] EWCOP 1330</ref> at [52]: </p>

In other words, the ambit of the litigation is determined, not by the parties, but by the court, because the function of the court is not to determine in a disinterested way a dispute brought to it by the parties, but rather, to engage in a process of assessing whether an adult is lacking in capacity, and if so, making decisions about his </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.55in;margin-right:0in">When ordering an adjournment of this case I was satisfied, in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/48" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 48</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>, that, notwithstanding the concerns about the expert opinion evidence, the evidence as a whole established that there was reason to believe that AG lacks capacity to make the decisions under consideration and that it was in her best interests to make interim orders and directions. Accordingly, on 28 October 2020 I authorised the continued deprivation of AG&#8217;s liberty with her residence and care being in accordance with a safeguarding plan dated 20 May 2020. A resumed hearing was fixed in January 2021 with directions for the receipt of evidence from a new expert psychiatrist. These interim orders deprive AG of her liberty and interfere with her Article 8 rights. Amongst other restrictions, the ongoing regime which I have authorised to continue until the final determination of this case effectively prevents AG from engaging in sexual intercourse, from leaving ECH and from choosing her care arrangements. Because of the impact of an adjournment on AG, and to assist the newly instructed expert, I was invited to and agreed to give this interim judgment.  </p>

The evidence is not complete and it would be wrong for me now to make any findings, including any findings in relation to Dr Quinn&#8217;s conclusions. My short review of his expert evidence is confined to that which is necessary to explain the need for the adjournment and to help to prevent any further delay beyond January 2021. Insofar as I make any criticisms of Dr Quinn&#8217;s evidence, it should be noted that Dr Quinn was questioned at length about these concerns at the hearing and had ample opportunity to respond to the concerns raised.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.55in;margin-right:0in">At her request I spoke to AG in the presence of her ALR prior to the hearing. The meeting was recorded and a note of the discussion made and circulated to the parties. AG has married four times, has four children, 11 grandchildren and 18 great  grandchildren. She was living alone in a bungalow as a local authority tenant prior to moving to the ECH on 2 July 2019 on an emergency respite basis. She continues to reside there nearly 17 months later. AG has a diagnosis of frontal lobe dementia and suffered episodes of confusion, aggression, and behavioural changes that the applicant contends affected her safety in the community. It is alleged that she had become a frequent caller to the ambulance service and attender at A&amp;E without requiring medical treatment and that on one day alone in December 2018 she called for an ambulance on 16 occasions. It is contended that even with intensive support from Age UK from 2016 until the summer of 2019, AG could not manage to live safely on her own in the community - she frequently ran out of money, she had been found naked outside her bungalow on one occasion, smashed neighbours&#8217; plant pots, and several times she lost her keys, handbag, passport, bank cards or money. A further incident on 2 July 2019 resulted in her admission to ECH. AG herself does not accept that she needed admission to ECH. </p>

On 17 August 2020, Dr Quinn answered the parties&#8217; questions and responded to a fresh witness statement from the allocated social worker. On 29 September 2020 he visited AG once more at the ECH and produced his final report dated 21 October 2020. This last report was seen by the parties only one working day before the hearing began on Monday 26 October. Detailed letters of instruction complying with the Practice Direction were sent to Dr Quinn prior to each assessment which set out the relevant information for each decision. </p>

He is an expert who has experience of assisting the courts in relation to capacity issues and who Counsel informed me has been a very helpful expert witness to the Court of Protection in a number of other cases. This was clearly a case which troubled him. His ultimate conclusion was that AG lacks capacity to make any of the decisions under consideration. What concerned the parties was the process leading to that the conclusion and the lack of clear explanation as to how it had been reached. </p>

Nor shall I comment on the way an expert should interview or assess P &#8211; those are matters for the expert&#8217;s professional judgment.
