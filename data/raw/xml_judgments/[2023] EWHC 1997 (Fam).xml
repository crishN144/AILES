What that episode meant to him is that C is extremely fragile and susceptible to deteriorations which are very profound and unpredictable. Explaining the pitch of the concern he had when he was telephoned at home in the early hours of the morning of 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June he said, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">It was very serious.

He did not take any issue with Dr Smith&#8217;s report in which he described the prospects of clinical improvement as remote because that chimed not only with his own view but with the consensus of neurologist views both internally at Alder Hey and also the external views from Manchester Children&#8217;s hospital . He would defer to neurology expertise as to whether C would remain ventilated and immobile.</p>

Dr K&#8217;s view was that these were nowhere near the level to indicate he could be weaned off mechanical ventilation. Taken to an entry in which a different consultant had noted that C&#8217;s breathing should be challenged off the ventilator twice a week, he agreed that it had not been done at that level of frequency but rejected the suggestion that  the fact that he had taken a different approach to what he called &#8216;one consultant&#8217;s view&#8217; in challenging at a lesser frequency did not mean there had not been monitoring by challenge of C&#8217;s breathing   &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">diligently, frequently and carefully</span>&#8217;.</p>

Dr K thought that, were he insufficiently ventilated,  C will sense that he was not ventilated. Within this context and talking of occasions when he had been off the ventilator for assessment  he observed, &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">There have been times when he has almost looked distressed and panicky when he has not had ventilation in assessment.&#8217; </span>As I later reflected on that part of his evidence it seemed to me that an appreciation of how having his breathing challenged was experienced by C might lie behind his seeming disagreement that it was necessary to do it as frequently as another of his colleagues had identified. </p>

His saturations were maintained (with oxygen as CPAP). After two minutes he began to show very small breaths on the ETCO2 monitor, which were not discernible when viewing his chest, or the bag. They were showing as ETCO2 readings of around 2. When I put him back on the ventilator, his starting ETCO2 was 7.3, and this gradually came back down with continued ventilation.

Dr Davis&#8217;s view is that the first option is unlikely, as there is no muscular reason why he would be only able intermittently to respond to commands and questions. The &#8220;diffusely, severely abnormal&#8221; activity revealed on EEG also aligns with the second option in his view. In relation to C&#8217;s Father&#8217;s belief that his status is explained by the amount of medication he is on, Dr Davies agrees that there are a lot of medications (he listed 18 in the body of his report) and that they include sedatives and painkillers. The clear message from all professionals is that without these medications, C  experiences what Dr Davis describes as &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">clear, continuous distress&#8217;.  </span> C has been much more settled since an optimal level of sedation and analgesia has been achieved for him and to withdraw that medication so as to test the effect on the level of consciousness is not something which would be acceptable.

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Of C&#8217;s respiratory function Dr Davis reported as follows: <span style="font-style:italic">His respiratory function is extremely poor. For effective breathing to occur, four mechanisms must work simultaneously: a patent airway, lungs, muscles, and a drive to breathe. C&#8217;s airway and lungs are not problematic. It is however very difficult to decide whether it is his muscle weakness, or a lack of a drive to breathe which are limiting him at the moment. His generalised lack of truncal muscle function would indicate that muscle power is the problem: however when I tested him off the ventilator, tiny efforts did not kick in until after over two minutes of apnoea, indicating a superadded drive problem. I suspect that he has both problems simultaneously. The muscle problem is however due to the innervation of the muscles, not the muscle fibres themselves. I note that he has been able to trigger a ventilator for a short time. Triggering needs small respiratory movements which cause brief reduction in pressure in the ventilator circuit, which is a long way away from effective breathing. Muscular training of respiratory muscles is only really effective for muscular fibre weakness.</span></p>

Nothing in his opinion was out of step or differed from the evidence I had already heard from C&#8217;s treating gasteroenterologist, Dr P, and his other treating clinicians.  In his report Dr Davies reflected on the difficulties of introducing feed:  <span style="font-style:italic">I wonder if the neuropathy affecting his body has also affected his gut, and he has a weakness of peristalsis meaning his ability to handle feed is restricted. The only way to show this is by increasing his feeds until any ceiling is reached.</span>  Asked about the recent greater success at the slow increase in feeds which are being better tolerated, his view was that since what was being tolerated is about 20% of his normal feed volume but at half strength it is essentially &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">trophic feeding</span>&#8217;. He acknowledges that there is a plan to increase very slowly. Increases of the order of 5ml per hour per day even if successful were not such that gave him optimism that C could move away from TPN feeding.  In common with the evidence I had heard from others, he expressed concerns about TPN feeding which has a limited life span and he observed in his report that <span style="font-style:italic">TPN hepatitis is an inevitable consequence of long term therapy. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Davis had been asked to give a second opinion on C&#8217;s prognosis. In his report he expressed that opinion as follows: <span style="font-style:italic">C&#8217;s prognosis can be ascertained by two routes: his diagnoses, and his trajectory. His diagnoses are all clinical. These are by their very nature less precise, and therefore less prognosticable, than diagnoses made by scientific tests. Steven-Johnson Syndrome and Critical Care Polyneuropathy are clinical descriptions of the end points of processes which are poorly understood. This means that it is very difficult to give a clear description of prognosis for his neuropathy. We know that such neuropathy can take many months (up to two years) to fully improve, but I would not be able to say who is going to improve, when, or why. It is therefore correct and judicious to give C time, and lots of it, to demonstrate whether he can, or will make any improvement. For C therefore, his trajectory is of utmost importance. Patients with Critical Illness Polyneuropathy can improve for up to two years after the initial insult, but the trajectory of improvement is not zero to one year, then full improvement after. C has had no improvement at all of his muscular function since his weakness evolved, 14 months ago. It is extremely unlikely that he will now start to recover</span>. </p>

In the ten days before this hearing I had heard an urgent application by the Father for an order that there should be a repetition of that test. It was an application which was opposed by all other parties. It was also not supported by Dr Smith, the independent paediatric neurologist instructed to give a second opinion, as I will come on to consider. I refused the application. It is right to record that at the time I refused the application, C&#8217;s recent life-threatening crisis meant that his condition was such that those treating him would not have carried out the test on ethical grounds in any event. It is a procedure involving sedation. Mr Mant had, however, heralded at the time of refusal the possibility that he would wish to revisit the question of a repeat test of neuro conductivity with the independent experts. </p>

There is general agreement that he has made no appreciable progress since August 2022, nine months ago. The therapy team is clear that there has been overall deterioration in his function. I note Father&#8217;s optimism regarding his feed and his breathing: however his feed is still of extremely low volume, and of negligible nutritional value, and his breathing is nowhere near enough, either muscularly or by drive, to sustain life. I understand Father&#8217;s wish to &#8220;leave no stone unturned&#8221;, however C has undergone multiple attempts at establishing feeding and ventilation.

The question of life expectancy is more difficult since it is dependent on complications of intensive care given. Dr Davis had given following view: <span style="font-style:italic">He has had frequent episodes of sepsis, from which he recovers relatively quickly. However, intensive care complications are inevitable, and depending on the seriousness of these, he may have a fatal complication. He is currently having expert care, where he is in extremely good condition considering his illness, and the length of time he has spent in hospital. There is no imminent risk to life. Without any intensive care complications, his life expectancy cannot be estimated, as it is essentially open ended. With a fatal intensive care complication, the risk is that he would suffer a painful, distressing, and uncontrolled death</span>. </p>

It might be a blocked tube that causes his death, it might be liver failure, infection is always going to be a complication, those are examples of what may bring about his death as a complication of intensive care.  It may happen in five years or ten years, or it might be much sooner as C doesn&#8217;t have a condition with a clear deterioration he is completely static and at the moment stable but the rapid deterioration over 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>/10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span> June shows what can happen.

He could not be discharged even to HDU without an improvement in his condition and it was his opinion that there was no realistic prospect of a meaningful improvement. The combination of his very high nursing load, ventilator needs, intravenous nutrition, intravenous medications, and a long list of drugs, of which some are intravenous was one component of what makes such a discharge unrealistic but as with all else in this case it is a question of taking account not just of the component parts but the whole. C is completely flaccid, requiring significant nursing input for all cares. Reduction in his nursing level would put him at risk of skin deterioration, creating more episodes of sepsis, pain, and distress. Discharge on long term ventilation into the community he regarded as impossible. His approach to physiotherapy was, to the extent that it fell within his area of expertise, slightly different. Since it has general benefits for the body if it could be done without pain and distress he would not see any reason not to but he would not see it as rehabilitative, and he was explicit that it changed neither his opinion nor his overall recommendations.</p>

He accepted when asked by Mr Mant that there must as a matter of logic be a point in time at which what was detectable as an electronic reading had not yet translated itself into clinically observable improvement. However what was useful to him in clinical terms in looking at C was that now,  in June, months on from the nerve conductivity test, there was nothing which indicated any improvement. He did not in his oral evidence depart from the opinion he had given in writing: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I note that there was modest improvement in the repeat nerve conduction studies performed on C in January 2023. This is not surprising as the body will always make efforts to repair itself following injury (as was seen on the nerve biopsy in May 2022, revealing some attempted remyelination), but there is no evidence that this is functionally beneficial. As noted in my clinical examination there is not even a flicker of movement in the limbs, and I note when seen by Dr Davies that ventilatory effort was negligible. As there is no evidence of clinically meaningful improvement in the limb weakness after a period of over 12 months, my view is that it is extremely unlikely that will be any further clinically meaningful improvement, and therefore C will remain immobile and ventilator dependant for the remainder of his life&#8221;</span></p>

Considering this in the context of PRES in his written opinion he said: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">C also has a substantial acquired brain injury (ABI). This is seen on the series of brain scans, manifesting with widespread loss of brain volume (atrophy), in both the cerebral hemisphere (supra-tentorial compartment) and cerebellar hemispheres (infra-tentorial compartment). There is also a evidence of injury to the basal ganglia, which have shown abnormal signal on the MRI scans of April 2022, July 2022, and January 2023. Although I understand why the diagnosis of PRES was suggested, the MRI brain scan was abnormal in any event several weeks beforehand, and it is likely that there is permanent injury as a consequence of hypoxia and ischaemia +/- systemic inflammation</span>.&#8221; He has no doubt that the damage to C&#8217;s brain is permanent and irreversible. </p>

Literature for high cord injury for example also suggests reduced expectancy &#8211; perhaps 14 years. The combination of profound neuropathy affecting the  peripheral nervous system and  a brain injury which is severe in his view makes those estimates optimistic but not impossible. Dr Smith explained that in that context he had quoted in giving his opinion 10 &#8211;15 years  but it could be shorter or longer. Moreover he explained one should not disregard the possibility that he could die on a ventilator whether by a misadventure with for example blocked tubes or otherwise.

His response, from the sense of which he did not depart in oral evidence, was telling:  &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">As discussed above best and worse outcomes are subjective, but I will attempt to answer this. I am restricting my answers to what I consider medically plausible, even if unlikely. It is possible that there will be modest improvement in his level of consciousness. However, as discussed above I expect C will live with substantial learning difficulties. It is possible that there would be some further improvement in his peripheral neuropathy leading to limited and partial limb movement, but I doubt this would change the fact that he would always need full time nursing care. I doubt it would be possible for him to be fully weaned from longer term ventilation, but it is theoretically possible. In the scenario that his critical illness neuropathy recovers to a large extent (which I consider to be improbable), this would likely then allow an underlying movement disorder (due to acquired brain injury) to declare itself. On this basis alone, he would very likely still require full time nursing care.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Smith&#8217;s evidence was that he considers C to be in a minimally conscious state though towards the upper end of that state. He had, when he saw C, elicited a response to a single step command but not a repeat thereafter.  In coming to his view as to consciousness, he has taken account of the videoclips of C&#8217;s responses to his family at his bedside. He did not regard the clips which showed, for example, C smiling at nonsense words made up by his Father to amuse him or responding to a punchline of a joke as inconsistent with his view that this was a minimally conscious state. Those sorts of responses led him to the view that he was towards the upper end of it. Though he did not think that C was consistently responsive, taking together what he had observed with what he had seen and read in preparing his report.  This he regarded as an issue of consciousness rather than cognition since C did have the ability to respond on those occasions when he did.  In relation to the prospect of any change in that minimally conscious state, when asked he gave the view that he might expect if he saw C in 5 years' time on a best case that his level of consciousness might have improved to the point where his responses were consistently given. This was another part of his evidence in which this witness felt himself to be entering the territory of an educated guess because of the uncertainty of C&#8217;s condition and the possibility of further episodes of illness having an impact on already uncertain cognition but he was confident in saying that as to consciousness, he would expect improvement over time. I therefore add to the benefits balance that C might be able, on a best case over time, to have a level of consciousness which allowed him more reliably and consistently to make responses to questions. I had considered, in listening to Dr Smith&#8217;s evidence on this point whether the possibility of a greater level of consciousness might carry with it the prospect of a greater awareness of his situation which might not so readily fall within the benefits side of the balance. I have, however, cautioned myself against an unduly speculative and overly subjective approach. Furthermore, a level of consciousness which had the effect of more consistent responses would be directly referable to the pleasure he takes in his family.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is also important in this case, just as fell to be considered by Poole J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Pippa Knight</span><span style="font-style:italic"/>at [80] -[82] by reference to the approach of Macdonald J in  <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Raqeeb,</span> to place into the analysis of the benefits that C&#8217;s life has inherent value to his family. In contrast to the child Poole J was considering, C is aware and takes comfort from the presence of his family. He is precious and valued to all of his wider family on both sides. Unusually, this aspect might seem less straightforward than one might expect. There can be no doubt that each of his parents love him dearly.  His Father I am entirely sure sees his life as having inherent value in this way. His clear view is that C is &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">still in there</span>&#8217;  though he will never return to the boy he was. His Mother&#8217;s position is more nuanced. She has told me several times during the hearings in this case not only that she regards C&#8217;s situation as not a life and certainly not a life he would wish to live but also that the state in which he is kept alive is terrible and unbearable for all of her family. I understood her as saying that her own perception is that C&#8217;s life no longer has value to him rather than I should understand her as saying his life has no inherent value to her. I am fortified in this by my recall of a time in the Mother&#8217;s submissions in March when she had incorporated into her passionate explanation of why she thought he should be allowed to die the words <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;I don&#8217;t know what I will do without him&#8217;. </span>I have taken those poignant aspects of what the Mother has said to me into account when I  conclude without doubt that C&#8217;s life is of inherent value.  The affecting way in which those who have cared for C in so dedicated a way over such a long time have spoken about him demonstrates that his life has touched theirs on a personal as well as a professional level. It must also follow from the rarity of his combination of illnesses and medical conditions that much will have been learned from his life, his experiences on ICU, and the experience of those treating him  during discussion at multidisciplinary levels in and out of the hospital where he is treated.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The assessment of C&#8217;s pain is a particularly difficult aspect of his situation. I have set out in my earlier judgment the extent to which C appeared to those treating and observing him to be experiencing pain. I do not repeat but remind myself of those parts of my judgment, notably [89]-[91] in which I have considered the issues of pain and discomfort. At this hearing Dr Smith whilst by no means dismissing the observation of those who are looking after C, from the field of his own expertise had little difficulty with the proposition of neuropathic pain but was hesitant  to commit to how it was, neurologically, that C would experience transmitted pain in circumstances where his central nervous system was not working so as to transmit pain from a stimulus. Couched, as was all his evidence, in terms which he chose carefully so as to try to avoid distressing yet further C&#8217;s family, he said that C&#8217;s lack of feeling and sensation in his trunk and limbs meant that if one were to try deliberately to cause him pain by an external, objectively painful stimulus,  he did not think  it could hurt him  as he would not expect C to feel it. He did think it possible that there might be some explanation for pain to be found in smaller fibres of the peripheral nervous system for which it is impossible to carry out any conductivity testing and so impossible to know anything about transmission of sensation. He emphasised however, on this and on other occasions, that he was making an &#8216;educated guess&#8217;. He was not cross examined about other pain which is documented as experienced by C in connection with for example gastrointestinal issues about which I have heard evidence from those concerned with his nutrition.</p>

The observations which record it are intended as objective but inevitably carry with them a degree of subjectivity. They are, however, the recordings made by those who are familiar with C and have been looking after him for a considerable time. They are also the recordings of those whose specialism means they are familiar with the environment of paediatric intensive care and the ways in which pain is both manifested and managed in that environment. I accept the recorded observations over a long period of time that C experiences episodes of pain consistently but not constantly and that that pain can sometime be managed but sometimes it cannot.</p>

They are neither clinicians nor instructed experts, but they are the ones who know him best. Inevitably their views come with their own perception. The Mother gives a description of him being in significant pain and described the expression of it as unbearable to watch of C screwing up his face. The Father takes the position that although he is sometimes in pain he is usually pain free and comfortable. It is unusual to have such diametrically opposing perceptions from the two people who love him most. They no doubt see him at different times and in different parts of his day. Accepting as I do that they each describe what they see in good faith, I have found it safer in considering his pain to rely more on what is observed by others who are not family members. It is also the case that their expressed views, irreconcilable though they may be with each other, are congruent with pain that is sometimes managed sometimes not.</p>

It remains the case that those professionals who are caring for C do not regard his pain as satisfactorily managed. His requirement for background pain management is well established and the fact that he has any breakthrough pain is something that is regarded as close to a failure of pain management.  The life-threatening episode (as I accept it was) on the 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> &#8211;10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June illustrated that pain is and will be an ongoing feature of his life. On that occasion when his physiological condition became so precarious that he could not have administered his usual background pain medication that was reflected in heightened pain scores in the following 24 hours.   Within the documented pain scores for the months of April; May and from 23 May to hearing there are days when there are no recordings of him being in pain: 4 in April; 1 in May and 5 in the period from 23 May to this hearing. It obviously cannot be said that he is in constant pain. Nor however can the characterisation urged by the Father at this hearing of &#8216;usually&#8217; pain free be right. I am satisfied that pain, howsoever explained neurologically or caused, continues to be a consistent part of C&#8217;s life. It falls to be considered in the burdens both of his condition and of his treatment. </p>

I have been reminded in oral evidence that the ICU is not a calm and peaceful environment but quite the reverse. It is a busy, noisy place filled with machinery and devices required for the very seriously ill and the frequent urgent interventions required to preserve life in those who are critically ill.  He will continue to require invasive procedures. He may or may not be able to understand what is being done to him or why. I have heard at this hearing that for example deep suctioning is a procedure which is unpleasant. It is not clear how in the light of his condition he experiences it.  It has been noted that even in relation to suctioning of the back of the mouth, C is described as withholding his cooperation. It is hard to know what to make of that but taken at the lowest, it seems to me logical to proceed on the basis that it does not bring him pleasure.  A nurse who knows him well told Dr Smith that he dislikes it.</p>

Whilst at this hearing Dr K agreed that were there improvement, he would be willing to consider trying again to move C by use of a hoist to sit in a chair which would be a better quality of life than lying in a bed that has to be seen within the context of the evidence of prognosis. The evidence to date is that C&#8217;s conditions in combination have made it impossible for him to sit in a chair without suffering significant discomfort. Moving him is a difficult and lengthy process, complicated by his dependence on mechanical ventilation and his entirely flaccid state, which I accept causes physiological responses including a raised heartbeat and profuse sweating. Since his physical condition means that those responses do not come from physical effort on his part they are to be understood as indicative of the effect on him of the experience. I accept the evidence that the efforts made on one occasion to take him, in his bed, outside so as to feel fresh air on his face was so problematic that it will not be repeated. </p>

The prospect that C would die in circumstances which this expert described as &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">terrifying</span>&#8217; with every likelihood that he would not have his family with him, would not hear their voices and know they were there and instead would be alone and frightened is as bleak a prospect as could be imagined.</p>

I agree that whereas it may be necessary in some other context for the concept of Dignity to be explored, it is not in this case. Ms Scott however, says that those matters to which the Mother draws attention when she speaks of dignity, using that word as an ordinary English word, rather than in any legalistic way, are not ones which I am precluded from considering when I think about C&#8217;s situation from his point of view.
