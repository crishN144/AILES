However the case has given rise to interesting questions about Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and what the scope of the safeguards should be to ensure compliance with it for the future. I have been exhorted to give a judgment which states unambiguously that the arrangements which I approve are compliant with Article 8. It is said that this judgment is likely to be looked at in any case presenting similar facts.</p>

	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">George is very seriously challenged. I have the benefit of a comprehensive report from the independent expert consultant psychiatrist Dr Dene Robertson dated 12 November 2010 and his addendum report dated 10 January 2011. These reports are fully endorsed by Dr BR in a witness statement dated 19 November 2012. They tell a sad story. It is not necessary to describe George&#8217;s history since childhood. I only need to recount that it is the unambiguous opinion of Dr Robertson, endorsed by Dr BR, that George suffers from a number of separable mental disorders viz childhood autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder, dissocial personality disorder, mixed anxiety disorder and paedophilia. Accordingly Dr Robertson, endorsed by Dr BR, is of the opinion that George lacks capacity to litigate, and lacks the capacity to make decisions concerning his care needs (including where he lives); the medication he should take; the contact he should have with others; and about his finances property and affairs. He is likely to remain incapacitated for a considerable time, to be measured in years, and possibly for the remainder of his life. It is Dr Robertson&#8217;s opinion, which is agreed by all, that it is in George&#8217;s best interests to remain living in the Y Care Home indefinitely. Moreover he should be subjected to fairly rigorous restrictions in his contact with other people and in his correspondence in order to minimise the risks that he presents.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The reason that these restrictions are necessary is that the psychological disturbance from which George suffers extends, as I have mentioned, to paedophilia. This has manifested itself in compulsive letter writing about his fantasies of sex with children (which letters have sometimes been left in places like the toilets at Tesco); by collecting photographs of children; and in other aspects of sexually deviant behaviour. Obviously, without restrictions, it would not be too difficult for George to leave sexually explicit messages in places where others (including, especially, children) may find them to their distress and harm. For these reasons it is judged necessary that he is from time to time strip-searched; that his correspondence is monitored; and his telephone conversations listened to (not on an extension but by aural physical monitoring of his side of any such conversation).</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_7">
	  <num>7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is no question but that George has been and will be deprived of his liberty. Under Article 5(1)(e) of the Convention an exception to the right to liberty is the lawful detention of persons of unsound mind. It is agreed by all that the final order requiring George  to live at the Y Care Home is not only in his best interests but is a lawful detention squarely within the terms of the exception.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The more problematic question does not concern Article 5, but rather Article 8. As is extremely well-known, Article 8 furnishes the right to respect for a person's private and family life, his home and his correspondence. But it is not an absolute right and it may be curtailed "in accordance with the law" where it is necessary inter alia for the protection of health and morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. It is well-established that even people in detention, whether in prison or in mental health institutions, retain nonetheless these rights, at least up to a point - that point being that the exercise of the right obviously cannot have the effect of destroying the purpose and function of the detention in question: see <span style="font-style:italic">R (P and Q) v Home Secretary</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2001/1151" uk:canonical="[2001] EWCA Civ 1151" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] EWCA Civ 1151</ref> at para 78. Thus in the case of imprisonment the right does not extend to allowing prisoners conjugal visits, or to possession of mobile phones, or for that matter single cells. On the other hand it does extend to allowing visits from family and friends, the use of payphones, and the sending and receiving of letters. Thus is the balance struck between the exercise of the right and the purpose and function of imprisonment.</p>

Second, the legal measure has to be accessible to the person in question. Third, that person has to be able to &#8220;foresee&#8221; its consequences - I take that to mean that the consequences of the legal measure have to be predictable. Finally, the measure must be compatible with the rule of law. This latter requirement means that there must be a degree of protection in the national law against arbitrary interferences with the Article 8 rights. Further, if a discretion is vested in a public authority then the scope of that discretion must be clearly signalled and specified.</p>

However, the Ashworth Hospital decided to devise a seclusion procedure which departed from the Code of Practice in a number of respects, particularly in the provision of far fewer reviews for long-term secluded patients than was mentioned in the Code. By a majority the House of Lords decided (and the Strasbourg Court later agreed) that this bespoke procedure, at variance with the prescriptions of the Code, was nonetheless "in accordance with the law". This was because the code of guidance had a statutory basis, but because it was only <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">guidance</span>, the Ashworth Hospital was free to depart from that guidance for good reason: its managers were given "a judgmental authority" (para 36).

Sometimes, particularly where the issue is one-off (such as authorising an operation), an order from the Court of Protection will suffice and will provide a sufficient basis in law.  But where there is going to be a long-term restrictive regime accompanied by invasive monitoring of the kind with which I am concerned, it seems to me that policies overseen by the applicable NHS Trust and the CQC akin to those which have been agreed here are likely to be necessary if serious doubts as to Article 8 compliance are to be avoided.</p>

All of the Court documents in this case, including Orders, have the names of the parties anonymised by the use of initials. In the memorable words of Lord Rodger of Earlsferry in <span style="font-style:italic">re Guardian News and Media Ltd </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] 2 AC 697" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] 2 AC 697</ref> at para 1 the case has become an &#8220;alphabet soup&#8221;. There is absolutely no reason for this, although for some mysterious reason, which I cannot work out, it has become standard practice. Not only is it very confusing to any reader but it dehumanises the participants. I cannot locate in the Court of Protection Rules a rule equivalent to FPR 2010 rule 29.10 which prohibits the inspection or copying of any document on the court file by a stranger to the proceedings. However by Court of Protection Rules 90 - 91 the general rule is that proceedings shall be heard in private. This means that the court file is, absent an order of the court, similarly closed to strangers. Proceedings in the Family Division and other family courts are equivalently designated as private business but all court documents bear the parties&#8217; actual names. So should court documents in proceedings in the Court of Protection. Of course, a judgment such as this, which is going to be published, will be anonymised, just as is the (usual) case with Family Division judgments.

But it would be a false inference to conclude that that judgment tacitly said that all court documents should be anonymised also. I therefore require that in the agreed final order here the parties have their identities restored to them.</p>
