They were very concerned about him.  He was unable to feed because of pain.  Having said that, they suspected colic and, on the way to the appointment, he burped and became more settled.  Perhaps as a result, the GP did not do a full investigation although his chest was checked.  He looked well and settled with normal colour.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">He said that the ribs of an infant are soft and pliable and a considerable force is required to cause a fracture. The mechanism of injury is severe squeezing/compression of the chest, typically by adult hands around the chest (although the mechanism does not have to include shaking).  The causative event would have been memorable to a competent carer and any observer of the event.  </p>

He told me that dating the fracture becomes less exact as the time between causative event and the X-ray increases.  He would have expected the fracture to have been fully healed by 5 &#8211; 6 weeks but with remodelling usually complete by about 3 months.  He estimated the fracture to be no more than 2&#189; months old and no less than two months old.  He therefore put the &#8220;radiological window&#8221; from early February 2013 to the end of that month or early the next month.  </p>

The Mother had made a number of appropriate concessions whilst maintaining her instructions that she did not recall anything.  She appeared to be honest when she gave this evidence.  There was no question of injuries to her older children.  Her contact to Y has been positive.  There was no concern as to her handling of Y or any loss of temper.  She reminded me of the Mother&#8217;s desire to have R returned to her which did not indicate that she was having difficulties in handling him or had recently assaulted him.  The health visitor referred to her as loving and caring.  Given their falling out, her brother had no motive to lie on her behalf but he did not say she had handled R inappropriately.   In fact, he said she was very good at handling him and better at consoling him.  There was no evidence that she was intoxicated due to alcohol.  The brother was well aware of her difficulties but he did not see her inebriated during this time.  She has been shown to be difficult to wake at times, including in hospital.  She was not asserting a positive case against either the foster carers or her brother.  It was not for her to prove anything.  She did, however, note that the Uncle was in the house for most of the time.  He had the opportunity.  He did care for R at times, including when she was sleeping.  Turning to the foster carers, Ms Anslow said that the Mother does not know them and has had no opportunities to observe them handling R but they had significant periods of time caring for him and they found him an immensely difficult child to care for.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I accept all the points made by Mr Abberton.  The foster carers had passed a rigorous test to be short-term foster carers.  They have cared for many children over the years, including their own, without difficulties.  They reacted appropriately by taking R to the GP.  Their evidence was entirely consistent with one another.  They were clearly honest witnesses doing their best to assist me.  The Local Authority need have no concerns as to the way in which they cared for R or as to their future care of young children, including babies.  </p>

At some point, either the Mother or the Uncle lost their temper with R and assaulted him by grabbing him around his chest and squeezing hard such that his rib was broken.</p>

I am broadly prepared to accept his account of the rest of this unpleasant incident but B had a bruise on his leg.  I do not believe that the Uncle merely stuck out his leg.  If he had done so, I consider it unlikely that B would have got a bruise.  He told me that B &#8220;ran into my foot and hurt himself&#8221;.  I reject this account. If B had run into his foot or leg, I think it would be far more likely that he would have fallen over, possibly leading to him grazing himself.  I find that the Uncle did kick him.  B may well have hit J but I remind myself that B was only eight at the time.  The Uncle admits he was angry by then.  I find that the Uncle lost his temper and did kick B as alleged.  This shows he does have a temper.  It also shows that his evidence is at times unreliable.</p>

He did accept that R was not himself and was crying a lot more than usual when he commenced his evidence.  He also said that he tried to soothe him a couple of times but, in answer to Mr O&#8217;Sullivan for the Father, he undoubtedly downplayed any difficulties.

She either said she could not remember or she said that her alcohol intake had been very modest.  I cannot accept this evidence.  I accept that she was never drunk when the foster mother handed B over to her but I am quite sure she did drink to excess at times during this period, although I am prepared to accept that this was primarily in the evenings when R was not with her.</p>

This is simply incorrect.  She said that, if he had been that difficult, she would have taken him to the GP.  Why did she not do so as I am satisfied he was that difficult during the day?  She told the truth when she told the foster mother that R had cried all day and had not fed well.  Why has she changed her account?  Can she really not remember or is she trying to mislead me?  </p>

Whilst one might have thought that the Mother would have realised something was wrong, she might not have done so if she was in a deep sleep as everyone seems to accept is possible in her case.  It could be said that the Uncle might be more likely to lose his temper if he was not experienced in looking after a fractious baby.</p>
