	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father is American, the mother English. Their two children were born in 2007 and 2008 respectively. Until the events giving rise to the litigation, the family lived in the United States of America. Following the breakdown of the marriage, there were proceedings in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Orange. I need not go into the details. What is important for present purposes is that on 18 February 2015 that court awarded legal and physical custody of the children to the mother and granted her a domestic violence restraining order against the father, and that on 17 March 2015 the same court made an ex parte order authorising the mother to remove the children from the United States. </p>

On 25 March 2015, while that stay was in place, the mother brought the two children to this country. Whether or not she was aware of the stay I do not know. It has not been explored before me.</p>

It suffices for present purposes to quote the following passage from the Introduction to his judgment (Transcript, page 2):</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;We grant [the father&#8217;s] writ petition in part and order the issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate directing the respondent court to (1) conduct an evidentiary hearing on the issue of visitation and contact, make appropriate findings, and issue a new visitation and contact order; (2) conduct an evidentiary hearing on [the mother&#8217;s] request to move to England with [the children]; and (3) conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine permanent custody. We will not, however, vacate any part of the domestic violence restraining order or the ex parte move-away order and will not require [the mother and children] to return to Orange County pending the evidentiary hearings. As we shall explain, the record disclosed exigent circumstances justifying the respondent court&#8217;s ex parte order permitting [her] to move to England with [them].&#8221;</p>

I have transcripts of the first and third of those hearings. It appears from the latter that the hearing in the Californian court has now been fixed for 2 May 2016. When the father&#8217;s attorney asked Judge Miller on 15 January 2016 whether he would be ordering the children and the mother back for the hearing, the Judge replied (Transcript, page 14): &#8220;Unlikely. If you want to bring a formal motion, I&#8217;ll consider it.&#8221;  </p>

As it happened, I appeared for the appellant. My submission, summarised by Sir Stephen Brown P at 793, was that the case raised a question of law of general importance as to the power of the court to dismiss summarily, without hearing oral evidence or further investigation, an application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> for which the leave of the court is not required; that where Parliament has said that proceedings can be brought without leave it is not for the court to cut those proceedings short by summarily dismissing them unless it can be shown, in accordance with established principle, that the proceedings are an abuse of the process; and that proceedings are only to be &#8216;struck out&#8217; if they are obviously frivolous or vexatious or obviously unsustainable or if it is perfectly clear that the claim cannot succeed. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">&#8230; these are not ordinary civil proceedings, they are family proceedings, where it is fundamental that the judge has an essentially inquisitorial role, his duty being to further the welfare of the children which is, by statute, his paramount consideration. It has long been recognised &#8211; and authority need not be quoted for this proposition &#8211; that for this reason a judge exercising the family jurisdiction has a much broader discretion than he would in the civil jurisdiction to determine the way in which an application &#8230; should be pursued. In an appropriate case he can summarily dismiss the application as being, if not groundless, lacking enough merit to justify pursuing the matter. He may determine that the matter is one to be dealt with on the basis of written evidence and oral submissions without the need for oral evidence. He may &#8230; decide to hear the evidence of the applicant and then take stock of where the matter stands at the end of the evidence.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>The judge in such a situation will always be concerned to ask himself: is there some solid reason in the interests of the children why I should embark upon, or, having embarked upon, why I should continue exploring the matters which one or other of the parents seeks to raise. If there is or may be solid advantage to the children in doing so, then the inquiry will proceed, albeit it may be on the basis of submissions rather than oral evidence. But if the judge is satisfied that no advantage to the children is going to be obtained by continuing the investigation further, then it is perfectly within his case management powers and the proper exercises of his discretion so to decide and to determine that the proceedings should go no further.&#8221;</p>

Connell J posed the question (at 414), what possible purpose could there be now to the father seeking to pursue the Hague Convention proceedings? He explained why he was making the order sought by the wife (415):</p>

The conclusion that I reach is that in the circumstances described, those proceedings have not been properly prosecuted and now amount to an abuse of the process of the court.&#8221;</p>

This was a father&#8217;s application under the Hague Convention following what Holman J referred to (para 10) as &#8220;blatant&#8221; child abduction by the mother. But, the mother&#8217;s counsel submitted, the application should be struck out or otherwise summarily dismissed as &#8220;that act of abduction has in effect been overtaken by the subsequent events that the subsisting French orders themselves provide that the children should live here in England, and, to put it colloquially, it simply makes no sense now to contemplate their return forthwith to France when both parents are living here in London.&#8221; </p>

I prefer to stand back from that detail and adopt the shorter route. Although patently there was an historical wrongful removal and abduction of these children, the situation that now obtains simply is not the sort of situation at which the Hague Convention is directed. Neither parent currently actually desires that these children move back to France.&#8221;</p>

Baker J did not refer to Holman J&#8217;s decision in <span style="font-style:italic">AF v HS</span>, presumably because he had not been referred to it. This was another application by a father in a Hague case where the mother complained that the father had delayed in commencing the proceedings: she had brought the children to this country in July 2013 but it was not until September 2015, more than two years later, that the father launched his application. The mother, relying upon Connell J&#8217;s decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Re G</span>, applied to strike out the proceedings on the ground (see para 11) that it was &#8220;overwhelmingly likely&#8221; that her defence based on Article 12 &#8211; that the children were settled within the jurisdiction &#8211; would succeed. Baker J refused the mother&#8217;s application, describing it as misconceived.</p>

The scheme of the Convention, which stipulates a different approach depending on whether or not the children have been in the country to which they have been brought for more than twelve months, is carefully drawn so that the issue of delay can be further taken into account in the analysis which the court has to carry out on any defence of settlement raised against such an application. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I start with the obvious point that Hague proceedings are, of their very nature, summary. Indeed, they are required by the Convention and the relevant jurisprudence to be determined within six weeks, a much shorter timescale than most cases involving children. As Mr Harrison puts it, the issue therefore is when, if at all, the court should deal with Hague proceedings in a manner which is not merely &#8216;summary&#8217; but &#8216;ultra-summary&#8217;. The answer, surely, is &#8216;not very often&#8217;. I bear in mind also that Hague proceeding are sui generis and that we must be cautious before applying too uncritically purely domestic approaches to what are, after all, international cases governed by an international Convention.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is convenient to consider first Baker J&#8217;s judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Re W</span>. I have no doubt that Baker J was entirely right to decide the case as he did and for the reasons he gave. Where, as there, the basis for the attempt to abbreviate an already summary process was an argument going to the merits (or, more precisely, the asserted demerits of the other party&#8217;s case) the short point, as Baker J explained, is that, save perhaps in an exceptional case, such arguments are properly to be dealt with as part of the substantive hearing and not by way of preliminary point. Preliminary points here, as in other jurisdictions, have an unfortunate tendency, unless kept under strict control, to cause the very delay which it is their object to avoid. I would expect cases in which it can be appropriate to follow the course adopted by Connell J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re G </span>to be most unusual and very rare. As Baker J commented, twenty years had elapsed before the point next arose in <span style="font-style:italic">Re W</span>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I equally have no doubt that Holman J was entirely right to decide <span style="font-style:italic">AF v HS </span>as he did and for the reasons he gave. That was not a case where the basis of the application was a challenge going to the intrinsic merits of the Hague proceedings. It was, like the one before me, a case where the Hague proceedings had been overtaken by subsequent events &#8211; a change in the family&#8217;s circumstances or developments in the foreign court &#8211; the effect of which was to deprive the Hague proceedings of any continuing utility and to make it unnecessary and inappropriate to allow the proceedings to continue in circumstances where there was no obvious benefit either to the parents or to the children in carrying on. In such a case, in my judgment, the court undoubtedly has power, applying the principles in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C</span>, to bring the proceedings to a premature conclusion. In the nature of things, I would expect such cases to arise only infrequently. The vast bulk of Hague cases will &#8211; must &#8211; continue to a substantive hearing in the usual way.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his helpful submissions, Mr Harrison drew attention to the requirement to give the child the opportunity to be heard in Hague proceedings: see <span style="font-style:italic">In re D (A Child) (Abduction: Custody Rights) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2006/51" uk:canonical="[2006] UKHL 51" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] UKHL 51</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 1 AC 619" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 1 AC 619</ref>. That does not mean, in my judgment, that the court is disabled, in an appropriate case, from summarily disposing of the proceedings, without making a substantive order, just because the child has not been heard. After all, I did not hear from the children before making the order agreed between Mr Harrison and Mr Bennett, nor, I should point out, did Mr Harrison ever suggest that I should.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I add three further observations. First, there is pressing need in the context of Hague proceedings to avoid satellite litigation and the inevitable over-elaborate and ever-elaborating jurisprudence which always accompanies it. Secondly, I would strongly deprecate any attempt to create a taxonomy distinguishing between, if I may be permitted to use the expressions, a Baker-type case and a Holman-type case: compare what I said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re F (Relocation) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2012/1364" uk:canonical="[2012] EWCA Civ 1364" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWCA Civ 1364</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2013] 1 FLR 645" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] 1 FLR 645</ref>, paras 58, 60. Thirdly, and to emphasise points I have already made, the circumstances in which the court can properly adopt an &#8216;ultra-summary&#8217; approach in Hague cases are very limited and the cases in which it can ever be appropriate to do so are likely to be very few and far between.</p>
