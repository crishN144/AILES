Of these just over &#163;1.3m are held in a post-nuptial settlement called the Brown Sugar Trust created on      22 January 1986. The settlement is a discretionary Jersey trust. This owns a Liberian company (Summer International Ltd) which in turn owns a UK company (Summer Ltd) which in turn owns two UK companies (Oakleaf Ltd and Deerpark Ltd) which in turn own two retirement villages in Lincoln and Gainsborough as well as some other assets, all of which are sited in the UK.  </p>

That aspect was whether the interposition of companies between the trust at the top of the tree and the assets at its bottom acted as any kind of impediment to making a variation which disposed of the actual assets at the bottom. I concluded in reliance on authority never before doubted, as well as my own experience over decades of dealing with this class of case, that there was certainly no such impediment (see paras 12 -13).</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In <span style="font-style:italic">Hope v Krecji</span> (at paras 14- 27) I also offered some comments as to the power of the court when exercising the jurisdiction under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/24/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s24(1)</ref>(a) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref> to penetrate the carapace of a company owned by a respondent and to transfer to an applicant assets owned by the company. Again, in reliance on high authority never before doubted, as well as on my experience, I expressed the view that where the company was under the control of the respondent and where there were no material minority interests such property could be so transferred as it constituted property to which the respondent was &#8220;entitled&#8221; within the meaning of the section. However, in <span style="font-style:italic">Petrodel Resources Ltd &amp; Ors v Prest &amp; Ors</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2012/1395" uk:canonical="[2012] EWCA Civ 1395" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWCA Civ 1395</ref> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2013] 2 WLR 557" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] 2 WLR 557</ref> Rimer LJ, with whom Patten LJ agreed, politely but firmly held that my view about the scope of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/24/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s24(1)</ref>(a), and the many antecedent authorities to like effect upon which I had relied, were all quite wrong, as they  violated the long-standing principles stated in the decision of  the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Salomon v.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case all the companies have been joined to the proceedings in circumstances which I will describe. They are represented by Mr Matthew Haynes who argues that the effect of the Court of Appeal judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Prest</span> is to render my view about the scope of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/24/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s24(1)</ref>(c) powers wrong also. He argues that respect for the corporate personalities means that the variation powers are confined only to adjustments in the shareholdings of the Liberian company and nothing more. Specifically the interposition of the companies means that the court cannot directly deal with the assets at the bottom of the tree. </p>

This is because it is only in rare cases that the settlement directly owns the underlying assets (although this does crop up from time to time in cases about landed estates here). In the great majority of cases there is an interposed company, and it is usually off-shore. A grant of relief that leaves the applicant to engage in enforcement proceedings in Monrovia or Tortola or George Town is likely to prove to be a poisoned chalice. That said, if the argument is right the unintended consequence of the destruction of the efficacy of this type of relief is something that will have to be borne. </p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;In English law "settlement" is not a term of art, with one specific and precise meaning. Its meaning depends on the context in which it is being used. To a conveyancer a settlement essentially connotes a disposition by deed vesting property in trustees to be held by them for a succession of interests. In some contexts settlement bears a statutorily defined meaning, as in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/18/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/18" uk:canonical="1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5) c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Settled Land Act 1925</ref>. Another example, where settlement is given an extremely wide statutory meaning, is <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1988/1/section/670" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 670</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1988/1" uk:canonical="1988 c. 1" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988</ref> ("any disposition, trust, covenant, agreement, arrangement, or transfer of assets").</p>

Certain indicia of the type of disposition with which the section is concerned can be identified reasonably easily. The section is concerned with a settlement "made on the parties to the marriage" <span style="font-weight:bold">So, broadly stated, the disposition must be one which makes some form of continuing provision for both or either of the parties to a marriage with or without provision for their children</span>. Conversely, a disposition which confers an immediate, absolute interest in an item of property does not constitute a settlement of that property. The statutory provision is concerned with an order varying the terms of a settlement. This would not be an altogether apt exercise in relation to property given out-and-out and belonging to one of the parties to the marriage as his or her own absolute property. The context does not require that outright gifts of this nature should fall within the scope of the variation provision. In such a case the appropriate order on the dissolution of the marriage, if an order is needed in respect of the property, is a property transfer or property settlement order.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Beyond this the authorities have consistently given a wide meaning to settlement in this context, and they have spelled out no precise limitations. This seems right, because this approach accords with the purpose of the statutory provision. Financial provision that is appropriate so long as the parties are married will often cease to be appropriate when the marriage ends. In order to promote the best interests of the parties and their children in the fundamentally changed situation, it is desirable that the court should have power to alter the terms of the settlement. The purpose of the section is to give the court this power. This object does not dictate that settlement should be given a narrow meaning. On the contrary, the purpose of the section would be impeded, rather than advanced, by confining its scope. The continuing use of the archaic expressions "ante-nuptial" and "post-nuptial" does not point in the opposite direction. These expressions are apt to embrace all settlements in respect of the particular marriage, whether made before or after the marriage.&#8221; (emphasis added)</p>

If that is so then it would seem that there must be very many invalid variation orders at large. And further that one would have expected Parliament when enacting the Family Procedure Rules to have provided for mandatory joinder so that valid orders may be made.</p>

This seems to me to state the obvious and provides no support for Mr Southgate&#8217;s argument that the bespoke procedure specified in rule 9.13 will, absent joinder, lead to invalid orders being made.</p>

A crucial matter for my determination in March 1996 will be to evaluate the real control over the assets of this trust which forms so substantial a fund in relation to any other assets which the parties have. Are these funds, in terms of capital and not just of income, funds which, in effect although not in form, are able to be deployed by the husband? That is directly relevant to the duty of inquiry that I have under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1988/1/section/25/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 25(2)</ref>(a) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1988/1" uk:canonical="1988 c. 1" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. I have to have regard to the &#8216; . . . property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has . . .&#8217;. It seems to me that that question will, in addition to its relevance to any lump sum order, be of the greatest importance in the decision which I reach as to whether (and if so in what terms) to vary the settlement under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/24/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 24(1)</ref>(c).</p>

I would have had some doubt about whether to have added that consideration into my conclusion about the applicability of Ord 15, r6(2)(b)(i) and/or (ii), had I not been referred to a decision of Mummery J in <span style="font-style:italic">TSB Private Bank International SA v Chabra</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1992] 1 WLR 231" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1992">[1992] 1 WLR 231</ref> where a very wide construction was placed upon the justice and convenience referred to in r 6(2)(b)(ii). He decided that there should be joined to the proceedings a UK company which it was alleged by the plaintiff was the alter ego of the defendant but which really had, so far as I can see, nothing to do with the substantive issue as to liability raised between plaintiff and defendant; and the justification for bringing that company in as a party seems to have related to the judge&#8217;s perception as to the facility for enforcement later of any order that might ultimately be made. I have already said that I would consider it far easier for the wife to enforce against the trust assets in England if the trustees remained a party. I would also expect and believe that, notwithstanding that there might be difficulties about the automatic enforcement in Jersey of any order that I made in the event that following this afternoon the trustees failed to take an active part in these proceedings, nevertheless their having been made parties to the proceedings would be likely to assist the wife in, if not direct enforcement, the obtaining of an analogous or supplementary judgment in Jersey; and, indeed, might assist her in putting before the Jersey court, as facts which have been found and from which there should be no escape, facts found by me at a hearing in which, whether they actively participated or not, the trustees were parties.&#8221;</p>

The inquiry will be done on the evidence before the court and the formal joinder of the trustees will not enlarge that evidence. It may be said that the obtaining of information for the inquiry might be better achieved if the trustees are parties but as against that there is the fact that if they are not parties orders for disclosure against them as non-parties can be obtained under FPR 2010 rule 24.2 or, if the trustee is overseas, by means of the procedure in rule 24.12 (in a non-EU case) or rule 24.16 (in a EU case).</p>

The failure to give any notice or to provide any evidence deprived them of that obvious right. I asked Mr Southgate why the rule was disregarded and he was unable to give me an answer.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This was a second marriage for each of them. By her first marriage the wife has two children: Maggie who is single and Edward who is married to (but separated from) Libby. Edward and Libby have one child Grace aged 11. The husband was previously married to Christina and from that marriage has one child Susie who lives with her partner in Australia and who has a daughter Chloe aged seven. The husband and wife have one child Amelia who was born on 1 February 1978 and who is now aged 35.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In 1975 the husband was aged 31 and was clearly a man of some substance. Unfortunately he only advanced his case about premarital wealth very late in the day and in such a way that has prevented any kind of careful quantitative appraisal of the scale of such wealth. He told me that in the divorce proceedings between him and Christina he would likely have made an affidavit of means and he accepted that it would have been open to him to have applied for the retrieval of the court file from his first divorce and to have bespoken a copy of it. This would have told him and me with some precision the scale of his wealth at the time of the commencement of this relationship with the wife. But he did not do so and nor did he produce any corroborative contemporaneous documentary evidence of the scale of such wealth. The inevitable consequence is that this factor must be treated extremely sceptically and conservatively and if an injustice is thereby meted out to the husband then he has only himself to blame.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment the only fair way of dealing with the husband's premarital wealth is to identify those assets which actually existed at the time of the commencement of this relationship and which exist now and which remain in the husband's direct sole ownership. These identified assets comprise a 16 acre field behind the former matrimonial home worth net &#163;125,615; a plot of land in Suffolk on which a tennis court has been built worth net &#163;29,100; a mooring in Suffolk worth net &#163;9,700; and some ground rents worth net &#163;28,500. A total of &#163;192,195. The husband says that in addition he had a substantial land-bank, since sold; a nursing home, since sold; and the land on which the jewel in the crown was built &#8211; the Gainsborough retirement village. The proceeds of the sold assets are unknown and went into the family pot and over the course of this very long marriage have been well and truly merged with other matrimonial property. The Gainsborough Village is the principal asset of the postnuptial settlement to which I have referred. I am not prepared to make any further adjustment in my application of the sharing principle beyond designating the identified assets which I have specifically mentioned above as non-matrimonial property.</p>

That one-third interest in these assets is worth &#163;123,965 and that I also designate as non-matrimonial property.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband has always been involved in property and in 1975 he devised the concept of the Oakleaf Village which is a form of sheltered housing for people aged 55 and older. The residents can occupy properties in the village in three different ways &#8211; either under shorthold tenancies, or by buying long leases, or under a leasing scheme whereby they advance upfront a substantial deposit which is then drawn down as rent with any balance being refunded upon vacation. The Gainsborough Village commenced operating in 1977 and there are 67 dwellings there; the Lincoln Village commenced operating in 1984 and there are 36 dwellings there. In addition to the individual dwellings there is a communal central block offering social facilities and each village has a resident warden to look after the residents. Until the advent of the current economic crisis the business prospered but it has recently fallen on evil times (to echo Lord Macnaghten&#8217;s description of Mr Salomon&#8217;s similar problems back in 1896). The villages are not running at full occupancy &#8211;  there are 16 voids and in order to meet cash flow apartments are being sold on long leases thereby diminishing the capital base. The husband is very actively involved in both villages both in management and pastoral terms and it is his ardent wish to be able to continue to do so. It is his case that a sale or partition of the business would likely destroy it with the loss of employment and the placing of the residents in jeopardy.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have referred above to the creation of the Brown Sugar Trust in 1986 into which the retirement villages and some other assets were placed. In the trust deed the beneficiaries are defined as (1) the husband; (2) any person who is or has been his spouse; (3) the issue of any person within (1) or (2); and a person who is or has been a spouse of a person in (3). Thus at the present time the beneficiaries are the husband, the wife, Maggie, Edward, Libby, Grace (aged 11), Amelia, Susie, Chloe (aged seven), Christina and her adult son by a later relationship James. A total of 11 living people and of course by the terms of the trust they will be joined by persons as yet unborn.</p>

Edward and Libby state on behalf of Grace that they are unconcerned for her also. By contrast Christina, and Susie (both on her own account and on behalf of Chloe) express strong concern at the prospect of the dismantlement of the trust particularly since the trust has commenced paying Chloe&#8217;s school fees in Australia. Amelia wisely is taking a neutral stance.</p>

In her evidence the wife agreed that the object of the trust was to benefit all members of the family. On the other hand the assets of the trust are the product of the joint endeavour of the parties each making the fullest possible contribution in their different ways and are quintessentially matrimonial property. I consider that the fairest way of balancing these two considerations is not to allow the full value of the trust as matrimonial property. In my judgment to allow 80 pence in the pound is a fair, if arbitrary, way of balancing these two conflicting considerations.</p>

Ms Mullen for the husband sought to persuade me to take a lower figure as my starting point based on a fire-sale or an auction of the villages. I decline to do so not least because the order which I will make in favour of the wife from the trust assets will carry with it a considerable time for payment. I also heard some completely irrelevant evidence from a Mr Alton who is a property developer who might, or might not, make an offer in a sum which he did not specify to buy the villages.</p>

As is well known discretionary trusts must pay inheritance tax along the way at 10 yearly intervals. The trust is technically owed a sum of about &#163;1 million by the Liberian company. If the debtor is sited here then inheritance tax must be paid. It has not been paid as it is considered that the Liberian company is resident in Liberia even though its business is here and its directors are here. The husband's accountant felt that it was more likely than not that tax should have been paid in 2006 and he calculates that &#163;115,000 is due with interest (but no penalty). As against this the trustees firmly believe that the debtor is sited overseas and it is a fact that no demand for payment has been made by HMRC notwithstanding that an exhaustive tax enquiry took place about 10 years ago. I therefore allow 50% of the sum to reflect the various uncertainties to which I have referred.</p>

Although the normal rule as stated in <span style="font-style:italic">White v White</span>[2001] 1 AC 596  is that latent capital gains tax should be allowed the court must nonetheless be realistic. I consider it reasonable to allow this latent sum but I will bear in mind that it may be a long time before any such tax is paid by the husband (or anyone else) and that in the meantime the husband will continue to have the use of the assets.</p>

Inevitably the husband produced estate agents&#8217; particulars at a lower range and one of them, on the market for just under &#163;300,000, the wife actually liked a great deal, although she stated that quite a lot of work would be needed on it. In my judgment having considered the estate agents&#8217; particulars carefully and the wife's written and oral evidence the wife's capital needs are tabulated by me as follows:</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The wife's income budget was for &#163;63,420 annually. There were a few plainly illegitimate items within it such as saving for her children's inheritance but those aside the figures were not unreasonable even if they represent a gross income substantially in excess of what the business in these straightened times has been able to pay to her over the last few years. In my judgment an annual figure of &#163;60,000 is reasonable. It is agreed that the parties&#8217; pensions will be divided equally. This will give the wife pension income of &#163;5,572 . In addition she has the state pension of &#163;5,587. On these parameters the Duxbury calculation is &#163;725,000. </p>

To depart from the Duxbury pathway when capitalising a lifetime income need risks an unprincipled, formless and impressionistic judgment replacing the tried and tested guideline. Of course the Duxbury figure is only ever a guideline but departure from it must surely be rationally and numerically justified by reference to clear evidence rather than just being, as here, a figure plucked out of the thin air. In this case I discern no good reason to depart from the Duxbury guideline. </p>

The wife's aspiration as expressed in her formal open proposal was that one of the two villages should be appointed out to her outright from the settlement. The evidence demonstrated this to be a completely unrealistic ambition. There are significant capital demands on the villages looming and the wife was unable to explain how she would raise the funds to meet these beyond saying that she would, if she could not obtain bank credit, use her own capital which would otherwise have been used to meet her housing need. This struck me as highly foolhardy. Further, it was clearly shown to me that the wife simply did not have the practical experience to run a village herself. Further still, I was fully persuaded by the husband that to partition the business would lose synergy and economies of scale and would likely lead to its demise and the prejudice of the workers and the residents. In any event in her oral evidence in answer to a question from me the wife accepted that her preference would in fact be to receive clean money from the business so that with an appropriate allocation of the non-business assets she could rebuild her life anew.</p>

I am satisfied that the value of this field has been captured in the valuation of the rest of the farmland which is held in the husband&#8217;s sole name. In addition, the husband wishes to retain a small plot within the demise of the matrimonial home. This is the red land on the plan at D382.  The reason that the husband wishes to retain this plot is that he has a hope of buying the adjacent bungalow from its elderly occupant and of merging its demise with the red land and to build a home for himself on that enlarged plot.  The valuer&#8217;s view is that to remove the red land would reduce the value of the (reduced) demise of the matrimonial home by &#163;50,000.</p>
