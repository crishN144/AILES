	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">During the course of the hearing, the stress of the proceedings was palpably evident on the parties and particularly the Wife. It brought home to me yet again the benefits of an agreed settlement and the emotional as well as the financial cost of contested litigation. The impact of the latter are often, in my view, underestimated at the early stages of proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">The Wife's case, in summary, is that she should receive broadly half of the current wealth. It is contended that this represents a fair share of that wealth and that her needs would not be met if she received any lesser amount. In total the Wife seeks approximately &#163;9.6 million based on total resources, put by her, at approximately &#163;19.5 million. The latter figure includes a number of contingent deferred assets and includes assets in employee benefit trusts at their gross value.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">The Husband's case, also in summary, is that the Wife's award should reflect the fact that a significant part of the current wealth is non-marital as it has accrued since the parties separated. He puts the marital wealth at approximately &#163;8.8 million net (&#163;10.8 million gross) and the non-marital wealth at approximately &#163;4.5 million net (&#163;6.8 million gross). The net figures are after deduction of a significant tax charge potentially payable if the funds in the employee benefit trusts were distributed. He proposes that contingent assets (included within these totals) should be shared in kind (in differing proportions) so that the amount each party receives reflects the actual value received rather than an estimate. The Husband states that his offer would provide the Wife with &#163;5.2 million from the accrued assets and with over &#163;6.1 million if the contingent assets materialise. It is contended that the Wife will be able to meet her needs even if none of the contingent assets are received.</p>

His career started in 1980 when he joined a firm of stockbrokers in South Africa. Since then it has progressed and developed as he has moved up the corporate ladder and as, through the businesses where he has worked, he has been part of the mergers and acquisitions which have been a feature of the financial services industry over the last 25 years. Between 1991 and 1997 he, and the family, lived in the USA where the Husband had been transferred. In 1997 they moved to live in England when the Husband was transferred here. He remains employed in England at Company Z. </p>

In the course of his evidence, the Husband said that most of the resources now represented in the Schedule of Assets were received in the recent past. This is not unusual. It is not unusual for financial rewards to increase substantially during the later part of a person's career. This might be predictable, reflecting the work done and experience gained during the earlier years, but can also be unpredictable as it might reflect external factors such as the state of the global economy or the flotation or sale of a business. </p>

In 1998 property K , the family's home in England, was bought for &#163;1.9 million. The property was then refurbished. It is now valued at &#163;3.5 million. Also in 1998, a plot of land was purchased, and a house subsequently built, in Plettenberg Bay, South Africa. This has been the family's holiday home which they have used largely at Christmas and Easter. It is now valued at R21.5 million (approximately &#163;1.5 million). In 2004 a London property, property D, was bought. This was bought for &#163;1.8 million and a very significant additional amount was spent of refurbishing and furnishing the property (in total approximately &#163;1 million). It is now valued at &#163;3.5 million. </p>

Their holidays have been expensive and they have been able to afford other luxuries.

	  <content>
	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">The Husband gave evidence that he intends to leave his present employment at some stage in the course of the next 3 to 6 months. He will join a new venture called S. This is a business set up by former colleagues of the Husband's and will focus on his specialist area, natural resources. He anticipates having to invest up to &#163;1.5 million for an interest of up to 50%. In his written Skeleton, Mr Marks submitted that this is a "risky venture" and that the Husband will take a huge drop in income. Whilst I accept that the Husband's income will drop from its very high current level, I do not agree that this can be described as a risky venture. In his oral evidence the Husband estimated that his income with S would, over time, build up in line with his "normal" Z incentive award. He also gave no indication that he viewed his investment in the company as "risky". Indeed, the company has been trading for over a year and appears to be doing reasonably well. The Husband did not specifically address this in his oral evidence, but in his Affidavit of 28th September 2007 he refers to the bonus pool which the company has achieved in its first year's trading (to be split between 5 people). </p>

However, he also intends to manage his departure from Z so that it is as least disruptive as possible. He remains involved with a number of deals which have not yet completed. Ideally, he would like to be able to have a foot in each camp but he doubts whether this will be possible. An added feature is that he has heart problems. </p>

However, he clearly will not leave prior to the date on which he becomes entitled to receive his bonus for the year 2007. In his final submissions Mr Marks estimated the cash element of this award at &#163;1.66 million gross (approximately &#163;1 million net). This is more than the Husband estimated in his oral evidence but in my view better reflects the likely level of his award. In recent years, this element of the Husband's bonus has been paid gross into an employee benefit trust. </p>

On current values these will produce net, &#163;212,000, &#163;430,000 and &#163;350,000, a combined total of &#163;992,000. The Husband would have to stay at Z for approximately 5 months to receive these sums. I gained the clear impression from the Husband that he was hopeful of receiving a far greater proportion of his deferred shares than just these. However, at the very least, I would expect him to stay at Z until he has become entitled to his 2007 bonus and these deferred shares, giving a combined net total of approximately &#163;2 million (or, if he leaves earlier, that he will negotiate the receipt of these sums).</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">In his opening note Mr Pointer submitted: "Following the breakdown of the marriage and the institution of proceedings H set out to make life difficult for W". A number of matters are then relied upon in support of this contention. The financial matters relied upon were not explored during the hearing. I am not, therefore, in a position to deal with them. The other matters I will deal with further below. However, in any event, this allegation amounts largely to an allegation of conduct and neither party has sought to raise conduct as a substantive issue which should impact on my decision in this case.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">The Wife also relies on the manner in which the Husband (both personally and through Trusts) has been spending money since the separation. The P Trust has recently purchased an apartment in a property in Cape Town. It cost R34 million (approximately &#163;2.4 million). The Husband accepts that this property was purchased by the Trust at his request. He went to view it with the sons of the marriage. Although the Husband says that it has been purchased as an investment, it is also clear from his evidence that he intends to use it as his home in South Africa. This was based on his assumption that the Wife would be retaining the property in Plettenberg Bay. He has arranged for the property to be fully furnished and equipped. The Husband will stay there when he is in South Africa and will have to pay rent to the Trust for the benefit. </p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">During the course of the marriage a number of Trusts were established under the Husband's direction. They were established for the perfectly conventional and legitimate reason of seeking to protect the family's wealth. It is also clear from the oral evidence, and contrary to what is set out in parts of the written evidence (from both parties), that this wealth has been viewed as being available to meet the needs of the Husband and the Wife, including their obligation to meet the needs of the children whilst in education, but has not been viewed as being available to meet the independent needs of the children. I have already given the example of the purchase by the P Trust of an expensive property for the use of the Husband in South Africa. As I have described, it is clearly viewed by him as being effectively his home in South Africa. In addition, the Husband gave evidence that, when a property was very recently purchased in South Africa for the eldest child A, he was surprised that it had been bought through the P Trust. He had expected it to be bought through A's own trust, notwithstanding the fact that A is a beneficiary of the P Trust. This clearly supports the conclusion that the Trusts are viewed as being, at the very least, primarily available to meet the needs of the Husband and Wife, whose needs now that they are separated are inevitably much greater than when they were together.</p>

On the basis that she was the primary beneficiary, this would clearly be within the power of the trustees who would have the power to advance all the capital to her. There are two principal reasons why the Wife seeks such an order. First, it is submitted on her behalf that unless she receives a significant amount of free capital she will have insufficient resources to meet her needs. In this respect, in the supplementary note from Mr Pointer dated 12th November 2007, it is recognised that the Wife could make arrangements for her share of the LPDFs to buy property K (although this would, presumably, have other cost/tax consequences). Secondly, the Wife was concerned at a conversation she had with the two elder children. It was clearly a very regrettable conversation which took place at a time when their relationship with the Wife was, to put it neutrally, not good. The children said that property K was "our home", meaning that they had an interest in it. The middle son has since apologised. The Wife has not seen the elder son for about three years.</p>

In this respect, although, as I have said, the parties by their open positions might appear to be seeking very different outcomes, this is not an accurate reflection of the evidence. In his oral evidence the Husband expressly agreed, in his evidence in chief, that the Wife should have "control" of the PFLIT (and of property K) and should be able to do with it "as she wishes". </p>

The Husband has circled the name of the person at the firm who had sent the fax and written "Deep dive please + family history". Mr Marks accepted, on the Husband's behalf, that this was a misjudgement. In contrast, in the course of his oral evidence the Husband was clearly of the view that it was perfectly natural to undertake an investigation to establish who he was dealing with. This is confirmed by his solicitors' letter of 24th July 2007. He says that it was not an instruction to anyone else and that in fact he conducted no significant investigation. The Husband's explanation might be a reasonable one save for the content of the note. It carries with it the possible interpretation that information was being sought which might then used in some way against the individual concerned. The Husband should realise not only that it was a very bad misjudgement but also that a court will act decisively to protect those involved in the administration of justice from improper interference. </p>

Mr Marks has analysed the difference in the total given in that schedule to the current total.

Further, even if a projected, prospective calculation was carried out to seek to establish the value of the options which are currently "under water", the resultant value would remain speculative.

Although, as I have said, I gained the clear impression that the Husband is optimistic that he will do much better than this, I am not in a position to decide what specific additional amount he will receive in respect of the balance of the value (&#163;1.825 million) of his deferred shares. This does not mean that I ignore the prospect that he might receive some of this latter value. It simply means that I cannot, in fairness, ascribe to it a firm value.</p>

The difference arises from the differing values given to the shares owned by the Trust in Company X. The Husband accepts that this is a company which has very good assets. He regards it as a high risk company which may ultimately be worth nothing or a "phenomenal" amount. Again, he proposes that the value be shared, if and when it is realised. Again, the Wife rejects this proposal, contending that there would be no assurance that the Wife would in fact receive her due proportion. It is submitted that the Husband would be able to manipulate the position. The value advanced on behalf of the Wife is based on the value at which shares were acquired under a rights issue in August 2005. In evidence, the Husband said that this value (&#163;3.25 per share) did not reflect the true market value of the shares. It was simply designed to raise a fixed level of capital for the company. I accept the Husband's evidence on this point. These shares might be worth a great deal in the future but, at present, this is entirely speculative. I propose to include these investments at &#163;630,000.

However, I can and do decide that the Husband is likely to be UK tax resident on the last day of his employment. If 2006 is a relevant date, and according to Mr H it could be in respect of J1385, the contrary cannot be argued. I also consider the Husband likely to be UK tax resident when he ceases his employment with Z in 2008. (If I am wrong about this, both parties will share in the resultant benefit as a result of the proportionate division I include as part of the Wife's award). In addition, Mr H pointed to one clear differential between the parties, namely that, if subject to UK tax, outright distributions to the Husband would bear tax at 53.8% while outright distributions to the Wife would bear tax at 40% (assuming gross rate tax).</p>

However, this is not a liability which has to be repaid in the near future and, accordingly, the Husband has the use of this additional sum which I bear in mind when structuring my order. </p>

There is an issue between the parties as to the extent of this, save that it is agreed that the Wife and the eldest adult child are presently estranged. I have, rightly, not been informed of the circumstances. It is to be hoped that this will not continue and that everyone will do all they can to ameliorate the position. At one point, it appeared that this factor was being viewed as relevant to the Wife's needs. I made it clear during the course of the hearing that my award would not be influenced by the current state of the relationship which either parent has with the children. If a family's resources are limited, the extent to which one parent is bearing an additional financial burden might inevitably have an effect on the outcome of the case. This is not such a case. Further, I consider that each parent is entitled to be in a similar position to assist the children financially (even perhaps on occasion to indulge them). In my judgment it would be wrong for children to see one parent being advantaged or the other disadvantaged solely on the basis of their relationship with that parent. If anything, this would militate against rather than in favour of any significant financial disparity.</p>

At present we are engaged, in my view, in an incremental search for a consistent pattern in the application of the principles identified by the House of Lords. This is unlikely to happen quickly. It needs to be incremental because of the risk that broad statements about the application of these principles can overlook their effect in different factual situations not then before the court. Consequences can also become evident in the long as well as the short term.

These are powerful words of general application. In the search for predictability, I am attracted to this general proposition, which also reflects the fact that a clean break has been recognised as an "object of the modern law" since at least <span style="font-style:italic">Minton v Minton</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1979] AC 593" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1979">[1979] AC 593</ref> and even more so since the 1984 reforms.

This is not so. It is plain from <span style="font-style:italic">Miller</span> that it is not necessary to draw a "clear and precise boundary" between matrimonial and non-matrimonial property. At [26], Lord Nicholls draws attention to the dangers and difficulties inherent if such an approach were to be adopted. Not only can it be an illusory search, but as he says, the greater the emphasis placed by the courts on the need to identify what is and is not marital property, the greater the amount that the parties will be willing, indeed encouraged, to spend on seeking to value assets at the start and at the end of a relationship. </p>

In RP v RP Coleridge J also referred to applications for costly valuations at different times during a relationship in pursuit of an alleged entitlement to a "share" of the "matrimonial property". I have no doubt that these sorts of enquiries were specifically not intended by the House of Lords.</p>

I have referred to Mr Pointer's submission that all the wealth in this case "should be treated as subject to the presumption of equal division". In other cases I have heard the view expressed that, as all property at the date of a hearing is included within the (equal) sharing principle, it is in the interests of the applicant spouse to delay the determination of their application if in the meantime that property is likely to increase significantly. This is based on an expectation or belief that the property which exists at the date of the hearing is more likely than not to be divided equally. This is not in the interests of justice. Further, although an award might be differently constructed, the court's approach should be the same whenever the application happens to be determined.</p>

This is followed in [154], which is dealing specifically with the case of McFarlane, to the passage which the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Charman</span> refers to as being "said to permit argument that a party's earning capacity is itself an asset to which the other has contributed and which might to some extent be subject to the sharing principle". </p>

An issue had been raised in that case (see the Court of Appeal's decision: <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Parlour v Parlour; McFarlane v McFarlane</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] 2 FLR 893" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] 2 FLR 893</ref>) as to whether periodical payments could only be awarded to meet needs. The Court of Appeal decided that there was no such limitation. In that context, it is not surprising to read that, if an equal share of the capital is not sufficient to provide for need and compensate for disadvantage, the principles identified by the House of Lords (including sharing) continue to apply and can continue to apply to "surplus" income. For example, in <span style="font-style:italic">Parlour</span> the husband's future income was shared not on the basis of need nor of compensation.</p>

I referred earlier in this judgment to the Husband's evidence that most of the resources now represented in the Schedule of Assets were received in the recent past and to the fact that different careers have different patterns in the way rewards accrue. In my view, a fair outcome might not be achieved unless the court takes into account the different times and the different forms in which financial resources can accrue during the course of a career. </p>

Indeed, Mr Pointer submits that my primary focus should be on the Wife's needs. In this analysis he does not seek on behalf of his client any Wells sharing in respect of contingent or uncertain assets. When addressing needs, I understand this point. If I were to include them when addressing needs, I would run the risk of making an award that did not enable the Wife to meet her needs (or left the Husband with insufficient to meet his needs). However, to my mind, the Wife seeks, unfairly, the best of both worlds when she includes the (speculative) contingent and uncertain assets when seeking a share of the wealth but then proposes that her share comes only from the certain assets. </p>

I have also referred to the Husband's oral evidence when he expressly stated that the Wife should have "control" of the PFLIT (and of property K) and should be able to do with it "as she wishes". I have also already made plain that I intend the capital in this trust to be available for the Wife as she may require, including by means of capital advancement.

Precision in this case is not possible because of the tax uncertainties surrounding the LPDFs. I have considered the effect of varying proportions of each category of asset. Ultimately I have decided that the Wife should receive &#163;1.8 million (after the payment of her debts) from what I have called the Liquid Funds.

In my view I should, initially at least, test this by reference to the sum net of tax which could be obtained by means of a distribution. The evidence has given me no other mechanism by which to carry out this test. It is also the approach advanced by Mr Marks. If the Wife receives just under 40% of the LPDFs (and the value of the pension fund) this would provide her with a gross fund of &#163;3.2 million. If this was distributed whilst subject to UK tax (after the Husband had retired) it would produce (net of 40% tax) just under &#163;1.9 million. This would provide the Wife with an income fund of &#163;3.3 million. This is just short of the sum of &#163;3.5 million. I consider that this will be made up by the Wife having access to the tax deferred sum of &#163;1.28 million and/or by a more flexible use of her overall resources. The Wife also has the current advantages that result from being non-domiciled.</p>
