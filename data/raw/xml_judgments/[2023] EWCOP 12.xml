It concerns a young person with complex mental health needs that leave her in danger by her own hand as well as at the hands of others. Her presentation can be dramatic and disturbing. The various organs of the state whose duty it is to provide care and safety to JS are seemingly unable to do so. This is due to a combination of the challenges presented by her condition and behaviour, a lack of readily available resources and, as I will explain, a fundamental difficulty in understanding and applying the law. </span></p>

However, it is necessary for me to outline the facts in some detail. I also have to deal with an area of the law that is extremely complicated, in fact unduly so in view of the vulnerable circumstances of the people to whom it applies and the need for it to be used by busy clinicians in their daily work. This is the issue of ineligibility under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> (MCA) and, in particular, Schedule 1A and Case E. Also, and consequently, I have to deal with issues concerning medical treatment under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> (MHA) and the issue of detention under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">that Act</ref> as well as the MCA. </span></p>

Therefore, on 4 January 2023, she was discharged into the care of her mother. I make it clear at the outset, Jane&#8217;s mother is a loving and caring parent. Her inability to keep her daughter safe is despite her love for her daughter, and she is not at fault.</span></p>

There, a Mental Health Act assessment was carried out by the Greater Manchester Assessment and Inreach Centre (GMAIC) which is responsible for conducting gatekeeping assessments for Tier 4 in-patient units. That is the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) highest tier.       This can be in any mental health unit, but it is usual and preferable for people under 18 to be treated in a specialist CAMHS provision, such as Junction 17.</span></p>

This caters for adults of both sexes and all ages, including geriatric patients, with a wide variety of medical conditions. It is not a psychiatric ward.

In the absence of any suitable provision elsewhere, Jane remained on the acute adult general ward for a number of weeks. Her s. 2 detention expired on 5 February 2023. She remained there as an inpatient whilst efforts were made to find an appropriate place and package of care for her discharge. In the absence of a proper placement, it was hoped she could return home to her mother. It was agreed by all the professionals that ward J6 was inappropriate and was detrimental to Jane&#8217;s health.</span></p>

The circumstances are depressingly familiar. Jane was discharged on 27 February 2023 to her home with a package of care and support. On 2 March 2023 she attempted to harm herself. She was detained by the police under s. 136 MHA. The police must be frustrated and concerned about being seen as a form of psychiatric triage in the community. She was admitted to the Emergency Department of the Manchester Royal Infirmary. She was placed on a general medical ward. She was detained yet again under s. 2 MHA. Section 2 of the MHA is intended to provide detention for a period not exceeding 28 days to enable professionals to assess and perhaps treat a mentally disordered patient.

These neurodevelopmental disorders affect her ability to manage emotional, psychological distress, manage daily stress and relationships, changes to the environment, limit her ability to adapt to changes. He rigid thinking prevents her from considering other options. She is not able to see other peoples perspectives. She isn&#8217;t able to understand others emotional responses. She isn&#8217;t able to understand complex information appraise it and adapt her response. These therefore manifest in agitation and self harm. She isn&#8217;t able to identify triggers and cannot remember incidents of severe agitation. She is impulsive. All this makes her behaviour unpredictable. When she is in an agitated state she isn&#8217;t able to think and consider the risks that her actions pose. She is not able to appraise her arousal and control herself and this therefore has required that restrictions are placed to maintain her safety in hospital. There have been minority of occasions when verbal de-escalation has been effective. When highly aroused she has needed physical restraint and medications to reduce agitation and maintain her safety. In the current hospital setting the restrictions have been needed to keep her safe as some of the triggers such as noise cannot be controlled.</span></p>

Applying the statutory test in ss 1, 2 and 3 of the MCA I was satisfied that the presumption of capacity was rebutted. She is unable to understand her mental health problems and she is unable to realise how challenging those conditions are, as well as how dangerous they are for herself. I am satisfied that is caused by her mental health condition, which includes ASD and the ADHD. It means that she is unable to make decisions concerning how she is to be cared for and treated, and in what setting.</span></p>

Dr K and his team were called upon to deal with an extremely difficult case when Jane was admitted to their hospital. She had been a patient in a specialist unit dealing with children and young people with serious psychiatric problems. She had been discharged the day before she took an overdose and was taken to NMGH by the police. Having been called upon to act as Jane&#8217;s place of safety, the clinical and nursing staff had to make do with the skill, resources and environment they had. She was placed on a general, mixed-sex adult ward. She was placed under section. That was because of her challenging behaviour and presentation caused by her mental disorder. </span></p>

Jane could go home in a few days to the best care plan that was going to be made available to her. There was agreement that a transition plan as such was not needed. In fact, she needed to go home as soon as possible. However, it was agreed by all parties that the package had to be in place first. With that I agreed. In the meantime, it seemed to me that the existing care provision in hospital, sub-optimal though it undoubtedly was, was the only option at that time.</span></p>

Restraint, be it physical or chemical must be the last resort not the first. In this case the regime of restraint had been used as a rough and ready patch over the suboptimality of the care provided. I declared it to be in Jane&#8217;s best interests to remain only with very considerable hesitation.</span></p>

The whole mechanics of the MHA through s. 117 is to require the various services concerned with the patient, both inside and outside the Hospital to work together for a speedy and appropriate discharge. It also ensures funding for care afterwards. The Court of Protection has no powers to make MHA orders.</span></p>

It reaches its synthesis in Schedule 1A of the MCA. The structure of the provision is far too complex bearing in mind it affects the life and liberty of vulnerable people like Jane. When reading the legislation in advance of the first hearing I looked at the provisions that are intended to replace Schedule 1A in the new schedule AA1 Part 7 paras 45 to 57 of the new regime (the &#8220;Liberty Protections Safeguards&#8221;). It was the cause of some disappointment that the language of the new provision almost entirely repeats that of the old.</span></p>

In particular, it is vital that NHS consultants, particularly psychiatrists, understand that the MCA and the MHA have to be used where but only where it is appropriate to do so. Furthermore, the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court is a &#8220;great safety net&#8221; that is used to bridge genuine gaps in the legislative framework, not something that should regularly be used as a matter of necessity (let alone convenience) where resources are inadequate to provide protection, or where professionals with a duty to choose the right framework, for whatever reason choose not to.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">I will keep the statutory explanation to a minimum here. The background is that the MHA and the MCA are statutory codes to deal with the care and treatment of vulnerable people. The MHA is for those with mental disorders that necessitate its use, and those provisions apply mainly in Hospital, but also in the community. There are sections of the MHA that enable Hospitals to detain patients for medical treatment (ss 2, 3 and 37 being the principal ones). Others enable patients to be under some control in the community (ss 7 and 8 (guardianship), s17 (leave of absence), s17A-E (community treatment orders) and for restricted patients there are conditional discharges with the power of recall.  </span></p>

It applies, quite literally, to anyone over 16 lacking the capacity to make any decision. It concerns health and welfare, but also property and affairs. It is relevant to those receiving care or treatment outside Hospital, but also to those receiving care and treatment in a hospital for conditions that are not mental health conditions.</span></p>

Where a person lacking mental capacity is subject to the MHA in the community, the MHA cannot authorise his deprivation of liberty or enforce treatment. That is where the powers of the MCA can come in. Equally, where a person is subject to an MHA section in a Hospital there are considerable restrictions on the extent to which the MCA can be used. That is for a very good reason. The MHA is purpose built for such a specialised cohort of people and deals with the particularly difficult decisions that have to be made for them. These are all dealt with by s. 28, and schedule 1A paragraph (2) Cases A to D.</span></p>

This is clearly wrong. The medical treatment she did receive as a detained patient in hospital was necessary to keep her safe and to prevent her from absconding or harming herself. There was no readily available alternative when she was receiving it.</span></p>

This too is plainly wrong. She could only be treated in the community once a suitable package of care was available for her. Until then she could not safely leave hospital. That was the situation with which I was confronted at the first hearing. At that point hospital was the only option. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">This is quite a familiar situation for those who practise mental health law. Patients who have been detained under the MHA (like Jane) can theoretically be discharged into the community with a suitable package of care, but only when that package is actually available. Many weeks or months can be spent putting such packages together (funding, placement, support etc) and in place. During which time patients remain detained. The whole s. 117 process is designed to speed that up so as to ensure detained patients get out and stay out of hospital. Of course, because Jane was never detained under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 3</ref> of the MHA, s. 117 aftercare was not available to her.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">The hospital thought that utilising the MHA to detain Jane would be harmful to her mental health, as would her remaining in Hospital. This is an invalid argument which contains two fallacies. First, she was detained by her care plan which I have summarised above. What jurisdictional label is placed on the care plan is immaterial to its restrictive nature, whether that be MHA, MCA, &#8220;common law&#8221;, the High Court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction is irrelevant to whether she was detained for treatment. That was the care plan&#8217;s doing. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Secondly, keeping her in Hospital for a day longer than was necessary was also nothing to do with the regime she was subject to. Good clinical practice and the operation of Article 5 of the European Convention requires a patient to be detained only for so long as is necessary. The MHA does not prolong detention. In fact, as I have already said, proper use of s. 117 should reduce the overall time a patient spends in Hospital because professionals inside and out of Hospital concerned with health and social care should all work together to put together an effective discharge plan speedily.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">There seems to be a belief, not just in this case but in others which I have heard recently, that the decision to use the MHA should be viewed in isolation from what is available elsewhere at the time the decision to detain or not detain is taken. Ideally, a 17-year-old vulnerable young person would not be detained in a psychiatric facility, let alone a mixed adult general ward. However, where there is literally no option in which that young person will be safe, or as safe as possible in the circumstances, I cannot see how the MHA decision maker can avoid the decision I have had to make in this judgment. If the patient has to be detained for treatment for their mental disorder, and there is no alternative outside the hospital setting, and no other treatment plan available, then it seems clear to me the patient should not be detained under the MCA but rather under the MHA.</span></p>

Certainly, that happens where Local Authorities are unable to find suitable and regulated provision for the care of young people and have to resort to unregulated placements. </span></p>

I am not satisfied the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court should be used to ensure that those powers are used, although the High Court would have other powers available through the prerogative writs and judicial review to do so. Indeed, I am interested to know what would have happened if, during the period of Jane&#8217;s unlawful detention in Hospital, someone had applied for a writ of habeas corpus from the High Court, and what powers that Court may have used.</span></p>

I did not have to do that because of the steps I took. However, I would be reluctant to do so for the following reasons. First, because the inherent jurisdiction should be used only where a vulnerable adult or (in this case) a child is left at risk because of a gap in the statutory framework designed to keep them safe. That is not the case here. The MHA should have been used. It was available. There is no gap for the inherent jurisdiction to patch. Secondly, the MHA is a long-established bespoke code dealing with the difficult regulation of the treatment of detained patients in Hospitals. The use of the inherent jurisdiction or the MCA for that matter would have the perverse result of a Judge having to make decisions over the management of medical treatment when that code exists and is available for use. For the Court to assume that role would (a) place Judges in an impossibly difficult position and (b) act as an incentive for those entrusted with using the MHA, clinicians and Hospitals, not to use it.</span></p>
