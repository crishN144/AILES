 <span style="font-size:10pt">"domestic abuse" includes any incident or pattern of incidents of controlling, coercive or threatening behaviour, violence or abuse between those aged 16 or over who are or have been intimate partners or family members regardless of gender or sexuality. This can encompass, but is not limited to, psychological, physical, sexual, financial, or emotional abuse. Domestic abuse also includes culturally specific forms of abuse including, but not limited to, forced marriage, honour-based violence, dowry-related abuse and transnational marriage abandonment.</span>

 <span style="font-size:10pt">"abandonment" refers to the practice whereby a husband, in England and Wales, deliberately abandons or "strands" his foreign national wife abroad, usually without financial resources, in order to prevent her from asserting matrimonial and/or residence rights in England and Wales. It may involve children who are either abandoned with, or separated from, their mother".</span>

 <span style="font-size:10pt">It is clear from the Practice Direction that the words abandonment and stranding are not terms of art and that they are not intended to be applied in a formulaic manner. This is because there are a number of ways in which a spouse might be said to have been abandoned or stranded abroad or in which the other spouse might have sought to achieve this. I would agree with Mr Gration when he submitted that cases can include many differing elements which militates against their being placed in distinct categories.</span>

As set out above, stranding is a broad concept and can include any action taken by a spouse which puts obstacles in the way of the other spouse being able to return to the UK. In some respects, it matters not whether the attempt is successful or not.

 <span style="font-size:10pt">"'Credibility' involves wider problems than mere 'demeanour' which is mostly concerned with whether the witness appears to be telling the truth as he now believes it to be. Credibility covers the following problems. First, is the witness a truthful or untruthful person? Secondly, is he, though a truthful person, telling something less than the truth on this issue, or, though an untruthful person, telling the truth on this issue? Thirdly, though he is a truthful person telling the truth as he sees it, did he register the intentions of the conversation correctly and, if so, has his memory correctly retained them? Also, has his recollection been subsequently altered by unconscious bias or wishful thinking or by over-much discussion of it with others? Witnesses, especially those who are emotional, who think that they are morally in the right, tend very easily and unconsciously to conjure up a legal right that did not exist. It is a truism, often used in accident cases, that with every day that passes the memory becomes fainter and the imagination becomes more active. For that reason, a witness, however honest, rarely persuades a Judge that his present recollection is preferable to that which was taken down in writing immediately after the accident occurred. Therefore, contemporary documents are always of the utmost importance. And lastly, although the honest witness believes he heard or saw this or that, it is so improbable that it is on balance more likely that he was mistaken? On this point it is essential that the balance of probability is put correctly into the scales in weighing the credibility of a witness. And motive is one aspect of</span>

 <span style="font-size:10pt">"Speaking from my own experience, I have found it essential in cases of fraud, when considering the credibility of witnesses, always to test their veracity by reference to the objective facts proved independently of their testimony, in particular by reference to the documents in the case, and also to pay particular regard to their motives and to the overall probabilities. It is frequently very difficult to tell whether a witness is telling the truth or not; and where there is a conflict of evidence such as there was in the present case, reference to the objective facts and documents, references to the witness' motives and to the overall probabilities can be of very great assistance to a Judge in ascertaining the truth."</span>

I detected no sense that she was trying to tailor her evidence. F through counsel put to her matters which were not contained in the evidence, but appeared for the first time in counsel&#8217;s position statement, about litigation in Pakistan relating to her employment at a bank there. Additionally, documents were produced at the last minute by F, which M had no time to see in advance of her oral evidence. Confusingly, the additional documents were described as exhibits when they were no such thing. This disregard of basic procedural requirements should not have happened, but I gave F leeway and allowed the questioning (after some breaks so that material could be sent to M). M gave cogent and credible answers about all subjects on which she was asked questions. I accept the broad thrust of her evidence.</p>

I formed the clear impression that his primary loyalty is to his wider family ahead of M. He automatically takes their side over M where there is a dispute about cross allegations of abusive conduct, even though he himself was not a witness to the arguments and can only rely on accounts given to him. His attitude to his wife appeared to me at times to be cavalier, unthinking, and dismissive. For example, he seemed unconcerned at the revelation during the trial that he caused M&#8217;s private post to be opened by his brother, by which process he obtained copies of 6 years of bank statements which were not disclosed by him to M (the owner of the documents) until the eve of the trial. His defence of his parents&#8217; institution of guardianship proceedings against M in Pakistan was not very edifying either.</p>

Counsel for M asked him careful questions, which were translated by an interpreter. He had every opportunity to give accurate answers. He repeatedly told me that the application made by him and his wife in Pakistan in respect of the children is solely to be able to see them, but could not explain how and why the court documents plainly show that they have applied for custody, and orders preventing M and the children from leaving Pakistan. I found it implausible that, as he claimed, he had not discussed the Pakistan court application with F in advance of making it, nor that he had been told nothing by F about the proceedings in England; remarkably, he said that he only found out about the wardship proceedings 3 days before his evidence, i.e the day before the case before me started. F, his parents, and his brother are all very close and the children had lived with F&#8217;s parents for years. It defies credulity that they would not have discussed such matters. He was inconsistent and uncertain about how and when he purportedly registered the births of Z and X in Pakistan, giving various dates such as February 2021, corrected to February 2020, then June or July 2020 (all of which conflicted with F&#8217;s evidence that registration took place in November or December 2019). He did not produce evidence of the fact of registration, or the date, which presumably would have been easy to obtain. He was unclear about whether or when M accompanied him for the registration. He could not explain satisfactorily why the Pakistani court application included copies of the passports of the children and M, taken after they had arrived back in Pakistan in November 2019. He appeared to say that he obtained the copies from the municipal council which held them from the time of registration, but could not explain how he acquired a copy of M&#8217;s passport (M being an independent adult). What he said made little sense.</p>

In any event, I do not consider it necessary to resolve this particular area of dispute. Having heard the evidence, my assessment is that over the whole period when M lived with her in-laws, some 5 years, there were increasingly regular contretemps, angry exchanges, and flare- ups between them. It became an unhappy household, which is not altogether surprising. However, it is not directly relevant to the principal question before me, namely whether M was stranded in Pakistan by F. What is significant is that, as was clear from F&#8217;s evidence, he (who had not been in Pakistan when these events occurred and was not a witness to them) largely took the side of his family, believing their version of events and not believing his wife.</p>

In September 2017, M travelled to Spain on her own for 4-5 days to apply for a residency permit on the strength of her spousal visa. An application was also made for residency for Z. In October 2017, M and F travelled together to Spain to submit papers for Z&#8217;s residency application. In December 2017, M and Z travelled to Spain where they received Spanish residency cards, which enabled them to travel on to England as EU residents.

There is no evidence that M was physically forced to travel against her will, but I find that she was very reluctant to do so. She was assured by F that they would be returning, an assurance that proved to be hollow.</p>

All their belongings, according to M, whose evidence I prefer on this, were left in England. F told me that, on the contrary, they brought 350kg of belongings to Pakistan, but he could not produce any evidence of having paid what must have been a hefty luggage surcharge. The plane tickets were return, rather than one way (albeit for a date in February whereas M expected to return in December).

She told me that approximately once per month she and the children would go and spend a week with her own family who live in the same area. But in practice, she had no real options. F, and F&#8217;s family, provided for her and the children; she was financially dependent upon them. Her own father, when she had previously attempted to leave, had encouraged her to return, and clearly opposed her separating herself from her in-laws. F had told her, as I accept, that if she attempted to leave his family permanently, he would remove the children from her care. He also told her that if she left, he would stop sending her money. And without travel documents she was unable to depart from Pakistan. She was, in practice, trapped, even if not forcibly confined. There was an obvious imbalance of power.</p>

I did not believe him. They are bound to have consulted him beforehand about something as significant as this. Nor did I believe him when he told me that he did not see copies of the Pakistani court documents until M obtained them, and produced them in the proceedings before me, and that he did not even ask his parents for copies of the court documents.

The grandparents submitted an amended application dated 10 July 2021. Notably, paragraph 4 of the amended application states at the end in brackets &#8220;<span style="font-weight:bold">Copies of the passports attached&#8221;</span>. That did not appear in the original application and was presumably added in the amended application to meet any jurisdiction issues, for the aim was to demonstrate that both children were Pakistani nationals. The copies attached to the application were of the Pakistani passports of both children and M, all bearing an entry stamp to Pakistan dated 21 November 2019. To which the obvious question was; how did the grandparents obtain copies of the passports, which must have been taken after 21 November 2019 when, according to F, they were in the possession of M at all times and there is no suggestion by him that either he, or his parents, or any other family members, had custody of them at any time? F said he thought (but it was clearly a guess) it was because the birth of X had been registered at the municipal office by his father shortly after arrival in Pakistan. He surmised, and it was never more than a surmise, that X&#8217;s passport may have been copied for the purpose of registration, lay on municipal files, and was later extracted by F&#8217;s parents for the purpose of the guardianship application. Quite apart from the fact that this was pure guesswork on his behalf, none of this was in his written evidence and it did not explain how Z&#8217;s passport, and M&#8217;s passport, came to be copied as well as X&#8217;s. Nor could F explain how his parents could obtain copies of the children&#8217;s passports from the municipal office, given that they are not these children&#8217;s parents, let alone a copy of M&#8217;s passport.</p>

I am quite satisfied that this application is brought because of M&#8217;s assertion that she was stranded in Pakistan in November 2019. It is completely understandable that M would, at the same time, seek to ensure that she can re-enter the United Kingdom; there is no inconsistency between that, and her primary case. After all, had she not been stranded in Pakistan, she would (i) still be living in England, having returned there at the end of 2019, and (ii) be in possession of a passport with no time limit on her entitlement to stay. Instead, her passport has been removed by F, and she has thereby lost the entry clearance previously secured by her. True, if M had somehow been able to secure the ability to re-enter the UK with the children, she might well not have instituted wardship proceedings; but that is not what has happened.</p>

It is, in my judgment, clear that (a) the parties intended for M and Z to move to England permanently to set up home with F and their then unborn baby in June 2019, (b) F&#8217;s attitude changed as the marriage deteriorated and perhaps also because of his disappointment at the birth of a daughter rather than a son, (c) F at all times retained the whole family&#8217;s travel documents, (d) F decided that M and the children should not return to England, but should instead remain with his family in Pakistan, (e) F falsely assured M that she and the children would return to England at the end of November 2019, (f) F did not hand the travel documents over to M, (g) M was essentially trapped because she could not move permanently to her family, nor could she leave Pakistan.</p>

F&#8217;s misrepresentation of the application (describing it as simply for contact) is telling. So, too, is the characterisation in the application of M as an unfit mother which reflects F&#8217;s family&#8217;s view of her. I am quite satisfied that this is part of an ongoing plan on the part of F to ensure that the children remain in Pakistan. The timing of the application is significant, made shortly after M&#8217;s wardship application in this country which, inter alia, sought a return order.</p>

 <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt">In re B</span>
 <span style="font-size:10pt">, whilst the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction when the child is habitually resident outside the United Kingdom is not confined to the "dire and exceptional" or the "very extreme end of the spectrum", there must be circumstances which are sufficiently compelling to </span>
 <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt">require </span>
 <span style="font-size:10pt">or make it </span>
 <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt">necessary </span>
 <span style="font-size:10pt">that the court should exercise its protective jurisdiction.

 <span style="font-size:10pt">In my view the need for such a substantive threshold is also supported by the consequences if there was a lower threshold and the jurisdiction could be exercised more broadly; say, for example, whenever the court considered that this would be in a child's interests. It would, again, be difficult to see how this would be consistent with the need to "approach the use of the jurisdiction with great caution or circumspection", at [59]. It is not just a matter of procedural caution; the need to use great caution must have some substantive content. In this context, I have already explained why I consider that the three reasons set out in </span>
 <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt">In re B </span>
 <span style="font-size:10pt">would not provide a substantive test and, in practice, would not result in great circumspection being exercised.</span>

 <span style="font-size:10pt">The final factor, which in my view supports the existence of a substantive threshold, is that the 1986 Act prohibits the inherent jurisdiction being used to give care of a child to any person or provide for contact. It is also relevant that it limits the circumstances in which the court can make a s.8 order. Given the wide range of orders covered by these provisions, a low threshold to the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction would increase the prospect of the court making orders which would, in effect, "cut across the statutory scheme" as suggested by Lord Sumption in </span>
 <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt">In re B</span>
 <span style="font-size:10pt">, at [85]. This can, of course, apply whenever the jurisdiction is exercised but, in my view, it provides an additional reason for limiting the exercise of the jurisdiction to compelling circumstances. As Henderson LJ observed during the hearing, the statutory limitations support the conclusion that the inherent jurisdiction, while not being wholly excluded, has been confined to a supporting, residual role.</span>

 <span style="font-size:10pt">In summary, therefore, the court demonstrates that it has been circumspect (to repeat, as a substantive and not merely a procedural question) by exercising the jurisdiction only when the circumstances are sufficiently compelling. Otherwise, and I am now further repeating myself, I do not see, in practice, how the need for great circumspection would operate.&#8221;</span>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.57in;margin-right:0.18in">In my judgment, if the children were not (contrary to my findings above) habitually resident in England and Wales at the relevant time, and had in fact become habitually resident in Pakistan, that is as a direct result of being trapped in Pakistan by reason of F&#8217;s controlling conduct. Neither they nor M were free to leave Pakistan and return to England. If they lost English and Welsh habitual residence because of their powerlessness in the face of abandonment by F who had removed their passports and means of travel, it would, in my view, be unjust to deny them the parens patriae jurisdictional basis of exercising the court&#8217;s powers. This is exactly the sort of case where that power, to be exercised only when the facts are sufficiently compelling to warrant it, would be legitimately invoked for the protection of British subjects.</p>
