In referring to them as the wife and the husband I recognise that they are long since divorced, and I apologise to them if it seems odd, but it is convenient nomenclature for the court to utilise.</p>

He has been unemployed since that time. In due course he ceased meeting his periodical payments obligations under the order. He says he has since sought other employment; but has not been successful. It has not been suggested before me that this was other than a genuine unemployment situation. This position has been accepted by the CMS, who have assessed him as a nil earner for their purposes. </p>

Plainly the reductions left her in a difficult financial situation, though (as it happens) a really bad outcome for her has been avoided because her new partner has broadly supported her living costs and somebody (she declined to identify the person when I asked the question) has helped with school fees so that the unpleasant consequence of the children having to be withdrawn from YY School has not happened, until now at least, and A has been successful in achieving a place at XX University.</p>

An email sent to me by Mr Burrows on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2023 (yesterday), and copied to Ms Bangay, suggested that he plans other attacks on the March 2021 events &#8211; now threatening Judicial Review proceedings against the Ministry of Justice seeking, amongst other things, a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">mandatory order requiring this court to comply with United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989 Art 12</span>&#8221; &#8211; for me, a further demonstration of Mr Burrows&#8217; troublingly high degree of ill judgment about this case. Further, as I was preparing to send out my judgment by email this afternoon I received a further email from Mr Burrows, now annexing a Judicial Review Pre-Action Protocol letter raising a whole array of extraordinary requests, asking me to vacate the hearing fixed for 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> March 2023 and indicating that he would be applying for an order in the Administrative Court to remove the case from my list on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> March 2023 if I did not agree. I regard these suggestions and applications as bizarre, certainly unprecedented in my legal and judicial experience.

The document is long on the unnecessarily lengthy citation of passages from authorities, but the essence of the complaint appears to be that the March 2021 order should be set aside because it was made by DJ Cronshaw without a proper knowledge of the underlying facts, in particular that it was made in the absence of a Form D81 and therefore in breach of FPR 2010 Rule 9.26.

Further, she in essence accepted that there was no material non-disclosure involved and that the husband had given full disclosure to the wife&#8217;s lawyers prior to both the 2021 and 2022 orders. In essence the &#8216;material non-disclosure&#8217; point, as eventually formulated, is no more than the headline allegation that DJ Cronshaw was not presented with a Form D81. The witness statement explains &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">So far as this is not clear I am sure Mr Burrows would apologise</span>&#8221;. Whether or not this amounts to an apology or not is not entirely clear, but the existence or not of an apology has no legal status anyway so I do not propose to become distracted by this issue.

There is an ongoing dispute about whether the disclosure given amounts to a full compliance with the DJ Ashworth order; but, since the purpose of this forced disclosure is largely to illustrate that the wife&#8217;s legal advice at the time was to accept the 2021 and 2022 orders, it may be that there is little purpose in prolonging this dispute.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">As a starting point I agree that there is merit in this bald proposition. The consent order process (whether in a traditional court setting or on the Digital Consent Order System) requires that the parties must file a Form D81. This requirement can only be dispensed with if one or both of the parties attend the court hearing. It may or may not be the case that DJ Cronshaw, before approving the order, looked at the court file and perused the Forms E which had been filed; but (even if he did) the rule strictly required him to look at a Form D81 because there was no attendance at court by either party that day. Any judge dealing with financial remedies law is likely to be familiar with this rule and, in general terms, it is an important rule because it allows the court to scrutinise the appropriateness and fairness of a proposed consent order. Once the judge has seen a Form D81, he has a discretion as to how to proceed &#8211; in the words of Munby J (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">L v L</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 1 FLR 26" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 1 FLR 26</ref>, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">If epigrammatic phrases are preferred, the judge is not a rubber stamp. He is entitled but is not obliged to play the detective. He is a watchdog, but he is not a bloodhound or a ferret</span>&#8221;.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The approval of this bald proposition does not, however, go anywhere near answering the questions that are for me to resolve. In this case it is clearly established that both parties were aware of their obligation to produce and proffer up to the court a Form D81 and were in the process of doing so when the judge approved the order, after which (by agreement) they abandoned its preparation. Further, it is plain and obvious that had a Form D81 been produced then the judge&#8217;s decision to approve the consent order would almost certainly have been exactly the same &#8211; since (<span style="font-style:italic">ex hypothesi</span>) it was common ground that the husband was unemployed with no income this was the obvious order to make. Further, none of the many distinguished lawyers on either side of the case took the view that the March 2021 Order was impeachable or in any way wrong or unfair until Mr Burrows arrived on the scene. In particular, when the case received further scrutiny in 2022 it did not occur to any of the lawyers involved that there was anything impeachable or in any way wrong or unfair with the March 2021 order. Further, the March 2021 order had been in place for more than 18 months before Mr Burrows&#8217; first application about it and the only reason the issue has been raised is because Mr Burrows has steered the wife in that direction &#8211; nothing other than that has changed or emerged to throw a different light on what happened in March 2021. Further, if and when the husband&#8217;s financial situation improves by his receipt of a substantive income or capital payment the wife has the ability to make an application to vary upwards the currently nominal spousal periodical payments order and if it is fair for her to receive a substantive periodical payments order and/or a capitalised order then the court has the powers under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref> to grant it. Unless and until that happens the setting aside of the March 2021 order would be very likely to lead (after the completion of a Form D81) to the re-confirmation of the terms of the 2021 order. For these reasons it strikes me very clearly that Mr Burrows&#8217; headline complaint, whatever its technical merit, has been an expensive and pointless legal exercise. For me it is baffling as to why he should be steering the wife into doing what she is doing.</p>

I asked Mr Burrows whether he had ever come a case where such a step had been taken and he was unable to identify such a case (which accorded with my own experience). I regard the suggestions that, in some way, the argument is assisted by an application of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989, Article 12 or that there should be the intervention of a Judicial Review against the Ministry of Justice as also being in the same category &#8211; it is an application (if it be pursued) which is very surprising to see and I can identify no merit whatever in it.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">As described above, he started by suggesting that this was a &#8216;set aside&#8217; case. In my view, whatever it was, it never was a set aside case. The wording of FPR 2010 Rule 9.9A makes it clear that this procedural route is only open where &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">no error of the court is alleged&#8217;</span>. Mr Burrows complaint, when properly analysed and cleared of obfuscation, is that the court (i.e. DJ Cronshaw) made an error. It is not, therefore, within Rule 9.9A. In so far as the complaint once appeared to involve allegations of material non-disclosure, the later clarifications have made it clear that this is not being pursued and/or could not credibly be pursued. Further, it is clear that &#8216;bad legal advice&#8217; is not a valid category upon which to base a setting aside application: see <span style="font-style:italic">Harris v Manahan</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] 1 FLR 205" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] 1 FLR 205</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">L v L</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 1 FLR 26" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 1 FLR 26</ref>. Accordingly, I am satisfied that I have enough information and argument to dismiss the wife&#8217;s application to set aside the March 2021 order and I propose to do exactly that. Pursuant to FPR 2010 Rule 4.3(7) I propose to record on my order that this application was totally without merit.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">When Mr Burrows changed horses and pursued the matter by way of appeal then he immediately ran into the problem that the time period of 21 days for pursuing the appeal had long since expired: see FPR 2010 Rule 30.4(2). Such an appeal should have been issued by 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2021 and was in fact only issued on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2022. Although there is not formally an application for permission to appeal out of time, in view of the order of HHJ Evans-Gordon I am minded to treat the case as if there was. Accordingly, I need to consider the relevant law. For these purposes I consider it sufficient to cite a passage from the <span style="font-style:italic">Dictionary of Financial Remedies </span>(2023 edition):</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The arguments are really the same as the ones I have set out above in the context of the setting aside application, save that it can be added that there was a technical imperfection in the consent order approval process amounting to a court error, i.e. no Form D81 was seen by the judge approving the order. In this context I invited Mr Burrows to address me on the issue of whether this technical imperfection would automatically give rise to an appellate overturning of the order, whatever the circumstances. What, for example, would happen if the absence of Rule 9.26 compliance was discovered many years after a detailed consent order had been fully implemented and the monies distributed and spent? Mr Burrows conceded that there would be no automatic appellate overturning of the order in these circumstances and I think he was right so to concede &#8211; the appellate overturning of the order in those circumstances would have to be considered in the light of the reasons for, context of and consequences of the technical imperfection and the overall fairness to the parties. In this case, as I have said, there was no reluctance on behalf of the parties to produce the Form D81 and, had it been produced, the outcome would almost certainly have been exactly the same. It was common ground that the husband was unemployed with no income and this was the obvious order to make. In so far as I was minded to grant leave to make the application out of time I would not be minded to grant permission to appeal on the merits.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In this context (or possibly more generally) I feel it may be helpful for the court to hear the views of the parties on one issue which may yet arise in the future &#8211; the status of the expected payment of &#163;475,112 by the SS Company to the husband on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2024 in the context of paragraph E(vii)(a) of the 2019 Order. My perception from the arguments I have heard is that (whilst this issue has perhaps not yet been tackled head on) the view of the husband&#8217;s legal team is that, because this payment will be made after 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2024 the wife is not entitled to any part of it under paragraph E(vii)(a); but the view of the wife&#8217;s legal team (and I include in this the pre-David Burrows legal team: see Mr Calhaem&#8217;s comments in his attendance note &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">we will need a judge to make a determination on that point</span>&#8221;) is that she is entitled to 25% of the net proceeds from this. It may be that an examination of this issue might take us back to those who drafted this clause in 2019. Does the date in the clause relate to the date of the husband&#8217;s leaving the SS Company (which was, of course, before the cut off date) or the date of realising his interests (which is after the cut off date)? It may be helpful to have an airing of views on this subject on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> March 2023. It is unlikely to be appropriate for me to resolve the issue, but it may be sensible to consider a mechanism for resolving it, if indeed it is in dispute.</p>
