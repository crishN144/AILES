There was not a hint that he might take legal steps to get the children back. Rather, he was focusing on seeking a reconciliation, or if that were not possible, participation by him in family life with his children. His conduct at that time was largely ruled by emotion, at the centre of which was his despair at the loss of his family life. In his oral evidence he explained to me that his policy in his communications with the mother was one of appeasement.  </p>

One which has been used is &#8220;anticipatory retention&#8221;. This is certainly convenient but it may lead to misconceptions. If early wrongful retention is a legal possibility, it is not because there is an anticipation of retention. On the contrary, the child is retained in the destination State from the moment of arrival, just as he is removed from the home State at the moment of departure. If the departure and arrival are permitted by agreement with the left-behind parent, or sanctioned by the court of the home State, they are still respectively removal and retention, but they are not wrongful.

However, he argues through his counsel Ms Chokowry that this is completely irrelevant. It was a clear common understanding that the trip to England was always going to be fixed or limited. That the original return date was frustrated by the pandemic is neither here nor there; the trip retained its temporary characteristic. Had the pandemic not erupted the mother would not have returned on 23 April 2020, and the case would have been an open and shut one of actual retention on that date. The mother cannot opportunistically seek to jump on the bandwagon of the pandemic and try to convert what was at all times, and for all purposes, a limited trip into an unlimited one.  </p>

It seems to me that a wrongful act of retention, whether anticipatory/repudiatory (i.e. happening before the due date for return), or actual (i.e. happening after the due date of return), requires there to be, as a matter of fact, a clearly agreed due date of return. I believe that every reported case about retention has involved a finite period away with a due date of return. In my opinion it is implicit in the concept of wrongful retention, as referred to in Articles 1, 3, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16, that the wrongful act must take place within, or immediately following, an agreed finite period of care by the retaining parent. </p>

Three months later she writes to the father saying that she would not return at all. Could this be a retention for the purposes of the Convention? Surely not.  </p>

For the permission to be meaningful, it must be made known. This natural reading is reinforced by the fact that consent appears in the Convention as a verb ("avait consenti/had consented"): what is required is an act or actions and not just an internal state of mind. But it is at the practical level that the need for communication is most obvious. Parties make important decisions based on the understanding that they have a consent to relocate on which they can safely rely. It would make a mockery of the Convention if the permission on which the removing parent had depended could be subsequently invalidated by an undisclosed change of heart on the part of the other parent, particularly as the result for the children would then be a mandatory return. Such an arbitrary consequence would be flatly contrary to the Convention's purpose of protecting children from the harmful effects of wrongful removal, and it would also be manifestly unfair to the removing parent and the children. &#8221; </p>

In contrast, according to the OED &#8220;to acquiesce&#8221; means &#8220;to agree, esp. tacitly; to accept something, typically with some reluctance; to agree to do what someone else wants; to comply with, concede&#8221;. The word carries with it a much greater sense of passivity; of acceptance of a state of affairs by doing nothing; of tacit compliance. In ordinary language it obviously covers active consent <span style="font-style:italic">ex post</span>; but it also covers passive acceptance by just &#8220;going along with&#8221; the proposal. This dual meaning is to be found in the leading authority on the defence of acquiescence namely the decision of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">In re H (Minors) (Abduction: Acquiescence)</span>[1998] AC 72.

This is not to reintroduce the distinction between active and passive acquiescence disapproved in <span style="font-style:italic">In re H</span>. That distinction had given rise to different legal treatments of the left-behind parent&#8217;s subjective intentions. That distinction was overturned.

The first, which Lord Browne-Wilkinson described as &#8220;the ordinary case&#8221;, is where the left-behind parent has subjectively consented to, or has gone along with, the continued presence of the children in the place to which they had been taken. Lord Browne-Wilkinson  explained that this state of subjective intention is a pure question of fact. In determining that question the court will pay more attention to outward conduct than to self-serving evidence of undisclosed intentions. As part of the normal process of fact-finding the court may infer the actual subjective intention from the outward and visible acts of the left-behind parent, but will not impute to the left-behind parent an intention which he did not in fact possess. Judges should be slow to infer an intention to acquiesce from attempts by the left-behind parent to effect a reconciliation or to reach an agreed voluntary return of the abducted child. Nonetheless, it is for the judge, in all the circumstances of the case, to attach such weight as he thinks fit to such factors in reaching his finding as to the state of mind of the left-behind parent   </p>

Australia is a Hague 1996 Convention country. Certainly until May 2020 the children remained habitually resident in Australia. Absent acquiescence, under Article 7 of the 1996 Convention jurisdiction would have been maintained in Australia even after the children acquired habitual residence in England. Therefore, there was every reason for him to have commenced proceedings in Australia as it would have established exclusive jurisdiction in that country. The father was not able to give me an explanation as to why he did not take this obvious step. After all, he knew from 9 July 2020 that the mother was not going to be returning voluntarily to Australia. There was plainly going to be a child arrangements case somewhere and it is hard to understand why the father did not establish the Australian court as the court of exclusive jurisdiction. I have noted in para 20 above that on 17 September 2020 the father&#8217;s Australian lawyers contacted the English solicitor who acts for him in these proceedings. This fact makes the father&#8217;s failure to establish Australian jurisdiction all the more perplexing.  </p>

This provides that I am not bound to order the return of the child if, among other things, acquiescence is proved. In many fields of law there are so-called discretionary powers granted to the court which are more theoretical than real and where their exercise is almost invariably driven by proof of the threshold facts that trigger the discretion. Consider, for example, the power of the court to award a discretionary stay of proceedings in a <span style="font-style:italic">forum conveniens</span> dispute pursuant to s.5(6) of, and Schedule 1 paragraph  9 to, the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/45" uk:canonical="1973 c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Domicile and Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1973</ref>.

It is extremely hard to conceive of any circumstances where consent or acquiescence is proved but a return of the child should be ordered nonetheless. The essence of such conduct is that the left-behind parent has condoned the wrongful behaviour of the other parent and has in effect waived his rights for implementation of the policy objectives of the Convention as set out in the preamble and Article 1. But, in <span style="font-style:italic">In re M (Children) (Abduction: Rights of Custody</span>)<span style="font-style:italic"/><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] AC 1288" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] AC 1288</ref>, HL at [45] Baroness Hale (after citing the above passage from <span style="font-style:italic">In re D, </span>and observing that it was not the policy of the Convention that children should be put at serious risk of harm or placed in intolerable situations) stated: </p>

It suggests that even if a parent has positively agreed, before or after the event, with a removal to or retention in this country, but has later repented of that decision, there may nonetheless be general, particular or individual considerations militating in favour of the child being returned to her home country.  </p>

		<p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0in">"The final thing which I have to weigh in the balance is the purpose of the Convention. This is something to which the courts attach the greatest possible importance. We all want children to be returned as soon as possible to the place from which they have been wrongfully removed. The reasons why the Convention exists to secure this are partly that it is bad for children to be uprooted from one jurisdiction to another and partly to fulfil the obvious proposition that if there is a dispute between parents as to the future of their child it is better dealt with in the courts of the country where the child has hitherto been habitually resident because that is where the best information lies. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0in">However, I have to bear in mind in particular that that factor has a different weight in a case in which consent to the removal or retention has been established. Indeed, in cases of consent, all of those factors carry a rather different weight. But if it has been agreed between parents that a mother may bring her child to another country and, if she so chooses, remain here with the child, then frustrating those two purposes of the Convention scarcely comes into question." </p>

They were made when drawing a contrast with cases of grave harm, where policy considerations in favour of return may be weak and welfare considerations against return are likely to be particularly strong. They do no more than say that the relevant considerations "might" point to a speedy return so that future decisions can be made in "the home country". However, they carry a different emphasis to the earlier analysis in <span style="font-style:italic">Re K</span>, which was not cited in <span style="font-style:italic">Re M</span> and where the decision actually turned on the exercise of discretion. </p>

		      <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.5in">To sum up, the exercise of the discretion under the Convention is acutely case-specific within a framework of policy and welfare considerations. In reaching a decision, the court will consider the weight to be attached to all relevant factors, including: the desirability of a swift restorative return of abducted children; the benefits of decisions about children being made in their home country; comity between member states; deterrence of abduction generally; the reasons why the court has a discretion in the individual case; and considerations relating to the child's welfare. </p>

I do not contribute much weight to the benefit of decisionmaking in Australia rather than Liverpool. A summary return in the context of Covid19 will be difficult to manage and will involve considerable expense as there will have to be quarantine on arrival in Australia in Sydney or Melbourne (there are no direct flights to Adelaide) at a cost of about &#163;1750 a week and possibly further internal quarantine on travel from Sydney or Melbourne to Adelaide. The children have now spent nearly a year here &#8211; more than half of O&#8217;s life. A summary return will cause them considerable upheaval. On the facts of this case I do not attribute much weight to the Convention objectives.  </p>

For the reasons I have set out above, my primary conclusion is that there was no operative retention by the mother until 1 August 2020 by which time the children were habitually resident in England. Accordingly, the father cannot invoke the Convention and his application must be dismissed. My secondary conclusion is that even if there were an operative retention by the mother in early May 2020 the father subsequently acquiesced in that retention and that in all the circumstances the court should not exercise its power to order a return of the children under the Convention to Australia. On this footing also the father&#8217;s application should be dismissed. </p>

There is no reason why they should not now agree child arrangements which could be recorded by me in an order to be made in the Liverpool proceedings. The child arrangements would no doubt record that the children live with and spend time with both of their parents, albeit unequally. The Liverpool application had sought a specific issue order. I fail to understand what specific issue the court was being asked to resolve; that aspect of the application strikes me as spurious and should be withdrawn. </p>
