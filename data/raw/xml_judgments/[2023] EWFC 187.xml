That was confirmed in a letter from the valuer to the parties on 10 May 2023. It was not to be what I term a &#8220;hindsight approach&#8221; whereby the valuer would assess the value at November 2019 in the light of actual figures thereafter, rather than forward looking predictions.

She has instructed her own expert from Longworth Forensic Accounting. In support of the application is a report dated 9 October 2023 which ascribes a value to the parties&#8217; business interests in November 2019, applying the &#8220;hindsight approach&#8221;, of about &#163;20.5m gross (compared to &#163;35m on sale).  It can therefore be seen that, comparing like for like on a &#8220;hindsight approach&#8221; basis, the difference between the experts is about &#163;1.6m (&#163;18.9m v &#163;20.5m), which is a small percentage of the total assets in the case. </p>

In that case, the issue was the value in 2016, when the parties had started living together. As identified at para 13 of the judgment, the husband took strong exception to the report of the SJE and was given permission to adduce his own accountancy evidence. The judge, for reasons of procedural fairness, then permitted the wife to adduce her own expert evidence. The consequence was that three experts produced reports and gave evidence at trial. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A feature of <span style="font-weight:bold">E v L </span>was that two of the experts, including the SJE, stood in the shoes of a fictitious purchaser in 2016, and adopted future earnings predictions for their valuations rather than the actual figures which were by the time of trial known and matters of record; the &#8220;present day approach&#8221;. That approach in 2016 disregarded what in fact transpired thereafter and with no application of hindsight. It led to an unreal calculation, for subsequent events demonstrated that the predictions were wrong. Mostyn J concluded that when undertaking an exercise such as this in the context of financial remedy proceedings, a realistic valuation exercise must be based on actual figures (the &#8220;hindsight approach&#8221;) rather than the &#8220;present day approach&#8221; which adopts predicted figures and ignores subsequent events. His full analysis on this point is set out at paras 51 to 66, culminating in this conclusion at para 66:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is W&#8217;s case that the SJE report is deficient in several respects. She asserts that the SJE adopted the &#8220;present day approach&#8221; rather than the &#8220;hindsight approach&#8221;. The SJE did not input actual figures post 2019 in his main report. He made forward looking predictions. There were, so it seems, no, or very limited, forecasts and business plans available at that time. Thus, the SJE arrived at his own projections and assumptions about future growth based on previous year figures.  By contrast, Longworth Forensic Accounting have applied the figures as they turned out to be after 2019; the &#8220;hindsight approach&#8221;. Accordingly, says W, the SJE has fallen into the sort of error identified by Mostyn J in <span style="font-weight:bold">E v L</span>, and produced a report which is artificial and unrealistic in the context of family court proceedings. The consequence, on W&#8217;s case, is that the SJE&#8217;s valuation was understated, because his projections undershot the actual figures in the next 2 to 3 years. This, it seems to me, is the heart of the challenge to the SJE report.</p>

The reasons for this are many. In the first place there is likely to be no obvious market for a private company. Second, even where valuers use the same method of valuation they are likely to produce widely differing results. Third, the profitability of private companies may be volatile, such that a snap shot valuation at a particular date may give an unfair picture. Fourth, the difference in quality between a value attributed to a private company on the basis of opinion evidence and a sum in hard cash is obvious. Fifth, the acid test of any valuation is exposure to the real market, which is simply not possible in the case of a private company where no one suggests that it should be sold.

Why, a party might ask, should my "share" be fixed by reference other than to the real values of the assets? However, this is to misinterpret the exercise in which the court is engaged. The court is engaged in a broad analysis in the application of its jurisdiction under the Matrimonial Causes Act, not a detailed accounting exercise. As Lord Nicholls said, detailed accounting is expensive, often of doubtful utility and, certainly in respect of business valuations, will often result in divergent opinions each of which may be based on sound reasoning. The purpose of valuations, when required, is to assist the court in testing the fairness of the proposed outcome. It is not to ensure mathematical/accounting accuracy, which is invariably no more than a chimera. Further, to seek to construct the whole edifice of an award on a business valuation which is no more than a broad, or even very broad, guide is to risk creating an edifice which is unsound and hence likely to be unfair. In my experience, valuations of shares in private companies are among the most fragile valuations which can be obtained.&#8221;</span></p>

Calculations by reference to approved indices might be of some utility. But beyond these tools, the court&#8217;s approach might involve a more nuanced assessment reached after consideration of increase in turnover, number of employees, the genesis of inspirational business ideas, the actual work undertaken by the party, how such work drove the business and the like.  Every case, every set of circumstances, is different, and as was explained in <span style="font-weight:bold">H v H [supra] </span>the court is conducting a s25 exercise, within which valuations may assist the court, but are not the be all and end all. Ultimately, the court will need to weigh up a multiplicity of factors with the degree of generality or specificity it thinks fit. </p>

H has very little time between now and the trial to mount a challenge to W&#8217;s proposed expert report. He will not be able, realistically, to obtain, and seek permission for, his own expert. True, he might seek to rely on the SJE, but it seems to me to be unprincipled that he should be somewhat forced into that corner because the alternative is an unwelcome adjournment. And of course, the SJE is not his own expert, with whom he has been able to sit down and discuss the case in preparation for trial. The SJE might find himself in an uncomfortable position. By contrast, W and her chosen expert are fully aligned.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The historic valuation issue is just one factor among many for the court to consider. It may be relevant to, but is assuredly not determinative of, the issue of post separation accrual. W&#8217;s case is that even if the value of the business has increased, it would be unfair for her not to receive a full 50%. She advances a number of reasons in her s25 statement which the judge at trial may, or may not, find persuasive. Her own post separation contribution may be relevant. So too will be the length of time since separation, the reasons for the delay to trial, and an evaluation of precisely what personal contributions H made which purportedly enhanced the value. W will argue that a contributory factor in the business&#8217;s success was a roll out of various products from 2018 onwards, and expansion abroad. The impact of Covid may have enhanced the business profitability, as was commonplace in the tech sector generally. The court will be asked to consider whether any increase in value was the product of passive growth (driven by market forces and natural progression of the company) or active growth (driven by H&#8217;s personal efforts), or even that the eventual sale price was achievable because the private equity group was a special purchaser. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The difference in figures between the SJE and the proposed new expert is, in my judgment, relatively small (&#163;1.5m on the &#8220;hindsight approach&#8221;) and unlikely to make a material impact on the proceedings. That is particularly so given that the parties appear to agree there was a significant increase in value (they disagree about the reasons why), and H does not make a proposal based on a purely mathematical approach referable to the SJE report. As I have observed, his suggested division provides W with a greater sum than would be applicable even on W&#8217;s own proposed expert&#8217;s figures, if the court were to adopt a strict exclusion of all post separation growth. But H does not pursue that strictly mathematical approach, and I therefore see little purpose in more evidence on a somewhat theoretical point.  Of course, whether there is merit in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">any</span> departure from equality in his favour remains to be seen; there may be none. But as his case is presented, detailed accountancy evidence about sets of figures which both show an increase in value, but dispute the precise extent, is unnecessary.</p>
