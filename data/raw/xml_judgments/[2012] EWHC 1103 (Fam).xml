By July 2006 the parties had reconciled and resumed cohabitation at their home in Essex.

W's case is that H abusively told her to get out of the house in December 2010. H's case is that W finally told him that she did not wish to remain married to him in late 2010 or early 2011. Even though they were not physically under the same roof after August 2010, it seems to me that their post decree nisi cohabitation and reconciliation is to be regarded as having continued uninterruptedly for something over 4 years. </p>

	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin-left:0.25in">In the light of H's denials I am simply not in a position to proceed on the basis that H continued to commit adultery throughout the period after the reconciliation. I note that W is wholly unspecific as to how and when she discovered this alleged adultery, or her claim that "from Spring 2010 it became obvious that (H) was again conducting affairs with several women, that these affairs had been ongoing throughout the attempted reconciliation, and that these affairs are continuing". I note also that W makes the assertion of the continuing affairs in order to explain and justify her application to make the decree absolute in spite of the delay. In his statement H describes a full reconciliation rather than an attempted reconciliation. It may be that his assertion that he was faithful to W throughout the period of reconciliation is to be read as containing an implied admission that he has not been faithful to her thereafter. But if so this does not go the issue of the explanation for the delay. In any event, for the reasons set out below, I do not think that any of this truly affects the exercise which I have to conduct. </p>

Under the FPR 1991 R 2.49 the procedure for making a decree absolute was the lodging of a notice in Form M 8, whereupon the district judge "shall cause" the records to be searched for the purpose of establishing that there is no outstanding application or question affecting the decree nisi or preventing the granting of the decree absolute: for instance challenge to the order by way of rescission or appeal, intervention by the Queen's Proctor or other third party, application for consideration of the Respondent's financial position in divorce proceedings based on section 1 (2) (d) and (e) where the court may delay the decree absolute, or unresolved issues with regard to gender recognition. If satisfied that no such challenge is in existence the District Judge shall make the decree absolute. However this is subject to the proviso that if the notice is lodged more than 12 months after the grant of decree nisi there shall be lodged with the M8 notice an explanation in writing, which the District Judge may require to be verified by affidavit </p>

		<p class="ind" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in">"There seem to me to be two reasons for saying that in the circumstances of this case there should not be a decree absolute. One is that at the date of the application for decree absolute the petitioner is still relying on <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1 (2)</ref> (a) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> and before the date of the application for a decree absolute the parties have lived together for a period exceeding six months. The other reason is that at the date of the application for a decree for a decree absolute, it is impossible to say that there has been irretrievable breakdown of the marriage because in fact the marriage has been retrieved. The parties have become reconciled. One must at the date of decree absolute take into account all the facts which are known to the court at that time. The wife in this case ought not to be allowed, merely because she would like it, to have this marriage dissolved, so than she can continue to live as she is with the husband, but to hold over his head a decree absolute, treating the marriage as having broken down, when it has not.'

Further in the case of adultery it demonstrates that the Petitioner does not find it subjectively intolerable to live with the Respondent and in the case of behaviour it demonstrates that objectively the condition that the Petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with the Respondent is not fulfilled. Wood J also accepted Mr Holman's submission that a stale petition "should not be given new life" particularly when followed by such a long period of cohabitation. Whilst expressing much sympathy for the wife he stated, as had been submitted by Mr Holman, that he had to have regard to public policy considerations. </p>

He submits that Singer, Bodey and Charles JJ all held that consent was an important factor when considering a "freestanding" application under the inherent jurisdiction to rescind decree nisi. Bodey J held that "But if a petitioner for some reason changes his or her mind about being divorced and the respondent cannot, or does not, make any application about the matter, I can see no justification for the court declining jurisdiction to rescind the decree nisi. Whether or not it would actually do so (i.e. rescind) would depend on the overall merits, including amongst other things a balancing of the likely impact on the respective parties. I find it impossible to conceive of circumstances in which a court, exercising its discretion judicially, could properly allow such a retrospective readjustment of its process and of its orders against the opposition of the respondent with the sole motive of getting round the intention of parliament" (i.e. that pension sharing orders should not be available before a certain date)." He held that public policy considerations arose when considering whether he should rescind a decree nisi non-consensually in order that one spouse might seek pension sharing provisions otherwise time barred. He declined to rescind the decree. </p>

But if a decree nisi has been pronounced, no further answer can be filed, and there is no further trial in which directions for trial can be given. This is for the obvious reason that the trial of the facts would have been completed, the facts found, and there is no further trial in respect of which directions can be given. Mr Amos relies on <span class="Emphasis">Scharrer v Scharrer</span>, the Times, 6 July 1909 (CA). A wife filed a petition to which the husband filed an answer, but they subsequently reconciled and the wife's solicitors were instructed to withdraw the petition. This was not done. 20 years later the parties separated again. W applied to supplement her petition but the court declined to permit her to do so and on Appeal the Court of Appeal dismissed both her application and the original petition.

I also bear in mind that if the decree nisi had been rescinded prior to 6 April 2012 W would have been procedurally in the same position that she would have been in had the decree nisi not been pronounced. </p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">But I also accept that the parties' connection with this jurisdiction is long past and that the petition is extremely "stale", and based upon events upon which W can no longer rely, and which cannot, in contrast with behaviour, be revived. The grant of decree nisi is a crucial watershed which cannot be ignored. She could (as in Savage v Savage) issue a second petition: but only if there is jurisdiction. </p>
