It has, of course, come at a cost. The wife has incurred a total of &#163;52,138 in legal costs, the husband a total of &#163;165,103 and the intervenors a total of &#163;61,808 (which has in fact been paid by the husband). This represents an overall total of &#163;279,049 lost to the family as a result of this dispute. It is disappointing to me that these intelligent and likeable parties, both involved at a high level in responsible caring professions, found it impossible to find an acceptable compromise to their disagreements.</p>

He is a Consultant Doctor, currently working in a Hospital in London. He was previously married to FL in 2003, but separated from her in 2012 and was formally divorced from her in 2014.

She is a Consultant Clinical Psychologist, currently working for an NHS Trust. She has a now adult child from an earlier relationship, namely WP (now in her mid-twenties).

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.12in">The husband and wife met via an online dating website in February 2013. At this time the wife was living in rented accommodation (although she owned and rented out a flat in London) and WP (then aged in her early teens) was at school in Buckinghamshire; whilst the husband was living and working in London and PL and CL (then aged 6 and 4 respectively) were at a private school in London.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in">The parties have different perceptions of what happened between 2013 and 2019. The wife says that the relationship quickly (by April 2013) developed into a settled and committed relationship of quasi-marriage, albeit that for quite a while they had to juggle their lives between London and Buckinghamshire to ensure their respective children&#8217;s schooling was not interrupted and albeit that the relationship was volatile and involved occasional short periods of breakdown followed by reconciliation. The husband says that, whilst there was a relationship for most of this time, they deliberately kept independent lives and the relationship did not become one of quasi-marriage until much later, possibly not even until 2019. I will need to resolve this issue, which I shall do below.</p>

This is a source of unhappiness for the wife, who had miscarriages in 2014 and 2015 in what she says were intended and wished for pregnancies. The husband says that he never wanted more children and that the wife told him she was taking the contraceptive pill and that the pregnancies caused great tension in the relationship because he thought she had lied to him. It is common ground, however, that the husband&#8217;s two children (the intervenors) fall into the category of &#8216;children of the family&#8217; within the meaning of Matrimonial Causes Act 1973.</p>

For a time the husband lived in the outbuilding on the premises at Property Two; but eventually this arrangement became too tense and he rented alternative accommodation elsewhere from Summer 2023. Sadly, these events have caused a rift between the two sides of the family and the previously good relations between the three children and between the wife and the husband&#8217;s two children have fractured, possibly irrecoverably (though the wife would wish otherwise).</p>

Cohabitation is normally but not necessarily in one location. There is often a pooling of resources, both in money and property terms." At para 62, Bennett J added: "I am prepared to accept that the wife and the husband from 1999 to the date of their marriage spent many, many nights together, holidayed together and became engaged. They had a very close relationship. But that does not, in my judgment, in the circumstances of this case, equate with a settled, committed relationship moving seamlessly into marriage."</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span class="within-new" style="color:initial">The complication here is that the intervenors have asserted an interest in Property Two, essentially based on resulting/constructive trust principles (there is an alternative possibility of pursuing a claim for an equitable lien, but my view is that this is an unnecessary complication to a relatively straightforward claim and I propose to deal with this issue on resulting/constructive trust principles &#8211; the outcome would not in my view be materially different anyway). This claim arises from the fact that o</span>n 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2014 the husband executed a deed of trust under which the intervenors gained an interest of 36% in Property One (the mortgage was to be taken from the husband&#8217;s remaining 64%). Their interest was under a bare trust, not contingent on any life interest to the husband. Whatever the wisdom of this step by the husband, and whether or not the HMRC might (if alerted) be interested in the transaction, it is common ground that this was a valid and binding execution of trust and that the intervenors can properly rely upon it. As a consequence of this, the intervenors (it is common ground) had an interest in 36% of the sale proceeds of Property One (deducting the sale costs, but not the mortgage). The mathematics of this claim work, in my view (which marginally differs from that of Ms Francis), as follows. The intervenor&#8217;s interest in the Property One sale proceeds was 36% of &#163;(1,023,000 &#8211; sale costs) = 36% x &#163;1,003,632 = &#163;361,307. It is common ground that all of this money was used to contribute to the purchase price of Property Two. The purchase costs of Property Two were &#163;1,440,000 (the purchase price) plus purchase costs, including SDLT, such that the total was &#163;1,529,757, i.e. the intervenors contributed &#163;361,307 out of &#163;1,529,757 = 23.62% of the purchase costs. Based on a Property Two sale price of &#163;1,835,000 (subject to estimated 3% sale costs, but not deducting the mortgage) that would prima facie entitle the intervenors to 23.62% x &#163;1,779,950 = &#163;420,424 from the sale proceeds of Property Two.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The wife has argued that the husband&#8217;s obligation in this respect should be treated as having been discharged by the later execution on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2020 of a different trust (also a bare trust) in favour of the intervenors by the husband over his interest in real property at 91, 93 &amp; 95, MD Road, London SE1 which, when these properties were sold in 2022, gave the intervenors c. &#163;985,000 (after CGT), which sum is still held for them in cash under the terms of that trust. The difficulty with the wife&#8217;s argument in this respect is that there is no evidence that the execution of the later trust was intended by the husband to be in discharge of, or in any way related to, the obligations the husband had under the Property One trust (and he has expressly and clearly denied the linkage). Mr Finch has argued that I should somehow infer this intention from all the circumstances, but I have not been persuaded that I could properly do this. Whether it was wise for the husband in 2020 to give his already fairly wealthy children large amounts more money at his own expense, leaving himself potentially impecunious, and whatever I should make of this in the context of his already existing marriage and later divorce from the wife, he was legally entitled to do what he did and I cannot properly infer an intention which there is no evidence that he had. I note in passing at this stage that, in the weeks leading up to the final hearing and at the outset of the final hearing the wife sought to develop the argument that, in fact, the April 2020 trust was executed much later, possibly in 2022, and that the document had been fraudulently backdated by the husband, possibly working with his father and his father&#8217;s accountant (who was the witness on the 2020 declaration of trust). At the outset of the hearing on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2024, I noted that this line of argument had not been previously pleaded or even referred to at the Pre-Trial Review hearing on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2024 and, if it was to be pursued at all, needed to be properly set up by pleadings so that the husband could be given a proper opportunity to respond to a potentially very serious allegation. I contemplated out loud that it might be possible for the wife still to issue an application under Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, section 37, to set aside the April 2020 transaction, and that the fraud allegations might properly be explored in that context, but that she really needed to make clear her position in this respect and, if she did issue such an application, that this might prevent the final hearing proceeding which might in turn have costs consequences. After having an opportunity to discuss the matter with Mr Finch outside the court room, the wife decided not to go down this route and, this decision having been taken, I determined that the fraud allegation could not properly be pursued at this hearing.</p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The other argument pursued by Mr Finch in relation to the intervenors&#8217; claim was, in my view, on much more solid ground. Mr Finch argued that the obligation to account to the intervenors in the sum of &#163;420,424 was not a top slice from the proceeds of sale of Property Two, after which the wife and husband received their respective half shares; but was instead an obligation to be met out of the husband&#8217;s half share (subject, of course, to any redistributive property adjustment order I might make). Having considered the detail of the evidence, in particular the communications which took place in the period immediately before the purchase of Property Two in December 2019, I have reached the conclusion that Mr Finch is correct about this. My view is that the husband&#8217;s half share of the proceeds of sale of Property Two is held on resulting/constructive trust for the intervenors in the figure of &#163;420,424 (or whatever the precise figure is when the actual sale costs are calculated rather than the 3% estimate). My view is that the wife&#8217;s half share is held free of the intervenors&#8217; claim. Amongst the facts and matters which cause me to reach these conclusions are the following:-</p>

Further, I accept her evidence that he did not tell her about it from 2013 to 2019 and the first time she was aware of its existence was in the context of the December 2019 conveyancing process for the purchase of Property Two. Further, I accept her evidence that she was unaware of the size of the interest (36%) until it had to be disclosed within these proceedings (although the October 2020 document &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">my property interests for your lawyers</span>&#8217;, apparently produced in anger after a marital row, hints at a bigger size, it is vague and unclear and was not followed with any detailed explanation). Further, the evidence suggests that the husband deliberately misled both FL and the conveyancing solicitor about the size of the intervenors&#8217; potential share, expressly saying to both of them that their interest was 10% (rather than 36%). I reject as a lie the husband&#8217;s explanation that when he sent an email to the conveyancing solicitor on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> October 2019 to the effect that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I transferred 10% of Property One into trust for PL and CL</span>&#8221; this was the result of a typo and that it was meant to read &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I transferred 18% of Property One into trust for PL and another 18% for CL</span>&#8221;. I accept the wife&#8217;s evidence that when she raised the issue with the husband in the context of the 2019 conveyancing process he told her it was nothing to worry about. I accept her evidence that she took this to mean, and reasonably took it to mean, that any such obligation was modest and would be met from his share, and would not affect her half share (which she would be free to leave to her daughter in the event that she died).</p>

They are also bolstered by the contents of the TR1. If the husband wished the Property One Trust obligations to be a top slice on the proceeds of sale of Property Two (which would have meant that the wife did not have the unencumbered half share which she was led to believe, and did believe, that she had) then it was for him to say so before Property Two was purchased and ensure that the wife knew the position.

In any event I agree with Mr Finch that some consideration was given, i.e. the fact of the wife being on the mortgage and the fact of her making significant contributions to the mortgage. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1.25in"><span class="within-new" style="color:initial">The simplicity of this proposition has been challenged in two directions. First, the wife has asserted that the husband&#8217;s share is not 1/6</span><span class="within-new" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:initial">th</span><span class="within-new" style="color:initial"> but is instead 1/3</span><span class="within-new" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:initial">rd</span><span class="within-new" style="color:initial">. The difficulty with her asserting this is that the 1/6</span><span class="within-new" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:initial">th</span><span class="within-new" style="color:initial"> portion was clearly asserted in the husband&#8217;s Form E as long ago as November 2022 and the challenge to that assertion was not made until the very last minute. There was no challenge pursued at First Appointment, post-FDR directions appointment or Pre-Trial Review. Neither the wife nor her lawyers made an entry to this effect on the ES2 until just before the start of the final hearing. At the outset of the case I made a determination that it was really too late for the wife to make this challenge since the husband would not have an adequate opportunity to respond to the challenge and gathering evidence to deal with the challenge might take time and involve quite a number of other people who were not necessarily available. I shall therefore use the 1/6</span><span class="within-new" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:initial">th</span><span class="within-new" style="color:initial"> portion for my schedule. Secondly, the husband asserted that there should be a 40% &#8216;minority discount&#8217; from the figure because of the difficulty (or impossibility as he put it) of realising the asset. No mathematical or evidential basis was put forward for this 40% reduction and, whilst I recognise that minority discounts are sometimes appropriate in, for example, company valuations, my conclusion is that it is unusual and inappropriate to think about applying such a discount to a simple interest in real property. In determining the outcome of the case I shall be cognisant that this interest is not necessarily immediately available, but I do not propose to make any mathematical discount. Accordingly, I shall use the above figure in my schedule.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1.25in"><span class="within-new" style="color:initial">I raise the fact that this money came from her property sale because it was part of the husband&#8217;s case that the wife had agreed, as a qui pro quo of his agreeing to give the wife a half share in Property Two, that when she sold her property she would pay the proceeds into the mortgage account on Property Two, thus increasing the equity in Property Two commensurately. He has complained that when she did sell her property she reneged on this promise and that this is not fair. The wife denied the existence of such a promise. On this subject I preferred the evidence of the husband. I accept his evidence that she had led him to believe that she would do this. Even if I am wrong about this, it would in my view meet the test of objective fairness to deal with the case on the basis that she should have done this and fair for me to exercise my redistributive property adjustment powers with this thought in mind.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1.25in"><span class="within-new" style="color:initial">In the context of the above legal tests I note that there is a written loan agreement and some record of the accounting between the husband and his father, but I also note that they are very close indeed and there is no evidence of a demand for repayment or even any timescale for repayment. Further, I note that in the unusual context of this case the husband&#8217;s father has been heavily involved in the transfer of large amounts of monies from the husband to his own children with a strong culture of passing assets down the generations so a demand for payment up a generation might be surprising. I note also that the husband&#8217;s father is aged 86, may be suffering some level of dementia and that the husband holds an enduring power of attorney. Whilst I note that the husband was clear that his father would be likely to want to treat his children equally, the possibility that this debt might be left over to be reconciled from the father&#8217;s estate after his death seemed to be a strong possibility. As ever, there are no guarantees of this, but my overall impression is that is unlikely that the husband&#8217;s father will ever pursue him for the debt, notwithstanding its size. Overall, I have been persuaded that I should treat this debt as a soft debt and not include it in the asset schedule and (in view of Mr Finch&#8217;s thoughts on this) I propose to treat the wife&#8217;s much smaller debt to her father as being in the same category.</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in">The housing needs of the wife were considered in more detail at the hearing than those of the husband. The husband&#8217;s case was that a reasonably suitable two bedroom property could be purchased by her for c. &#163;650,000, requiring a housing fund of c. &#163;700,000 (including purchase costs). Ms Moys on his behalf drew my attention to the fact that she was now single with no dependents (WP being an adult in work) and that she had sold her own property in Amersham for &#163;550,000 in 2021 and never had a more expensive property than that until the purchase of Property Two (in which she had lived for a relatively short time &#8211; December 2019 until now). Further, that her financial contributions were limited. The wife&#8217;s case was that such a figure did not properly reflect the standard of living enjoyed during the marriage (in both Property One and Property Two) and that a purchase price of c. &#163;1,100,000, requiring a housing fund of c. &#163;1,200,000, was more reasonable.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.12in">In my view the fair answer lies somewhere between these two propositions and that a housing fund of c. &#163;850,000 is a reasonable figure for the wife to seek. In particular I would not attach as much weight to the standard of living during the marriage as the wife was inclined to do.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in">I have seen mortgage capacity evidence relating to the wife which suggests that a mortgage of up to &#163;400,000 (or perhaps a little more) would be achievable for her. It does not follow that it would be reasonable to expect her to have to take such a mortgage, in particular if the calculations are done on the basis of her repaying that mortgage over 17 years, the remaining period of her working life. In my view a repayment mortgage of &#163;300,000 is a more reasonable proposition for her and this might cost her c &#163;2,250 pcm, which is affordable on her salary. In the end, of course, it is open to her to buy a better home with a bigger mortgage or a less good home with a smaller mortgage, but it is reasonable for me to work with these figures. If I use a mortgage figure of &#163;300,000 and a reasonable housing fund of &#163;850,000 then I can conclude that she has a reasonable need for capital of c. &#163;550,000 if that is achievable in the context of a fair division of assets. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in">The housing needs of the husband, at least for as long as he has two dependent children, can properly be put at higher than those of the wife because of the children. It can also be said that he has made greater financial contributions than has the wife to the remaining assets. I would not particularly disagree with his own assessment of a reasonable need to purchase at a price of c. &#163;1,000,000, requiring a housing fund of c. &#163;1,100,000. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in">Assessing his need for a capital fund now to meet this housing need is rather more complicated. His share of the sale of Property Two, once the children&#8217;s claim is deducted, is modest. He has some other assets, but they may be difficult to realise quickly or fully, as he only has a portion of the assets and the other owners may not be ready to assist his wish to realise the assets straight away. He has a mortgage capacity, but this must be limited by his need to pay off any borrowings over the next ten years.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.12in">A big question here is what to make of the husband&#8217;s giving away to his children some &#163;1,405,424 of his own assets, the major cause of his current and immediate future impecuniosity. I think there is strength in the argument put by Mr Finch that, by doing what he did, the husband has not done anything in the category of section 25(2)(g) conduct, but he been the author of his own misfortune and that it would be unfair to disadvantage the wife unduly heavily to relieve the husband from the consequence of his actions. In the course of his evidence he said to me in a poignant moment of distress: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I have screwed it up completely</span>&#8221;. It may be the case that a dominant part of his motivation for giving away so much was an admirable wish to assist the next generation, but it is hard not to think that (in relation to the 2020 transaction at least) the motivation did not also involve in part a wish to favour his children over a wife with whom he had a volatile marriage &#8211; I note that he did not tell the wife about it at the time, indeed not until these proceedings started. It was not perhaps sufficiently obvious to cause the wife to feel confident in making a section 37 application, but to an extent the metaphor that he must now &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">lie on the bed he has made for himself</span>&#8217; seems apposite. Another aspect of this question is whether or not the court should assume that the use of all of this money is necessarily lost to him. He is the trustee of both trusts and therefore the effective controller of the destiny of all the money in question, at least for a period, and there is nothing to prevent him using the money (or some of it and presumably subject to a clear recognition of the trust portion of the ownership) to purchase a home for himself and the children. Indeed, he told me that he was already thinking of doing this. Whilst the intervenors might wish not to let their father have a penny of their money once they cease to be minors, it may be more likely that they will take a more humane view to their father (who voluntarily gave them all the money in the first place) and be content to permit him to retain the use of a home purchased by the trust money, or a portion of it, for a much longer period, perhaps even during his lifetime. It may be that he will not need any mortgage at all to meet his housing need, depending on all these imponderables. There are of course uncertainties in all of this, but in so far as there are, they are the product of what the husband has done of his own choice.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Taking all these circumstances into account, I have considered what the outcome would be if I left all things as they are in the above asset schedule, save to require the wife to account to the husband for a half share of the net proceeds of sale of the Amersham Property for the reasons set out above, that would involve the transfer of one half of &#163;247,253. This approach would be achieved by my seeking to transfer &#163;123,627 across from the wife to the husband from the above asset schedule. This could most conveniently be done by amending the percentage divisions on the sale proceeds of Property Two by a commensurate amount, which would be to give the husband 62.45% and the wife 37.55%.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In my view this outcome respects all the matters I have discussed above. It leaves the wife able to proceed to purchase a home at the budget I have identified. It reflects what I consider the agreed arrangement was at the time of the purchase of Property Two. It leaves the husband, with a degree of uncertainty, but probably, able to put together a package whereby suitable housing will be available to him. Accordingly, I have decided to make an order to this effect.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">There was an additional issue before me as to which of the parties should have the ability to port the existing NatWest mortgage (or part of it) to the purchase of a new home, this being desirable as it has a lower than current market interest rate for the next few years. Research carried out by the wife established that only one of the parties could have access to the porting arrangement (i.e. it couldn&#8217;t be split) and that person could take all or part of the mortgage to a new property. If porting occurred then there would be a commensurate reduction in the Early Redemption Penalty. Both parties wished to have the benefit of the port themselves, but undertook to abide my decision on the question and cooperate with the other having the port if required, lest I concluded that the court had no power to order one party to have the port. Having considered both sides&#8217; arguments I have reached the conclusion that the wife should have the benefit of the port. She is more likely to need the port and has a significantly lower income. The husband may not need to have a mortgage at all if he uses the trust money to purchase a home. If there is any reimbursement of the Early Redemption Penalty arising out of this it should be split equally.</p>

He was instructed to give alternative views based on the wife&#8217;s assessment of the duration of the marriage (c. 9 years) or the husband&#8217;s assessment of the duration of the marriage (c. 3 years). In view of my finding of 9 years for the duration of the marriage, I shall obviously concentrate on the former. He was also instructed to give alternative views based on income equality or capital equality. His conclusion was that, looking only at the pensions accrued over the 9 years of the marriage, a 9.2% pension sharing order (of all the husband&#8217;s NHS pension schemes) would produce equal incomes on retirement, but a 10.2% pension sharing order (again, of all the husband&#8217;s NHS pension schemes) would produce capital equality, whilst at the same time leaving the wife with a higher income from those pensions.</p>

The PAG 2 Report suggests that &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Generally in a &#8216;needs case&#8217; it would be wrong to apportion pensions so as to exclude the non-cohabitation/marriage element. By contrast, in a &#8216;sharing case&#8217;, where the assets and future pension benefits exceed the parties&#8217; needs, such apportionment may be appropriate&#8221;</span><span style="color:#000000"> (page 24); but the report goes on to suggest that the categorisation of a case will depend on other section 25 factors, most obviously the duration of the marriage: &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic">Thus, the court will have regard to the length of seamless cohabitation/marriage when determining the extent to which it is fair and reasonable to divide the &#8216;non-matrimonial&#8217; element of any capital or any pension. All cases will be determined upon their own facts. The &#8216;marital&#8217; element of any pension will usually be shared equally. For the reasons set out above, in needs-based cases, the timing and source of the pension saving is not necessarily relevant, but the Court will nevertheless have regard to the length (or shortness) of the seamless cohabitation/marriage in determining the extent to which the needs of the claiming party will justify a division of the pre-cohabitation/marriage element of the pension...The requirement of a nexus between the relationship and a financial need to be met by a matrimonial claim has long been recognised by the case law</span>&#8221; (page 26). In the present case, involving a medium length marriage in more mature years, where the parties have entered the marriage with significant assets acquired earlier in their adult lives, and where the case in terms of pension income sits more easily in the category of a &#8216;sharing case&#8217; (the wife has not argued that she should have more based on a need claim), the fair answer is likely to be provided by focusing on a division of the pensions accrued in the span of the marriage&#8217;s duration, that is to exclude the sharing of pensions outside this category on the basis that they represent non-matrimonial property. The report by Mr Conlon in this case has been targeted towards identifying the mathematical consequences of this principle and its conclusions should therefore be followed in the search for fairness. </p>

There are undoubtedly scenarios where the fair solution is probably to divide pensions by CE value. For example, where the CEs are relatively small in themselves or as a portion of the assets overall. For example, where the parties are relatively young and any projections about the future income-producing qualities of the pensions are likely to be speculative or unreliable. For example, where all the pensions are simple defined contribution funds so that the CE values can be regarded as reasonably reliable and simple predictor of future income streams&#8230;There are, however, scenarios where a simple division of CEs may well not represent a fair solution.&#8221; </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1.25in">I have noticed that it is not uncommon for PODEs to be asked to provide an answer not only based on equal incomes, but also alternatively based on an equal capital approach. Indeed, this happened in the present case. It may be that the reason this happens is because the specimen letter of instruction in the PAG Reports (page 106) includes both approaches in its text, but it should be remembered that these are options provided in the specimen letter and it is not necessary for both of them need to be included in the actual letter sent to the PODE. In the notes accompanying the specimen letter it is stated that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">equalisation of benefits by reference to projected income will in most circumstances be the appropriate approach</span>&#8221;. There may be cases where, for particular reasons, equality of capital is a suitable measure; but in my view these are uncommon and thought should be given to what is the appropriate question before the PODE report is commissioned, if necessary with the judge at the First Appointment determining the issue, and that in most cases the only question which needs to be asked is what level of pension sharing order will produce an equal level of income on retirement. Asking more questions than are necessary will certainly add to the cost of the exercise and almost inevitably lead, further on down the line, to each party advocating the figure most helpful to themselves (as happened in the present case) and making compromise less likely.</p>
