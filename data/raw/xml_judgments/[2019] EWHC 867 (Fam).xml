On 24 January 2019 Williams J granted the mother permission to appeal.  The appeal concerns the approach to be taken in a case which, on the judge&#8217;s finding, falls short of attracting the labels &#8220;intractable hostility&#8221; or &#8220;parental alienation&#8221;. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">At the age of two years, following his parents&#8217; separation, L went to live with his mother and maternal grandmother and he has had his main home with them since that time.  He has, however, been the subject of litigation in the Family Court since 2013 when the mother made the first application, namely an application for L to live with her (notwithstanding that was already the case).  A final order was made by District Judge Gibson on 19 May 2016 confirming that L would live with his mother but providing for regular time with his father every third weekend in England and for substantial periods in Northern Ireland during the school holidays.  It is of note that during the three years between the original application and the final order it seems that no fewer than 10 judges had heard the case, making a total of 12 orders.  However, the final order was made by consent and none of the intervening hearings involved the court hearing any evidence or making any actual findings.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">That finding was not, however, the end of the matter for by the time the case came before HHJ Tolson the father had applied for a change of residence.  During the May 2018 hearing the judge had been exposed to both parents and to the maternal grandmother in the course of oral evidence.  As a result of what he had observed during that process the judge considered that the father&#8217;s central submission, namely that his relationship with his son was being undermined by the mother and grandmother, may be made out.  Having dismissed the factual allegations, HHJ Tolson moved on in his judgment (at paragraph 30): </p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;That is sufficient to dispose of the immediate fact-finding allegation.  The question is, where is (father&#8217;s) wider submission left? My findings clearly dispose of the mother&#8217;s application to suspend contact in the case but they do not dispose, and I cannot dispose, of the father&#8217;s application that L should, in future, live with him and not the mother.  As advanced during his evidence, he presented it in some ways as a last resort.  He feared that we had reached the position where in future the mother would be unable either to permit him a normal relationship with L or to promote his relationship with L in any way. </p>

Is it possible from this point to move into what I shall describe as &#8220;a more broad and sunlit upland&#8221; in which L&#8217;s time with his father in England and, more especially, in Northern Ireland passes peacefully and in L&#8217;s best interests without any further allegations of this kind being made; or will the immediate future of this case see more of the same &#8211; more of the dreadful past history of litigation which we have had now for far too many years?&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In a report dated 10 October 2018, circulated 10 working days before the hearing, the Guardian observed that a change of L&#8217;s primary home would have a profound emotional impact upon him.  He had been in his mother&#8217;s care since birth and had a strong attachment with his maternal grandmother.  The adjustment to living in a new city, a new home and a new school were bound to put pressure on an eight year old boy.  The Guardian prioritised L&#8217;s primary need as being that of feeling a sense of stability at that time.  She expressed concern that both parents did not appear to be able to focus on L&#8217;s well-being and the need to prioritise a positive view of coparenting.  Her conclusion was that a change of residence would be too damaging for him right now.  She therefore recommended that L should remain living with his mother.   </p>

They must also accept that they have created a situation where L returns to their care and shares aspects of his spending time that are not necessarily true and they facilitate a manipulation of or put words into L&#8217;s mouth.  However, if (mother) cannot accept this at the next hearing then I would be inclined to consider more greatly that a change of residence is necessary.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In his judgment HHJ Tolson indicated that there were very similar themes in the reports written by various CAFCASS officers over the years during the proceedings.  The first CAFCASS report identified the main issue in the case as arising from the parents&#8217; somewhat troubled relationship as co-parents and the importance of each of them protecting L from their adult issues during his childhood.  Three years later the same CAFCASS officer referred to research on effects of &#8220;persistent entrenched parental conflict played out by way of the courts&#8221;.  The judge observed that the CAFCASS officer went further and suggested that L &#8220;could be developing a view that his mother is all good and his father is all bad&#8221;.   </p>

Concern was expressed by one judge as to &#8220;the extent to which external agencies (police, social services and school) appear to be unnecessarily involved by the mother&#8221;.  L&#8217;s ABE interview followed soon after and the matter was brought back to court on the mother&#8217;s application to suspend contact.   </p>

He must be absolutely torn apart that his loyalties are pulled one way and then the other by the very people who should be ensuring that he has a secure, loving and stable environment.  I have no doubt that the emotional pressure on L can be nothing short of enormous and only by his parents achieving a full, lasting resolution can this little boy hope to enjoy a normal, happy childhood.&#8221; </p>

It is important at all stages, in my view, to bear in mind that this was a part-heard hearing.  The judge had already been exposed to each of the three key family members at length during the May hearing.  In particular, during the first hearing the judge plainly formed an adverse view of the maternal grandmother.  During his May judgment he said: </p>

It is true that the grandmother can be seen behaving entirely inappropriately and in a hostile manner towards the father during the course of this video.  When the grandmother gave evidence before me she accepted that on this occasion she had behaved inappropriately. She also told me that she was someone who was hot-tempered.  She also expressed the view that in her opinion she was dealing with an irresponsible father.&#8221; </p>

She described herself as a hot-tempered woman when giving evidence before me on the last occasion.  The video of her actions on one handover confirm her description.  She believed the father to be irresponsible.  She will have left L in no doubt about these views.  I find she will have described him as a &#8220;bad man&#8221; on many occasions in the past, as the father contends.  The grandmother presents very differently from mother.  When giving evidence, the impression is that the mother is a relatively passive individual.  The grandmother is not.  There may well be a dynamic in play in the family home where to this point the grandmother has set the tone.  L spends substantial amounts of time in the grandmother&#8217;s care.  I find that the grandmother&#8217;s approach heavily influences L&#8217;s present words and actions when in his mother&#8217;s home.&#8221; </p>

Contrary to the normal arrangement, the mother had not included L&#8217;s passport in the boy&#8217;s luggage. After they had parted, and after he was &#8220;airside&#8221;, the father checked the luggage and found the passport was missing.  He summoned the police and, as a result of their intervention, the mother was located and produced the passport, which she had had with her at the airport, and it was transferred to the father once he had told the mother of his holiday plans.   </p>

The mother takes advantage of any chink in the father&#8217;s armour or opportunity to be difficult (this is the feel for example of the &#8220;handover video&#8221; referred to in my previous judgment). I find that she knew L would be travelling abroad on holiday but took the opportunity not to handover the passport when she believed it would be required.  This incident happened after my findings of fact and when the mother could have been under no illusion that I was looking for a more positive response from her.  The actions of the mother and grandmother have a slightly harder &#8220;edge&#8221; to them because they are both health professionals and should know better.&#8221; </p>

I am afraid that I do not accept that the grandmother has performed what in the light of her evidence to me at the fact-finding hearing would be a U-turn.  She remains a woman with a short temper who has a very poor view of the father.  She will have called him a &#8220;bad man&#8221; (in Cantonese) in L&#8217;s presence on many occasions as the father alleges.  Her attitude will, in my judgment, continue to be evident to L.  He will continue to spend much time in the care of the grandmother.  It is more difficult to guage the mother&#8217;s approach in future.  She was reflective when giving evidence.  On the other hand she seems a passive individual.  I do not believe she really wants to change L&#8217;s view of his father.  Moreover, I do not think she will have the strength of character to do so.  If I look to the future, I am afraid I see more of the past. </p>

At present, I do not believe that L is wedded to the idea that he is an abused child: I have accepted the father&#8217;s evidence that L told  him he had been put up to say things to the police.  There is, however, a danger that L&#8217;s repetition of allegations to his maternal family might become a belief system.  In this case, I would not put the danger at the extreme end of the scale, but it exists.&#8221; </p>

The principal deficiency relied upon was the manner in which the Guardian&#8217;s change of recommendation at the conclusion of the other oral evidence was dealt with.  Prior to that point, submits Mr Wilkinson, the mother&#8217;s case had been conducted upon the basis that the Guardian was in her favour.  He did not therefore cross-examine the father in detail about the planned move to Northern Ireland (for example around schooling).  All the oral evidence, he told me, was adduced on the basis that L was going to be remaining with the mother as recommended by the Guardian.  In any event, when the change of view was made known to the parties, Mr Wilkinson submits that there was insufficient time for the mother to re-focus her case to meet the changed situation. </p>

There was hardly a need for a psychologist to establish the risks of moving these girls from mother to father, not only after her long years of care but also in the light of the negative picture that they had been given of a father who they had not effectively seen for 17 months.  The risks of gamesmanship from the mother in the future, confirmed in residence but nailed down with a clear detailed contact order, were plainly less, and from that essential risk balance the judge was diverted.  In a sense it could be said that the order she made was premature and in its draconian content too risky for these children.&#8221; </p>

The children involved were aged 8 and 10 and their primary home was with their mother, her partner and two younger half-siblings.  There had been substantial difficulties in the children maintaining contact with the father and, the judge found that the mother was coaching the children into disliking their father.  Whilst Peter Jackson J held that it was contrary to the children&#8217;s welfare to be deprived of family relationships which were essential for their development, his findings fell short of holding that they were currently suffering emotional harm or were likely to do so in the future. Nevertheless he held that the father&#8217;s application for a residence order should succeed, subject to offering the mother one final chance.  He therefore made a conditional residence order in the father&#8217;s favour, provided that a move to live with the father would not take place if the mother complied with two further ten day periods of staying contact.   </p>

It is well established that the court cannot put a gloss on to the paramountcy principle in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1</ref>.  I do not read the judgments in <span style="font-style:italic">Re: A</span> as purporting to do that.  The test is, and must always be, based on a comprehensive analysis of the child&#8217;s welfare and a determination of where the welfare balance points in terms of outcome.  It is important to note that the welfare provisions in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1</ref> are precisely the same provisions as those applying in public law children cases where a local authority may seek the court&#8217;s authorisation to remove a child from parental care either to place them with another relative or in alternative care arrangements.  Where, in private law proceedings, the choice, as here, is between care by one parent and care by another parent against whom there are no significant findings, one might anticipate that the threshold triggering a change of residence would, if anything, be lower than that justifying the permanent removal of a child from a family into foster care.  Use of phrases such as &#8220;last resort&#8221; or &#8220;draconian&#8221; cannot and should not indicate a different or enhanced welfare test.  What is required is for the judge to consider all the circumstances in the case that are relevant to the issue of welfare, consider those elements in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1(3)</ref> welfare check </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">There is, therefore, an express duty placed upon a guardian in a case such as this to report on the child&#8217;s wishes.  However, in my view, that duty must be tempered by the overarching requirement to afford paramount consideration to the child&#8217;s welfare.  In the present case, the Guardian began direct work with L which would normally lead to explicit discussion of the central issue before the court.  However, during the course of that work she saw first-hand that which her predecessors had also apprehended, namely that this young boy was exquisitely torn between a wholly negative presentation of his father in the maternal home which was in total contradiction to the reality of his relationship with his father when they were seen together.  The Guardian considered that any expression of wishes in the current circumstances would be bound to favour the mother.  More importantly, she considered that to ask the question and to put this eight year old boy on the spot of expressing a choice would itself be emotionally harmful.  She therefore made the positive decision not to ask him the question.  Her decision was, certainly by implication, supported by the solicitors and counsel instructed on L&#8217;s behalf, who now defend that decision before this court, and her decision was accepted by the very experienced family judge.  In those circumstances, it is difficult, indeed it is not possible, for the mother to argue on appeal that the exercise conducted by the Guardian was fatally flawed and that, as a result, the process before the judge should be set aside and a fresh exercise undertaken to canvass L&#8217;s wishes and feelings.   </p>

In the professional opinion of the Guardian, it was not possible to ascertain L&#8217;s wishes and feelings on the central issue without causing him emotional harm.  It was also the view of the Guardian that L&#8217;s position was such that any expression of wishes would be unlikely to represent his true wishes and feelings, and, to that extent it would not be possible to ascertain the child&#8217;s genuine view.   </p>

There was, he argued, however, a need for a more subtle process to identify how the child felt about a move to Northern Ireland. </p>

Actions speak louder than words.  In that regard the Guardian&#8217;s observation of this heavily conflicted young boy, who has a good relationship with both of his parents, yet can only speak negatively of his father when in the care of his mother and maternal grandmother, speaks volumes and, as the judgment demonstrates, his voice, in that regard, was heard loud and clear by the Judge.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The central submission in the mother&#8217;s appeal is based upon the twin assertions firstly, that the judge was in error in conducting the welfare balance and, secondly, that he acted prematurely in directing a move to Northern Ireland at this stage.  In presenting the mother&#8217;s appeal, Mr Wilkinson was careful to limit and focus his submissions so that contemplation of the need for change in the maternal home was limited: </p>

The mother will have had only a limited time to change.  Oral evidence demonstrated her acceptance that she had previously been in error and was willing to take advice and, indeed, that she had engaged on a parenting course.  If the parameters of the case were as tightly confined as Mr Wilkinson&#8217;s submission, then the judge&#8217;s decision would, indeed, be seen as premature.  But, as the judge&#8217;s judgment plainly demonstrates, there was much more to the case then the narrow, constricted perspective that the mother seeks to present in arguing the present appeal.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Firstly, concern about the impact on L of being a child at the centre of parental conflict was identified as long ago as 2013.  It has been the theme of the CAFCASS reports in the case at every stage over the years.  This is not a new concern generated for the first time in the father&#8217;s recent application for a change of residence.  Ms </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">Musgrave was right to point to the fact that this case has been going on for six years.  Further, the May hearing before HHJ Tolson was the first part of a part-heard process.  The judge could not have been more explicit in delivering a wake-up call to the mother and the grandmother in his May judgment.  Any reading of that judgment makes clear that the judge was so concerned at L&#8217;s position as to give active consideration to the father&#8217;s change of residence application.  Further, whilst it is correct that any parental conflict requires more than one participant, the judge&#8217;s findings make plain that he regarded the actions of the mother, and more particularly the grandmother, to be the principal source of conflict and the principal cause of harm to the L.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The manner in which Mr Wilkinson sought to close down the parameters of the case in presenting the mother&#8217;s appeal was most striking with regard to the maternal grandmother.  If she was mentioned in his submissions, it was only in passing.  For the judge, however, the personality and role of the maternal grandmother in L&#8217;s life was, if anything, more significant in terms of emotional harm to the boy than that of the mother.  As the extracts from the judgment to which I have made reference demonstrate, the judge identified the grandmother&#8217;s behaviour as harmful.  He also concluded that, despite the earlier judgment, the grandmother had been unable to undertake a U-turn or, indeed, demonstrate any real change at all.  These were crucial findings. The role of the maternal grandmother in the maternal home, and in L&#8217;s experience of relationships in the family, was central to the judge&#8217;s analysis.  It is, therefore, wholly artificial to challenge the welfare balance undertaken by the judge in a manner that excludes consideration of the grandmother&#8217;s role. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Thirdly, although the role of the CAFCASS Guardian was important, and the judge agreed with her final recommendation, both the May and November judgments demonstrate that the analysis leading to the conclusion that L must move to Northern Ireland was the judge&#8217;s and the judge&#8217;s alone.  Having formed a preliminary view that raised the real prospect of a move to Northern Ireland in May, the judge made it plain to the mother and grandmother that he expected to see a change in the following months.  In this regard, the airport incident was of importance.  The judge&#8217;s finding as to what took place, and, in particular, the motivation of the mother and the grandmother in acting as they did, is not directly challenged on appeal, nor could it be.  The judge was entitled to rely upon that incident in support of the wider finding that, in reality, nothing had or would change in emotional terms for L if he were to remain living in the maternal household. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">of change, a move of home was justified.  The key finding of emotional harm is not challenged in the appeal.  Indeed, the mother told the Judge &#8220;I got it wrong &#8211; I need advice&#8221;.  It may be that the decision to move L was finely balanced, but, as is well known, finely balanced welfare decisions are not susceptible to a successful appeal.  It is, in my view, not possible to say that the Judge was &#8220;wrong&#8221; in fixing the balance as he did  in this case.</p>

The change in the Guardian&#8217;s recommendation at the close of the lay parties&#8217; oral evidence undoubtedly placed the mother&#8217;s team in an unwelcome and difficult professional position.  Given the decision to run mother&#8217;s case on the basis that L was likely to remain living with her, in the light of the Guardian&#8217;s report, the forensic difficulties were enhanced.  No application was made to recall the father.  Although it is unclear as to how much time was given, further time was stated to have been given by the judge for the mother&#8217;s cross-examination of the Guardian.  Difficult though the circumstances were, there is no real ground for criticising the trial process, or for challenging the judge&#8217;s decision to refuse the adjournment application that was made at the end of the hearing. </p>
