	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.02in">I am concerned with RD, a 37 year old woman, who lives in a property on her own in the Midlands, albeit with very significant support.  The application is brought by a Midlands NHS trust.  RD is the First Respondent, represented by her litigation friend the Official Solicitor.  Her two parents, SD and LD, are the Second and Third Respondents.  The Fourth Respondent is a Midlands Clinical Commissioning Group, although it has not played any significant part in the case and has basically just allowed the Midlands Trust to conduct the litigation.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.02in">The reason why RD is subject to these proceedings, brought under the Court of Protection and, as a result of the order that I make today, under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court, is that RD has suffered since approximately the age of 13 from an extremely serious and debilitating condition, namely anorexia nervosa.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.02in">It was in the year 2000 that she was first diagnosed with anorexia nervosa restrictive subtype, with clinical features of depression and she was admitted to an inpatient unit.  Thereafter, there have been 14 further admissions for her to receive care and treatment.  On most of those occasions, but not all, there has been some weight gain but it has virtually always been lost almost immediately following her discharge.  Starting in 2013, there have been approximately four admissions pursuant to the Mental Health Act, effectively on a compulsory basis.  Yet again the pattern was the same.  There was some weight restoration, although I do not believe ever to a healthy weight since 2013 but the weight was loss after discharge. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.02in">In February 2020, she was admitted again to the a specialist ward, I think pursuant to the Mental Health Act.  When she was discharged, she had a BMI of 13.4 and a regime of support workers which was hoped to be four times per day but, in fact, became three times per day at her request.  The meal plan was that she should take seven Fortijuices per day although I do not believe that has ever been achieved or even close to it.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.02in">Whilst she was on the Ward, a report was commissioned by the Applicants from Dr Matthew Cahill, a consultant psychiatrist.  It is right to say that he was critical that RD had been treated in the community for too long when in her 20s without admission to an EDU unit.  I take the view that this is now water under the bridge and I am here to deal with RD&#8217;s best interests as they are at today&#8217;s date.  He was, however, in complete agreement with the Applicant Trust that she was suffering from a severe and enduring anorexia nervosa, that the prognosis was very poor and her recovery was very unlikely.  Having said that, he took the view that there should be two further interventions attempted to see whether or not there could be a significant improvement before applications were made, effectively to authorise no further compulsory admissions or treatment.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.02in">The first of these two interventions was the discharge on a Community Treatment Order, with four visits per day and the second was the possibility of her being admitted to a specialist rehabilitation unit.  The second possibility proved impossible because </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.02in;text-indent:0in">she did not meet the requirements of the unit.  First, her BMI had to be above 13 and it was not.  Secondly she had to demonstrate a willingness to engage and make changes and, regrettably, she did not.  Thirdly, she had to be stable physically in terms of her health and again that was not the position at the time.  Such an admission, therefore, was not available and the return home onto the Community Treatment Order was equally not successful.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.02in">In July 2020, she had to be re-admitted, first to a local Hospital for re-feeding and physical health monitoring, pursuant to the Mental Health Act and on 2 September 2020, she was transferred to the specialist ward where she had been before.  Her BMI on admission was 10.9.  She was put on an NG tube feeding regimen of 6.5 bottles of Fortisip across three nasogastric bolus feeds per day.  She struggled to tolerate it.  There had to be some physical restraint.  There were new symptoms of vomiting, although these were denied by RD.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.02in">Sedation and extended restraint was rejected due to the risks to her and, by the end of her stay there, she was struggling to finish four Fortijuces per day and there was no significant improvement in her BMI.  In consequence, she was discharged home on 22 December 2020 with a BMI very similar to that at which she was admitted.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.02in">In consequence, the application was made on 22 December 2020 to the Court of Protection for declarations, first that she lacked capacity to make decisions in relation to litigation and to take decisions about her nutritional intake and about her care and treatment in general.  Second, for declarations that it was in her best interests to receive the care in her care plan, specifically that is was lawful not to take any steps towards forcing nutrition against her wishes, notwithstanding that, by so doing, it might, in the short-term, prevent her death and to provide palliative care when appropriate.  At the time, she had a dangerously low BMI of around 11.3.  She was at high risk of death and treatment in the community could well result in her death if she is not compliant with the treatment proposals made by the Applicant Trust.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.02in">A capacity assessment was produced and there is no disagreement that she lacks capacity in all respects.  I have read the capacity assessments with care.  In particular there is one from Dr T dated 22 December 2020.  The conclusion is that she is able to understand and retain information but she is simply not able to weigh that information.  In other words, she understands that, if she does not eat or drink her juices, it will not be good for her, but she simply does not understand that it will lead to her death and she cannot understand that it means that she has to comply with the treatment.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.02in">On 22 December 2020, Dr T filed a statement.  She took the view that it would not be clinically appropriate for RD to be detained under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> any further.  It was likely to have a detrimental effect on her wellbeing and make the situation worse, increasing the chance of a sudden death.  RD regularly experiences muddled head or disorientation.  She has many symptoms of chronic anorexia nervosa.  Her prognosis is poor.  She lacks insight into the severity of her presentation.  She believes her intake of juices and nutrients will improve if she is left alone, but there is no history to suggest that is correct.  A healthy BMI for her would be between 18.5 and 24.9, but her BMI, at the time, was approximately 11.7.   </p>

The supportive package should be put in place to allow RD her privacy and independence.  The doctor&#8217;s summary was that RD was in the end stage of her life.  Further forced treatment was unlikely to be of benefit, would not preserve her life, was likely to cause significant distress and result in an undignified death.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.02in">On 6 January 2021, a second report was filed by Dr Cahill.  His summary was that the further interventions that he had recommended had not been successful.  Her eating disorder remains severe and entrenched.  There is evidence of physical deterioration.  He was struck by her lack of understanding of the seriousness of her condition.  He agreed that the inpatient options had been exhausted; that further attempts were extremely likely to be futile; that the potential risks do not justify the likely gains; and that they were increasingly unethical and disproportionate if administered coercively.  The shift should focus to the quality of her life.  He did take the view, however, that it was likely she would deteriorate within weeks and require palliative care within months.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.02in">Poole J made various Case Management Orders on 6 January 2021, including a Transparency Order.  He listed the case today for a final hearing before me.  It is right to say in this judgment that, this morning, I varied the Transparency Order.  Submissions were made to me by all three counsel that RD was extremely distressed by this case proceeding in public, albeit subject to the Transparency Order.  I was clear that I should convert this into a private hearing.  In fairness, the one member of the public who attended accepted this before I gave judgment, without reservation, and agreed voluntarily to leave the hearing.  I reminded him, as he did so, of the order preventing any publicity in relation to this case.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.02in">Following the orders of Poole J, Ms Kate Jackson, the solicitor instructed by the Official Solicitor to attend upon RD in this matter, went to see RD.  On 6 January 2021, she produced her statement.  RD told Ms Jackson that she agreed with the NHS Trust that, if she refuses treatment, it should not be forced on her, despite the possible grave consequences.  However she was clear that she wants to live but did not want nasogastric feeding.  She did not want to go back into hospital and specifically she did not want to go to an eating disorder hospital.  She wants to be at home.  She would accept IV fluids and treatment for electrolyte imbalances.  She wants to live but her mind is making her do things against it.  She would like to speak to me but she would rather not have people watching.   </p>

I did not see her but I was able to hear her.  I told her that I understood how difficult this process was for her.  I asked her how she was and she told me she was OK. She was clearly very nervous.  I said I understood that she did not want treatment forced on her against her wishes and she confirmed that this was the case.  She told me that, if she was in the community, she would comply with the treatment plan and drink her juices.  I said that I was very concerned for her and only wanted to do what was best for her.  She said she understood that.  She was, however, adamant to me that she </p>

The Official Solicitor put a number of questions to Dr Cahill and his answers were received this morning.  I pay tribute to him for dealing with this case on such an urgent basis and effectively out of hours.  He said that he considered this case on a seriousness scale to be 9 out of 10.  He was of the view that there was no evidence that any further attempts by compulsion to improve RD&#8217;s BMI would be any smoother than before.  He reminded the court that there had been months of treatment without success and there would need to be months of further treatment.  He considered that this would cause further distress to RD.  He said that restoring her weight has had no impact on her cognitions or behaviours and the chance of success was less than 5%.  It was very likely, moreover, that she would suffer physical, emotional and psychological harm and it would rekindle previous trauma that she had experienced.  He accepted that restraint was extremely risky.   </p>
