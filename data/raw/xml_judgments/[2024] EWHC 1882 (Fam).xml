	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application before the court made by the local authority sought protective orders pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court in respect of P, a young woman aged 29 years. There was no dispute that P is a vulnerable adult who is under the influence and control of her father, Y. She has, on any analysis, experienced a dysfunctional family life that has left her homeless, isolated from her wider family and her peers, lacking formal education or training, distrustful of authority, and likely to be at risk of harm without support from others which she has consistently refused. P had been compelled by court order to live apart from her father in a placement provided and funded by the local authority since late October 2023. Simply put, the central issue in this case was whether the court should continue to use its powers to compel P to live apart from her father.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The first respondent to the proceedings was P, through her litigation friend, the Official Solicitor. Throughout the proceedings, P was encouraged by the court to seek legal representation but did not do so. In March 2024, the Official Solicitor was invited to act as P&#8217;s litigation friend but P has not engaged with her legal representatives. P&#8217;s father, Y, was the second respondent. He has not engaged with the proceedings at all and his current whereabouts are not known. He is believed to be living in the local authority&#8217;s area as P is thought to see him regularly when she goes out from her current placement. The third respondent is X, P&#8217;s mother. She married Y in 1991 but divorced him in 2017 on the grounds of his domestic abuse. She left the marital home in 2015 and since that time, has had very limited contact with P.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By the time of the hearing and for reasons which will become clear in this judgment, the local authority had decided that continuing P&#8217;s placement was disproportionate and that any other safeguarding measures were unlikely to be effective in helping P extricate herself from a relationship of control and dependence on Y. It applied to withdraw its application, a course supported by both X (albeit with some reluctance) and the Official Solicitor. I approved that course and, by consent, made the following determinations:</p>

With the agreement of the parties present in court, I also invited the local authority to withdraw the claim for state benefits it had made on behalf of P and to inform the DWP that, if any future application was made by P herself, P should not be assumed to lack capacity to make an application. The final order contained provisions permitting the disclosure of this judgment and other evidence to the police should they become involved with P and Y in the future.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority first became aware of P following a referral from the police in early March 2022. X had reported her concerns to the police, namely that Y exercised control over P; that P lacked access to basic necessities such as heating and food; and that P was financially dependent on her father who lived on a very limited income indeed. P and Y were living together in the family home at this time. The initial police report detailed how P - then aged 27 years - appeared to look like a young teenager, being underweight, and pale with sores on her mouth. Following the referral, the local authority attempted in vain to engage P, making over 17 visits to the family home between March 2022 and May 2023. The social work evidence showed a concerted effort by P and Y to evade health and social care professionals and the police. It is important to note that, at that time, P had never been known to Children&#8217;s Services and, save for obtaining the Covid vaccine, had last attended her GP a decade earlier for a minor ailment. She left school at 16 without any qualifications and appeared never to have been in paid, formal employment or to have claimed state benefits. She was socially isolated with no friends or contact with other family. P has a brother, Q, who has been diagnosed with a serious psychotic illness and was hospitalised in March 2022. He has never returned to the family home since then and presently resides in a mental health unit as a voluntary patient. Q has said almost nothing about his sister&#8217;s circumstances in the family home.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In April 2023, P and Y were evicted from the family home because Y had failed to pay the mortgage and the property was repossessed. Thereafter, both P and Y slept in a car parked on the property&#8217;s driveway, using an external mailbox at the property to collect post. There was no evidence that P or Y were trying to find somewhere else to live or making a claim for state benefits to enable them to do so. In May 2023, two separate referrals were received from members of the public expressing concern about P&#8217;s living circumstances. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Concern about P&#8217;s circumstances was heightened by the information gleaned about X&#8217;s experiences in the family home before she left in 2015. Both X and P&#8217;s brother, Q, reported Y to be controlling, paranoid about government, and suspicious of professionals. X described family life as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;cult-like&#8221;</span> with Y assigning family members roles in the family home so that he could concentrate on his health. X gave an account of her life to the local authority detailing prolonged domestic abuse by Y in which P and Q had been required to participate. Neither X, P or Q were allowed to leave the family home unaccompanied by Y, work, or claim state benefits. Shopping was done as a group and Y controlled the family finances, only allowing &#163;1.50 a day for food for the entire family. Food was rationed and measured out in small amounts and the family diet often consisted of bread and jam/mustard. X reported that P and Q had to wear covert recording equipment to school so that Y could monitor their interactions with others. Y had refused to sign a learning agreement which resulted in a B-Tec course for P being terminated. His control over the family appears to have extended to limiting showers; cutting the family&#8217;s hair himself; and restricting P&#8217;s access to funds so she could purchase sanitary towels. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The proceedings were allocated to HHJ Burrows sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge. On 1 September 2023, he gave the local authority permission to invoke the inherent jurisdiction and joined P and Y as parties to the proceedings. The Official Solicitor was appointed to conduct an enquiry into P&#8217;s circumstances with a view to advising whether protective orders were appropriate. An independent social worker was appointed and met with P on three occasions from a total of five visits. He concluded that she was a vulnerable adult and that it was probable that her views were informed by a more dominant other. P was unable to provide any information to reduce professional concern about her future welfare, stating that she wished to be left alone. The independent social worker also concluded that P lacked the capacity to conduct the proceedings and to make decisions about her residence and care. He was unable to assess her ability to make decisions about contact. Given the lack of medical evidence, the independent social worker was unable to say whether P&#8217;s lack of capacity arose from an impairment of the mind or brain but concluded that it was probable she was subject to coercion or undue influence. He recommended that the court obtain a psychiatric report.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 26 October 2023, HHJ Burrows discharged the Official Solicitor and went on to make an order that it was in P&#8217;s best interests to be accommodated at a care home and to be transported to that place, if necessary, with the use of force. The recital to the court&#8217;s order explained that the court had concluded, on the available evidence, that P was under the influence and control of Y and that P was at significant risk of serious harm because she was living in a car with Y in cold weather, appearing to be malnourished. In those circumstances, the court determined that the need for protective action was urgent and that the conveying and accommodating of P at the care home amounted to a deprivation of her liberty, authorised in accordance with Article 5(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). HHJ Burrows did not impose restrictions upon P that prevented her from leaving the placement during daylight hours. When the matter returned before the court on 16 November 2023, HHJ Burrows authorised continuation of the placement in circumstances where the car in which P had been living with her father had been repossessed by the finance company, thus depriving P anywhere at all to go should she leave the placement. HHJ Burrows recognised the draconian nature of the orders he made but considered them necessary so that P&#8217;s circumstances could be assessed away from the influence of her father. He emphasised the critical importance of P being represented and encouraged both her and her father to obtain legal advice. He stressed the court&#8217;s and the local authority&#8217;s genuine concern for her welfare but made clear that there may come a point where the court was unable to alter P&#8217;s mindset and circumstances, rendering the proceedings otiose. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In December 2023, the court directed a report from a consultant psychiatrist, Dr Ince, and listed the matter for further review. Y was prohibited from having contact with P at any place other than the residential placement, such contact to be prearranged and supervised; and prohibited from behaving in any way so as to prevent P from attending court or having access to health or social care professionals or to Dr Ince. In order to prepare his report, Dr Ince spoke with P in January 2024 but P refused to leave her room and speak with him on his next visit in early February 2024. Having considered all the material and interviewed Pon one occasion, Dr Ince concluded that P did not have a mental disorder or mental impairment. Her behaviour and views were a manifestation of the undue influence of her father arising from coercion and control. As a result, P lacked the capacity to conduct the proceedings and to make decisions about residence, care, contact with her father and state benefits. In his opinion, P did not recognise the impact of Y&#8217;s beliefs and behaviour upon her own well-being or broader decision-making and Dr Ince drew attention to the positive impact of her relationships with staff at placement as a protective factor, these allowing objective but supportive challenge to P. Though hesitant to make significant comments about P&#8217;s best interests, Dr Ince suggested that P was developing some confiding and supportive relationships with the current care team together with social connections in the placement. Should the court be satisfied that P continued to require the protection of the inherent jurisdiction, Dr Ince was of the opinion that her continued placement within a supportive environment would be a positive step towards a greater level of independence. Without such a framework or if there were to be a hasty removal of the placement, there would be a significant risk that P would not have developed the relevant and necessary skills to prevent a return to her father&#8217;s control and a re-establishment of her prior dependence, enmeshment, and coercion.</p>

Following her move, P was unwilling to provide information about herself but eventually she seemed happy to engage in some activities. She had a set list of food that she would eat which was rather limited. P appeared to spend considerable time researching the law relevant to these proceedings which she explained to staff, appearing to be reading from a script. She was focused on some matters but did not appear to have an understanding of the court order as a whole. By the time of this hearing, P continued to engage superficially with the psychological help provided at the placement but would not take part in formal sessions. She did however engage with staff and participated in planned activities and appeared to have formed some friendly relationships with other residents. She now ate the food provided at the placement and no longer appeared to be underweight. P had declined state benefits despite an application for Universal Credit being made on her behalf by the local authority. She had some engagement with an Independent Domestic Violence Advocate via email and information about controlling behaviour and undue influence was going to be sent to her but P had ended the contact before this could take place. P had declined to meet with the social worker to discuss alternative residential options. </p>

P was unlikely to make significant progress unless contact with her father could be prevented, but the only means by which this could be achieved would be placing P in a locked setting and restricting her access to the internet and social media. In those circumstances, the social worker considered it would be disproportionate to require P to continue living in the placement.</p>

She wants nothing to do with the local authority or any services it might offer her and wants to leave the placement to return to her old way of life. Those wishes are also expressed in all P&#8217;s dealings with local authority or other care staff involved with her. For example, on 23 November 2023, during a visit from the team manager, P said that she wished <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;to get my own accommodation and have my own life and to know you won&#8217;t be there&#8221;</span>.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority recognised that the hearing marked an important crossroad in P&#8217;s life. Having spent it all so far under the influence and control of her father, this had been her first opportunity to live a life independently of him. However, P was either unable or unwilling to take that opportunity and had declined all efforts of support. The local authority recognised that safeguarding measures such as the residential placement - though necessary - had with the passage of time become disproportionate and that more draconian measures would be required to cut off all ties between P and her father. Given the strength and consistency of P&#8217;s will and the limited reason to believe that such measures would be effective, the local authority had come to the conclusion that further protective orders were disproportionate. Given the risk of P returning immediately to her father, Miss Butler-Cole KC submitted that the court needed to be satisfied that neither the local authority&#8217;s obligations under the ECHR nor those of the court would be violated if the proceedings ended with no ongoing orders. She therefore invited me to determine whether ending the current protective measures would breach the State&#8217;s positive obligations. On a careful analysis of the future risks in the event of the discontinuation of protective orders, the local authority submitted that there was no real and immediate risk that P would experience degrading treatment by her father such as to engage Article 3 of the ECHR. </p>

Regrettably, the residential placement had made no obvious difference to P&#8217;s engagement with services nor had it addressed the concerns of her enmeshed relationship with Y. There was no real prospect of altering the outcome or mitigating the harm sufficient to engage the lawful responsibility of the state.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of P, the Official Solicitor shared the concerns in relation to P&#8217;s safety and general well-being but was unpersuaded as to the utility or lawfulness of further protective orders. It was highly likely that P would refuse to engage with further assessment or offers of therapeutic or practical support. There was no purpose in making findings of fact against Y when the local authority no longer sought injunctive orders against him and where ongoing restrictions on P&#8217;s contact with him were unlikely. The allegations made in the documentary evidence were very serious but some related to incidents that had taken place many years ago and many were drawn from documents - some of them incomplete - provided by X which had only recently been disclosed to the local authority and the Official Solicitor. Presently, the Official Solicitor was not persuaded that the discontinuance of protective orders would breach P&#8217;s Article 3 rights in the circumstances of this case. P had been arguably deprived of her liberty for several months during which time she had steadfastly refused to engage with all attempts to offer her any therapeutic intervention or other formal assistance. That was highly unlikely to change and it was thus difficult to see what more the State could do. In such circumstances, it was likely that the State could not be found to be failing to take measures within the scope of its powers which it might reasonably be expected to take to avoid the risks to P. P would undoubtedly remain vulnerable but her circumstances fell short of engaging the high threshold required to engage Article 3 of the ECHR.</p>

In such a situation, there is an obligation not only to afford general protection to society, but above all to take account of the recurrence of successive episodes of violence within a family. In many cases, even where the authorities do not remain totally passive, they still fail to discharge their obligations under Article 3 of the Convention because the measures they take do not stop the abuser from perpetrating further violence against the victim (see </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Tunikova and Others</span><span style="font-style:italic">, cited above, [103], and further case law references in </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Volodina</span><span style="font-style:italic">, cited above in [86]. </span></p>

In assessing the &#8220;immediacy&#8221; of the risk, the authorities should take into account the specific features of domestic violence cases, such as consecutive cycles of violence, often with an increase in frequency, intensity and danger over time (ibid., [165-166] and [175-176]).</span></p>

The authorities should not rely solely on the victim&#8217;s perception of risk but complement it with their own assessment, preferably using standardised risk assessment tools and checklists and collecting and assessing information on all relevant risk factors and elements of the case, including from other State agencies. The conduct of the risk assessment should be documented in some form and communicated to other stakeholders who come into regular contact with the persons at risk; the authorities should keep the victim informed of the outcome of the risk assessment and, where necessary, provide advice and recommendations on the available legal and operational protective measures (ibid., [167-174]).</span></p>

I agree with that submission, whether the individual is an asylum seeker or anyone else.

Just as there is no Convention right to be provided by the state with a home, so too there is no convention right to be provided by the state with a minimum standard of living: &#8220;treatment&#8221; requires something more than mere failure.&#8221;</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is a difficult and sensitive case and I agree with Miss Richards KC that there are, in reality, no good outcomes for P. P&#8217;s mindset has not been altered during her time in the residential placement &#8211; she is as firm as ever about her desire to decline help from the local authority and to do what she wants. Sadly, she has no insight into the dysfunctional relationship that she has with her father and it is likely that, once she leaves the placement and whatever she might say about wanting her own place to live, P will be drawn back into his orbit and surrender herself once more to his control. I am wholly satisfied on the evidence before me that P is a vulnerable adult who lacks capacity because of the ongoing undue influence of her father. However, P&#8217;s refusal to engage and accept offers of help does not necessarily discharge the local authority of its statutory responsibilities.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Applying the case-law cited above and on fine balance, the real and immediate risks to P &#8211; though very concerning &#8211; fall short of establishing a real and immediate risk of degrading treatment for Article 3 purposes. Whilst there appears to have been financial and psychological abuse of P by Y, he does not appear to have physically assaulted her and his treatment of her is not such as to cause anguish and inferiority capable of breaking P&#8217;s moral and physical resistance. Destitution - which P faces given her reluctance and that of her father to claim state benefits - is not sufficient to amount to degrading treatment. Even if I am wrong about all that and a real and immediate risk of engaging Article 3 exists, I find that the local authority has, in the recent past, taken all reasonable steps to negate that risk including bringing these proceedings and accommodating P in a residential setting. P has consistently refused all offers of help and accommodation and has failed meaningfully to engage with domestic abuse and mental health services. Further, though the police declined to intervene in April 2023, I consider that P would not presently support any criminal prosecution of Y for his behaviour towards her. In those circumstances, I endorse the view shared by the represented parties that it would be disproportionate to make further protective orders in respect of P. The inherent jurisdiction is not unboundaried and, given that all investigations into P&#8217;s circumstances have now concluded, there is no lawful justification for the continuance of protective orders. Further protective orders in circumstances where they are unlikely to manifestly alter P&#8217;s situation would represent an unjustifiable interference with P&#8217;s Article 5(1) rights to liberty and security of person. I am thus satisfied that, despite the risks to P&#8217;s welfare should she reject the offers of support from the local authority and return to live with her father, further orders regulating her residence or otherwise constraining her choices are unjustified and disproportionate.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority made some proposals which it asserted were an appropriate discharge of their statutory obligations to P. First, it is proposed that the local authority will set up a prepaid card with a balance of &#163;500 which it will make available to P via her advocate or the library where P spends much of her time. This will be a safety net for P should she wish to make use of it. Second, the local authority has agreed to withdraw the claim for state benefits it made on P&#8217;s behalf and to inform the Department of Work and Pensions that P should not be assumed to lack capacity to make any future application for state benefits. Third, a pack of information which might help P access help and support should she wish to do so has been prepared and will be given to P&#8217;s advocate to give to her in case P maintains contact with her advocate following her departure from the residential placement. All of the above represent a reasonable response to the reality of P&#8217;s situation and I am satisfied that they are an appropriate discharge of the local authority&#8217;s statutory obligations to P. </p>
