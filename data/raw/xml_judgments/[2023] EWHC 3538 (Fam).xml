RN and her older sister TN were made subject of a Child Protection Plan in March 2021 due to emotional abuse by their mother, MN. There was police involvement and, on 2 July 2021, RN and TN moved to live with the Applicants (who are family friends) where they have remained since.  Sadly, their mother died in December 2022 after suffering a terminal illness. The children have had no relationship with the father for many years.  On 14 December 2022, the court made an order (headed &#8220;interim child arrangements order&#8221;) that, until further order of the court, RN shall reside with the Applicants. By then, TN was 18 years old.  The proceedings have been case managed by Lay Justices thereafter.  They have not been concluded and when this inherent jurisdiction application was issued, both applications were listed before me. </p>

His detailed Judgment sets out the principles that he distilled from the case law. On the particular facts of that case, he accepted that the application could proceed under the inherent jurisdiction rather than in the Administrative Court. However, he observed that disputes about the correct legal status of children (which in turn have financial implications) are more commonly dealt with in the Administrative Court. MacDonald J expressly stated that he was <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> altering the general proposition that ordinarily such challenges to Local Authority decision making would be dealt with by way of judicial review in the Administrative Court. </p>

In paragraphs 93 and 94 of his Judgment, he stated: </p>

Given that (a) determining the application for a declaration in these proceedings would, notwithstanding that the application claims no other remedy, serve a useful purpose in circumstances where the issue of financial support is relevant to the issue of special guardianship that is before this court, (b) that these proceedings are already on foot with much of the material relevant to the determination of the application for a declaration already before this court, (c) that in the circumstances the determination by this court of the application for a declaration may avoid the need for further and expensive proceedings in the Administrative Court depending on the response of the parties to this court&#8217;s decision and (d) this court dealing with the issue would thereby likely reduce delay and expense in a manner consistent with the overriding objective to deal with matter expeditiously and fairly whilst saving expense and allotting the matter an appropriate share of the court&#8217;s resources I am, on balance, satisfied that this court hearing the application for a declaration is the most effective way of dealing with the issue.    </span></p>

This decision does not alter the general position, recognised in Re B, that the appropriate forum for challenging a decision of the local authority of the kind that gives rise in this case to an application for a declaration under the inherent jurisdiction will ordinarily be by way of judicial review&#8221;.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">I have weighed into my consideration that, in the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Suffolk</span> case, the court was to address whether or not to make Special Guardianship Orders in respect of the subject children. MacDonald J observed that, as part of addressing that proposed plan, the court would be informed about the financial assistance available to the Special Guardians.  He reasoned that, where there was an overlap between that and the resolution of the children&#8217;s legal status, it was a proportionate and efficient use of court time to deal with both in the same court. I have asked myself whether, given the Applicants say that they too will be seeking a Special Guardianship Order in respect of RN, using the inherent jurisdiction to resolve the dispute with the Local Authority is also the correct route in the present case.  However: </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">This is not the situation in the present case. There are no linked care proceedings. Rather, the Applicants have issued a private law application for a Child Arrangement Order in respect of RN.  The only respondent to that application is RN&#8217;s father (FN). Leeds City Council is not a party to those proceedings.  </p>

None of them had reached adulthood.  By contrast, in the present case, RN remains a child, but TN is an adult. There are no linked family proceedings concerning TN.  Insofar as her name appears on any orders or application documents, that is legally inaccurate. I note that TN was named as a child on the inherent jurisdiction application form.  She ought not to have been. The form expressly states that it is for children only. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">I find that the circumstances of the present case are therefore materially different to the particular facts which led to MacDonald J ruling as he did in the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Suffolk</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span>case. There is an established court, namely the Administrative Court, and an established cause of action, namely judicial review, when this type of dispute arises.  Notably, when the Applicant&#8217;s Solicitors wrote to the Local Authority on 10 March 2023 setting out their case (naming both RN and TN), their letter was referred to as a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Letter before action &#8211; judicial review pre-action protocol</span>&#8221;. The Local Authority treated it as such and responded setting out their counter position.  To get the current application to the state where an informed decision can be made on the evidence would, in effect, involve using the inherent jurisdiction to replicate the same case management and hearing structure of the Administrative Court.  MacDonald J was careful to point out that his approach in the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Suffolk</span> case was in the particular circumstances of that case. He highlighted that there were care proceedings involving the same parties already afoot and relevant material already before the court in those proceedings. It is in that context that MacDonald J emphasised that he was not altering the general position, recognised by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B</span> [2013] EWCA Civ 964, that the appropriate forum for challenging a decision of the Local Authority in this type of dispute will ordinarily be by way of judicial review. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">For the reasons I have given in this Judgment, I do not consider that the facts of the present case justify departing from that ordinary approach.  It follows that this application ought not to have been issued in this court under the inherent jurisdiction.  It should have been issued in the Administrative Court. Today&#8217;s order will record that decision and go no further. Plainly, nothing I have said has any bearing on the substantive issue that divides the Applicants and the Local Authority.  It is purely a determination of the appropriate court forum to resolve their dispute. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">It follows that there is nothing which justifies a transfer to the High Court of the current private law application for a Child Arrangements Order in relation to RN under Case No LS22P01169. That application should proceed in the Magistrates Court as had been intended. That court is the correct tier of court to decide that issue, applying s.1 of the Children Act 1989, not least in circumstances where the Father is not taking any active role in opposing the application. </p>
