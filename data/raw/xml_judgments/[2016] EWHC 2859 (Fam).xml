Last year, she was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer and now she is a hospital inpatient.  Unfortunately, active treatment came to an end in August.  JS is now receiving palliative care and she knows that she will soon die.  Her case has come before the court because of the novel issues it raises and, particularly, because JS&#8217;s parents are not in agreement about what is to happen after her death.</span></p>

For most of her life she has lived with her mother in the London area, and she has had no face-to-face contact with her father since 2008.  For reasons that I need not describe, the relationship between the parents is very bad.  Late last year, the father, who himself has cancer, became aware of JS&#8217;s condition.  He brought proceedings to be allowed to see her, but in December 2015 these ended with an order that he should have written contact only.  The local authority was granted a Family Assistance Order in order to manage the indirect contact, and so JS has a social worker.  JS has herself refused any contact with her father and does not want him to have detailed knowledge of her medical condition.  </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The scientific theory underlying cryonics is speculative and controversial, and there is considerable debate about its ethical implications.  On the other hand, cryopreservation, the preservation of cells and tissues by freezing, is now a well-known process in certain branches of medicine, for example the preservation of sperm and embryos as part of fertility treatment.  Cryonics is cryopreservation taken to its extreme.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:12pt">Since the first cryonic preservation in the 1960s, the process has been performed on very few individuals, numbering in the low hundreds.  There are apparently two commercial organisations in the United States and one in Russia.  The costs are high, or very high, depending on the level of research into the subject&#8217;s case that is promised.  The most basic arrangement (which has been chosen here) simply involves the freezing of the body in perpetuity.  Even that will cost in the region of &#163;37,000, according to the evidence in this case &#8211; about ten times as much as an average funeral.  Although JS&#8217;s family is not well-off, her maternal grandparents have raised the necessary funds. </span></p>

She is described by her experienced solicitor as a bright, intelligent young person who is able to articulate strongly held views on her current situation.  Her social worker says that she has pursued her investigations with determination, even though a number of people have tried to dissuade her, and that she has not been coerced or steered by her family or anyone else.</span></p>

I&#8217;m only 14 years old and I don&#8217;t want to die, but I know I am going to.  I think being cryo-preserved gives me a chance to be cured and woken up, even in hundreds of years&#8217; time.  I don&#8217;t want to be buried underground.  I want to live and live longer and I think that in the future they might find a cure for my cancer and wake me up.  I want to have this chance.

The body must be prepared within a very short time of death, ideally within minutes and at most within a few hours.  Arrangements then have to be made for it to be transported by a registered funeral director to the premises in the United States where it is to be stored.  These bridging arrangements are offered in the UK for payment by a voluntary non-profit organisation of cryonics enthusiasts, who are not medically trained.  Evidently, where the subject dies in hospital, the cooperation of the hospital is necessary if the body is to be prepared by the volunteers.  This situation gives rise to serious legal and ethical issues for the hospital trust, which has to act within the law and has duties to its other patients and to its staff.  </span></p>

On 5 October, at my request, a meeting took place between a representative of the voluntary organisation and the doctors, nurses and other representatives of the hospital trust.  I have read a note of the meeting, which reviews all the practical aspects of the plan and shows the careful thought that the Trust has given to the matter at a senior level.  The outcome is that the hospital is willing to do what it properly can to cooperate for the sake of JS, because the prospect of her wishes being followed will reduce her agitation and distress about her impending death.  The decision centres entirely on what is best for JS.  The Trust is not endorsing cryonics: on the contrary, all the professionals feel deep unease about it.</span></p>

No other parent has ever been put in his position.  It is not to be forgotten that he himself is facing serious illness, and is not able to discuss the matter with JS or her mother because of the extreme difficulties within the family.  At the start of the proceedings, he was opposed.  He was concerned that he might become responsible for the costs.  He also wrote:</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt"> &#8220;Even if the treatment is successful and [JS] is brought back to life in let&#8217;s say 200 years, she may not find any relative and she might not remember things and she may be left in a desperate situation given that she is only 14 years old and will be in the United States of America.&#8221;</span><span style="font-size:12pt">  Despite this, during the course of the first hearing, the father, who was then unrepresented, changed his position, saying:</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt"> &#8220;I respect the decisions she is making.  This is the last and only thing she has asked from me.  I would like to have written confirmation that I will not have to pay the costs as I have cancer and I live on benefits.&#8221;</span><span style="font-size:12pt">  However, by the second hearing, the father was legally represented and his position had changed again.  He said that he was prepared to agree to what JS wanted on four conditions: that he and other members of his family could view her body after death; that the mother would not pursue any financial claims against him; that the mother and her family would not make any contact with him and his family; and that he would not be pursued for any contribution to the costs of the cryonic process.  The father&#8217;s last statement at this hearing was that he wants the court to know that he respects JS, and that he will respect the court&#8217;s decision.</span></p>

If she was 18, she would be able to make a will, appointing her mother as her executor, and it would then be for the mother to make arrangements for the disposal of JS&#8217;s body, no doubt in accordance with her wishes.  However, children cannot make wills.  My approach is therefore to try to remove the disadvantage that JS is under as result of her age.  I do not intend to go further than that, as JS cannot be in a better legal position than she would be if she was an adult.  </span></p>

That is a serious conclusion, but it is justified on the exceptional facts.  The intensity of the difficulties between JS and her mother on the one hand and the father and his family on the other makes it impossible to accommodate the father&#8217;s wishes.

But where all the parties who in any event will be entitled to the property are of age and are ready to argue the case, the reason of the rule departs, and it becomes a bare technicality. The reason of the rule is this, that the Court will not decide on future rights, because until the event happens it does not know who may be interested in arguing the question, and therefore may be shutting out parties who, when the event happens, may be entitled to succeed, but where they are all of age, and every possible party is represented before the Court, as I said before, utility seems to say that there should be a power to determine their rights, as is the case in Scotland and in many other countries.&#8221;</span></p>

Obvious examples of that, which are very familiar in the Chancery Division, are a decision by trustees to sell a family estate or to sell a controlling holding in a family company. In such circumstances there is no doubt at all as to the extent of the trustees' powers nor is there any doubt as to what the trustees want to do but they think it prudent and the court will give them their costs of doing so to obtain the court's blessing on a momentous decision. &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

To use the words of Jessel MR, it might be argued that a present right depends on the decision, in that JS&#8217;s present welfare cannot be adequately protected by the court refusing to entertain the question, whether the right is expressed in terms of Article 8 ECHR or otherwise.  It can certainly be said that there are other special circumstances to satisfy the court that it is desirable at once to decide on the future rights.  Then, to use the words of Robert Walker J, there is no real doubt about the way in which the power would be exercised, or about the momentous nature of the decision.  There is no likelihood of a change of circumstances and all interested parties are before the court.  I find that the power exists and that, taking account of all the considerations listed at paragraphs 35 and 36 above, it should be exercised in this case.</span></p>

Together, they demonstrate the existence of jurisdiction applying to a continuum, from the beginning of life until after its end.  While the former is directed to the living and the latter to the dead, s.16 of the Judicature Act draws no distinction between aspects of the inherent jurisdiction.  The existence of the continuum favours this Court&#8217;s ability to do such things as are necessary to protect the interests of the living child, after death.  </span></p>

Provided that there is justification for the view that an order is required, while JSB is alive, to protect his best interests after death, I hold that the inherent jurisdiction can be used to make such an order.  The fact that any order might deal with a topic at the intersection of the two relevant aspects of the inherent jurisdiction is, in my view, irrelevant.  The continuum approach militates against a sharp distinction between different aspects of the Court&#8217;s jurisdiction.
