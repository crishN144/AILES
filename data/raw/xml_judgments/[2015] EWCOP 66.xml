		    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.5in">&#8220;It appears that Rosemary&#8217;s sons have neglected their mother&#8217;s needs in relation to her heath and wellbeing by allowing the home to fall into a poor state of repair, and not following recommendations made by the community mental health and adults social care to arrange support and care at home. In fact, it seems that they moved in with her for a short period, but then moved out leaving her alone in a home with no hot running water, and a large dog to care for. Gary&#8217;s suggestion that he live with his mother was considered, but ruled out for these reasons. Furthermore Rosemary would not benefit from seeing other family members if her son lived in the family home as some family members have stated they would be uncomfortable if Gary were present due to conflict and alleged threats of violence from him.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.5in">&#8220;I&#8217;m writing this statement regarding the power of attorney of my mother Rosemary. I would like to express my concerns on this matter, on the relationship between me and my brothers over the last several years. Whilst my brother Julian was living at my mum&#8217;s address there was several incidents regarding the police, causing my mother mental stress due to unnecessary behaviour due to heavy drinking leading to violence, causing my mum to be walking the streets at 11 o&#8217;clock pm at night, and my son having to pick her up on occasions as she was too scared to return to her own home.</p>

		    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.5in">Shortly after this Julian and girlfriend left the home, which then my older brother Gary moved into. After a short while of living there at the property, he decided to strip the bathroom to pieces and replace the bath with a shower. But instead left her with no washing facilities i.e. bath, no hot water, no central heating for several weeks. He also had a dog at the home which was locked upstairs in a box room with no water or food and my mum was expected to look after at 80 years of age, i.e. walk her, buy food etc, which the dog belongs to Julian and did not take her from home when he left. The dog was very underweight to the point of seeing her ribs. This was very upsetting to see. </p>

		    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.5in">Shortly after this Gary and my mum had an argument regarding payment of the bathroom which caused him to move out leaving my mum to live in this condition. Therefore myself and my family felt we needed to take over these matters. We went in and cleaned the house which was in a very bad condition and not a place for a lady of her age to live. My daughter Sherrie took the dog away from the home and to this day still has her.</p>

		    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.5in">Shortly around Christmas time my mum started to become unwell where her legs became swollen and breathing problems, and was admitted to Kettering Hospital, where heart failure was diagnosed. A meeting was arranged. We all attended and a decision was made for my mum to go into a care home. But my brother Gary wanted to look after her at home, but we all felt this would not be the right move for her. My mum went to [the care home] in Kettering and has been there since.</p>

		    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following a call from my brother Julian, I was informed he was given power of attorney years ago, which during all this time I was not aware of. I contacted Diana Batts at Kettering Hospital (care worker) to inform her of this.</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.5in">These are just a few of events and abuse that my mum and myself had sustained in a short period of time. This is why I feel very strongly that this matter of power of attorney, the selling of her belongings out of the home and trying to rent the house out was a very premature situation. My poor mum, as I know to this day, has been left with a handful of clothes and a few photos from her home, which is nothing to show for 82 years of life. I feel the power of attorney should be taken over by the authorities. Many thanks to whom this concerned.&#8221;</p>

The rate of interest required to generate a similar level of gross income would be around 5.5%.</p>

According to Gary, his mother never insured it, though he was highly critical of the letting agency for not insuring it now, despite a promise to do so. </p>

However, as soon as she was &#8216;becoming&#8217; mentally incapable of making such decisions, Julian had a duty to apply to the Office of the Public Guardian to register the EPA, so that he could make these decisions on her behalf and act in her best interests.</p>

A consciously unwise decision will rarely, if ever, be made in P&#8217;s best interests.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.25in">There was an extensive period from the end of June 2014 until 20 July 2015 when Julian&#8217;s authority as attorney under the EPA extended to making sure that his mother&#8217;s property was fully insured, and this includes the period when the application to register the EPA had been made, when in most other respects the attorney&#8217;s powers are suspended until the instrument is registered. Paragraph 1(2)(a) of Schedule 4 to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> states that &#8220;where the attorney has made an application for registration of the instrument then, until it is registered, the attorney may take action under the power to maintain the donor or prevent loss to his estate.&#8221; But, again, Julian did nothing. Even his application to register the EPA was reactive, rather than proactive, and seems to have been prompted by the Council&#8217;s application to the court in May 2015 for the appointment of a deputy.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.25in">During the hearing Gary produced a blue plastic bag full of papers. This came as a complete surprise, not only to me, but also to the Council representatives and Mr Kingerley. Apparently, these papers related to debts in his mother&#8217;s name, which Gary claimed had been incurred not by her, but by his sister, Lisa.  They are mainly catalogue debts and he reckoned that they total about &#163;10,000.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.25in">This is where the hostility between the siblings is likely to have an adverse impact on the proper administration of Rosemary&#8217;s estate. It may be necessary to commence legal proceedings against Lisa or, at the very least, to reach an out-of-court settlement and repayment plan regarding these debts. I am sure it would be in Rosemary&#8217;s best interests for an independent third party to handle these delicate negotiations rather than either of her sons, by whom Lisa clearly feels bullied and intimidated.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.25in">There is one further point. Attorneys cannot usually delegate their authority to someone else. They must carry out their duties personally. Of course, they may seek professional or expert advice when appropriate (for example, investment advice from a financial adviser or legal advice from a solicitor), but they cannot as a rule allow someone else to make a decision that they have been appointed to make. I was left with the distinct impression that Julian had delegated his decision-making functions to his brother, Gary, which may be yet another illustration of his inertia.</p>

I shall also make an order appointing Barry Rogers of Tollers Solicitors as Rosemary&#8217;s deputy for property and affairs.</p>
