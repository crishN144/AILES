Their relationship was violent and abusive.   They didn&#8217;t supervise A properly.  She didn&#8217;t have proper boundaries.  For a time A was living with her father.   He gave her cigarettes.   A said she used and dealt cannabis.   A&#8217;s behaviour went downhill.  She often went missing.   Social workers were worried that she was at risk of sexual exploitation.  They said she was beyond the control of her parents.   </p>

A&#8217;s mother agreed to her being voluntarily accommodated in foster placements.   However, A found it difficult to comply with rules in her foster homes and went missing again.   So she was placed in a residential unit in Shropshire where she was able to get some therapeutic parenting.  While there A had to go to hospital a number of times because she was self-harming. </p>

The parents accept that and did not oppose the court making an order placing A in the interim care of the local authority.  This meant that the local authority was able to exercise parental responsibility for A. </p>

At this point that couldn&#8217;t happen, not least because he was in prison.    In reality though, neither of A&#8217;s parents have been able to look after her safely, given her risky behaviour. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.49in;text-indent:0.12in">Another placement was found for A in Somerset.  This was an unregulated placement staffed by MJ Staffing.  The social workers considered a plan for A to live with her aunt but this was not thought to be safe because of A&#8217;s recent behaviour at her placement.  This included assaulting staff and going missing.   So </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.49in;text-indent:0.12in">Because the placement in Somerset and later placements have all involved 24/7 supervision of A and the need to be able to lock doors and windows to stop her going missing, I have made a series of DOLs orders authorising those restrictions on her liberty.    These have been reviewed regularly and particularly when placements have changed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.49in;text-indent:0.12in">The court appointed a psychologist, Dr Jefferis, to do a report to understand why A was behaving as she was and to suggest what might be done to help her.  Unfortunately, A refused to meet with Dr Jefferis but he was able to do a report based on the information he had.   He thought that A&#8217;s psychological make up was extremely concerning.  He said she is a profoundly disturbed young person who would routinely place herself at risk if not kept in a tightly regulated environment.   She showed aggression, defiance and contempt towards her mother. Behaviour at school led to her being excluded.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.49in;text-indent:0.12in">Dr Jefferis thought A&#8217;s problems started at an early age and was caused by poor attachments with her parents and exposure to their drug use, parental conflict, domestic abuse and multiple carers.    A had painful feelings of sadness, selfdoubt, insecurity, resentment and anger which came out in her risky behaviours.   Her anger, dysregulation and problems forming close relationships results from her distress and lack of secure attachments.  It is important that A understands this is not her fault.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.49in;text-indent:0.12in">Dr Jefferis thought that A&#8217;s parents, while being well-intentioned, would not be able to meet her needs for safety and boundaries.  As there was no viable family placement, Dr Jefferis thought that a residential placement was the only option that could realistically meet A&#8217;s needs.    He saw a need to meet some very basic aims of improving A&#8217;s trust of those around her and to become less defensive.  He hoped this would enable her to move on and regulate (control) her emotions and behaviours and develop resilience and self-esteem.  Over time there could be therapeutic interventions.  He could not see a situation in which A would be able to return to her parents, but contact with them and her aunt was important. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.49in;text-indent:0.12in">On 16 April 2019 A was moved to another placement, this time in the New Forest.  A seemed to settle better in this placement but it was a 90-day crisis placement and A would need to be moved to another placement on 15 July 2019.   It was hoped this would be a permanent placement. </p>

At the end of the New Forest placement she was moved to another unregulated placement in Weymouth supported initially by Serenity Welfare and then Quayside Childcare (and another agency, Medgen, for three days while Quayside underwent staff training). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.49in;text-indent:0.12in">As we can see, by August A had already had a number of changes of placement, from foster placements in August 2018, then to Shropshire until January, then Somerset until April, then New Forest until July and then Weymouth.   Two of those placements had been unregulated.  The need for a permanent placement was crucial if the progress that Dr Jefferis (and everybody else) hoped for was to be achieved. </p>

A attended a hearing on 27 August to approve DOLs at this new placement.  At that point the plan was for a permanent regulated placement with Cambian in Plymouth.  An assessment by Cambian was planned for 29 August.  That was cancelled by Cambian at short notice (in fact no notice &#8211; A, her mother the social worker and Quayside staff were waiting for Cambian to arrive).  Cambian apologised for the lack of communication. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.49in;text-indent:0.12in">I should stress at this point that the social worker and her team manager (for whose professionalism and dedication I have the greatest respect) had been working tirelessly with the commissioning team to find a permanent placement for A.    They had constantly been putting out literally hundreds of enquiries to possible providers around the country to try and find something suitable.  It was not that Dorset were unwilling to find or fund a permanent placement.  It was simply that nothing could be found. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.49in;text-indent:0.12in">Late on the evening of Friday 13 September 2019 a decision was taken by senior management at the local authority (not, I hasten to add the social worker or team manager, who knew nothing about it until the following Monday) to move A temporarily to a caravan park in Bridport.     At the time A was enjoying a planned contact with her mother at a cinema.   When she came out of the cinema she was told that she was going to be visited by an out of hours (OOH) social worker at 10pm.   At that point she was not told why.  Her immediate worry was that something had happened to her father and that he might have died.   She had never been visited by a social worker at that time of night before. </p>

She and her carers say she was told that a young boy aged 9, B, was in need, potentially coming out of hospital that evening and needing 3:1 support.   A was asked whether she would help them &#8220;resolve the situation&#8221; by moving to a holiday home with her carers for the weekend for three nights (including that night) returning on Monday.   A did not feel she had much choice but to agree. </p>

A was worried about the belongings she had left there, although she was later reassured they had been removed and stored.    A refused to go back to Bridport and asked again to stay with her mother.  There was then an argument between A and her mother as result of which A contacted Quayside staff to collect her, which they did at about midnight from a friend&#8217;s house. </p>

In her letter to me of 24 September the Director explained that B has complex needs including disabilities and had selfharmed.    He needed a high level of staff support.   The damage done by him meant the property had to be vacated immediately.  As this happened late on a Friday there were limited options.  A and B were the only two young people in unregulated placements using Dorset properties.  It was decided (it would seem by the Director herself) to ask A to move out while repairs were done to the property B had been in.  The Director says that A was told only that a placement was needed for a young boy who was unwell.  No details were given of age (although my understanding is the staff also believed he was 9) or what &#8216;unwell&#8217; meant.  A was reassured she would still be able to do her activities such as horse-riding. </p>

There are growing concerns around child sexual exploitation, County Lines and other forms of criminal exploitation as risks for these young people.  The need for regulated placements is likely to increase.   Social workers work tirelessly (and some silly hours) trying to find placements.  When they turn up they are seized upon.  Sometimes it has taken so long and trust has so broken down that it can be difficult to move young people on.   </p>
