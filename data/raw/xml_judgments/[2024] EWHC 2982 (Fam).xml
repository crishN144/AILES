	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Judges and magistrates of the Family Court are called upon every day to make difficult, sometimes life-changing, decisions involving children and their families; they work in increasingly challenging circumstances.  In fulfilment of their public duties, they preside over and decide cases in accordance with their judicial oath, without fear or favour, affection or ill-will.  These judges are entitled to expect that they can undertake their demanding work peaceably and without fear of intimidation or threats of violence; there are simply no circumstances whatsoever in which they should be expected to tolerate abuse arising from their work, either in or out of the court room.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Everyday, many hundreds of people visit the Family Courts up and down the country, either to work or to participate in court proceedings.  Whether they are members of HMCTS court staff, or lay parties (many of whom are vulnerable, and anxious and upset as they attend court), witnesses, or lawyers or other professionals, each of them is entitled to expect that that they will be treated with respect while at court.  They are also all entitled to expect that the court will be a safe place to be, and that they will be free from any form of abuse, intimidation, or aggression.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I make these important points to set a context for the notice of application which I am required to determine today; by that application, it is alleged that Mr Greg Hazeltine, a party to family law litigation, behaved repeatedly in a manner which warrants findings of contempt in the face of the court.  The formal notice (dated 3 September 2024) alleges altogether nine separate contempts within proceedings under the&#160;Children Act 1989 and Family Law Act 1996 over the course of three court hearings in the Family Court in Milton Keynes in 2023.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application has been issued by the court of its own motion under rule 37.6 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010.  The application was drafted by, and issued on the instruction of, the Family Presiding Judge for the relevant part of the South Eastern Circuit at the material time, Mr Justice Williams.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At an earlier directions hearing, on 4 October 2024, I ordered that Mr Hazeltine must attend the final hearing in person.  I subsequently received, via his solicitor, medical evidence concerning Mr Hazeltine which caused me to vary the order, and I required him to attend this hearing by video-link.  He has done so from prison; he is currently serving a sentence of three years&#8217; imprisonment for offences which are described more fully below.   It was necessary to vacate an earlier listed final hearing of this application (1 November 2024) when Mr Hazeltine was moved from one prison to another on the day before the hearing, and no video-facility was available for Mr Hazeltine to participate in the hearing from his new location.  </p>

The final hearing date was 3 February 2023, on which day the judge gave judgment. The judge concluded that the children should have unsupervised visiting and staying time with Mr Hazeltine, although the handovers were to take place under a degree of supervision so as to avoid conflict between the parties.  It was during this hearing that the first set of the alleged contempts occurred. These are set out as allegations 1 &amp; 2 below.</p>

So you can deal with the contempt of court now.&#8221; When the Recorder continued giving judgment he further interrupted saying: &#8220;I told you what the thing was... I can't make it no clearer. I Greg Hazeltine will not be sticking to what you have agreed&#8230;&#8221;  He further interrupted and was abusive about [Ms T] saying: &#8220;well, you are wasting your time. You have wasted the court's time. You wasted the whole day in Luton, because we questioned [XXX], you then found fault with him, but now you want to ignore that fault. I proved him and [XXX] to be a liar, my son was punished and my daughter, that [XXX] will never forgive his mother for just so she is aware of that and for what? He got punished for nothing for a lying piece of rubbish.&#8221;  Shortly after this he again interrupted the Judge and was rude and abusive saying: &#8220;let her fuck him up.  He is going to fuck him up.  So let her put him in whatever school she wants. Whatever suits her.&#8221;  Shortly after this, he repeatedly interrupted the Judge asking &#8220;when am I next picking my children up?&#8221;  In behaving in this way he impeded the delivery of a judgment causing upset and inconvenience to the Court and the other participants, and was disrespectful and rude to a member of the judiciary who was undertaking his public duties.</p>

I will not be abiding by that order and I want to thank you and I thank that piece of shit there for reminding me of who I was 15 years ago&#8230; you'll get the 15 year ago Greg, Enjoy&#8221;.  In referring to the &#8220;15 year ago Greg&#8221; he was referring to, and intended to refer those present to, his conviction for GBH in 2008, and to cause them to be fearful of what he might do to them at or after the hearing.</p>

Mr Hazeltine then became visibly agitated, challenging the order and shouting, interrupting the Judge and becoming more animated and aggressive in his tone and language. He told him to &#8220;be a man&#8221; and &#8220;stand there and make some proper decisions&#8221;, that he hoped the Judge never had children because he was a piece of shit and didn't care about children. Mr Hazeltine was angry and shouting numerous expletives including &#8220;that is why you lot are pieces of shit scum.&#8221;  Recorder Patel pressed the panic alarm and informed him that the hearing was coming back, to which he responded that it wasn't, and said &#8220;why don't you come here? Let's go outside. Call security like you did last time, you fucking weasel&#8221; to the Judge when he stood to leave the courtroom.  As a result of his behaviour, the Judge has been apprehensive, much more aware of his surroundings at Court and generally more alert to his personal security and fearful of being approached and being the subject of reprisals from him.</p>

After Recorder Patel had left the courtroom he said &#8220;I hope you don't ever have kids, you piece of shit&#8221; directed towards counsel.  Due to his aggressive attitude, counsel feared that he was going to punch him and was anxious and found it difficult to continue to represent the mother after Mr Hazeltine had left the courtroom.</p>

I further accept that he was frustrated at the delays in the process, particularly as those delays impacted on the arrangements for him to maintain and develop his relationship with his two children.  Although I have focused on three court hearings, I accept that he had attended altogether ten or more court hearings over a period of more than two and a half years; I acknowledge that he has felt unfairly disadvantaged at court hearings on occasions when he has been (almost entirely throughout) unrepresented, when the mother of his children has been represented by both experienced counsel and solicitors; I bear in mind that he now finds himself without any contact at all with his two children;</p>

This in fact had not proceeded at the time of these events by reason of Mr Hazeltine&#8217;s lack of co-operation but has since been undertaken.  Mr Hazeltine&#8217;s neurodiversity had been acknowledged by Recorder Patel who had himself expressed concern about Mr Hazeltine&#8217;s &#8220;emotional dysregulation&#8221; and &#8220;difficulty in thought processes&#8221;; </p>
