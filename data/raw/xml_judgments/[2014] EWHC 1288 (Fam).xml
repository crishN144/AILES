He should understand that the court does not operate as some kind of advisory bureau.  If he wishes to make an application to the court to adjourn a hearing which has been regularly fixed then he must comply with the rules.  The fact that he is a litigant in person does not mean that any further latitude in relation to compliance with the rules is afforded to him than to a represented litigant.  There is, in this court, not one rule for the rich and one rule for the poor. </span></p>

However, that is to misunderstand the judicial process.  An order will very often go wider than the terms of a Judgment and will reflect Rulings made in the proceedings along the way.  In this case the Judge made a number of Rulings along the way which were not then reiterated in his Judgment.  However, it was, of course, appropriate and necessary that those Rulings were reflected in the Judge's order.  I have been given a clip of correspondence between Ryder J's clerk and Mr. Swift in relation to the drawing up and perfection of the order.  For these purposes I need only refer to the email from the Judge's temporary clerk dated 6</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> March 2013, which reads: </span></p>

Even if this were true, that would not be a basis for setting aside any orders.  It might be a basis for variation of future liability, but no such application has been made.  It is, in my view, a completely misconceived basis on which to mount a challenge to the validity of the existing orders to suggest that the wife, who acts in the form of a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">de facto</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> trustee for child maintenance, has, in fact, used the maintenance for other purposes.  The court does not stand as some kind of policing official as to how child maintenance is deployed.  But, beyond those statements of principle is the fact that there is no evidence to support Captain Wilmot's allegation.  Mere assertion in paras. 19 and 20 do not come anywhere near establishing the veracity of his allegation.  For these reasons I reject as meritless his second basis of challenge as expressed in the application notice. </span></p>

Receivership, as a process, is inevitably expensive because the receiver is usually an accountant charging hourly rates of some size.  However, in this case, the default of the husband, in relation to what is child maintenance largely, has been extreme and it is obvious that he has put in the past, and will put in the future, every conceivable obstacle in the way to frustrate implementation of the court's order.  It is worth him reflecting, however, that when the court makes an order the owner of that order is not the wife, it is the court.

The third reason is to capture costs orders for which Mr. Swift will shortly be applying, which are the costs that have been expended by the wife since the autumn of 2013 in trying to enforce the orders which I have mentioned.  Those costs, including the costs of the attendance of Mr. Swift and Miss Judd today, come to &#163;47,185.

His reason for not paying is inexcusable.  Indeed, inasmuch as the wife has been paid in the past to some extent that is only due to successful application by the court of its powers under the Attachment of Earnings Act.  In these circumstances I have no hesitation in granting the order to appoint a receiver over the husband's assets.  Two candidates have been put up and, for reasons which have been explained to me, the preference of the wife is, in fact, for the slightly more experienced, but concomitantly slightly more expensive, CCW Recovery Solutions LLP of Tunbridge Wells, of which the receiver would be Mr. Newman.  In those circumstances, having read the affidavit in support of the application, I am satisfied that Mr. Newman would be an appropriate person to exercise the powers of receivership in this case.  I therefore grant that application. </span></p>

It would be a wholly inappropriate act for the court not to extend the freezing order to cover the period of the receivership so I therefore extend the freezing order for a further 12 months.
