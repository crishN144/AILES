	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I will describe the scale and frequency of the assaults later.  At this point, I would only say that I doubt that even if Freud or Jung were alive today and able to advise me, that they would be able to give me an explanation for conduct that is so completely at variance with any understanding of human nature, conduct which has no basis rational or irrational, so it seems to me, but which violates the most basic and elemental taboos which govern our society.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The issue I have to decide is the scale or degree of the mother&#8217;s knowledge or suspicion of what the father was doing in the tiny house in where they were living with the father&#8217;s mother.  I refer to the scale of the mother&#8217;s knowledge or suspicion because the mother through her Leading Counsel agrees that by virtue of hearing a loud bang in the bedroom of that house in November or December 2013 following which she was implausibly told by the father that A had banged her head on the cot, she should have realised that A was being abused.  </span></p>

	  <num style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">That event had followed a series of injuries to A which the mother had observed, namely a graze to her back, grazes on her palms, a bruise to her cheek, a haemorrhage to her eye, blood on her bib and scratches to her ears.  So it is not very surprising, therefore, that when the bang happened and the mother was peddled a ludicrous explanation by the father, that her alarm bells sounded or should have sounded.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">On the mother&#8217;s own case (and I will have to decide if her own case is true or whether it has been significantly underplayed), by the time of the bang she must have known or at least very strongly suspected that something was seriously amiss.  Yet even taking her own case at its highest and taking her case in her favour, she did nothing to protect her daughter.  Rather, when the balloon went up and the investigations began, she went out of her way to lie and dissemble not only to protect just herself but the father also.  Why, when her suspicions must have been sky high on her own case, she did nothing to protect the person who surely was the most important to her in the world, is another unfathomable mystery which I doubt we will ever get to the bottom of.</span></p>

I denied it at the time because I didn&#8217;t want it to be true.  I hated and I can&#8217;t understand how I could possibly still have feelings for this person, for someone who has harmed my daughter.  He was right, I do hate him for what he has done and I am angry at him and hurt and sickened.  It isn&#8217;t a lie or an act when I say this.  I hate that deep down.  I hate that deep down I still feel care for him.  I feel ashamed that I do.  I feel a bad person for this and I&#8217;ve asked myself many times how I have betrayed my daughter very much by meeting up with him.  I feel like I don&#8217;t deserve her now because of my silly actions the last three weeks.  I clearly have not been thinking straight like I should have been.

At all events, the mother fell pregnant shortly after the relationship began in January 2013.

There were regular arguments, occasional acts of violence both ways and regular storming out of the home by the mother only for her to return, usually after a few hours.  This immature and dystopic conduct happened both before and after A&#8217;s birth.  Although the reasons for it are, I think, only of marginal relevance, I am satisfied that the root causes were the mother&#8217;s controlling, solipsistic and needy character.  She certainly knew how to wind the father up and seems to have taken pleasure in doing so by acts of deliberate provocation.  Thus she would watch pornography or pictures of handsome young men even though she knew that this would upset the father considerably.  I have also little doubt that she was in their relationship highly didactic if not dictatorial.</span></p>

Again, this signifies to me that the mother was, if not fundamentally then to an important extent, both selfish and self-centred, and no doubt the pressures built up on the father from many angles.  But none of this (to state the obvious) provides any kind of excuse or even a reason for what he did to his beloved and beautiful daughter.</span></p>

He told her that the graze to the palms had been caused when she caught both hands in the lattice work of a plastic laundry basket.  He told her that the bruise on the cheek was caused when he hit her head on his collar bone.  He told her that the haemorrhage to the eye was caused by A herself with her own finger.  He told her that the blood on the bib came from naturally bleeding gums.  The grazes to the ears were explained as deriving from dry skin.

However, it is not so much that the mother and the father sought to deceive the Court and all the professionals about the resumption of their relationship that strikes me as relevant for these purposes, but the fact that they resumed their relationship at all.  That tells me a great deal about the mother&#8217;s inclination to put her relationship with this abusive person ahead of her responsibilities to her child;</span></p>

The walls are thin and noise carries from room to room almost as if there were not a wall there.
