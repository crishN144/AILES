	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">SL was born on 17 September 1956 and is now 60.  She has two brothers, IL and NL and previously lived with them and her mother in housing association accommodation.  She has been diagnosed as having schizophrenia and obsessive compulsive disorder.  She first came to the attention of mental health/social services professionals in around 2012 when there were concerns about self-neglect.  Her mother died in 2014 and it appears that her condition deteriorated to such an extent that on 12 March 2015 she was admitted to hospital, initially under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> (the MHA).  At that point she had ulcerated sores on her legs which were a cause of concern.  She remained detained under section 3 MHA until her discharge on 9 November 2015.  She was then moved to supported living accommodation where she remains.  She is subject to a community treatment order (CTO) as she has a history of not taking her medication. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">An application was made by the London Borough of Brent (the Applicant) for an order authorising the deprivation of liberty occasioned by her care regime using the streamlined procedure in form COP DOL10 under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> (MCA).  SL has been consistent in her wish to return home but it is the Applicant&#8217;s case that it would not be in her best interests to do so.  The application was made on 8 April 2016.  An initial order was made on 12 April 2016 appointing a rule 3A representative.  The matter came before District Judge Batten on 12 May 2016 who was not satisfied that the application was suitable to be dealt with under the streamlined procedure and she gave directions for a hearing.  The first hearing, listed for 15 June 2016, had to be adjourned because there had been a failure to comply with the order of 12 May.  At the hearing on 12 July 2016 an order was made inviting the Official Solicitor to act on SL&#8217;s behalf and a section 49 report was ordered to address SL&#8217;s capacity to conduct these proceedings and make decisions as to her residence, care and treatment and to enter into a tenancy agreement.  A further directions hearing listed for 24 August 2016 had to be vacated because although the Official Solicitor had confirmed that his acceptance criteria were met he had indicated that he was not yet in a position to allocate the case or retain a solicitor.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By the time of the hearing on 23 November 2016 it had become apparent that given the complexity of the issue of capacity it would be necessary to obtain a report from an independent expert.  Dr Hugh Series, Consultant Old Age Psychiatrist was instructed.  Further consequential directions were given and this hearing was listed.  On receipt of Dr Series&#8217; report dated 27 January 2017 SL&#8217;s solicitors and NL put a number of questions to him which he answered in a document dated 13 February 2017.</p>

In his response to the questions posed on behalf of SL he leaves the matter for the court to decide.  At the hearing on 24 February 2017 counsel for SL invited me to decide the matter as a preliminary issue.  I have the position statements from the Applicant and counsel instructed by the Official Solicitor on behalf of SL.  I was told that the Official Solicitor&#8217;s position on this issue was neutral but capacity to litigate is clearly central to the way in which these proceedings are conducted.</p>

He records that SL has had schizophrenia since at least 2012 and that she does not accept that she grossly neglected her own care before her admission to hospital.  He assessed her as unable to understand or weigh up all the relevant information in relation to her own needs, both mental and physical or to weigh up the pros and cons of different types of accommodation as well as treatment and care in the community following hospital discharge.</p>

He reviewed SL on 11 August 2016 and was aware of the court proceedings at that point.  He notes that she understands that she is receiving treatment for schizophrenia whilst believing that she does not have the illness.  She told him that she took the medicine prescribed because she was, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;&#8230; not allowed to refuse it&#8217; </span>[F8].  He was of the opinion that she lacked capacity to enter into a tenancy agreement and make decisions about her care because she does not understand the concerns which led to the decision that it was in her best interests to live in supported accommodation rather than return home.  He also concluded that she lacked capacity to conduct these proceedings because, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;&#8230; she does not understand the basis of such proceedings, as she is preoccupied by the fact that she would prefer to live at home&#8230; she was not able to explain what the aim was for the Court of Protection despite giving a brief explanation and the reasons behind why such proceedings would take place&#8217; </span>[F8].<span style="font-style:italic"/>  He concludes that, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;&#8230; although she retains capacity in making decisions around medical treatment, she does not have capacity to make decisions around her overall care and treatment which includes residential placement&#8217;</span> [F9].</p>

Dr Hugh Series was instructed and his report is dated 27 January 2017.  His opinion is that, on the balance of probability SL is suffering from paranoid schizophrenia which is a recognised mental disorder.  At paragraph 7.1.5 he says that, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;&#8230; schizophrenia is a condition which interferes with the process of thought, and it can undermine a person&#8217;s ability to reason and to weigh things up appropriately.  It is common for a person to lack insight into his condition and not accept that there is anything wrong.  I found that SL did not agree that she had schizophrenia; this is also reported many times in the papers in the bundle.&#8217;</span></p>

He considered that the refusal to accept the information was a result of her lack of insight into her illness, which is itself a result of the illness [8.1.2].  The natural result of her refusal to accept this information means that she cannot use or weigh it, although she can retain it because she has no memory problem as such.</p>

Dr Series addresses SL&#8217;s understanding of the proceedings and her reasons for objecting to their continuation.  He says that SL, intellectually <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;&#8230; has a reasonable understanding of the issues involved, and she is able to retain the information, consider it, and use or weigh that information to reach a decision.  She is able to communicate her decision&#8217;</span> [F57 para 8.5.18]<span style="font-style:italic">.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">He is clearly aware that this puts him at odds with the position as set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Sheffield CC v. E</span>.  He acknowledges that his doubt is not occasioned by any consideration that SL may have made an unwise decision but because her decision making, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;&#8230; is coloured by the emotional blunting which results from her illness, and I accept that it could be argued that this blunting has undermined her ability to weigh the relevant information properly and thereby undermined her capacity</span>&#8217;.  He records that, in part, SL&#8217;s conclusion is driven by her natural carefulness with money, which I accept is reasonable and understandable and not a result of her illness.  She is described as regretting that she has to contribute to the cost, that it has gone on so long and she does not like having to talk to people about the matters repeatedly.  Dr Series&#8217; view is that these are valid reasons for her to take into account and I accept that.  He distinguishes between a denial and a delusion and says that her belief that she can look after herself without professional help is a denial which can be seen in other cases where people are unable or unwilling to accept the reality of their situation but that does not make their belief delusional.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having considered his reports it appears that the reason for his difficulty is his struggle with the application of the legal test to the assessment he has made of SL.  I was invited to consider whether I could decide this matter on the basis of the written evidence or needed to hear oral evidence.  Dr Series felt that ultimately the question of whether SL lacks litigation capacity is a question for the court to decide.  I am satisfied that there is sufficient material in his carefully considered reports to enable me to address the matter without hearing oral evidence.  </p>

E.</span>  At paragraph 41 he refers with approval to the acceptance by the Official Solicitor that the tests for &#8216;litigation capacity&#8217; and &#8216;subject matter capacity&#8217; are not identical and that an adult who lacks the capacity to litigate may nevertheless have capacity with regard to the matters which are the subject matter of the litigation.  He expressed the view that there is no particular difficulty with such cases.  He acknowledged that someone may have the capacity to litigate in a case where the nature of the dispute and the issues are simple, whilst at the same time lacking the capacity to litigate in a case where either the nature of the dispute or the issues are more complex.   He refers to the decision of Bracewell J in <span style="font-style:italic">The NHS Trust v. Miss T</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2004/2195" uk:canonical="[2004] EWHC 2195 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWHC 2195 (Fam)</ref>.  This is a decision to which Dr Series was referred and provided with quotations from in the letter of instruction but which he was unable to trace.  I had the same problem.  I could not find it either under that citation or by a more generalised search.  However, I take into account the fact that it is a proposition which was adopted by the court.  Munby J referred to the fact that in that case Miss T, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;&#8230; did not have the capacity to litigate because she did not have the capacity to make medical treatment decisions&#8217;.</span></p>

Given that difficulty, it might be appropriate for those responsible for the letter of instruction to consider whether reference to it should be included in future instructions. Dr Series has referred to the fact that, unlike Miss T, SL is not deluded.  She has a high level of intellectual ability to understand and reason.   At paragraph 8.5.17 he says, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;The fact that SL concluded that she would rather stay where she was than spend money, time and effort in challenging the decision is likely to be affected by the apathy and emotional blunting which is a result of her illness.  If she had been a person who was subject to stronger emotions, she might have felt more strongly that she was not willing to accept a decision on accommodation that was contrary to her preference, and she might have been willing to fight more strongly and commit more of her money to the fight.  However, partly as a result of her illness, she does not feel or express emotion strongly.  This is the meaning of the expression &#8216;blunting of affect&#8217; which is a recognised feature of schizophrenia&#8217;.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A person may decide to accept a situation which is not ideal by choosing not to pursue litigation to resolve the matter on deciding that the financial and personal cost was too great.  That is a pragmatic decision and not, of itself, an indication of a lack of capacity.  In civil litigation a person may decide to settle because of the litigation risk, a wish not to incur further expenditure or because of the personal toll it is taking in terms of time and effort.  Proceedings in the Court of Protection are different.  They are inquisitorial and the court only has jurisdiction if a person lacks capacity to make one or more of the decisions in question for herself.  Initially SL&#8217;s position was that she would not want to instruct a solicitor to act for her but she also said she did not want to attend court and speak for herself.  When asked by Dr Series how her views would be communicated to the court in those circumstances, SL said that she would keep a solicitor.  She wants the proceedings to end and accepts that that would, in effect, mean that she would not be free to choose where to live.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If SL does not lack litigation capacity it is difficult to see how a solicitor instructed on her behalf could consent to an order which included a declaration that she lacked subject matter capacity.  The difficulty arises because SL does not accept that she has schizophrenia.  On that basis, it must be her case that the diagnostic test is not met.  When dealing with that specific issue in the telephone discussion with Dr Series SL said that she would not agree to an order which recorded that she had schizophrenia, that she accepted that she had neglected herself in the past, and that she agreed to continue to live where she is now.  He explained that if she was not prepared to agree some compromise this might mean that the case would continue, further costs would be incurred and there might be costs consequences for her.  Her eventual response was that she did not want to pay any more for the case.  </p>

He contrasts the position of Ms T in <span style="font-style:italic">The NHS Trust v. Ms T </span>who is recorded as having been found to lack litigation capacity because her decisions were driven by mental disorder.  He does not consider that SL&#8217;s failure to accept that her situation is as described by the Applicant necessarily indicates a lack of capacity resulting from her mental disorder.  He accepts that SL&#8217;s belief that she does not have schizophrenia, that the medication is not helping her, that she does not need the kind of support which the council considers she does coupled with her desire to return home but is prepared to stay where she is if this will bring the proceedings to an end may suggest a defect in her ability to use or weight the relevant information.  He makes it clear that his doubt is not caused by thinking that SL has reached an unwise decision but because her decision-making, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;&#8230; is coloured by the emotional blunting which results from her illness, and I accept that it could be argued that this blunting has undermined her ability to weigh the relevant information properly and thereby undermined her capacity&#8217;.</span>  [F57 paragraph 8.5.20]</p>

If it is sufficient for her to understand the matter in broad terms, then I think that she does have litigation capacity.  However, if, as suggested by Irwin Mitchell, she would need to be able to have a more detailed understanding of the various potential outcomes and their consequences, then I think that she lacks litigation capacity&#8217;.</span></p>

A decision about capacity is significant.  A finding that a person lacks capacity in relation to a specific matter means that she is deprived of the right to make decisions for herself.  That is something which adults in the general population take for granted.  It is a significant interference in a person&#8217;s right to self-determination.  </p>

During her discussion with Dr Series she understood that, if she did not wish to attend court, she would need to instruct a solicitor to do so on her behalf.  If SL does not lack litigation capacity then the instructions she would give her solicitor, on the basis of what she has said to Dr Series, are clear.  She does not accept that she has schizophrenia, she does not accept that she has neglected herself in the past.  She is willing to agree that she will continue to live where she is now to bring the proceedings to an end but she does not accept that the court should make any declaration about her residence and care.  Dr Series is satisfied that she lacks capacity to make decisions about residence and care for herself. In making my decision it is necessary to consider what is required for litigation capacity in this case.  In their questions to Dr Series following his initial report, the solicitors instructed to represent SL highlighted the nature of the decisions which SL might need to make during the proceedings.  I accept that those are a reasonable description of situations which could arise in the course of this litigation.    </p>
