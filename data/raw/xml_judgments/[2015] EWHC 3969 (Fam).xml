There was concern from at least some of the medical professionals that he may have been subject to a shaking injury but the diagnosis was undoubtedly complicated by the defect in his immune system caused by the cytomegalovirus infection. </p>

He was found to have had bilateral subdural effusions with fresh blood, which were less than a week old.  A chest x-ray showed fractures of the third and fourth ribs on the left side with a degree of healing consistent with an injury three or four weeks previously.  Again, professionals were concerned as to the possibility of non-accidental injury.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Later in June 1997, he was transferred to Bristol Children&#8217;s Hospital due to deterioration in his respiratory condition.  The case does not appear to have followed the standard pattern that family law professionals would expect today.  As far as I understand it, care proceedings were never instituted.  There was certainly never a fact finding hearing.  Although P was placed in the care of his maternal grandparents following his discharge from hospital, the care given to him by the parents was considered exemplary and he was therefore returned to their care in November 1997. </p>

L was born in February 2013 and is therefore two years of age.  The Mother then became pregnant with twins.  M and O were born in March 2015 by elective caesarean section.  M is now aged eight months.</p>

The cause of death has been determined as sudden infant death.  I make it quite clear that this is accepted by all parties.  Absolutely no blame is attached to either parent.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This may be best illustrated by the fact that, on 21st May 2015, M suffered breathing difficulties.  Fortunately, in his case, he made a rapid recovery following appropriate treatment by the parents.  He was admitted to hospital for precautionary reasons but the tests were all clear and he was discharged.  He was given an alarm.  It appears that the alarm developed a fault and he was readmitted to hospital but it was soon discovered there was nothing wrong.  I do not, however, underestimate the stress these two episodes must have caused the entire family.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On 22nd May 2015, a radiological scan revealed a healing left distal radius and ulnar metaphyseal fracture in O.  In other words, his wrist had been broken in two places, although it was the same injury.  It was dated at between one to three weeks prior to his death.  At the same time, a possible fracture to his left seventh rib was identified but this has been extensively investigated since and it is accepted that there was no such rib fracture.  Again, I ignore it completely.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In the light of this history, the Local Authority took protective action on 29th May 2015.  L and M were placed by agreement in the care of the maternal grandfather, maternal aunt and her partner.  Initially, the maternal grandmother had to move out as she was thought to be in the pool of potential perpetrators but she was later excluded from the pool and allowed to return home.  As a result of this agreement, no Interim Care Order has been made.  The parents had regular contact at a contact centre and, in the case of the Mother, contact supervised by her family members at the grandparents&#8217; home.  </p>

She did say that L found it difficult to deal with the presence of the twins and showed jealousy towards them at times. She said that L occasionally poked them, pulled their arms and legs and would often jump on them when they were in their car seats.  She did, however, add that she had been wracking her brains but could not explain the wrist fractures.</p>

He said he had gone over and over in his head how O could have sustained the wrist fractures.  He also said that L would poke at the twins and pull their arms and legs.  He added that, sometimes she pulled hard.  She would often jump on them.  Once, she crawled over O to get to a toy.  He cried but nothing appeared to be wrong.</p>

L started to play with a ten or eleven year old girl.  The girl took hold of O&#8217;s hand and arm.  She still had hold of it when she moved away.  He said that the girl yanked it so much that it made the Father move quite unexpectedly and O cried for quite a while.  He was agitated for ten minutes or maybe a bit longer.  He said he, the Father, was a very patient and calm man.</p>

He again dealt with the incident in the park, but said that the girl had hold of O&#8217;s left hand whilst L pulled the girl away.  O gave out a cry and was unsettled for around ten minutes but he thought no more of it as O had settled and appeared to be absolutely fine.  The Mother does recall him mentioning the incident but it had not stuck in his mind at the time.     </p>

In relation to the park incident, she said that she did recall the Father saying to her that a little ginger-haired girl at the park was playing with L.  She could not remember the exact conversation as she was focussing on the children.  O, in particular, seemed fine.  She added that, if O had been distressed in any way, she would have remembered and would probably have spoken to the Father about it.  She ended by saying that her recollection of the conversation is extremely vague.</p>

First, I must decide whether or not he did deliberately tell lies.  If I find that he did, I have to ask myself why he lied.  The mere fact that a witness tells a lie is not in itself evidence that the person concerned is the perpetrator of non-accidental injuries on a baby.  A witness may lie for many reasons.  They may possibly be &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">innocent</span>&#8221; ones in the sense that they do not denote responsibility for the injuries to O.  For example, they may be lies to bolster a true case; or to protect someone else; or to conceal some other disreputable conduct unrelated to the injuries caused to O; or out of panic, distress or confusion. </p>

The mechanism would be a pulling and twisting force being applied to the limb.  This type of fracture is highly indicative of non-accidental causation.  The force required to cause such an injury is well in excess of that used in normal day-to-day handling of an infant.  It is possible for such fractures to cause relatively little discomfort beyond the initial pain at the time of the occurrence, such that a non-perpetrator may be unaware of the injury.  She would have expected O to have shown immediate distress, lasting perhaps 10 &#8211; 15 minutes.  The distress would manifest itself as crying.</p>

She was asked in particular about the alleged incidents involving L and, in particular, the occasion identified by the maternal grandfather and the incident in the park with the Father.  She did, at one point, say that it all involved a lot of speculation.  I have come to the clear conclusion that she is correct.  It all depends on my eventual findings of fact.   She did say that the wrist injury suffered by O is, in general, closely associated with inflicted injury unless there is an explanation.  She stressed that, when she used the term non-accidental injury, she did not necessarily mean that there was intent to harm.  A perpetrator of such an injury would, have had to be &#8220;pretty rough&#8221; with O&#8217;s wrist.  It would not just be normal rough handling.  It would be abusive and recognised as abusive by the person concerned.</p>

To cause the injury, O would have had to have been held on/below the site of the fracture.  She made the point that, with a baby, it is virtually impossible to grip just the wrist as it is so small.  She repeated that she thought it was unlikely that a two year old could produce such force, although it would be much more likely that a fracture would occur if there was intervention by an additional adult.   There would be no fracture if L&#8217;s fingers were prised away, one by one but I accept that it all depends on exactly how it occurred.  </p>

I recognise that when serious harm is done to children, responsible adults tend to look for innocent explanations.  They can then genuinely blame themselves when it is actually illogical to do so.  I made it clear to the maternal grandfather during his evidence that he could not conceivably be to blame for opening a door.  I hope he will now accept that.</p>

I further accept that L had a toddler&#8217;s tantrum and threw herself on to O, probably because he was in her old car seat.  Initially, the maternal grandfather thought that this might have caused the broken rib but it did not and it could not have done.  Then he thought it might have caused the broken wrist.  Again, I find that it did not and it could not have done.  I accept the expert evidence that a two year old is not strong enough to do so on her own.  The Mother and the Father&#8217;s recollection of this incident is virtually non-existent.  There is a reason for that.  It was not serious.  Indeed, the Father may have been in the kitchen.  Nobody thought it appropriate to investigate whether any serious damage had been done to O&#8217;s wrist.  No-one considered taking him to a doctor.  This is because there was no serious injury.</p>

She is a trained physiotherapist, working with children on a regular basis.  She would have ensured O came to no serious harm as she removed L from the car seat.  At best, the grandfather says that L grabbed O&#8217;s arms as she was moved away and her little fingers had to be &#8220;prised&#8221; away one by one from O.  This would not have caused the fracture.  I accept this may have distressed O but I am quite sure that it was not because he had his wrist broken.  The grandfather said, poignantly, that he did not think he appreciated how serious it could have been.  The Father told me it was not a standout incident for him because he could not remember it.  The Mother said she could not recall it although she does remember having to pull L off O.  I do not consider this would have been the case if a wrist had been broken.

The incident described by the maternal aunt&#8217;s partner was outside the timeframe as it took place on 20th April.  I consider all the other occasions on which L was boisterous do not get close to establishing a broken wrist. I remind myself that M had no injuries.  I do not consider L was a danger to these twins.  If she had been, responsible adults would have ensured she was nowhere near them.  </p>

On his case, this had occurred only three weeks earlier on 2nd May.  He told me he was racking his brains to think how the broken wrist occurred but this incident did not come to him for several weeks.  Even if I am prepared to accept that it might not have done so in the fraught atmosphere of 22nd May, he was not interviewed by the Police until 30th May.  He did not raise it with them.  I reject the suggestion that this was because he was interviewed in the middle of the night.  He had had over a week to think about this yet it had not crossed his mind.  It does not emerge until his statement in July.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I do accept that it is at times difficult to remember the exact details of incidents that happen very quickly.  Nevertheless, there are significant differences between the two accounts he gives.  The Father told me there was no difference between his statements but that is simply not correct.  In the first statement, he says that L was encouraging the little girl to go and play with her and called her.  If this is right, L must have been a distance away as she &#8220;called&#8221; the girl.  The Father then says the little girl moved away but still had hold of O&#8217;s arm. He had earlier mentioned the girl holding on to O&#8217;s hand and arm but by the time the girl moved away, he specifically says it was the arm.  The movement is said to have yanked O&#8217;s arm so much that the Father moved quite unexpectedly.  This all seems inherently implausible.  First, if it was the arm, I cannot see how it would break the wrist for the reason given by Dr Fairhurst.  Second, if the little girl was moving away, I cannot conceive why she would keep hold of O&#8217;s arm.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I find that the Father realised this.  His second statement is materially different.  This time he says that the girl was holding O&#8217;s left hand.  L &#8220;pulled the little girl&#8221; to go and play with her but the girl still had hold of O&#8217;s hand and, from feeling the pull, it caused the Father to turn.  He says that O gave out a cry and was unsettled for around ten minutes.  O was quite upset but the Father then says that he thought little more of it as O settled and appeared to be absolutely fine.  I consider that, if this incident happened at all, the reason why he came to this conclusion was that O was indeed absolutely fine.  He then says that he discussed &#8220;this incident&#8221; with the Mother and the Mother does &#8220;in fact recall me mentioning the incident with the little girl&#8221;.  I reject this evidence.  He told the Mother L had been playing with the little girl not that there was an &#8220;incident&#8221;.  I accept that the Mother said she was told about O crying when cross-examined.  She was recalled the next day and confirmed the position in her statement.  On the balance of probabilities, I accept her evidence when recalled.  I do not accept she is deliberately dishonest.  I will deal with my detailed reasons for this finding when I consider the evidence of the two parents in due course.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Indeed, by the end of his evidence, the Father appeared to be distancing himself from saying this incident was the reason for the broken wrist.  He denied that he had made it up.  He also denied he had exaggerated.  He clearly felt he needed to justify himself because he then said that he never said he believed this caused the injury and he honestly doesn&#8217;t know if the wrist injury was caused on this day in this park.  I find that he knows it was not caused in the park on that day.  </p>

There has been considerable ferreting around to try to come up with an explanation but none of the incidents raised explain a serious injury to a non-ambulant baby, who cannot have injured himself.  I remind myself that broken bones are highly indicative of non-accidental injury in babies in the absence of a good explanation for how the injury occurred accidentally.  I recognise that I must be cautious when dealing with only one broken bone.  Nevertheless, I am clear that there is no explanation in this case for this broken wrist.  I have come to the clear conclusion that O suffered from a non-accidental injury between one and three weeks prior to his death.  </p>

When each was working, the other cared for the children.  I accept that the Father was alone with the children more than the Mother.  His work was conducive to undertaking more of it from home, particularly with the use of the telephone.  I also accept that the Mother had the help of her family at times.  Nevertheless, it is clear that both could have injured O.  Moreover, I accept the expert evidence to the effect that the other would be unlikely to realise that O had been injured if he or she was not present at the time.

She said she would not hurt any of her children as they meant so much to her.  She became distressed at this point.  She also said that she was never concerned that anything had happened to O when she got home, although I have already made it clear that I am not surprised by this and accept it.</p>

She accepted she was the one who instigated the separation.  </p>

When cross-examined by Miss Judd, she contradicted herself on a number of occasions.  She initially said that the Father had told her that O was upset about the girl in the park but she cannot now remember why.  She then said she did not recall anything untoward and the only suggestion that the ginger haired girl had behaved badly was from the Father&#8217;s statement and not at the time.  She then told me she cannot remember the Father telling her that the girl had &#8220;yanked&#8221; O&#8217;s left arm.  She then said she remembered being worried about him but, as he was fine, she didn&#8217;t feel she needed to do anything.  She repeated that she did recollect something about O being distressed but again said that, if she had thought anything was wrong, she would have acted on it.  Finally, she said she was told something happened to make O distressed.  In re-examination, she told me the Father said O had cried but she wasn&#8217;t alarmed and didn&#8217;t think anything significant had happened.</p>

She confirmed her statement was correct.  She said it was not correct that the Father had told her that evening that O had been crying in the park.  All she knew was that he was playing with a little ginger headed girl in the park.  Unsurprisingly, she was asked about this again by Miss Judd.  She said she cannot remember the Father saying anything about O being upset.  It was just general conversation such as &#8220;how has your day been?&#8221; Nothing struck her as being out of the ordinary.  All she knew was that L was playing with a little red headed girl and this was brought up later by the Father. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">By the narrowest of margins, I am, however, prepared to accept the Mother&#8217;s evidence on the second day of the hearing.  I am particularly swayed by what she put in her statement dated 15th September 2015.  This was before the parents separated on 2nd November 2015.  The Mother had no incentive to give a partial account in that statement.  She specifically does not say that she was told that O was distressed.  I consider that she would have investigated further if she had been told that on the day.  She did not.  She got herself into a mess over it in her oral evidence.  My conclusion is that the reality was that she could not remember but she accepted things put to her on behalf of the Father when she should have said she had no recollection.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Other than in relation to the park incident, the Mother&#8217;s evidence was cogent and compelling. She showed appropriate emotion throughout.  I appreciate that anyone can lose their temper with a baby.  Perhaps it is easier to do so if you have twin babies and a toddler.  But this applies to the Father as well.  Apart from the matter of her evidence of what she was told about the park incident, there was absolutely nothing that made me doubt what I was being told.  Indeed, if she had lost her temper with O, I consider she would have made a full confession to the Father and, subsequently, to professionals.  I find that her medical training was such that she would have made the correct investigations.  She would have found pain through O&#8217;s reaction when touching his wrist.  She would have taken him to see medical professionals.  She did none of these things. I find that this was because she did not inflict any injury upon him.  I accept her denials and acquit her of involvement in non-accidental injury to O.</p>

I have already made it clear that I am not making findings of fact as to the cause of P&#8217;s injuries.  The relevance, says Mr Hopkins, is twofold.  First, he says it shows that the Father has lied repeatedly about his past, both directly and by omission.

He says that the social worker only asked him about children with whom he had contact.  I reject that.  I accept that a social worker might indeed only have asked about children to whom he had contact as they might be the ones at risk but, in this particular case, the Father later disclosed the existence of P.

Moreover, the Mother knew about the fractured ribs, albeit that she had been told that it was caused either by N falling down the stairs with P or by the family dog hitting P.  We know this as this is what she told the Police and I do not accept the Father&#8217;s account that she must have got this from his mother.</p>

He repeated to me that he had forgotten that P had broken ribs.  He told me he did not remember attending case conferences.  Whilst I accept he may not have remembered the detail, he was not being truthful to me or to the professionals.

On balance, I do consider his reaction to being told of O&#8217;s wrist fracture to be of some, albeit small, significance.  I find that he knew immediately why O had such a fracture.
