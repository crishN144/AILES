A is the only child of the Applicant father and the Respondent mother who were married to one another for a period of three years, having been in a relationship since about the end of 2004.  For the purposes of this judgment, I will refer to the parties as &#8220;the father&#8221; and &#8220;the mother&#8221;.</span></p>

She shares her home with her two half-siblings, J (who was born on 27 June 1999 and is now 13 years old) and C (who was born on 7 January 2009 and is now 4 years old).  J&#8217;s father has played no role in his life since he was very young although, throughout this marriage, the father treated J as a child of the family and, until the parties&#8217; separation, the two appear to have been very close.  C&#8217;s father is PO, the mother&#8217;s current partner.  Whilst she told me that she and PO maintain their relationship, they are not currently living together.  On the mother&#8217;s case, it is the pressure of these proceedings and the antipathy between PO and the father which prevents their cohabitation as a family.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.55in;border:none"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">On 1 February 2012, the father issued an application for contact with A.  At that point, he had not seen his daughter for two years.  The following month, on 13 March, Mr Philip Sapsford QC, sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge, made a number of disclosure orders and directions including the listing of a hearing at which the Court would be asked to deal specifically with findings of fact in relation to events which flowed from A&#8217;s return with her mother to this jurisdiction from Spain (which had been her home for the first three years of her life).</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.55in;border:none"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The matter returned to court on two further occasions for detailed case management. An earlier fact-finding hearing listed in July 2012 was abandoned primarily, it seems, because of the unavailability of one of the professional witnesses.  On 16 July, Ms A Russell QC, sitting as a Deputy Judge of the High Court, relisted the fact finding hearing for 15 October 2012.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.55in;border:none"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The allegations against the father in respect of which findings are sought by the mother fall broadly into two categories.  The first set of allegations arises from the sequence of events which was put in train when the mother, with A, left Spain in November 2008 at the end of her marriage to the father.  The mother makes allegations of violence, harassment and intimidation directed by the father towards her and others.  She says that his actions in relation to her and a number of individuals employed by various authorities and agencies constituted a campaign of harassment directed principally towards her and PO.  They unfold against the background of some bitterly contested Hague Convention proceedings in which the father sought, and temporarily secured, the return of A to Spain.  </span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.55in;border:none"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The second, and separate, allegation concerns the possibility that the father may have sexually abused A.  This allegation has its origins in various conversations which A is said to have had with her grandmother and, subsequently, with her mother and other third parties who were to become involved in the investigation.  I shall return to the detail of those matters shortly.  </span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.55in;border:none"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The father accepts in part the facts which underpin the first set of allegations (although not their effect and/or consequences upon or for the mother) and pleads justification for his actions.  However, he is aghast at the allegations of abuse insofar as they relate to  A and rejects them entirely.  In so doing, he contends that this is a clear case of parental alienation in which the mother, in collusion with the maternal grandmother, has coached A to make specific allegations against him, thereby achieving her objective of marginalising him forever in his child&#8217;s life.  The case he puts against the mother, whilst not specifically set out in the form of a counter-schedule, has led Mr Hepher, counsel for the mother, to invite the court to make specific findings as to the truth or otherwise of the father&#8217;s allegations in relation to &#8220;coaching&#8221; of this child.</span></p>

He was born on 6 January 1969 and is now 44 years old.  The mother was born on 22 May 1979.  She is 33 years old.  There is an issue as to when they first began a relationship.  The father says he has known the mother and her family since 1996 when J was about 3 years old.  The mother&#8217;s evidence, which the father rejected in his oral evidence, is that she lost her virginity as a result of a brief sexual relationship with him when she was 15 years old and still a student.  They both appear to have moved forwards with independent lives.  The mother formed a relationship with J&#8217;s father although she was never married to him.   I was told about earlier court proceedings relating to J where contact was offered by the mother at a time when the child was still a young infant.  Whilst these proceedings appear to have been ongoing until shortly after J&#8217;s second birthday, his father did not engage with them and his involvement in J&#8217;s life appears to have ended at that point.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.55in;border:none"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In the summer of 2004, the mother and father met up once more.  What appears to have been a fairly casual friendship soon developed into a romantic attachment.  The mother had just emerged from a broken relationship and, when the father proposed that they begin a new life together in England, she accepted.  They became engaged in November 2004 and the mother moved into the father&#8217;s home in England at the beginning of 2005, her parents having by then moved to Spain.  Shortly thereafter, the mother became pregnant with A.  It seems that she was unhappy living in England and the father suggested they move to Spain to be near her parents and to start afresh.  A was born in August 2005 and the parties, with the two children, moved out to Spain in November of that year, the father having persuaded his employers to allow him to relocate from England.  Thus, A arrived at her new home in Spain when she was about 12 weeks old.  J was then 6 years old.  There is little doubt from the evidence in the papers before me that the father included J as a full family member and assisted with the cost of his private education at a local international school in Spain.  It is not without significance that the mother and father agreed to change their names by deed poll so as to allow J and A to share the same surname.</span></p>

I have read the affidavits filed by the parents in connection with the subsequent Hague proceedings.  By the summer of 2007, it seems that the mother had formed a relationship with PO who was then working locally in Spain.  In July 2007, she moved out of the family home.  On the father&#8217;s case, the two children were left in his care.</span></p>

There is within the papers evidence that he was in dispute with his employer over the removal of monies taken in lieu of unpaid wages and that several creditors were pursuing claims against him and/or the mother.

Proceedings were instituted under the Hague Convention in which the father sought the return of both children to Spain.  The mother was located and served with the proceedings.  The father flew to England for contact with A in July and August.  In September 2008, no doubt with appropriate legal advice, both parties agreed to mediate using the services of Reunite International.  I have a copy of the Memorandum of their agreement in the papers which are before me.   That document was produced after two days of mediation on 9 and 10 October 2008.  In terms, the mother agreed that A would be returned to Spain by the end of the month and, in the event that she herself did not travel to Spain, A would be placed in the father&#8217;s care.    The mother was by this stage heavily pregnant and unable to travel.  Arrangements for contact in England were put in place until C&#8217;s birth.  Thereafter, the agreement was that the mother and her new baby would travel out to Spain for two out of every four weeks.  She would be based with her parents and A would then divide her time between the two homes in Spain with the father having daily telephone contact and two afternoons a week with A after school during the periods when she was in her mother&#8217;s care.  During periods when the mother was in England, she was to have daily contact with A within the father&#8217;s home by email, telephone and Skype.  It was agreed that the father would provide A with a mobile telephone for the purposes of facilitating contact to both mother and father.</span></p>

These were not simply estranged parents.  They were parents who were by that stage wholly antipathetic towards one other and unable to co-operate effectively about even the most basic arrangements for A&#8217;s care.  They were attempting to implement what was already a difficult timetable on the basis that the mother was required (no doubt reluctantly) to travel back and forth between different countries with a very small baby.  I have no doubt she was distressed to leave A in Spain on occasions when she travelled back to England.  It must have been a confusing situation for a small 3 year old child who had not been given the opportunity to absorb within the family dynamic the arrival of a new baby brother.</span></p>

The alleged assault (which the father denies) is the subject of one of the allegations in respect of which I am asked to make a finding, and I will return to it at a later stage of this judgment.  However, it is a time critical event because, shortly thereafter and in the context of the mother&#8217;s appearance in the local Spanish court two days later as a result of this alleged assault, she was given permission to return with A to England on an interim basis, thus bringing to an end over a year of &#8220;shared care&#8221; with the father.  The Spanish order, dated 9 November 2009, effectively gave interim residence to the mother in England with contact to the father over one weekend in every month.

A&#8217;s primary school was similarly out of bounds at the beginning and end of each school day without prior written invitation from the school authorities.

The first part of that chronology was set out over eleven pages in her statement dated 16 May 2011.  In the father&#8217;s absence, that provided the evidential basis of the injunctive relief which was granted by Mr Justice Peter Jackson some three days later.  The second part of the chronology is set out in an exhibit to her statement dated 31 May 2012 made in response to his current application for contact.  That, in itself runs to six further pages, albeit that there is an element of duplication.  Thus, over 17 pages of detailed chronological notes (some the content of which was the subject of challenge), I have the backdrop to the complete collapse of the parental relationship over the course of two years and eight months from July 2008 to May 2011.  At the start of that period, A was almost 3 years old.  By the end of it, she was 5&#190; years old.  It covers the period of almost a year during which the parties were attempting to operate the shared care regime which had been put in place following A&#8217;s return to Spain in mid-November 2008 pursuant to the agreement which was put in place to resolve the Hague proceedings.  It goes on to cover the 18 month period following her return to England at the beginning of November 2009 and, crucially, the events as they unfolded around her various disclosures to the mother and other third parties.  It provides a road map to the evidence on which the mother relies in support of her written schedule of allegations in respect of which she seeks findings at the conclusion of this process.</span></p>

The father&#8217;s hostility is directed towards the mother because of what he sees as her failure to adhere to contact arrangements and her attempts to marginalise his role and status as a parent to A.  He told me, and I accept, that throughout the first three years of her life in Spain (which was effectively the only home she had known), he played a full role in A&#8217;s life as a &#8220;hands on&#8221; father.  I was shown a small volume of photographs which demonstrates quite clearly the lifestyle she enjoyed in Spain and the happiness she appears to have found in her father&#8217;s company.

I saw the exchange of correspondence between the solicitors in the weeks leading up to Christmas. Following the mother&#8217;s return, the father re-instructed Dawson Cornwell who, on 19 November 2009, wrote asking for the mother&#8217;s proposals.  On 1 December, the mother&#8217;s solicitors replied making various complaints about his behaviour (instigating internet postings, contacting PO&#8217;s place of work and making various threats by email and telephone).  In relation to contact, they said this :</span></p>

There is an issue as to whether or not the father&#8217;s solicitors received this letter.  There was a telephone conversation between the two solicitors (the father having now employed the services of a firm called Draycott Browne on the basis that Dawson Cornwell were then outside his financial reach).   Because of a combination of an alleged breakdown in communications, the father&#8217;s pre-arranged travel plans and the weather, contact did not take place as suggested on Boxing Day or the following day.  The father has suggested that this was as a direct result of the mother and her solicitors deliberately sabotaging the arrangements.  I do not accept that as a fact, although I am prepared to accept that it may have been his subjective perception of the situation.  I heard evidence from the mother&#8217;s solicitor, Mrs K, that the mother was actively giving instructions to arrange the contact dates.  She told me that she remembered quite clearly having to miss part or all of the office party because she was trying to finalise the arrangements and secure confirmation from Spain of the father&#8217;s agreement.

They went upstairs and A did allow her grandmother to look at her bottom from which she could see that her bottom and genital area looked inflamed and sore.  She applied Vaseline and helped A to put her pants back on.</span></p>

When the mother was recalled at my instigation in order to deal specifically with these matters, she told me that whilst she regarded the father&#8217;s behaviour as very odd, there had been no disclosures at that stage and she had been advised by her solicitor that she had to be very careful before making allegations of this nature when there was no evidence to support any wrongdoing on his part.  She told me that her life at this time was far from straightforward in that she was travelling backwards and forwards to Spain and </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8220;it was not a case of jumping from one scenario to another&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">.

That account is recorded not in Mr Fitzpatrick&#8217;s report but in a letter dated 18 March 2010 which he wrote to S County Council by way of a child protection referral, having failed to reach them on the telephone [2/E:140].  In his letter, he set out the context of that remark, namely that A had been made to sleep in her father&#8217;s bed without a nappy on, even though she was not dry at night, and this had distressed her.</span></p>

He said he might have chosen a more neutral setting away from the home and the mother&#8217;s presence, such as a school environment.  He had not been expecting a disclosure of this nature and, had he been aware of this as a possibility, he might have wanted to focus on a situation where he could be sure that he had eliminated the possibility of any contamination factor.  He reaffirmed that, in all his discussions with the mother prior to his second meeting with A, she had not mentioned any previous disclosure.</span></p>

Nothing was placed before the Spanish court in relation to the concerns raised by Mr Fitzpatrick following his meeting with A on 13 March.  The mother was subsequently to confirm in a police interview that she had deliberately withheld any reference to the ongoing investigation in England in case it had been misconstrued, coming in such close proximity to the final decision on jurisdiction in Spain.  Her view, as stated to the police officer, was that she would just get back to England and sort matters out from there [2/F:239].</span></p>

It is not clear whether this occurred before or after the involvement of Mr Fitzpatrick and Mrs M was unable to assist me on the precise date.  She deals with this episode in paragraph 9 of her statement dated 10 July 2012 [1/C:113].  She says that she had come to England to look after the children while the mother was in Spain for a court hearing.   This would place the disclosure at some point between 25 and 30 March 2010 and, if this is right &#8211; as it must be, for that was the only court hearing at the relevant time &#8211; it comes after Mr Fitzpatrick had referred the matter to social services but before the ABE interview.</span></p>

This email was in fact produced by the father in an undated statement which he made in order to address the mother&#8217;s allegations.  He relies on this email as evidence of a further attempt on the mother&#8217;s part to &#8220;defame&#8221; him.  The email appears to have come into the father&#8217;s possession as a result of it having been sent by an unidentified third party to the father&#8217;s Spanish lawyer.  I have been quite unable to determine from the evidence before me how and in what circumstances she came to receive it, but it perhaps matters not for the purposes of this exercise.  When the mother was recalled to deal with the contents of this document, she accepted that she had written it although she said the content appeared to have been </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8220;altered around &#8211; a mish-mash of the original email I sent&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">.  Be that as it may, she accepted that the material passage with which I was concerned had been written by her shortly after she had learned of the decision taken by the CPS that they would take no further action in terms of a criminal prosecution of the father.

This she had done and she told me that the extensive chronology of events which she set out in her email to the MP would have been compiled from the foot of contemporaneous notes and emails she had sent to her solicitor.

Miss Corani&#8217;s report records that information had been received from the volunteer that A had said things about her step-father who did things to her &#8220;which made her need to &#8216;wee&#8217;&#8221; [1/C:284].  On 25 July last year, Miss Corani had attended at A&#8217;s home and spoke to the child alone without her mother or any other family member being present.  After some general conversation about the family, A was asked if she remembered telling anyone something which might worry them.  She shook her head.  Upon being asked if she would like to hear what Hilary (the volunteer) had said, A said she remembered what she had said about &#8216;weeing&#8217; a lot because of things done to her by her stepfather.  She identified Hilary as someone who had taken her to the toilet.  She confirmed that the person she was talking about was the father (whom she identified at &#8220;SMD who lives in Spain&#8221;) and she continued </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8220;he put his finger up my bum where I poo from&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">, that he had hurt her and that he was a horrid man.

To bring matters up to date, the mother told me that A had seen a consultant paediatrician in November 2012 concerning her difficulties over urinating and incontinence.  Whilst that consultant had been made aware of the allegations of abuse which are the subject of these proceedings, he had told the mother that there was no conclusion to be drawn given that children can present with incontinence for a number of reasons, including situations which they have found distressing.</span></p>

Whilst he presented as a quietly spoken man from the witness box, I was left in little doubt as to the strength of his conviction that he is a victim of an unfair process and a legal system or systems which have allowed the mother to abduct his daughter on not one, but two occasions.  He referred repeatedly during his oral evidence to the &#8220;spiral of deception&#8221; which has taken place at the mother&#8217;s behest.  He regards the mother, in concert with her immediate family and her solicitor, to be acting together in pursuance of a conspiracy to remove him from any sphere of influence over or contact with A.  He has at times, as he accepts, been prepared to act inappropriately towards both the mother and third parties in his attempts to secure the reunion he seeks with his daughter.  I found him to be lacking in judgment and insight at times when he was giving his evidence.  There were moments when the quiet reserve which I observed through most of his oral evidence gave way to some seemingly theatrical gestures, so intent was he on making his point to me.  On one view he has left few stones unturned in his attempts to re-establish contact yet, conversely, there was a period of two years during which he refused to take any part in the English proceedings (launched in May 2011).  This, he says, was a step taken on the advice of his Spanish lawyers in an attempt to preserve jurisdiction in Spain.  He has plainly behaved in a hostile manner towards the mother and it is perhaps fair to say that neither feels anything but contempt for the other.  He accepts that he made a referral to the Legal Services Commission in an attempt to disqualify her from receiving legal aid, although he denies contacting the Benefits Agency to restrict her entitlement to other state benefits.  As he explained it to me, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8220;I believe that I am entitled to highlight an injustice which has occurred&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">.</span></p>

I accept that, until the separation, he drew no distinction between the two children, each of whom he regarded as his child within the family.  The mother was plainly content to leave the children in his care when she first left the family home to begin her relationship with PO.  There were no apparent concerns about his care of either child during the shared parenting year in Spain aside from those expressed privately and in general terms to her solicitor.  I saw photographs depicting life in Spain during A&#8217;s early years.  These suggest a happy and contented little girl who delighted in the company of her father.   I was told about a telephone call on Christmas Day in 2009 during which A was reported to be speaking happily and easily to her father.

He offers no explanation as to how something which he might have done could have been misconstrued or misinterpreted by the child and/or others in their interpretation of her reports.  He nails his colours firmly to the mast of what he refers to as the mother&#8217;s sustained campaign of parental alienation.  He says that there is no other feasible explanation but that either she has systematically coached this child to say what she has or, as he put it to me, &#8220;something in that household is awry&#8221;.  By this, he was referring to the photographic evidence of sexual activity which took place on a consensual basis between the mother and PO which had been found on the latter&#8217;s computer by his employer following his departure from Spain.  The father says this material was sent to him by the employer (who had an axe to grind in terms of monies removed by PO).  The father denies disseminating that material and/or further material which I was told was available and which the mother had been shown on a mobile phone.  At the start of the case, there was some suggestion from the mother that, as part of his ongoing campaign of harassment, the father had covertly installed cameras within her home to record these images.  He denied this.  She was subsequently to accept that the video had been recorded by PO during consensual sexual activity between them and that the father had no involvement at all.  All of this, says the father, points &#8211; at the very least - to a lack of boundaries within the home environment which A sometimes shares with PO.</span></p>

Having listened to her carefully, and whilst I accept that she has become caught up in her daughter&#8217;s wish to see the father exposed as an abuser, I do not accept that she was in any sense involved in the &#8220;coaching conspiracy&#8221; which the father puts forward as the reason for A&#8217;s disclosures.  She struck me as a fundamentally honest witness who had come to court to help me.  She clearly believes that the father has abused the child in some way and she tells me that belief flows from repeated disclosures made by A in unprompted situations and always in the same or a similar form. (</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8220;She has never changed her story.  Whenever she brings it up out of the blue, it is always the same.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">)  She was cross-examined by the father&#8217;s counsel as to why, as a trained nurse, she had done nothing after the first disclosure in August or September 2009.  She told me that she did not construe what A had said as anything other than difficulties arising out of her problems with constipation and she had simply wanted to make her granddaughter comfortable.  In relation to the emails, she accepted candidly that her daughter had been capable of difficult behaviour in the past and she acknowledged the extent of the difficulties in their relationship in the aftermath of her separation from the father.  She told me that the emails had been sent in a difficult atmosphere which lasted for several months at a time when the mother was angry and upset.  She accepted that initially she and her husband were very supportive of the father.</span></p>

In relation to the suggestion that the police had been &#8220;drip-fed&#8221; information by the mother, she accepted that matters had indeed come to light which could and should have been said earlier.

However, he was candid in his admission that, at the time the disclosure was made, he was completely unaware of two important factors.  First, that the father was running a case that A had been deliberately coached and, secondly, that the mother had been aware for several months before his involvement of the previous disclosure in similar terms made to the maternal grandmother.</span></p>

Let me give an example.  A child was seriously harmed.  The court is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that either M or F caused the harm.  On the binary method of adjudication a value of 1 is returned and they are jointly, but not severally, treated as having caused the harm.  The court cannot identify one or other as the perpetrator on the balance of probabilities but is satisfied that there is a &#8216;real possibility&#8217; that one or other did.  It assesses the probability in relation to each at 30% (P=0.3).  On that footing, on the binary method they are severally treated as not having caused the harm (value=0).  So the law says as a matter of certainty (value=1) that jointly they did cause the harm but severally that neither did (value=0).  That has logical problems, but viewed from a child protection perspective it is perfectly acceptable.  The threshold is crossed and there is a real possibility that each parent was responsible.  On that basis the court can move to the welfare stage armed with sufficient knowledge, or at least a sufficient appreciation of the risks, to enable a just disposal in the child&#8217;s best interests.&#8221;</span></p>

The father, in response to the allegations of sexual abuse, says that the mother has systematically coached the child or, in the secondary alternative, exposed her to some form of sexualised behaviour within the home which has led to the child making these allegations.  As to the cogency of the evidence which is required to discharge that burden, the more serious the allegation (such as digital penetration of a child&#8217;s anus or vagina as a form of sexual abuse), the greater the need for evidential cogency.  Throughout, I bear in mind that allegations of this type are easy to make yet difficult to disprove.  Here, there is no legal burden on the father to disprove the allegations; it is for the mother to establish that, on the balance of probability, it is more likely than not that that which she alleges has occurred :  see </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Re M (A Child) (Fact Finding Hearing : Burden of Proof) </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">[2012] All ER (D) 222.   In this case, there is no real issue between the parties as to whether or not A has made the numerous statements to family members and other third parties about which I have heard.  The real question which I have to determine is whether, in so doing, (i) they are reliable statements of what has actually happened to her and, if not, (ii) why she has been making these disclosures over a sustained period of time.  I say that with this caveat.  Whilst the father does not dispute the contents of A&#8217;s ABE interview and the reports made independently to the third parties who have submitted reports, he does not accept as a fact that A made any disclosure to her maternal grandmother in August / September 2009.  As I have already said, it is his case that Mrs YM is a part of the conspiracy of alienation and that whatever A has disclosed subsequently to third parties, she is merely repeating suggestions or words implanted by her mother and/or grandmother through their &#8220;coaching&#8221; of this small child.</span></p>

It was this incident which was the subject of the criminal charges in the local Spanish court which led to the father&#8217;s conviction.  It seems to me that, unless and until that conviction is overturned or the court&#8217;s findings otherwise disturbed on an appeal, I am bound by the fact of the conviction.  Whilst I entirely accept that there may have been provocation of some sort on both sides with yet more video-recording of contact handovers, the fact of the matter is that there was expert medical evidence before the Spanish court which was relied upon as clear corroboration of the mother&#8217;s account of what happened.  I have the translations of the medical reports from the hospital in the bundles at [2/E:213].  Furthermore, as Mr Fitzpatrick told me, A was readily able to provide an account of what she saw on that occasion when he met with her (she being present, of course, at the hand over when the assault occurred).  The father&#8217;s evidence when he was cross-examined by Mr Hepher on behalf of the mother was that he did not believe that the mother had sustained an injury on that occasion, that he did not witness any injury and, if she had been injured &#8211; which he does not accept &#8211; it was self-inflicted.  In the light of the medical evidence which I have read, I do not accept that evidence and I am, in any event, bound by the record of conviction in the Spanish courts.  It is not without relevance, in my view, that the mother herself did not wish to press charges.  She told me that she was in great distress, that she had just had enough by that point and wished to return home to England.  I accept her evidence on this aspect of the case.</span></p>

Whilst I do not intend to make any specific findings about the circumstances in which this letter was written (and the mother says she had not seen this before), I am prepared to accept that its contents are likely to have been influenced by the adults around him at the time.  It is quite clear from what J said to the Cafcass officer in 2008 that discussions involving the distress and upset which the father is said to have caused the mother and her family were common currency within the home at the time.  I do find that the mother, albeit in fraught circumstances at the time, exposed J to an inappropriate extent in the acrimonious parental conflict which was ongoing at that time, and to the wider distress felt by the maternal family as a result of his decision to institute the Hague proceedings.  It is quite clear to me from the evidence I heard from the maternal grandmother and from the emails which passed between the Ms and their former son-in-law that the mother was quite capable of hurtful and vindictive behaviour towards her own parents when felt she was or might have been the subject of criticism in relation to the circumstances in which this marriage had come to an end.  Whilst I heard no direct evidence on the point, it is clear to me that her parents were less enthusiastic about her relationship with PO in the immediate aftermath of her separation from the father than they might be now.  Of course I accept that the dynamic within families will always create the possibility for temporary fractures in relationships and the breakdown of communications between family members.   Equally, I accept that time is a great healer and, free from the influence of the father, the mother has now had the space and time to rebuild a life for herself and the children here in circumstances where her parents have provided her and their grandchildren with much love and support.  But the antipathy which the family (and the mother in particular) feels towards the father in the context of his attempts to re-establish contact with A through a formal court process has not, as I find, been extinguished.   Whilst she may have good reason for holding these feelings, the mother is prepared to believe there are no depths to which this father will not stoop.  As the case was opened to me, one of the allegations against him was that he had somehow managed to install video recording equipment in the home which she had shared with PO in Spain and had thereby come into possession of sexually graphic images and recordings which he had disseminated.  By the end of the hearing, that allegation was no longer pursued, it being accepted that such images were found on PO&#8217;s work computer by his former employer and shown to him (on the father&#8217;s evidence) or that they had been filmed with her consent by PO (on the mother&#8217;s case).</span></p>

I have referred to this earlier in my judgment.  The mother accepts that A told her father that she loved him, missed him and wanted to see him.  She seemed happy to talk to him on the telephone.  When she was asked why A might have said this if she had been abused in the manner alleged by the mother, she said </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8220;a lot of children that are groomed love people&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">.

Whether or not this was said during that particular telephone call will be the subject of one of my findings in due course, but I have little doubt that A is aware to some extent of the mother&#8217;s feelings of hostility towards the father.  I have recorded in paragraph 141 the father&#8217;s account of what she said to him about no longer calling him &#8216;daddy&#8217;.  To me, that had a ring of truth and I am prepared to accept that A did make a statement to this effect or something similar.  Whether or not that statement flowed from a direct instruction from the mother or from the child&#8217;s understanding of her home situation and the mother&#8217;s (and possibly, the grandparents&#8217;) feelings about her father matters not, although I prefer to think that the mother has encouraged A to regard PO as &#8220;daddy&#8221;.  She has plainly done little to keep alive in the child&#8217;s mind any positive memories of the father during the last two years.  </span></p>

Similarly, despite the criticism I have made of some of the mother&#8217;s earlier responses to the breakdown of this marriage and the children&#8217;s involvement in the adult conflict which flowed from it, I struggle with the concept that this mother, who plainly loves A, would set out to teach her daughter to disclose and repeat a description of an event or events which on their face appear inherently unlikely.  I ask myself why this mother, in all other respects a loving and caring protector of her child, would sow this particular suggestion in the mind of her three year old child when &#8211; had she wanted to deliberately manufacture allegations of abuse &#8211; there were far more obvious suggestions she could have put in A&#8217;s mind.</span></p>

I draw no support in this context from the fact that he was untruthful to me, as I find he was, about the date when he first began a sexual relationship with the mother.

Neither of the parents knows of anyone to whom she might be referring.  I was reminded that Mr Fitzpatrick had not been told about the previous disclosures when he spoke to A in March 2010.  He had accepted that he might have conducted the interview differently and might well have reached different conclusions about whether A appeared to be speaking freely and without prior prompting.  I bear in mind that in the context of the Spanish family proceedings for which his report was being prepared, there had been no suggestion of any sexual abuse of A.  I was reminded about the concerns of the police and their concerns about what they described as a &#8220;drip feed&#8221; of information.   I was asked to bear in mind, as I do, that A was anxious to return to her mother&#8217;s presence at various points during her ABE interview and at points where she appeared unable or unwilling to answer a particular question.  As I pointed out at the time, I do not regard this as conclusive one way or the other.  It was clearly a stressful situation for this child.  Even when DC Lumb had to resort to what were, frankly, leading questions in her attempts to elicit information from this child, the interview did not go beyond the substance of her original disclosure to her grandmother.  DC Lumb accepted that she did not find the interview easy to conduct and that A had been one of the youngest children she had interviewed in a formal context such as this.</span></p>

Whilst I have considered carefully that the timing of the first disclosure outside the immediate family was made to Mr Fitzpatrick in the context of a welfare focused report, the mother had not made the earlier disclosure an issue in those proceedings.  Was she motivated by a desire to ensure that there was a seemingly spontaneous report to an impartial expert or was A genuinely repeating her memories of an actual experience ?

He said nothing at all had ever occurred whilst A was in his care which could be misconstrued in this way.  I bear in mind that a father who is on the receiving end of allegations such as these will be anxious in the extreme not to say anything at all which might open the door to further enquiry even in circumstances where the denial of guilt in any inappropriate behaviour is entirely genuine.  I remind myself again that he has nothing to disprove in relation to these allegations.

Counsel (and/or the father if he continues to act in person) will no doubt ensure that the matter is listed for further directions with an appropriate time estimate.  That should be done sooner rather than later.   Mr Lewis drew my attention to the fact that there were two outstanding applications in relation to wasted costs.
