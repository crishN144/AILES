	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:12pt">On 27 June 2014, the local authority issued care proceedings in relation to C, a baby boy born in February 2014.  His parents had brought him to hospital on 16 June with a swollen right arm.  X-rays identified several old and new fractures of the arm and shoulder.  A full skeletal survey was carried out.  This showed that C had suffered no fewer than 26 fractures, affecting all four limbs, the ribs and the shoulder blades.  The fractures had occurred on at least two separate occasions.</span></p>

They both strongly deny this and rely on expert medical opinion that the injuries may have been the manifestation of a condition as yet unknown to medical science that caused transient fragility in C&#8217;s bones.  Against this, other expert medical opinion considers it much more probable that the fractures and other appearances were the result of C being assaulted. </span></p>

At the same time they all agree that the radiological appearances seen in the skeletal survey are highly unusual.  It is also agreed by everyone that C&#8217;s mother and father have been consistently observed to be caring parents, both before and after the hospital admission.  The basis for intervention in this case rests on the origin of the fractures, and nothing else.</span></p>

The inherent improbability of a devoted parent inflicting such widespread, serious injuries is high, but then so is the inherent improbability of this being the first example of an as yet undiscovered medical condition.  Clearly, in this or any other case, the answer is not to be found in the inherent probabilities but in the evidence, and it is when analysing the evidence that the court takes account of the probabilities.</span></p>

There is no hierarchy of possibilities to be taken in sequence as part of a process of elimination.  If there are three possibilities, possibility C is not proved merely because possibilities A and B are unlikely, nor because C is less unlikely than A and/or B.  Possibility C is only proved if, on consideration of all the evidence, it is more likely than not to be the true explanation for the medical findings.  So, in a case of this kind, the court will not conclude that an injury has been inflicted merely because known or unknown medical conditions are improbable: that conclusion will only be reached if the entire evidence shows that inflicted injury is more likely than not to be the explanation for the medical findings.</span></p>

Her own mother, to whom she was very close, was terminally ill and she was helping her father care for her.  In July, six weeks after meeting the father, she came into a very large sum of money that allowed her to leave her job.  Later that month she went overseas with the father and her parents for her brother's wedding.  On returning to England, she discovered that she was pregnant.  Five days later, her mother died while she was caring for her in her father's absence.  In the immediate aftermath of that blow, she decided to continue with the pregnancy (she had begun the process of arranging a termination) and in October she and the father moved into their first home together.

C was therefore seen by health professionals every few days: nine times in April, nine times in May and four times in June before his last admission.  The father exhibits a list showing the frequency of these contacts.  To this I have added the dates on which the maternal grandfather cared for C, and also three lines.  The first two lines bracket the window of time during which the majority of the fractures are thought to have been sustained (5 May to 2 June) and the third line shows the beginning of the window for the more recent fractures (6 to 16 June). </span></p>

She said that she was reluctant to wake him for an extra feed at night as he slept very little.

The grandfather was joined as a party to the proceedings at an earlier stage on the basis that he had had the opportunity to injure C.  In response he filed a statement describing each of the occasions listed above.  The local authority accepted that he did not have the care of C during the ten days before the hospital admission in June and that he could therefore be excluded as a possible perpetrator of any later injuries.  It being extremely improbable that the child was being assaulted by the grandfather and also by a parent, he was therefore discharged as a party at the outset of this hearing, though he attended every day and gave evidence as a witness. </span></p>

There was also a time, probably in late April or early May when C&#8217;s arms had looked swollen.  When he had changed C&#8217;s nappy around that time he was quite upset to be handled.

The parents told him that C was still having difficulty in taking full feeds.  He would start well and then slow down and cry at times.  He could gag and it could take up to 45 minutes to finish his feeds.  Dr A performed a full examination, picking C up to check his tone.  He demonstrated this in evidence.  It was suggested to him by the parents that the examination had been roughly conducted, leaving red marks on C.  Dr A did not accept that he had done anything that could have damaged C&#8217;s arm.  He viewed it as a case of reflux and added the medication Omeprazole, to be given by syringe.  The physical examination revealed no abnormality and Dr A&#8217;s contemporaneous note describes C as a</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt"> "picture of health"</span><span style="font-size:12pt">.

During the course of the hearing, the question arose as to whether whole exome genetic sequencing (analysis of all the protein-coding genes in a genome) would be likely to provide further information.  Dr F advises that this was not clinically indicated and that a genetic bone disorder would be unlikely to be associated with transient changes of the kind hypothesised in this case.  Even if some genetic variant was identified, it would be difficult to show that it was relevant to C&#8217;s history without finding the variant in other patients with the same history.  The process of analysis would be a lengthy one and likely inconclusive.  In the light of this advice, no party to these proceedings advocated further genetic investigation for forensic purposes.</span></p>

They are principally based on assumptions.  Research evidence (Farrell and others, 2011) shows that 9% of children of up to 6 years old with normal bones were not recorded to cry after a fracture.  The evidence relating to Baby S reinforces that it is not safe to infer a &#8216;standard&#8217; pain response in the case of a child with bone pathology.  It is not safe, therefore, to use the absence of any identified causative event and acute pain response as a basis for undermining the mother&#8217;s credibility.</span></p>

Accepting the evidence of (as it happens) Dr Allgrove, the judge found it possible that excessive use of a mid-strength topical eczema cream might have led to bone demineralisation and a propensity to fracture in a child with some degree of hypotonia and hypermobility of her joints.  He concluded that the local authority had not proved its case and dismissed the proceedings.  </span></p>

As to Dr Ng&#8217;s process of reasoning, I understand the origin of the concern expressed by Miss Grocott.  Dr Ng at times appeared to suggest that if you could exclude other known diagnoses but could not exclude non-accidental injury, then the conclusion was that this was non-accidental injury, thus overlooking the possibility of an unknown cause.  However, this concern is in my view more apparent than real and may arise from the rather definite way in which Dr Ng sometimes expressed herself.

Dr Allgrove&#8217;s thesis that this child may suffer from an as yet undiscovered condition cannot be rejected with absolute certainty &#8211; the unknown can never be conclusively disproved &#8211; but on my assessment of the medical evidence it is extraordinarily unlikely.  Further, his analysis elevates the unusual features of the evidence mentioned at the expense of other features that are not only consistent with but in some cases associated with inflicted injury, for example the numerous metaphyseal fractures, the substantially normal biochemistry, the normal November x-rays, and the significance of fractures apparently occurring only at home.  Accordingly, and with full acknowledgement of Dr Allgrove&#8217;s expertise, I prefer the evidence of Dr Halliday and Dr Ng where opinions diverge.  </span></p>

His view that one should be 100% sure that all reasonable metabolic conditions have been excluded before arriving at a diagnosis of non-accidental injury is a proper one for a clinician and I respect his lingering doubts.  However, the court's task is not performed by reference to certainties or to lingering doubts, but by reaching factual conclusions on the balance of probability.  Dr J sounded a valuable cautionary note but his evidence does not undermine the opinions of Dr Halliday and Dr Ng as to the probable cause of C&#8217;s injuries.</span></p>

It would of course be wrong to apply a hard and fast rule that the carer of a young child who suffers an injury must invariably be able to explain when and how it happened if they are not to be found responsible for it.  This would indeed be to reverse the burden of proof.  However, if the judge&#8217;s observations are understood to mean that account should not be taken, to whatever extent is appropriate in the individual case, of the lack of a history of injury from the carer of a young child, then I respectfully consider that they go too far.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:12pt">Doctors, social workers and courts are in my view fully entitled to take into account the nature of the history given by a carer.  The absence of any history of a memorable event where such a history might be expected in the individual case may be very significant.  Perpetrators of child abuse often seek to cover up what they have done.  The reason why paediatricians may refer to the lack of a history is because individual and collective clinical experience teaches them that it is one of a number of indicators of how the injury may have occurred.  For example, in the research article relied upon by the mother in this case, carers said that 91% of the 206 young children in the sample had cried when they sustained a fracture.  Whether or not that is true for the population at large, medical and other professionals are entitled to rely upon such knowledge and experience in forming an opinion about the likely response of the individual child to the particular injury, and the court should not deter them from doing so.  The weight that is then given to any such opinion is of course a matter for the judge.</span></p>

The inability of either parent to describe a single occasion when he reacted in this way is highly suspicious.

His bones were undeniably abnormal and he was diagnosed with metabolic bone disease of prematurity, which C does not have.

The mother and father were in a new relationship.

They did not have the routine of employment, in the father's case for the first time in his adult life.  They had a premature baby who was persistently difficult to feed.  The mother was plainly stressed by a number of factors.  Of course, none of this is uncommon and still less does it indicate a propensity to injure a child.  However, it is a more realistic assessment of the environment in which C was living than the calm and unruffled picture painted by the parents.  </span></p>

In assessing the opportunity for C to be injured in the home, I have considered the degree of protectiveness that each of them has shown.  Unfortunately, they both demonstrated an unquestioning loyalty to the other, to the extent that neither has even asked the other the obvious question: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">"Have you done something</span><span style="font-size:12pt">?</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">"</span><span style="font-size:12pt">  In contrast, they have shown an inexhaustible curiosity for investigating alternatives (rare conditions, unknown conditions, doctors) that might place responsibility elsewhere.  This would be understandable if each parent was in a position to know with absolute certainty that C had not been injured by the other.  But they cannot both be certain, and however emphatically they protest, such claims amount to little more than blind faith.  An innocent protective parent in this situation would, at whatever cost, confront the other parent.  That has not happened here and the conclusion that I draw is that the dynamic between these parents has deprived C of a level of protection when he was at home as well as depriving the court of their best assistance in finding out what happened to him.  It may be that in the overall circumstances, asking such questions of each other represents too great a risk to the parents' relationship and to their rather idealised image of family life. </span></p>
