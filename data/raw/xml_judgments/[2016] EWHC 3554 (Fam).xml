The father initially lived some thirty minutes by car from the mother.  There is a dispute about the frequency of contact in the post-separation period.  It is the father&#8217;s case that post-separation and until an order was made in the El Salvadorian Court in respect of his contact with the child in 2012, that he had little or no contact with the child as a result of the mother deliberately preventing such contact.  He says, indeed, that at one point, one hundred and forty-two days passed without contact.  Once the court order came into force, his case is that he would see T every week and had a loving relationship with the child.  He says the child enjoyed activities, church, contact with the paternal grandparents and with friends. The mother&#8217;s case, by contrast, is that the child&#8217;s contact was somewhat irregular; the father not taking up all the contact available.  </span></p>

The court order on that date provided for the father to spend time with the child every Monday and Thursday from 5pm to 8pm plus fortnightly from Friday 5pm to Saturday at 7pm.  Significantly, the order also provided that, if the mother was to leave the country, she was to leave the child with the father and, upon her return to the country, he (the father) was to return the child to her care.  He was ordered to pay maintenance, which the mother alleges he failed regularly to do.  Arrears accrued.  The father agrees that he has not in fact paid maintenance since July 2015 though he claims to have been setting aside sums of money and now has a fund of the sterling equivalent of &#163;2,856.  </span></p>

The mother was then taken into a separate room by two of the men who undressed her and touched her intimately.  The mother says that she feared she too would be raped and even murdered.  However, the men were apparently disturbed and abruptly left the property.  It was the police assessment that the home had been watched by the attackers.  </span></p>

In the latter case, Thorpe LJ stated at para.61 that it is not enough to have regard to the physical characteristics of the child's settlement; equal regard must be paid to the emotional and psychological elements and that, in cases of concealment and subterfuge, the burden of demonstrating the necessary elements of emotional and psychological settlement is much increased.  Thus the approach is not simply to disregard a period of concealment, subtracting it from the total period of delay in order to calculate whether 12-month period has been exceeded; the court must look critically at any alleged settlement that is built on concealment and deceit, especially if the abducting parent is a fugitive from criminal justice.  Thorpe LJ went on to emphasise at para.62 that, even if settlement is established on the facts, the court nonetheless retains a residual discretion to order return under Article 18 of the Hague Convention.&#8221;</span></p>

The comparative moral blameworthiness of mother and father has had an effect upon the judgments in both of the courts below.  But from the children&#8217;s point of view, they have had to suffer all the upset of being brought to this country secretly.  They were unsettled at first and in September 2005 the older child sent her father an email asking for him to come and take them home.  But, as counsel puts it, &#8216;the father&#8217;s responses to this plea both in his emailed responses and in his actions were miniscule&#8217;.  For whatever reason, he did not come and fetch them home; he did not start proceedings until more than a year later.  When he did start the ball rolling in Zimbabwe, the central authorities between them took more than eight months before the proceedings were brought.  What were the children to do during all this time?  They settled down and got on with making their lives here, where they are happy and have become fully integrated in their local church and schools.  They feel fully settled here whatever the courts may think.  Their views have changed from wanting to go home to objecting to this further disruption in their short lives.  Not only this, their father&#8217;s emails have given them the impression that he has moved to Zambia.  Although he now states that he was only spending some of his time there on business and would restrict his visits there should the children return, they are understandably confused about the position.  They certainly do not want to be left in the care of their father&#8217;s new partner.  In short, having been the victims of one international relocation contrary to their wishes, they stand to be the victims of another should the father&#8217;s application succeed.&#8221;</span></p>

Plainly one must have proper regard to the authorities as they have interpreted Article 12 but I would resist the development of an unduly technical approach to the question of settlement, or indeed acquiescence.  The Hague Convention is designed to establish procedures to ensure the prompt return of children to their State of habitual residence and our courts have geared themselves to providing a speedy resolution of Hague disputes.  Whilst I appreciate that it is no longer possible in settlement cases to return a child almost as soon as he or she has arrived here wrongfully, prompt resolution of the child&#8217;s future is still required.  The more complexity and sophistication that attaches to the Articles of the Convention, the longer it takes courts to determine cases and the more appeals there are likely to be.  The constant stream of reported authorities on the Convention, including regular decisions of the House of Lords, speaks for itself.  I have endeavoured therefore to take as simple a view of the concept of settlement as is permitted by the existing authorities by which I am bound.</span></p>

Still less do I wish to fall into the trap of being influenced not by the impact that the conduct of abducting parent has had on the issue of settlement but by considerations of comparative moral blameworthiness of M and F.  I do take into account that M has been aware throughout that proceedings have been on foot in Poland that may lead to N having to be returned to Poland and, because her own lawyer told her, was aware well before these English proceedings were issued of the possibility of Hague proceedings.  This will have had an impact on M and on the climate in N&#8217;s home.  M&#8217;s own evidence discloses that N has been aware of the possibility they may have to return to Poland and reluctant for this to happen.  That is a factor which will have made it more difficult for M and for N to settle here.  On the other hand, this is not a case in which the family has been constantly on the move evading detection.

He submits that in the light of this, it would be wrong to find that N is settled.

He likes his home; his family, including his little sister; feels safe in the UK and perceives his mum feels safe and happy, with the consequence she will be fully emotionally available to him.  He told me clearly that his life is in the UK, and that he considers himself British.  I spoke to his mum of my concern at the tendency to minimise any sense of T keeping alive his Salvadoran identity, which she considers is secured by the continuing Skype contact with his maternal grandmother (who has come to the UK for an extended stay).</span></p>

T has been allowed to view his father in negative terms (his knowledge of his dad &#8216;abandoning&#8217; his mum and the negative connotations of El Salvador being inextricably linked).  The parental relationship has clearly been fraught, tensions compounded by this application and what it represents to the world that M has created in the UK for her family.  Sadly, this disconnect has interfered with the establishment / maintaining a real sense of a relationship with his father, preventing T to be properly considered &#8216;settled&#8217; here.&#8221;</span></p>

I have concern that T&#8217;s identity as Salvadoran child, and as a child of his father, is not being promoted - or worse - being denied.  It has been to T&#8217;s great loss that his relationship with his dad was so abruptly ended, and even indirect contact effectively prohibited.

Ms. Roddy feared greatly for the boy in the future were this not to be remedied.  She did, however, recognise somewhat late but encouraging steps in the right direction.  The mother had very recently put together a family tree and photographs for the boy, which I was shown I court.  Skype contact was a poor substitute for face to face interaction, but it was at least taking place.  The children&#8217;s Guardian was profoundly perplexed, as I was, why that had not been taking place in the last fourteen or so months.  The Guardian could certainly not endorse the mother&#8217;s summary cutting off of contact, whether or not there was any justification in the mother&#8217;s perception that the father may not have made much effort.  </span></p>

To say that T&#8217;s mother had not seen the world from T&#8217;s point of view would be a generous interpretation.  Ms. Roddy considered that T had probably already suffered some degree of emotional or psychological harm and there was in her mind a real question as to whether or not the mother, even now, understood that convincingly.  Ms. Roddy considered that the mother had found the present court process somewhat frightening and hoped it might effect a change of view, but that was uncertain and it was hard to predict in reality what precisely would occur.  She did think that the mother deserved a stark warning at the dis-service she did her son and would continue to do him were she not now to promote a proper relationship with his father.  Distances and travel costs were an obvious problem.  The children&#8217;s Guardian hoped that annual visits each way might ideally be possible.  </span></p>

Further, there is no reason why the mother could not issue and pursue relocation or other child arrangements proceedings there.  As she conceded, she could and should have done in the first place.  Finally, and despite the mother&#8217;s eleventh hour offer of a child arrangements order here with all the questions of enforceability of that, the reality was that the father&#8217;s finances and the challenges of travel were likely gravely to impact his ability to see his son with any acceptable degree of regularity.  </span></p>

I need not repeat my conclusions on settlement.  Normally, of course, a return to El Salvador for a short finite period to enable the welfare decision to be reached would not give rise to a grave risk of harm or intolerability (see Mostyn J in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">SP v. EB and KP</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> [2014] EWHC 3964 (fam) para.21).  Where, however, as here, a child is settled, is very dependent upon his mother, is integrated into a new family unit with a very young half-sister and has established a new life and mindset and externally at least appears to be prospering, it is likely to be intolerable and seriously harmful to order a disruptive summary return where welfare proceedings that would undoubtedly and ultimately decide his future have not even been commenced and would, inevitably, take significant time to conclude.  </span></p>

The arguments I have already set out above may be redeployed by the parties in this context too.  I reach the same conclusion.  I do not intend to make a summary order for T&#8217;s return.  </span></p>

There was agreement that Art.20 and Art.13(b) harm essentially stood or fell together.  There was agreement that the parties&#8217; Art.8 ECHR rights were already catered for when considering a return under the Hague Convention.  I was referred to SP v. EB &amp; KP supra and was aware of the discussion of these issues by MacDonald J in J and C v. B <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2015/2047" uk:canonical="[2015] EWHC 2047 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWHC 2047 (Fam)</ref> at paras.67-86.  In the circumstances, I do not propose to say anything further about Art.20.  </span></p>

I am grateful to all counsel for their assistance.  I propose now to discuss further with counsel the suggestion made yesterday on the mother&#8217;s behalf that I might give thought to the making of a contact order in relation to T.  Ms. Chaudhry earlier today submitted a draft by email, which I intend to discuss with counsel.  In any event, I will invite counsel to collaborate over the drawing of a suitable order to conclude these proceedings.  There will be no order as to costs, save for detailed assessment.</span></p>
