	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In these proceedings, I am concerned with the question of whether this court should terminate parental responsibility conferred on a person by operation of Spanish law in circumstances amounting to fraud and subsisting in this jurisdiction by operation of Art 16(3) of the 1996 Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in Respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children (hereafter &#8216;the 1996 Convention&#8217;).

The mother is represented <span style="font-style:italic">pro bono</span> by Mr Michael Gration of King&#8217;s Counsel and Ms Julia Townend of counsel.  The court is grateful to them for so acting in a case that has required a very large amount of detailed legal research and preparation.  The biological father of the child, as confirmed by DNA testing, is C.  He is currently serving a twenty-three year sentence of imprisonment for child sexual offences in circumstances that I will come to.  C did not attend the final hearing and is not represented before the court.  Whilst he was given proper notice of the final hearing and a production order was made by the court to enable C to attend by way of video link, he declined to leave his cell.</p>

After A was born on 14 November 2017, his birth was registered in Spain at the Civil Registry Office on 29 November 2017 using the mother&#8217;s passport and the passport in the father&#8217;s possession.  In the circumstances, the father&#8217;s name was recorded as &#8216;D&#8217; on A&#8217;s Spanish birth certificate.   The court has before it a copy of the Spanish birth certificate and an apostille, made under the 1961 Hague Convention, dated 15 May 2020 certifying the authenticity of the signature on the Spanish birth certificate.   The court also has before it certified translations of the Spanish birth certificate and of the apostille.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It transpired subsequently that the passport used by the father to register A&#8217;s birth in Spain on 29 November 2017 had been stolen from the person who was in fact D and that the father&#8217;s name was in fact C.  It further transpired that C was wanted in the United Kingdom in connection with a series of serious child sex offences against the children of his former wife, he having absconded from the United Kingdom in November 2015 whilst on bail awaiting trial for those offences.  In these circumstances, it is clear that C conducted a relationship with the mother under a false identity, leading to the conception of A at a time when his true identity, and the sexual offences he had committed, were not known to the mother.    It is further apparent that C used a false identity, stolen from another and being used to evade law enforcement, to register A&#8217;s birth.</p>

The mother alleges that she was subjected to abusive conduct by C which, following the birth of A, she could no longer tolerate.   She alleges that conduct comprised abusive, intimidating, coercive and controlling behaviour, including stalking.  The mother became aware of the father&#8217;s offences following the father&#8217;s arrest in Spain in July 2018.  The mother did not return to Spain with A.   No party disputes that A is now habitually resident in England and Wales for the purposes of Art 5 of the 1996 Convention and that, accordingly, this court has jurisdiction to take measures directed to the protection of A's person or property.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The procedural history of this matter is somewhat involved and has, regrettably, been beset by very considerable delay.  By an application dated 12 August 2019, the mother originally applied to terminate the parental responsibility for A that she believed was held by C. The proceedings followed the standard course for proceedings under Part II of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> until 26 February 2020, when it became apparent that parental responsibility had been registered in Spain in the name of D.  On 26 February 2020, the District Judge made an order that the proceedings be &#8220;transferred to the Family Division of the High Court&#8221;.  I pause to note that in circumstances where, pursuant to FPR 2010 r.29.17(3), only a full puisne judge, the President of the Family Division or the Court of Appeal can transfer proceedings to the High Court, the order of 26 February 2020 was of no effect.  The application has, however, proceeded before a judge of the Division from that date.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 20 March 2020, Russell J gave the mother permission to instruct an expert in Spanish law to enumerate the law in that jurisdiction concerning parental responsibility.  On 17 April 2020 the proceedings were adjourned following C raising the issue of paternity and requesting a DNA paternity test.  Russell J stayed the order for an expert report on Spanish law, directed DNA paternity testing and relisted the matter on a date to be fixed.  On 17 September 2020, DNA testing confirmed that C was the father of A and, thus, that D is <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>A&#8217;s father.   The hearing which was due to have taken place following receipt of the DNA test results appears never to have been listed. As a result there was a significant delay to the proceedings.</p>

On that date, and although C was not produced from prison, I lifted the stay on the directions for expert evidence on Spanish law, varied those directions to provide for a report by an alternative expert to be filed by 22 April 2022 and listed the matter for final hearing on 5 October 2022 having regard to the availability of junior counsel representing the applicant <span style="font-style:italic">pro bono</span>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At a directions hearing on 2 November 2022, and in circumstances where the expert on Spanish law had by that time confirmed that D held parental responsibility under Spanish law, leading and junior counsel for the mother confirmed that the mother would seek to argue that, in circumstances where <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.4</ref>(2A) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> did not permit the termination of foreign parental responsibility subsisting in this jurisdiction pursuant to Art 16(3) of the 1996 Convention, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.4</ref>(2A) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> was incompatible with the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref> and should be read down to permit the mother to apply to terminate D&#8217;s parental responsibility or a declaration of incompatibility with the ECHR made.   In the alternative, the mother sought to argue that that a power existed under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court to terminate D&#8217;s parental responsibility and that that power should be exercised.  In these circumstances, I invited the Crown to intervene in the proceedings and adjourned the matter to 9 February 2023.  On 16 November 2022, the mother issued a C2 application seeking the relief summarised above.</p>

On 3 February 2023, the Secretary of State for Justice applied for a further adjournment to allow additional time for preparation of a Skeleton Argument in circumstances where the case raised a novel and important point of law, had potentially wider consequences for government policy and required instructions to be taken from multiple government departments.  On 9 February 2023, I acceded to the application for a further adjournment and, as I have noted, determined that D should be given notice of these proceedings for the reasons set out in <span style="font-style:italic">B v C (Foreign Parental Responsibility) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2023/291" uk:canonical="[2023] EWHC 291 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2023">[2023] EWHC 291 (Fam)</ref>.

The court granted that application by consent on 4 May 2023.  In the circumstances, this court now has the benefit of reports from two experts in Spanish law.  Namely, Lola Lopez, a family law advocate practising in Spain, whose reports are dated 21 April 2022 and 30 October 2022, and from Joaquin Bayo Delgardo, a former family Appellate Court Judge in Spain, whose reports are dated 30 May 2023 and 15 June 2023.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having regard to the background summarised above, it is clear that the situation in which the mother and A find themselves is a very difficult one.  As will become apparent when I turn to consider in detail the expert evidence on Spanish law, D has parental responsibility for A under Spanish law.  As will further become apparent, pursuant to Art 16(3) of the 1996 Convention D&#8217;s parental responsibility can subsist in the jurisdiction of England and Wales following A&#8217;s change of habitual residence to this jurisdiction.  By reason of A&#8217;s change of habitual residence, the competent authorities in Spain no longer have jurisdiction to take measures of protection dealing with the termination of D&#8217;s parental responsibility.  In the circumstances, the only remedies available under Spanish law to divest D of his parental responsibility for A are the rectification of the Civil Registry in Spain by administrative procedure (Mr Delgado considering it unlikely, however, that a change of parenthood would be accepted by the Registrar via this simple registry procedure) or the recognition by the Spanish court or the Registrar of the Civil Registry of a judgment of a court in England and Wales with respect to parentage and/or parental responsibility.  As A is now habitually resident in the jurisdiction of England and Wales, the English court does have jurisdiction to take measures of protection dealing with the termination of parental responsibility.  The English court&#8217;s power to revoke parental responsibility is, however, limited by statute.  In respect of parental responsibility conferred by registration, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 4</ref>(2A) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> confines the exercise of the power to revoke parental responsibility to circumstances in which the subject child&#8217;s birth has been registered under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/1-2/20" uk:canonical="1953 (1 &amp; 2 Eliz. 2) c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953</ref>.

The mother posits four methods by which the English court can divest D of his parental responsibility for A.  First, to &#8216;read down&#8217; <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.4</ref>(2A) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> so as to allow the mother to apply to terminate D&#8217;s subsisting parental responsibility notwithstanding that parental responsibility does not arise by registration under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/1-2/20" uk:canonical="1953 (1 &amp; 2 Eliz. 2) c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953</ref>.  Second, to exercise the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court to terminate D&#8217;s parental responsibility.   Third, to rely on Art 22 of the 1996 Convention to refuse to apply Spanish law as designated by Art 16(3) of the 1996 Convention on the grounds that to do so would be manifestly contrary to public policy taking into account A&#8217;s best interests as a primary consideration.

However, Mr Gration and Ms Townend seek to persuade the court that Art 22 is not a measure of protection and that the better solutions are those provided by either reading down <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.4</ref>(2A) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, the inherent jurisdiction or a declaration of incompatibility.

Mr Gration and Ms Townend submit that this transport occurs immediately upon habitual residence changing and is not dependent on certain conditions being met, whether of public policy or otherwise.  From this point, they submit that the Convention intends that the competent authorities of the child&#8217;s new habitual residence can take measures of protection with respect to parental responsibility, including with respect to termination of the Convention, applying domestic law.  They draw support for this proposition from the fact that Art 3(a) makes clear that the termination of parental responsibility is within the scope of the Convention, that Art 16(3) provides for parental responsibility acquired in one Contracting State to subsist in another Contracting State following a change of habitual residence and that Art 18 provides that the parental responsibility referred to in Article 16 may be terminated, or the conditions of its exercise modified, by measures taken under the Convention, which pursuant to Art 15(1) fall to be taken applying domestic law.  </p>

Mr Gration and Ms Townend contend that the absence of a domestic remedy to remove D&#8217;s parental responsibility means that, contrary to the mother&#8217;s and A&#8217;s Art 8 rights, A&#8217;s paternity will be formally recorded incorrectly and that, as a matter of English law, a person with whom A does not have any biological connection, and with whom he does not and will not have any relationship, will be recognised as his father and as someone who has substantive responsibility for him.  They further submit that this breach of the mother&#8217;s and A&#8217;s Art 8 rights arises from treating A, as a child born in a foreign country now habitually resident in England in respect of whom an adult holds parental responsibility over which the English court has jurisdiction pursuant to the 1996 Convention, differently from the analogous or relevantly similar situation of a child born in this jurisdiction and habitually resident in England in respect of whom an adult holds parental responsibility over which the court has jurisdiction pursuant to the 1996 Convention.  Mr Gration and Ms Townend contend that this difference in treatment arises solely by reason of A having been born in another Contracting State to the 1996 Convention before he became habitually resident in England and Wales, and that the difference in treatment is without objective justification.  </p>

In circumstances where the question of applicable law arises only under the 1996 Convention, they submit that a decision that Art 22 applied in this case would not be capable of recognition and enforcement in Spain in any way that might have some meaningful effect.

On behalf of the Secretary of State, Ms Patry and Mr Laing submit that the public policy exception in Art 22 represents a lower bar in the context of the applicable law provisions of Art 16, where no welfare decision has been taken, than in the context of recognition and enforcement, where the existence of a prior welfare decision drives the greater need for comity and mutual respect.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">With respect to the application of Art 22 to the facts, Ms Patry and Mr Laing point to what they submit is an essential contradiction in the case advanced by the mother.  Namely, that it is very difficult to see how the acquisition of parental responsibility by D under Spanish law in the circumstances that occurred in this case, and without a welfare decision, can be a fundamental breach of the mother&#8217;s and A&#8217;s Art 8 rights (such as to require the reading down of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.4</ref>(2A) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> or a declaration of incompatibility) but<span style="font-style:italic"> not</span> be manifestly contrary to public policy taking into account the best interests of A for the purposes Art 22 of the 1996 Convention.  Applying the long established principles governing public policy exceptions, Ms Patry and Mr Laing accordingly submit that the facts relied on by the mother to argue that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.4</ref>(2A) should be read down or a declaration of incompatibility made demonstrate, rather, that Art 22 <span style="font-style:italic">must</span> operate in this case to prevent D&#8217;s parental responsibility for A from ever having subsisted in this jurisdiction pursuant to Art 16(3), in circumstances where the application of foreign law designated by Art 16(3) has the effect of breaching fundamental human rights such that its application is manifestly contrary to public policy taking into account A&#8217;s best interests.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In support of the latter submission, the Secretary of State relies on the fact D acquired parental responsibility for A by operation of Spanish law in circumstances where a now-convicted child sex offender, C, conducted a relationship with the mother under a false identity, leading to the conception of A at a time when his true identity and sexual offences were not known to the mother (which, Ms Patry and Mr Laing submit is a potentially serious criminal offence under domestic law); where at the time of these events C was a fugitive from justice, having fled the United Kingdom whilst on bail, and classified as one of Europe&#8217;s &#8216;most wanted&#8217; by Europol; where A&#8217;s birth was registered by C using not only a false identity, but one stolen from a third party and deliberately falsified; where the false identity used to register A was also being used to evade law enforcement; where following the birth of A C was, on the mother&#8217;s case, abusive, intimidating and controlling; where the mother and A escaped from C to the United Kingdom; where C was arrested, extradited, convicted, and sentenced to 23 years in prison, including for child rape, child sexual assault and causing a young child (under 13) to engage in sexual activity; where the person who acquired parental responsibility by operation of Spanish law is not A&#8217;s biological father, a fact proven by DNA evidence commissioned by the English court; and where despite being contacted on a number of occasions and served with relevant documents, D has chosen not to engage in the case, nor sought to be involved in A&#8217;s life.</p>

In that context, Ms Patry and Mr Laing submit that to apply Spanish law, with the result that D&#8217;s parental responsibility subsists in this jurisdiction under Art 16(3), notwithstanding that is an outcome effected by a fraudulent deception by a fugitive and now convicted sex offender, is manifestly contrary to public policy pursuant to Art 22.   Ms Patry and Mr Laing further submit that invoking Art 22 in this case would, in the circumstances, be both protective of A and the mother&#8217;s fundamental rights generally and consistent with the right under Art 8 to adequate legal recognition of biological and social family ties. </p>

The Hague Permanent Bureau describes the Explanatory Reports as being intended to provide information to the public as to the sense intended by the Diplomatic representatives for a particular instrument.  In the circumstances, whilst in my view it remains unclear whether the Explanatory Report is an &#8220;instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty&#8221; for the purposes of Art 31(3) of the Vienna Convention, Art 32 in any event provides for recourse to supplementary means of interpretation where interpretation in accordance with the principles set out in Art 31 leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure or leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.

On behalf of the Secretary of State, Ms Patry and Mr Laing point out that the instrument that previously predominated in family cases involving cross border issues between the United Kingdom and Member States of the European Union, namely BIIa, contains no applicable law provisions, with that instrument moving straight from jurisdiction to recognition and enforcement.  By contrast, Chapter III of the 1996 Convention sets out the rules governing the extent to which a Contracting State should apply its own substantive law or the substantive law of another Contracting State when dealing with matters within the scope of the Convention.  A further distinction between BIIa and the 1996 Convention in this context is that, whereas the public policy exception in BIIa is engaged only at the recognition and enforcement stage under Art 22(a) and Art 23(a), the public policy exception in the 1996 Convention is also engaged at the applicable law stage under Art 22.</p>

It is likewise in this chapter that the provisions on the relationship of authority existing by operation of law are to be found (Art. 16-18). The Convention clari&#64257;es and effectuates this idea by speaking of attribution or extinction of parental responsibility by operation of law. Above all, it subjects such responsibility to the law of the child&#8217;s habitual residence (and no longer to his or her national law), thus unifying the law applicable to parental responsibility and measures of protection.

In deciding that question, Art 22 expressly requires that the court take into account the best interests of the subject child.    With respect to best interests, reference to recital four to the Preamble to the 1996 Convention suggests that, in the context of Art 22, the best interests of the child are to be a primary consideration, consistent with the demands of Art 3(1) of the UNCRC.  The principle that the child&#8217;s best interests will be a primary consideration (which comprises a substantive right to have best interests assessed and treated as a primary consideration, a rule of procedure for decision making processes concerning children and a principle of interpretation) requires consideration of the specific circumstances of the individual child.  The individual circumstances of the child that will inform his or her best interests will include the child&#8217;s wishes and feelings, the child&#8217;s physical, emotional and educational needs, the child&#8217;s particular identity, the child&#8217;s family environment and relationships and the child&#8217;s health and wellbeing.  </p>

The jurisprudence is founded on the recognition that in proceedings having connections with more than one country an issue brought before a court in one country may be more appropriately decided by reference to the laws of another country even though those laws are different from the law of the forum court. The laws of the other country may have adopted solutions, or even basic principles, rejected by the law of the forum country. These differences do not in themselves furnish reason why the forum court should decline to apply the foreign law. On the contrary, the existence of differences is the very reason why it may be appropriate for the forum court to have recourse to the foreign law. If the laws of all countries were uniform there would be no "conflict" of laws. </p>

Exceptionally and rarely, a provision of foreign law will be disregarded when it would lead to a result wholly alien to fundamental requirements of justice as administered by an English court. A result of this character would  not be acceptable to an English court. In the conventional phraseology, such a result would be contrary to public policy.

This imprecision, even vagueness, does not invalidate the principle. Indeed, a similar principle is a common feature of all systems of conflicts of laws. The leading example in this country, always cited in this context, is the 1941 decree of the National Socialist Government of Germany depriving Jewish emigres of their German nationality and, consequentially, leading to the confiscation of their property. Surely Lord Cross of Chelsea was indubitably right when he said that a racially discriminatory and confiscatory law of this sort was so grave an infringement of human rights that the courts of this country ought to refuse to recognise it as a law at all: <span style="font-style:italic">Oppenheimer v Cattermole</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1976] AC 249" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1976">[1976] AC 249</ref>, 277-278. When deciding an issue by reference to foreign law, the courts of this country must have a residual power, to be exercised exceptionally and with the greatest circumspection, to disregard a provision in the foreign law when to do otherwise would affront basic principles of justice and fairness which the courts seek to apply in the administration of justice in this country. Gross infringements of human rights are one instance, and an important instance, of such a provision. But the principle cannot be confined to one particular category of unacceptable laws. That would be neither sensible nor logical. Laws may be fundamentally unacceptable for reasons other than human rights violations.&#8221;</p>

As Dicey notes at [5-004], the court will be understandably reluctant to hold that a foreign law as such is contrary to public policy.  That does not prevent the court however, in an exceptional case, from declining to apply a foreign law on grounds of public policy having regard to the <span style="font-style:italic">effect</span> of applying the foreign law.

The preamble to the 1996 Convention states that the common provisions established by the Convention take account of the UNCRC. Art 7 of the UNCRC provides that a child shall be registered immediately after birth and have the right to a name.  Accurate registration at birth constitutes a decisively important step to ensure the child is recognised as a person and is fundamental to the efficacy of the child&#8217;s right to identity.  As I observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Osborne v Arnold (Parentage: Revocation of Adoption)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2023] 1 FLR 549" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2023">[2023] 1 FLR 549</ref>:</p>

Within this context, Art 7 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child stipulates that a child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have the right from birth to a name, the right to acquire a nationality and, as far as possible, a right to know and be cared for by his or her parents. Within this context, the seemingly mundane administrative act of correctly registering a birth carries with it enormous significance for child and parents. It is a decisively important step both in ensuring legal proof of identity and civil status and as the foundation on which a personal identity is built.&#8221;</p>

Parental responsibility exists outside and anterior to the law.  Parental responsibility involves duties owed by the parent not just to the court.

Above all, it subjects such responsibility to the law of the child&#8217;s habitual residence (and no longer to his or her national law), thus unifying the law applicable to parental responsibility and measures of protection. This chapter tries &#64257;nally to resolve the consequences of the removal of the child on the law applicable to parental responsibility (the mobile con&#64258;ict).&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having regard to the terms of Art 22, I am satisfied that it is near axiomatic that it is not in A&#8217;s best interests for parental responsibility, arising by operation of law founded on a fraudulent deception by a now convicted sex offender, to be held by a stranger who has no biological, psychological or emotional link with him.  Such a situation results in an unrelated adult unknown to A having, by reason of a fraud practised on a foreign competent authority, all the rights, duties, powers, responsibilities and authority which by law a parent of A has in relation to him and his property.  Whilst it is unlikely that D would ever seek to press his rights and powers, to allow his parental responsibility arising out of a fraudulent registration to subsist in this jurisdiction would leave A exposed to continuing inaccuracy, uncertainty and insecurity regarding his legal proof of identity and civil status. A would remain uncertain as to the status of D in relation to him and in relation to D&#8217;s ability to take decisions concerning fundamental aspects of his life.  Again, whilst it is unlikely that D would ever seek to press his rights and powers, from the <span style="font-style:italic">child&#8217;s </span>perspective A would be required to live with the possibility that at any given moment D might decide to intercede in his life.  This cannot in my judgment be in A&#8217;s best interests given the foundational implications of registration and the existence of parental responsibility for his identity and emotional development.</p>

I further acknowledge that public policy exceptions represent a high bar generally. Whilst the argument of the Secretary of State that public policy in the context of applicable law represents a lower hurdle than it does in the context of registration and enforcement, in circumstances where only the latter follows a welfare assessment, is superficially attractive, I am satisfied that when applied in the context of conflict of laws it is all the more important that the doctrine of public policy be kept within its proper limits and that Art 22 also constitutes a high bar.  Taking into account A&#8217;s best interests as a primary consideration however, that bar is still crossed in this case.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having regard to the best interests analysis set out above, to apply in this case Spanish law as designated by Art 16(3) would be manifestly contrary to both the fundamental public policy of English law and fundamental international norms.  It would be manifestly contrary to English public policy to endorse a status based on fraud and a status the existence of which is wholly antithetic to A&#8217;s best interests.  Applying Spanish law as designated by Art 16(3) on the facts of this case would lead to a legal status resulting from the fraudulent deception of the Spanish authorities, by which status a stranger would hold all the rights, duties, powers, responsibilities and authority which by law a parent of A has in relation to him and his property subsisting in this jurisdiction with demonstrably adverse consequences for A&#8217;s welfare.   In short, were it to apply Spanish law as designated by Art 16(3) on the facts of this case, the court would perpetuate the fraud committed by C and the damaging consequences of the uncertainty and insecurity inherent in a stranger holding parental responsibility for A.  Such an outcome must be anathema to English law in circumstances where fraud unravels all.  Further, having regard to A&#8217;s right to respect of private and family life under Art 8 of the ECHR, which encompasses the right to identity, and the terms of Art 7 and Art 8 of the UNCRC, I am satisfied that to apply Spanish law as designated by Art 16(3) in this case with the consequences I have described would also be to breach fundamental principles concerning the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.  The application of Spanish law in this case would permit a status to subsist that is based on a fraud and is wholly corrosive of a decisively important step for A&#8217;s identity and the foundation of his personal identity, namely that of accurate registration of his birth and the ascribing of parental responsibility consequent thereon. I am satisfied that, given the foundational implications of registration and the existence of parental responsibility for A&#8217;s identity and emotional development, this would amount to a breach of A&#8217;s fundamental rights.</p>

The question of the existence of a discretion under Art 22 was not dealt with in the written submissions on behalf of the mother and hence not addressed in writing by the Secretary of State.  The point was not pursued to any significant extent during oral submissions by either.  As noted, on behalf of the mother Mr Gration and Ms Townend themselves advanced Art 22 as one of the legitimate means by which the existence of D&#8217;s parental responsibility arising out of the fraud perpetrated by C can be dealt with.  </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Re M (Children)(Abduction: Rights of Custody)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 1 AC 1288" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 1 AC 1288</ref>, Baroness Hale considered the circumstances in which a court might exercise the discretion conferred by Art 13(b) of the 1980 Convention to return the child notwithstanding the court had concluded there was a grave risk of harm that the child&#8217;s return would expose him to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.  Lady Hale considered that in deciding whether to exercise the discretion, the court could take account of the policy of the 1980 Convention, the circumstances which gave the court a discretion and the wider considerations of the child&#8217;s fundamental rights and welfare.  </p>

Art 22 specifically enjoins the competent authority to take account of the best interests of the child when considering the question of public policy.  In these circumstances, having examined A&#8217;s best interests as a primary consideration and concluded in that context that the application of Spanish law as designated by Art 16(3) would be manifestly contrary to public policy where the effect of doing so would perpetuate a fraud resulting in a stranger having parental responsibility for A and permitting a status to subsist that is wholly corrosive of a decisively important step for A&#8217;s identity and the foundation of his personal identity, it would not be appropriate thereafter to exercise a discretion to apply Spanish law notwithstanding these conclusions.</p>
