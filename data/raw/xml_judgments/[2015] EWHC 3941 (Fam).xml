	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This judgment is given following the hearing of the applications by Mrs WS for financial remedies under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> following the dissolution of the parties' marriage. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is apparent that considerable efforts had been made to resolve the financial disputes and to define and narrow the issues. Subject to the very recent suggestion of a pension attachment order, it is common ground that there should be a 'clean break'. It is also common ground that the matrimonial property should be divided equally, there being no argument to suggest that any departure from equal sharing would be justified in the circumstances of this case. As the case has developed there have been fewer factual disputes of relevance. With the assistance of experts' reports the value of the property and business assets available for distribution are largely agreed, with only some relatively minor disputes as to value.</p>

They began cohabitation in 1983 and were married on 18th May 1985.  There are 2 children of the marriage, a daughter who is almost 25 years old and in employment; and a son who is just 21 years old and at university. There is no dispute as to the parties' remaining responsibilities towards their son.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In this case the evidence is clear that at least until the breakdown of the marriage both parties made a full, substantial contribution and that no proper distinction can be made between them in that regard. In the agreed case summary it is stated that the assets are a mixture of properties (residential and commercial), cash, listed and unlisted investments and pension funds, and that broadly speaking the assets have been acquired during the marriage and the parties have made equal (but different) contributions.  Although the parties' financial positions are not wholly similar, neither of them could be categorised as the weaker party in economic terms or is likely to be significantly weaker following the equal division of assets.</p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">For much of the marriage the wife has pursued a successful, high-earning career in investment management.  She was formerly employed by Morburg Bank and for some time has been managing director of SGR Investments Ltd which is part of an international bank. In her Form E in September 2013 she stated her gross earned income from SGR in the last financial year as shown on her P60 to have been &#163;357,207 gross and from her 2 non-executive directorships to have been &#163;55,000 gross. Her P60 for 2014-15 shows income from SGR Investments Ltd of &#163;704,490 gross which, in evidence, she explained was a combination of salary, bonus and vesting of bank shares. In a recent statement she explains that reorganisation within her company has meant that her role has ceased and that she has given notice of her retirement in February 2016.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">She hopes then to acquire perhaps 2 further non-executive directorships.  It therefore appears that she has future earning potential, albeit probably not at the same level as hitherto.</p>

She has taken advice and is challenging this claim, and may also seek an indemnity from her company.</p>

In 2013 the wife ended her monthly payments of &#163;5,000 into the joint house account. The husband's recent statement refers to what he has found to be a growing administrative burden.  He has suffered from depression and anxiety for which he has required medical attention, and a report has been provided describing his current problems and symptoms. It is to be hoped that these will reduce once these stressful proceedings have concluded.</p>

In his most recent statement he described the nature of the business and his involvement with it and he suggested that his interest in it was worth &#163;200,000. He has disclosed irregular but substantial consultancy payments received from YZ Fuels.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In February 2013 Morburg Bank provided a Cash Equivalent ('CE') value for the wife's pension which was given in the wife's Form E as &#163;2,433,969.  More recently (on 26th October 2015) the Trustee of the Pension Scheme has provided an updated CE statement (expressed to be a 'CETV') giving the figure of &#163;3,064,154.  This increase has been explained by the pensions&#8217; administrator as primarily due to the decline in the long bond yield.  On behalf of the wife it is submitted that this increase is perverse and illustrates the artificiality of using CE values, because in this case the CE value given for the wife has increased by about &#163;600,000 between the two statements although the wife is that much older and she has been receiving her pension entitlement.  Moreover, whatever the CE value, it can never be equivalent to, or converted to, cash in the wife's hands. It is submitted that CE values represent the rights accrued under a pension scheme and are used to calculate the benefits only in the context of their transfer to another scheme, and in particular for the purposes of pension sharing orders in the matrimonial jurisdiction.   In this case there is to be no transfer of pension benefits from one scheme (i.e. the wife's) to another scheme.  It is submitted that the CE value is of little or no use for calculating an offset payment.</p>

She cannot cash in her pension but can only take income which ceases on her death, whereas the husband can withdraw his funds and, subject to payment of tax, can invest them as he chooses. Conversely, in his statement of the same date the husband pointed out that whereas her pension was index-linked and guaranteed for life, his is subject to the vagaries of the market and investment decisions.</p>

Accordingly, as recorded in the order made last year by Parker J the court has been asked to consider offsetting, i.e. in the context of this case a payment or allowance in favour of the husband from non-pension assets to cover the disparity between the parties' pension positions, it being acknowledged that the wife's defined benefit pension scheme from Morburg Bank is more valuable than the husband's money purchase scheme.</p>

The pensions in payment had been put before the court as assets with a combined CETV of &#163;1,040,807.  On appeal the husband challenged the district judge's treatment of pensions and rejection of a pension sharing order. The appeal was dismissed. On the husband's second appeal to the Court of Appeal Thorpe LJ (at para [54]) found that the judgment of the district judge was flawed on two grounds.  First, in ignoring the essential differences between saleable property and an income stream derived from an inalienable pension in payment, the district judge having been hindered by the presentation of the husband's case and by the unquestioned use of CETV labels.  Secondly, in rejecting the husband's application for a pension sharing order without sufficient reasons.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The 3 alternative calculations involved taking (i) the wife's pension income indexed at 2% in 25 years time (&#163;83,015); (ii) the wife's pension income indexed at 2% in 12.5 years time (&#163;64,811); and (iii) the wife's current net pension income (&#163;50,600).  To each of those figures was added the husband's notional pension income from his existing funds if providing a flat 2.5% net return of &#163;24,267 p.a. The total pension incomes were then divided in half.  The resulting figure, less the husband's &#163;24,267, represented the net lost annual income for the husband if the pensions were to be aggregated and shared equally. What was described as the "net lost annual income" for the husband was then calculated as &#163;29,374 if the 25 year figure was used for the wife's indexed income, as &#163;20,272 if the 12.5 year figure was used, and as &#163;13,166 if her current pension income was used.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It was also submitted that a 25% discount should then be applied for accelerated cash payment. The figure proposed on behalf of the wife for an offset payment was &#163;300,000 (after the suggested discount for accelerated receipt). However, in this case I cannot see that it would be appropriate to provide for any such discount, since whatever payment is made would not be to replace the benefit of sharing an income stream for which the husband would have otherwise had to wait a substantial time. The alternative basis upon which Mr Dyer argued for such a discount was that there should be some reflection of the fact that the wife might predecease the husband.  However again I cannot in this case any justification for including such a discount in a Duxbury-based calculation based on current average life expectancies.</p>

He suggested that (in the absence of an expert's report which had been disallowed) in calculating the offsetting the court should consider the following possibilities:</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mr Peel also provided a modified version of the calculations suggested by Mr Dyer on behalf of the wife. These figures were based on the husband obtaining a 1.5% net yield on his pension funds rather than 2.5%, it being submitted that conservative investment was appropriate for a person of retirement age. They were also based on the wife's pension net income rising to &#163;66,000 when she ceases to be a higher rate taxpayer (although it is hard to predict when that might be). Finally they were based on an assumed Duxbury real rate of return of 2.5% gross, not 3.75% gross (despite the observations of the Court of Appeal in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">H </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">v.</span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"> H (Financial Remedies</span>). Mr Peel argued that the court should be very careful before applying Duxbury methodology which involves assumptions about income yield, growth, inflation, and life expectancy.  A Duxbury fund has to be actively managed and so can involve annual charges whereas the wife's pension income does not. In this case the court is not being asked to capitalise the periodical payments but rather to replicate part of a guaranteed, inflation proof pension income. Mr Peel's modification of Mr Dyer's calculations produced a range of figures from between &#163;1,017,450 and &#163;438,900.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Towards the end of his submissions Mr Dyer on behalf of the wife put forward on her instructions an alternative proposal to deal with the pension element of the case. This was for there to be a contractual deed whereby the husband would be paid 25% of the wife's net pension during their joint lives. A deed was proposed to ensure that it would not be variable or capable of capitalisation under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> (pension attachment orders can be subject to future variation applications). It was recognised that such a proposal would only work if Option B operated. Under Option A the husband could not afford the likely lump sum required unless there was a significant pension offsetting amount.</p>

He further submitted that if it was to be considered at this late stage the pension trustees would have to be served and an expert might have to be instructed after all.</span></p>

Having heard the husband's evidence and seen the way in which his position has varied, I can understand the wife's concerns about the problems, pressures and delays which may arise from Option A, particularly to the extent that it now relies on refinancing under the recently proposed arrangements with Handelsbanken which are still only in "indicative" form and somewhat imprecise, and (for the balance) relies on the husband's realisation of a substantial amount of his liquid assets. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.31in">An important element in the decision as to whether a lump sum payment under Option A is achievable or is unrealistic is the quantification of the pension offset payment. It is quite apparent when looking again at the rival arguments and different figures suggested that there is no obviously right figure or correct calculation. However I consider that Mr Dyer's argument for a conventional Duxbury approach is correct, and that it is certainly preferable to an annuity based calculation. I have decided that the appropriate figure should be &#163;425,000.</p>
