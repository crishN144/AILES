While working in Spain she met, and subsequently in May 1995 married, a Spaniard, Tomas Palacin Cambra (who I shall refer to as the father). They had five children; Sara, born in May 1996; Jessica, born in January 1998; Tomas, born in January 2000; Eva, born in November 2002; and David, born in August 2004. The marriage ran into difficulties and the parents separated in 2008. Since then there has been much litigation, both here and in Spain. The father has twice made successful applications in this jurisdiction for orders for return pursuant to the Hague Convention.</p>

That is the court with jurisdiction, the court that ought to make the order, and, for all those reasons, I propose to direct the summary return.&#8221;</p>

At a hearing on 15 October 2012, Roderic Wood J dismissed an application by the mother to set aside or stay the order of Hedley J. He discharged the location order made by Charles J and replaced it with a collection order. By the time an attempt was made to enforce the collection order in the early hours of 16 October 2012, the mother together with her partner, John Williams, and the children had disappeared. The matter came back before Roderic Wood J later the same day. He made various orders, the details of which are not material for present purposes, and, having made a statement to members of the press, authorised the disclosure of the children&#8217;s names and publication of their photographs in order that their whereabouts might be discovered. </p>

The Solicitor General was represented by Ms Melanie Cumberland and the mother by Mr Christopher Hames. The Solicitor General&#8217;s case was supported by an affidavit sworn by a Legal Advisor in the Attorney General&#8217;s Office. In response there were witness statements from the mother, from Mr Williams, and from a very old friend and neighbour of the mother, Allyson Thomas. I heard oral evidence from both the mother and Mr Williams. I reserved my decision overnight. The following morning, 24 July 2013, I announced that the Solicitor General had failed to prove his case. I made an order dismissing the application, with no order as to costs. I said I would give my reasons in due course.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is well known that, on occasions, judges refer the papers in a case which has been before them to some outside agency with a view to that agency considering whether or not to take any steps arising out of the matters referred by the judge. Sometimes the papers are referred to the police, the Crown Prosecution Service or the Director of Public Prosecutions with a view to the possible commencement of criminal proceedings. Sometimes the referral is to some professional or other regulator. Sometimes the referral is to Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs. Sometimes, as here, the referral is to the Law Officers. No doubt there are other instances. Although the basis upon which such referrals are made has not very often been explored in any depth &#8211; the judgment of Charles J in <span style="font-style:italic">A v A; B v B </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] 1 FLR 701" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] 1 FLR 701</ref> is an exception &#8211; there can be no question about the right of the judges to act in his way. Nor, in my judgment, can there be any objection to a judge, as here, referring the papers to the Law Officers with a view to them considering whether or not to bring proceedings for contempt; and, I should make clear, whether the contempt is criminal or, as in the present case, civil. I was personally involved, whilst at the Bar, in a case in 1984 where Hollis J referred the papers to the Law Officers with a view to possible committal proceedings (in the event no application was made). Ms Cumberland was able, on instructions, to tell me of a more recent example in a case, also in the Family Division, before Macur J.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;I agree with your Lordships that the Attorney-General has a right to bring before the court any matter which he thinks may amount to contempt of court and which he considers should in the public interest be brought before the court. The party aggrieved has the right to bring before the court any matter which he alleges amounts to contempt but he has no duty to do so. So if the party aggrieved failed to take action either because of expense or because he thought it better not to do so, very serious contempt might escape punishment if the Attorney-General had no right to act. But the Attorney-General is not obliged to bring before the court every prima facie case of contempt reported to him. It is entirely for him to judge whether it is in the public interest that he should act.&#8221;</p>

Paragraph 2(b) of the order was quite specific. It required the mother to do something by 4pm on 12 October 2012. It did not, as a matter of express language, require her to do anything at any time thereafter, nor did it spell out what was to be done if, for any reason, there had not been compliance by the specified time. In these circumstances there can be no question of any further breach, as alleged in the Solicitor General&#8217;s notice of application, by the mother&#8217;s failure to deliver up the children after 4pm on 12 October 2012 or, as alleged in the application, any continuing breach thereafter until 17 October 2012 when she and the children were found.</p>

If someone has been found to be in breach of a mandatory order by failing to do the prescribed act by the specified time, then it is perfectly appropriate to talk of the contemnor as remaining in breach thereafter until such time as the breach has been remedied. But that pre-supposes that there has in fact been a breach and is relevant only to the question of whether, while he remains in breach, the contemnor should be allowed to purge his contempt. It does not justify the making of a (further) committal order on the basis of a further breach, because there has in such a case been no further breach.

That is a question of construction and, thus, a question of law. (2) The next task for the judge is to determine whether the defendant has done what he was required to do and, if he has not, whether it was within his power to do it. To adopt Hughes LJ's language, Could he do it? Was he able to do it? These are questions of fact. (3) The burden of proof lies throughout on the applicant: it is for the applicant to establish that it was within the power of the defendant to do what the order required, not for the defendant to establish that it was not within his power to do it. (4) The standard of proof is the criminal standard, so that before finding the defendant guilty of contempt the judge must be sure (a) that the defendant has not done what he was required to do and (b) that it was within the power of the defendant to do it. (5) If the judge finds the defendant guilty the judgment must set out plainly and clearly (a) the judge's finding of what it is that the defendant has failed to do and (b) the judge's finding that he had the ability to do it.&#8221;</p>

So, for example, if a parent taking a child for contact is prevented from going on or is delayed by unforeseen and insuperable transport or weather problems &#8211; one thinks of the sudden and unexpected grounding of the nation's airlines by volcanic ash &#8211; then there will be no breach. Reasonable excuse, in contrast, arises where, although it was within the power of the defendant to comply, he has some good reason, specifically, a &#8220;reasonable excuse&#8221;, for not doing so. A typical case might be where a child suddenly falls ill and the defendant, reasonably in the circumstances, takes the child to the doctor rather than going to contact.&#8221;</p>

So any allegation of breach necessarily involves a close and careful scrutiny of the events of the day in question. Moreover, the question in the example I have given is whether, on 30 January 2010, it was or was not within the power of the father to do what the order required. If the answer to that question is that it was, then so be it. But if the answer is that it was not (or, to be more precise, that it has not been proved that it was within his power) then that is the end of the allegation, and it matters not at all that the father may by his own acts (or omissions) on previous occasions have brought about the state of affairs upon which he now relies by way of defence.&#8221;</p>

So, in order to get to Cardiff by 4pm they would have had to leave by 2.56pm at the latest. Also unchallenged was her evidence that she had arranged the loan of a friend&#8217;s 8-seater people carrier at 2.30pm to take herself and the four children to Cardiff and that, having herself packed the younger children&#8217;s luggage, at about 1pm she told the two older children to go upstairs to pack. At 1.37pm (the time is fixed by his mobile phone) Mr Williams received a telephone call from his daughter, who was driving past the house, to say that she could see Jessica on the flat roof outside her bedroom window and Thomas outside the house with his bag (apparently he had jumped down off the flat roof). Mr Williams went upstairs and pulled Jessica back into the house. She gave him the slip and ran out of the house and away with Thomas, Mr Williams in pursuit. He telephoned the police: the call was logged at 1.39pm. None of this is challenged by Ms Cumberland. So the crucial inquiry narrows down to the 77 minutes or so between 1.39pm and 2.56pm.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to what happened during that period I am dependent in large part on the accounts given by the mother and Mr Williams. Both, as I have said, made witness statements and gave oral evidence. Their accounts can be summarised as follows: Mr Williams set off in pursuit, giving the police a running commentary on the phone: this is borne out by the police log. The children were found in the public library and collected by the police; the police log records them as being in the process of being taken back to the police station at 2.1pm. While they were being taken to the police station Mr Williams returned home and told the mother she was needed at the police station. Her friend Allyson Thomas took her there in her car. On her arrival &#8211; at about 2.30pm she thinks, perhaps a little earlier &#8211; she had to wait some time on her own. She then had a conversation with a police officer, who told her what the children had been saying. Only then was she able to see the children herself. Eventually they all returned home. A police log records at 4.59pm that they had left the police station &#8220;approx 1 hour ago&#8221; but the mother and Mr Williams think this is wrong and that they had in fact left somewhat earlier; the mother recalls her friend being anxious to get back in time to get her son to work by 4pm.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having heard both of them giving evidence and being cross-examined, I accept this account as given by the mother and Mr Williams. They were, I think, being honest and doing their best to be accurate in what they said. Partly, this is a conclusion I arrive at having seen the way in which they gave their evidence. This was not some glib rehearsed account. The mother in particular was thoughtful, giving every appearance of trying to recall &#8211; to visualise &#8211; what had been happening that afternoon. Nor did she seek to put any kind of &#8216;spin&#8217; on her account. If anything, quite the reverse. She did not seek to use the entry in the police log as showing that she had left the police station later than the time she recalled. And, significantly, she made no bones about the fact that as soon as she was reunited with the children in the police station she made it clear to them that they were not going back to Spain, nor about the fact that she repeated this to all the children at or soon after 4pm once she and the two older children had returned from the police station.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is clear, both from her own account and from the police logs, that the mother told the police that she had to get the children to Cardiff by 4pm, and that she explained why. The police logs show that she was told it was a matter for her, and not the police. The mother&#8217;s account is that, whilst she was at the police station talking to the officer before being reunited with the children, he gave her an account of what they had told him and expressed his own opinion as being that Jessica was a danger to herself and others on the plane. </p>

She could not. Through no fault of her own, and having made every effort to arrange a timely departure that would get them all to Cardiff by 4pm, the mother&#8217;s plans were frustrated: two of the children ran away, and whenever precisely it was that she left the police station it was on any footing well after 3pm, and probably nearer to 3.30pm &#8211; too late to get to Cardiff in time. As a fallback position, Mr Hames points out that it is for the Solicitor General to prove the case, and, moreover, to the criminal standard of proof. He submits that I simply cannot be sure that it was within the mother&#8217;s power to comply.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I can see the force of what Ms Cumberland says, and cannot help thinking that the mother has, quite fortuitously, been able to take advantage of two things that are unlikely to re-occur: one the serendipitous happenstance that the children ran away; the other that nothing which happened after 4pm is capable of being a contempt of court. So I have to come back to the critical question: Was it within the mother&#8217;s power to get the children back home from the police station in time for them all to leave for Cardiff no later than 2.56pm? Ms Cumberland says that it was: no-one had been arrested, everyone was free to leave the police station whenever they wished, and in any event there was nothing going on in the police station that would have prevented the two younger children being taken to Cardiff.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the end of the day I am concerned with what is essentially a question of fact arising in most unusual circumstances. I have to put myself in the mother&#8217;s shoes as she is in the police station during the half hour or so between her arriving there at about 2.30pm and the time &#8211; 2.56pm &#8211; by which she has to leave for Cardiff. Two of her children have run away and been taken by the police to the police station. She has to wait, before receiving worrying information from the officer and only then being able to see her children. However the lawyer might subsequently analyse what had happened, the reality is that the mother was, metaphorically if not literally, in the hands of the police and having to work to their timetable. It is far from clear on all the evidence that the mother had been reunited with the children by 2.56pm &#8211; perhaps, but then perhaps not &#8211; and on that fact alone, in my judgment, the Solicitor General fails to prove his case.</p>

In my judgment he has failed to do so. The application must accordingly be dismissed </p>

The fact, in my judgment, is that the Solicitor General was fully justified in bringing the application in the light of all the information available to him at that stage and the evidence filed in answer to the application was not so compelling as to require him to desist. He was entitled to pursue the matter and to have the evidence tested before a judge. In all the circumstances the appropriate order, the fair, just and reasonable order, is that there be no order as to costs. I make clear that this would have been my decision whatever the basis upon which the mother was (or was not) funding the proceedings. </p>

For that both he and they deserve her thanks and mine. There can be no higher call on the honour of the Bar than when one of its members is asked to act for no fee on behalf of a client facing imprisonment. The Bar, I am sure, will never fail in its obligation to stand between the Crown and the subject in such a case. And the same goes, I am sure, for the other profession. But it is disconcerting that something so fundamental &#8211; the right to a proper defence when a great officer of state seeks to have you imprisoned &#8211; should be dependent upon the willingness of the Bar and its instructing solicitors to act without fee.</p>

Mr Hames told me on instructions that there was no method by which she could realise the value of her share within the short timeframe of the proceedings.
