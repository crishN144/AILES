The answer to that question would lead to the grant of a Letter of Administration in respect of the estate of the deceased, an entitlement to act as the deceased&#8217;s next of kin and to take custody of the deceased&#8217;s body for burial and power to decide on the funeral arrangements.  </p>

Although the second wife challenged the genuineness of one of the documents found which purported to be a Lagos High Court decree absolute dated 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2003, she did not suggest in evidence that the rest of the documentation was not genuine.   She remained sceptical however about how the documentation came to be found.  The fifth wife was given permission to rely on these documents.  </p>

Non-judicial dissolution could be unilateral or by mutual agreement as long as the dowry was returned.   A judicial dissolution of a customary marriage was carried out by the Customary Courts where the marriage was contracted or where the party or parties resided.  As I understood his evidence the dowry did not have to be returned in the case of a judicial dissolution of a customary marriage.</p>
