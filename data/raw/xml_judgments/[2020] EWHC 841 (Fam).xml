However, it was not necessary for the arbitrator to set out every sub-paragraph or the &#8220;statutory steer&#8221; in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s25</ref>A, and address it separately.  It was similarly not necessary, as a matter of law, for the arbitrator to provide a balance sheet or calculate the percentage split of the capital assets or do a cross-check of fairness. Emphasis was placed on the fact that the main capital asset had been split 98% to W and 2% to H (since W had been given &#163;298,000 of the net proceeds of around &#163;319,000).  It was said that this &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">leaped off the page&#8221;.  </span>However, this was a needs case where there was a very limited pool of available assets and a marked disparity in income.  The arbitrator had expressly stated that W would need a disproportionate share of the equity.  He also stated that in a needs case it would be necessary to depart from equality (this was in the context of the pension but the point did not need to be made repeatedly).   </p>

For example, it was suggested that he had erred in law in not considering H&#8217;s age (51) and the nature of H&#8217;s income and the precariousness of his employment.  This was unfair since the arbitrator had looked carefully at H&#8217;s career history and had highlighted how demanding and onerous his job was. It was not H&#8217;s case that he could not find another job.  To the contrary, it was his positive case that, in light of the challenges he faced in his current job, if he changed job his gross earning capacity would be around &#163;200,000pa.  It was not necessary for the arbitrator to state that he had taken into account that H may not be able or willing to keep a city job until 67 (not least since the maintenance obligations would end when H was 61, and school fees when he was 58).  </p>

Quite apart from whether this was an error of law, it was an unfair criticism. The arbitrator assessed in detail how H&#8217;s income was made up of different constituent parts depending on different considerations, and he assessed how H would obtain a mortgage on his base draw.  This also took account of H&#8217;s case as to his income if he lost his current job.  Further, the criticism disclosed no error of law since the assessment of earning capacity and income is essentially a question of fact: there is no legal rule requiring city jobs to be regarded differently to others, or that a bonus is to be excluded from consideration or treated in a specific way.  </p>

I was even asked to recompute the parties&#8217; competing income needs, by taking into account their various outgoings. The advocacy would have been attractive if I were re-hearing the matter.  However, such argument is not appropriate or helpful in the context of an application for permission to appeal (which should ordinarily be decided without a hearing under s69(5)).  First, the question of law must arise from the award itself. Secondly, any attempt to re-open factual findings or persuade the court to substitute its views for that of the arbitrator on the facts, or otherwise to go behind the award, is impermissible and suggests the application must fail.        </p>

He referred to the evidence as to her qualifications, CV, experience, past job opportunities, past income and efforts to find a job (paragraphs 16, 42, 43 of the award) and concluded that a reasonable income for her to receive would be &#163;35,000 gross although it would take her a while to find a job.  He later assessed maintenance on the basis that she could earn that amount in a relatively short period of time (paragraph 68).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It was unnecessary for the arbitrator to explain that his assessment of her earning capacity related not only to when she would find a job in the near future but also to the future more generally. On the facts found it was also unnecessary for him to explain that the term of maintenance was only such as was sufficient to enable her to adjust to financial independence, or to give an explanation as to why a step-down in maintenance was not required.  The issues and the authorities relating to the length of maintenance may have been argued at length but the arbitrator did not have to rehearse those points.  His approach would have been obvious to anyone reading the award.  His findings of fact made clear that W was experienced in her field, and had an established track record in the workplace, but her progress was relatively flat and she had not been able to keep a long-term job. There was no basis to suggest that he had ignored some obvious step or career progression that would raise her earning capacity.  H&#8217;s arguments on her ability to earn at a substantially higher level appeared speculative whereas the arbitrator had fairly based his conclusion on actual experience.  The arbitrator&#8217;s conclusion on her flat future earning capacity was unsurprising and easy to understand.   </p>

H had made a positive case that the parties had equal housing needs.  Again, at first sight, it was difficult to fault the arbitrator&#8217;s conclusion that their housing needs were equal.  Further, the arbitrator&#8217;s conclusion that there should not be a disparity in housing in the interests of their son was not challenged.   The point appeared to be that the arbitrator had not correctly assessed the relative housing budgets because H needed to live within reach of the M11 (and the school) in order to enable him both to drop his son at school and also to travel to work in central London by road.  Accordingly, he would necessarily have to spend more to meet his housing need than W, who could live in the same sort of house but within a 20mile radius of the school.  Accordingly, the submission was effectively that her housing budget should be &#163;50,000 less than his because she did not have to commute to London.    </p>

The assertion had an air of unreality and did not appear to have featured clearly in the arbitration.  There was no factual finding to support the assertion and instead I was asked to assess the evidence from mortgage advisors.

He was entitled to take the view that this would not be a difficulty.  This was a fair conclusion and he did not need to spell out that H might have to wait a few months for parts of his remuneration package to come in if he needed a deposit of &#163;35,000 (and then would need to borrow less).

The short answer to the application was that the questions (and errors) of law raised by H were all questions of mixed fact and law as to how the discretionary exercise of sharing assets under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref> should be made as between these parties. In such a case the ordinary test under s69 applies.  Permission is only available if the decision was one which no reasonable arbitrator could reach when applying the law properly.  On the facts found (and even taking into account H&#8217;s submissions as to the facts not found) the arbitrator&#8217;s exercise of his discretion under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s25</ref> was within the range of that which a reasonable (sometimes called rational) arbitrator could make.  The arbitrator had identified the right legal test and his exercise of discretion was not obviously wrong, and indeed not even open to serious doubt.  Even applying the simple test of &#8220;wrong&#8221; under Part 30 of FPR permission to appeal would have been refused. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">These criticisms were closely linked to the arbitrator&#8217;s alleged errors of law and the same reasoning applies. The complaints were largely going to the arbitrator&#8217;s findings of fact (namely how he evaluated the evidence, what findings he should have found on the evidence, and what conclusions he should have drawn as to a fair allocation).  Two important and linked points are worth keeping in mind.  First, section 68 relates to the process, it is not designed to address whether the tribunal reached the right result. Secondly, powers under section 68 are only to be exercised as a longstop where &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the tribunal has gone </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">The applicable principle is one of basic fairness.  Irregularities can arise where an arbitrator goes off on a new point without giving the parties a chance to address it.   However, the arbitrator is not bound by a technical rule that he must always ask both parties before he accepts evidence that is not precisely within one party&#8217;s case.  This would be entirely artificial since the arbitrator is expected to assess the evidence, and there is an inquisitorial aspect in a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s25</ref> evaluation.

The overall principle is well explained in a dictum quoted in <span style="font-style:italic">Cameroon Airlines v Transnet Limited</span> [2004] EWHC 1829.

If he feels that the proper approach is one that has not been explored or advanced in evidence or submission then again it is his duty to give the parties a chance to comment. If he is to any extent relying on his own personal experience in a specific way then that again is something that he should mention so that it can be explored. It is not right that a decision should be based on specific matters which the parties have never had the chance to deal with, nor is it right that a party should first learn of adverse points in the decision against him.&#8221; </span></p>

The arbitrator&#8217;s conclusion in giving her 35.94% was based on the key evidence on quantifying the pension share and the expert&#8217;s view as to what would best achieve equality. H (and his advisors) knew it was the central evidence and they had a full opportunity to explore it.  They cannot complain that they never had a chance to deal with it or were unfairly taken by surprise if the arbitrator accepted it.  The amount at stake was around &#163;13,000 so I did not consider that there was any serious irregularity in the arbitrator not having sought a further round of submissions before adopting the joint expert&#8217;s preferred assessment.</p>

The arbitrator had made clear findings that H had contributed to the purchase of the former matrimonial home with pre-marital property interests.  It cannot be said that he ignored the evidence or that his discretion in dealing with that contribution was outside the reasonable range of a decision maker correctly applying the law.  It is well established in <span style="font-style:italic">Miller v Miller </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] 2 AC 618" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] 2 AC 618</ref><span style="font-style:italic"/>that the general principle is that the former matrimonial home is regarded as matrimonial property even if it was acquired using pre-marital assets.  Given that it was common ground that this was a needs case, the general principle was properly applicable.  It was not necessary for the arbitrator to make further findings or to set out the case law as to how and when the general principle can be departed from and explain why he had applied the general principle.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">H had a fair criticism of the arbitrator regarding his failure to give reasons for ordering that H pay all the costs of the Award.  The ARB 1FS provides that under the Scheme rules, each party will generally bear an equal share of the arbitrator&#8217;s fees.  Here there was a dispute as to whether fees were to be shared and the arbitrator should have given reasons for departing from the general rule.  The arbitrator may have concluded that as H had lost on most issues he should pay the fees but this was not implicit or obvious. There was a gap which could be regarded as a failure properly to deal with an issue within s68(2)(d).  However, given that the amount at stake was &#163;2,500 (I was told the total fees amounted to &#163;5,000), this was not a serious irregularity that justified the court intervening (or refusing to give effect to the award).  In any event, the matter would have been remitted to the arbitrator (see below under remedies).    </p>

The grounds for this were not made clear although he relied on the alleged unfairness of the decision.  He questioned whether an arbitrator should sit where one of the parties is represented by counsel from his chambers.  Whatever its ground, the point was not part of his application and I considered that it was inappropriate for it to be raised at the hearing, without any clear notice.  It would, for example, have been a matter that the arbitrator should have been given notice of.  I did not consider that the point had any merit, not least since H was well advised at all stages and his experienced advisors would have been well aware of the connection and should have raised the point immediately if there was any concern. </p>

This had given the arbitrator an opportunity to self-correct and thereby avoid a challenge under ss68 and 69.  H argued that it would have been &#8220;ridiculous&#8221; to have submitted this request again after the arbitrator made his award as it was &#8220;whimsical&#8221; to suggest that the arbitrator would have changed his mind.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">I was told that it is normal (or even universal) practice for an IFLA arbitrator to circulate a draft award to the parties&#8217; counsel. The practice would appear similar to that used when judges circulate a draft judgment to counsel. The draft is not circulated for the purpose of re-opening the decision-making process or for rewriting the judgment. A request for clarification should be limited to exceptional cases where a specific material omission or ambiguity is identified <a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2019/898.html">(</a><a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2019/898.html" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#0000FF">I (Children) </a><a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2019/898.html" style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#0000FF"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2019/898" uk:canonical="[2019] EWCA Civ 898" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] EWCA Civ 898</ref></a><a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2019/898.html" style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#0000FF">)</a>. The Request for Clarification in this case was very courteous, but had the tone of a request for further information from an opposing party. It was not what a judge would have expected (or welcomed) if a draft judgment were circulated. It appeared to ask the arbitrator to re-open his decision-making and start re-drafting. As with a judgment, any attempt to use this process (or s57) for that purpose with an arbitration award is inappropriate and can be declined.  The Request would certainly not have been understood as a request to correct clerical errors or accidental omissions, and made no mention of specific ambiguity or uncertainty. It was unsurprising that the arbitrator declined to provide the explanations and clarifications sought.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">A party is not expected to make a s57 application if the errors it complains of are not within s57 (indeed the application would be inappropriate). In light of s70(2) it is prudent to consider whether a ground for challenge could be addressed by a correction under s57.  The complaints raised in H&#8217;s claim form were largely about the arbitrator&#8217;s exercise of discretion and his evaluation of the evidence.  A few of the points (mainly the complaint regarding lack of reasons, and particularly the omission on reasons on costs) could possibly have been called an accidental omission. The grounds of appeal made no mention of specific ambiguity or uncertainty in the Award.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">Overall, I considered that the complaints raised in this application do not clearly fall within s57 and it was not necessary for H to seek a correction under s57.  Accordingly, I reject W&#8217;s argument that the application was barred for having failed to make such an application.  In any event, I would have been reluctant to reject H&#8217;s argument that the Request should be treated as a s57 request for the purpose of s70(2).  First, to the extent that any of the complaints did fall within s57 the arbitrator had been given an opportunity to correct the errors. Secondly, it was not clear that H himself had been aware of the Request and its implications (although that equally should not have disadvantaged W). Thirdly, there was very limited evidence before me as to practice in IFLA arbitrations (for example as to whether the circulation of the draft is regarded as the only opportunity for requesting corrections).  </p>

The request should usually be kept within section 57, not least as this is most likely to elicit a correction.  A request does not need expressly to refer to section 57 but the arbitrator should know what is being asked of him and it is preferable to make clear that the corrections are within s57, and an explanation should be given as to why a broader correction is sought. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">Fourthly, there is some analogy with the court&#8217;s exercise of discretion in giving effect to a settlement agreement or a pre-nuptial agreement (this is apparent from <span style="font-style:italic">S v S</span> and also <span style="font-style:italic">DB v DJ</span>).  However, the same test does not apply since in assessing an award the court must take account of the fact that the parties have agreed to refer their dispute to a neutral and independent arbitrator, with detailed statutory safeguards including the right to challenge any award on clearly defined grounds.  An award is given binding effect not only by consent but also by statute and international treaty.  It would be incorrect to equate its binding effect with that of a settlement agreement or pre-nuptial agreement.  Further, the discretion to decline to make the award into an order is a blunt form of relief leaving uncertainty as to the status of the arbitration &#8211; the court cannot set aside the award, remove the arbitrator, declare the award to be of no effect, vary it or remit it back to the arbitrator.  Such relief is only available under the 1996 Act. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">Fifthly, an important consideration (and a further distinction from the settlement agreement cases) is that the parties have chosen an arbitrator to decide their case and have had the opportunity to make their case.  The parties have elected to have their &#8220;day in court&#8221; before their chosen arbitrator and the 1996 Act deals with procedural irregularity and errors of law.  The court&#8217;s discretion under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s25</ref> is not intended to allow them to re-run (or improve) their case and ask the court to be a new tribunal of fact.  The requirement that the flaw in the award <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;leaps off the page&#8221; </span>or be &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">so blatant and extreme</span>&#8221; reflects this. Arbitration is not a dress rehearsal enabling a dissatisfied party to re-open and improve his evidence on appeal in the High Court before then going back to argue the case before the Family Court (as was in effect the relief sought by H).  To allow the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s25</ref> discretion to achieve this purpose would be unfair and contrary to both the 1996 Act and also <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref>.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">Taking all these threads together the practical impact is that the court&#8217;s discretion under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s25</ref> will usually be exercised in a similar way to the court&#8217;s discretion to grant relief on a challenge to an award under the 1996 Act.   The tests for intervention are closely aligned and similarly robust (as explained above).  In signing up to arbitration a party is protected by the framework laid down under the 1996 Act including relief for errors of law and procedural irregularity.  Both parties are expected to comply with it, and seek all available relief within the statutory time limits.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">It would be rare to find a situation where a party who has not succeeded in challenging an award under the 1996 Act can persuade the court to refuse to make that award into an order by reason of its discretion under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s25</ref>.  If a party has failed to challenge the award under the 1996 Act (or been unsuccessful in doing so) then as a matter of statute (s58 of the 1996 Act) the award is final and binding.  This is likely to be a very significant consideration and the onus would lie on the party seeking relief to explain why the court should exercise its discretion in not giving effect to that award notwithstanding its binding effect. An assertion of unfairness or extreme error is likely to be rejected summarily if a party has, without justification, failed to invoke remedies under the 1996 Act.  Most complaints are properly dealt with by the 1996 Act, especially complaints regarding the procedure of the decision-making since this is not engaged by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s25</ref>.  The court&#8217;s discretion can operate as a safety net for exceptional cases but it is unlikely to be exercised to deprive an award of binding effect unless the matter is extreme or the complaint is outside the scope of the 1996 Act (for example supervening circumstances, or matters involving third parties - such matters may also fall outside the scope of the arbitration agreement).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">As explained above, the judge should generally not allow the exercise to be treated as an opportunity for one party to re-open the facts and introduce new evidence. It may be sufficient to start by considering whether the decision is wrong.  In most cases this will be enough to determine the matter (and the answer will be consistent to that given under the 1996 Act). Whether a decision is &#8220;seriously&#8221; or &#8220;obviously&#8221; wrong or such that the error &#8220;leaps off the page&#8221; is usually a measure of how confidently and promptly a judge can form a view as to whether it is wrong.  The test reflects the nature of the exercise: the court&#8217;s role is not to re-hear the matter or search out potential errors and it should resist any attempt by the parties to achieve this (c.f. <span style="font-style:italic">Piglowska v Piglowski)</span>. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">At this stage, having already considered relief available under the 1996 Act, I put to one side the 1996 Act and consider whether the arbitrator&#8217;s decision would be consistent with the court&#8217;s discretion under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s25</ref>, and whether the court should make an order reflecting his decision.  Here, I am satisfied that the Award was not wrong.  It reflects a fair allocation of assets taking account of the relevant considerations and is firmly within the range of right outcomes.  Another tribunal may have been more generous to the husband on some points but it could also have gone in the other direction (for example by taking more account of the benefit of his units).  I am satisfied that I should approve the order attached to the Award. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">It was not necessary for me to explore these arguments but the application for the matter to be listed in Chelmsford for a new 2-day hearing had very serious difficulties.  At a practical level it entailed delay and expense.  At a legal level, there is no clear power under the 1996 Act for a matter to be remitted to a Family Court judge.  I accept W&#8217;s argument that under ss68 and 69 the default remedy is that the award be remitted back to the existing tribunal.  The fact that a party has lost confidence in an arbitrator will not usually be enough in itself to justify the matter being remitted to another tribunal.  The grounds for challenge primarily went to him having not addressed certain issues and evidence, and not having given reasons.  This would not have been enough to show that he was unable properly to reconsider the case on remission.   Bias was raised at a very late stage, as discussed above, and was not accepted.  A party seeking a new tribunal would usually have to make an application that the arbitrator be removed under s24 of the 1996 Act.   </p>
