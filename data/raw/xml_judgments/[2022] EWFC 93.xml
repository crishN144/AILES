The guardian would encourage the father to seek support from substance abuse and therapeutic services in accordance with the recommendations of Dr Nadeem and in her report before making any further application to the Court. The guardian has stated that she would likely feel unable to recommend reassessment by an expert (preferably Dr Nadeem, if possible) if the father has not progressed with the recommendations which have already been made. If, however, the father accepts the recommended support and is able to make progress then there would certainly be a strong argument for reassessment by an expert. This, in turn, would then feed into being able to consider there being a progression of the arrangements around A&#8217;s relationship with his father.</span></p>

He would also undergo the therapy recommended but requested that it only be for 6 months due to the length of time it has already been since he saw A. He didn&#8217;t want to but would for A. His desire now was for healing and reconciliation and he regretted any trauma and emotional pain caused to the mother. Aspects of this were very different to the submissions in his final statement where he attacked and criticised the mother and  did not acknowledge the need for any other therapy or support. </span></p>

In the case of the father, given the severe and protracted nature of his substance abuse, this meant that total abstinence would be required.

There are many more aspects of the report which I could address in this judgment but I do not need to do so.

There is no evidence, save for the father&#8217;s opinions, to challenge his conclusions and I accept them. The same is true for the Guardian, another experienced professional.</span></p>

A has been shielded from much of the father&#8217;s problems and history and is far too young to have any complex or detailed discussions about these, indeed he will be too young for quite a few years to come. It is also not appropriate to blame the mother, this could have a negative effect upon the relationship between A and his mother, particularly when the reality of the situation is that the mother has been following the guidance of professionals including social services, CAFCASS and indeed the court.

He accepted that they could theoretically be risks but stated that he would not use Ketamine with A or in the days before. He held liberal views about ketamine use and said that this was a difficult area to navigate as it depended on your personal beliefs. Ketamine, he said, helped you to be introspective and to philosophise.

The father seeks to minimise his habit or addiction. Ketamine is an illegal Class B drug. Longer term effects of ketamine use can include flashbacks, memory loss and problems with concentration and regular use can cause depression and, occasionally, psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations. Ketamine can also make existing mental health problems worse. This was confirmed in the report of Dr Nadeem which father wholly dismissed. Possession of Ketamine can lead to a penalty of up to 5 years in prison, an unlimited fine or both. </span></p>

These risks include mental health difficulties but also the possibility of relapsing to high levels of drug and alcohol use (E81, Dr Nadeem). At E83 Dr Nadeem continued: &#8220;The father has good insight into the devastating impact of his dependence on heroin and cocaine on his health and life in general. &#8230;however he has limited insight into the adverse effects of his on-going drug and alcohol use and he believes strongly that he does not require any further help from services. He is unlikely to engage with psychological treatment for mental health problems or treatment through substance misuse services. I think that this is likely to delay his recovery from his mental health and long-term addiction problems.</span></p>

He has had positive and negative experiences with Ketamine and when asked if it was a risk, he suggested that it was as much a risk as such things as shopping or crossing the road. It is clear he has very limited insight to the risks and of concern that he considers that he knows more about the drugs impact than the expert psychiatrist.</span></p>

This would include psychological treatment to develop better coping strategies (E80). In his oral evidence he clarified that there should be complete abstinence before Dialectical Behavioural Therapy commenced or it would be less likely to succeed. This was not a generic approach but specifically for this father with his long history of substance abuse and his underlying mental health condition and personality profile.</span></p>

I have considered the provisions of the welfare checklist at section 1(3) of the Children Act and I have also weighed up the possible &#8220;pros and cons&#8221; or positives and negatives&#8221; of not allowing direct contact to take place, as has the guardian. The development and progress of contact is almost always an unknown. Children&#8217;s needs change as they grow older. Flexibility is usually the best approach, with both parents working together. Sadly, that cannot occur in this matter at this stage</span></p>

However, he continues to use illicit substances, specifically ketamine. There is a serious risk of relapse. His ongoing need to use to &#8220;self-medicate&#8221; is apparent in his use, his comments to the guardian and within his own oral evidence. (E140). By his own admission, his use of ketamine increases when he stops drinking and using cannabis &#8211; it &#8220;keeps him on a level&#8221;, soon as he stops he gravitates to use other substances &#8211; self medicating. The father absolutely believes that he is correct and that there is no problem with his drug use. He does not see his use of ketamine to be in any way harmful to A nor impact upon his own mental health. </span></p>

In his evidence the father believed that by Dr Nadeem advising him to stop taking drugs, Dr Nadeem was breaching the father&#8217;s human rights, being his right to choose to take drugs. That is quite a startling indictment of father&#8217;s addiction or reliance on drugs (or however he chooses to term it, he not being able to become abstinent) and his unwavering belief in his own liberal views being correctly held. </span></p>

In summary, I accept the evidence of the mother, the guardian, and Dr Nadeem that until such time as the father has accepted the need for and actively sought help for his drug issues and mental health issues; and thereafter been stable, drug free and undergoing the recommended therapy for at least 12 months, contact between him and A should remain on an indirect basis only with communications supervised. </span></p>

It is important that the father recognises that the suggested 12-month time was not set as a random arbitrary target but rather as an indication from an experienced professional of how long the therapy would be likely to take to be effective and show sustained improvement and acceptance. Cutting it short to save time would undermine its effectiveness. Therapy is a sustained treatment, with time to reflect as well as active sessions. It is not a quick fix, particularly with such a long history as the father has. Often therapy can be needed for a much longer period that 12 months: it depends on proper engagement, acceptance and genuine open progress. It would be in A&#8217;s best interests for the father to accept this and work as directed by the therapist rather than seeking any short cuts.</span></p>

This is likely to be a long process, however, of at least 12 months duration followed by reassessment and patience is required.
