This highly unusual case has taken a further very unexpected turn.  The background to the case need not be set out in this judgment because it is fully rehearsed in my judgment of 5 December 2016 which has been transcribed and reported at <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2016/69" uk:canonical="[2016] EWFC 69" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWFC 69</ref> and is available on the publicly accessible website bailii.org.  That declaratory judgment gave rise, after a certain amount of to-ing and fro-ing, to the ultimate order that I made which is to be found in the bundle at B1 onwards.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.03in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">At B3 the two key paragraphs dealing with Child Arrangements and the Specific Issue are set out.  The order, so far as immunisation is concerned, reads as follows: &#8216;It is declared that it is in the interests of the children to receive all age-appropriate vaccinations, inoculations, immunisations, including boosters.  In order to give effect to this Declaration the mother must either herself take the children to be vaccinated or allow the father to do so.  They must be administered by a medical practitioner.  All vaccinations required must be administered by no later than 17 February 2017.  In default of agreement between the parents as to the practical arrangements the arrangements will be put in place by the father having consulted with the Guardian&#8217; and then a paragraph essentially defining what I meant by vaccinations, inoculations and immunisations follows.  </span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.03in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">That order, which obviously had a cut-off date of 17 February, has not in fact been implemented.  The key reason is that the father has changed his mind, because the matter only became live and relevant for the Court when in December last there was a dispute between the mother and the father on that important issue, the mother being opposed to vaccination and further vaccinations and the father being in favour of them.  He, the father, is not represented and has not been throughout but is an articulate young man and although he did not give oral evidence before me today he reiterated what he has said at other intermediate hearings that his change of heart was genuine, was personal and uninfluenced by the mother, save to the extent that he said to me that he realised the profound effect that my decision had had upon her, greater than he had perhaps anticipated, and, as he put it, that as soon as the decision was made his heart sank and he realised that he had taken the wrong course and so was prepared, as far as he was able, to reverse it and therefore take up an entirely consistent position with the mother.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.03in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">In parallel with that, their relationship as adults appears to have improved somewhat because the other aspect of the case, namely Child Arrangements, in particular contact, was causing and had historically caused very great difficulties.  They have engaged in a form of informal mediation, not organised or recommended by the Court but upon their own initiative, relatively casual in the sense that it is </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">ad hoc</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> and by telephone only but they tell me it has been of support and benefit to them.  Similarly contact itself has been arranged and I am told is continuing.  There is a significant geographical divide now between the parties, the father having moved, but they are happy to organise contact on a fortnightly basis for what is a relatively short period as dictated by the father&#8217;s travel arrangements.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.03in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">When all this came to light, as it did fairly early in the New Year, some scepticism was felt both by the Guardian and, I have no hesitation in saying, by the Court.  It seemed to me a surprising turn of events, in particular the change of heart on behalf of the father, and undoubtedly there was a suspicion that there had been some form of behind the scenes trade-off in terms of his view of vaccination with contact arrangements.  But there is no evidence in fact that that is so whatever the suspicions might be and I am reinforced in that view that there is no clear evidence because the Guardian himself has spoken to the father today and, through counsel Mr Slater, does not seek to have the father challenged or cross-examined on that notwithstanding I suspect a certain degree of uneasiness behind this all.  The reality is that neither the Guardian nor the Court is in any position to dispute what this separated couple are now saying, which leads then to the applications before the Court.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.03in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The first is the ongoing and predicted further discussion of Child Arrangements and in particular contact; that was always coming back for consideration.  But in the meantime two further applications have been made; firstly, at B7, an application for enforcement brought by the Guardian to enforce the provisions about immunisation, and although it is wrongly couched in terms of an application to enforce a Child Arrangements Order that technical difficulty is not central to the arguments put forward today although properly has been covered in writing; secondly are the applications &#8211; one in relation to each child &#8211; at B27 and 35 jointly by the parents for discharge of my substantive order.  </span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.03in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">They were at the time, I think, both in person so the form is relatively casual but reads as follows: &#8216;Please see attached Statements of Truth from parents of the children and we are in full agreement to ask the Court to have the specific order of 5 December 2016 discharged.  We are both in full agreement to please ask the Court to discharge the Child Arrangements Order aside from the Residence Order whereby both parents are in agreement the children shall reside with the mother.  We also ask for the discharge of the Guardian.  We are both in full agreement to stop all Court proceedings with immediate effect.  We are currently moving forwards positively with mediation and would ask the Court to please respect and honour this positive decision.  It is beneficial for our children.  The children&#8217;s welfare is paramount to us and we are moving forwards positively and we invite the Court to list our application etc etc.&#8217;  So there was absolutely nothing between them at that point.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.03in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">It is necessary to say a few words about procedure although I do not want to spend too long on that.  My original order was deeply unsatisfactory as far as the mother was concerned and there was undoubtedly the prospect of an appeal and so the original order stayed implementation for a few days in order that the paperwork would be prepared, but there was in the event because of the change of circumstances no appeal and so the forensic reality is that my judgment stands.  Although it is embarrassing to have to review one&#8217;s own decision, it seems to me difficult to envisage that there would have been an arguable case to be brought before the Court of Appeal against my decision but that now is academic because the parents seek variation or discharge because of the change of circumstance, namely, the father&#8217;s change of position.  I accept that that is now the proper application to be made and there is no purpose &#8211; nor would there have been &#8211; to seek permission of the Court of Appeal to vary the order rather than challenge its underlying merit.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.03in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">As I said, the Guardian&#8217;s application is technically in the wrong form; it relates to Child Arrangements Orders, which of course is not inclusive of the Specific Issue Order which is another species of Section 8 order.  Forms and procedural routes are very important in enforcement proceedings particularly if penal sanctions are likely to be involved.  However, for reasons that will be apparent, this procedural difficulty is not determinative of these applications.  But simply by way of summary there was some discussion importantly of what the routes might be available.  One conceivably would be to invoke the provisions under the Family Procedure Rules Part 37.  That would be premature because that deals with enforcement by committal, and this is not a case where there is even a penal notice attached to any of the mandatory provisions and so that route would have to be considered first.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.03in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">In the Family Court Practice 2016 at C14 the procedural guide sets out the process in terms of invoking Court&#8217;s jurisdiction for committal and I am referred to the procedural tables one of which is side-headed &#8216;Who may apply for committal or enforcement?&#8217; and the answer given with the procedural paragraphs cross-referred &#8216;Person in whose favour the injunctive order was granted or the undertaking was given.&#8217;  That of course is not directly in play here for the same reason, namely, it relates to committal or a breach of an undertaking.  But it is nevertheless some helpful guidance.  It is in the end unnecessary to dwell upon Miss Kabweru-Namulema&#8217;s points on procedure although I am essentially persuaded that they are made with merit and particularly, were penal sanctions ultimately to be sought then the correct procedural route would have to be identified.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.03in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">But I look essentially at the substance which is of more significance of course.  The legal reality is that given this change of circumstances there is now a position where both parents who have parental responsibility are agreed as to the appropriate way forward.  Given that immunisation is not statutorily compulsory, given that failure to immunise will not threaten life or on the evidence give rise to the likelihood of significant harm, although it still remains objectively in their best interests, the question arises should the Court impose its own will and insist upon proceeding notwithstanding that that would override the now consensus of parental responsibility as shared by the parents?  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.03in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">This strange point arises essentially because of the unusual timing of this case.  If all of this had happened outside of proceedings altogether no one realistically would have required the Court to adjudicate at all.  If it arose before a Final Hearing and judgment was delivered again in my judgment it would be unlikely that the Court would insist upon resolving what by then had appeared to become a largely academic issue or at least one where both holders of parental responsibility were now in agreement.  However, this change occurred post judgment and order but before implementation, a crucial window of opportunity which is likely to be &#8211; as here &#8211; very short.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.03in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The other curiosity of course is that the matter only comes before the Court as a result of the involvement of a Guardian in Private Law proceedings, which is itself unusual.  Had there been no such Guardian then it is probable that the Court would not have known.  The Guardian himself was appointed under Rule 16.4 principally because of the very grave difficulties potentially over Child Arrangements, in particular contact.  He of course participated relatively passively, as is proper, but appropriately on the issue of immunisation and was in favour of it principally because that is the guide that the medical evidence called gave.  In my judgment the Guardian is in an invidious position.  His focus as a representative of the child, who is of course a party, is undoubtedly wholly welfare-based.  He is right conscientiously to continue to advocate what he regards as the advantage of immunisation, and it is proper in those circumstances it seems to me that he should invite the Court to give effect to the order made.  But the question arises does he have </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">locus</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> at all, and even if he does, is it within the proper exercise of his powers to seek enforcement or should he merely, as counsel for the mother put it, draw the issue to the Court&#8217;s attention in a relatively neutral way?  </span></p>

As between two parents with parental responsibility that scenario is easily understood.  The position where the enforcement is brought by a third party without parental responsibility is far more difficult and notwithstanding the researches of counsel and my own brief enquiries into the matter the point does not appear to be covered by direct authority.  It is necessary therefore to look albeit briefly at the Rules.  </span></p>

The Court will appoint a Guardian if it is satisfied that the position under Rule 16.2 is in play, and the position is that if a child is made a party to the proceedings then a Guardian&#8217;s appointment will follow.  It is almost universally the case in Public Law proceedings to have a Guardian; it is rare in Private Law Proceedings.  That is because the involvement of the Guardian in such proceedings is regarded as exceptional and limited to that category of most difficult or most exceptional class of case.  It is obviously such a case with which we are dealing.  </span></p>

We hardly need reminding of, but for the sake of completeness I do, the meaning of parental responsibility pursuant to Section 3 of the Act: &#8216;In this Act parental responsibility means all the rights, duties, powers, responsibilities and authority which by law a parent of a child has in relation to the child and his property.&#8217;  That is a hugely important statement of the role of a parent in the general complexity of family life.  That is both in terms of day to day management and also the extent to which Article 8 rights continue to dominate the exercise of decisions about family life.  The Court is constantly urging parents to make their own decisions if possible and to avoid proceedings or the prolonging of proceedings before the Court.  They are invited to take alternative routes to resolution of problems either informally or through such things as mediation or arbitration in some cases.  But of course the Court has a residual power.  But not every decision taken by parents is objectively correct.  </span></p>

The State normally only becomes involved, whether the State is in the form of the Court or sometimes the Local Authority, if intervention into family life is justified and proportionate.  The test in care proceedings as we all know of course is likely to be that there is evidence showing that the child or children is or are suffering or likely to suffer significant harm.  The unusual facts and in particular the timing in this case puts the public policy against the parental choice issue into stark relief.  In the course of argument a number of analogies and comparisons were discussed: the so-called relocation cases; specific issues, for example, choice of schools, and even the medical treatment cases under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court reserved to full Judges of the Division, where medical professionals usually end up in conflict with either one or often both birth parents.  That last example of course is a stark case of parental responsibility being overridden by a decision taken objectively by the Court if, for example, it prefers the view of the medical professionals in that case.  Plainly different considerations apply and in such a case the issues are obviously grave but not necessarily would the gravity difference mean a difference of approach.  But in the end I am not satisfied that any of the analogies or comparisons unlocks the difficult question in this case and so I turn to what might be regarded as simple lowest common denominator factors.</span></p>

But frequently parents thereafter agree variations informally or even reverse an order or a state of affairs entirely.  In those situations more often than not the Court remains entirely unaware that that is so.  Even if by one mechanism or another the Court becomes aware, absent an application by one aggrieved party and save where a child&#8217;s welfare would be affected &#8211; not necessarily to the extent of there being significant harm but in my judgment substantively affected &#8211; it is unlikely to impose something upon unwilling parents because that is both, in my judgment, undesirable and impractical.

Even if all of the procedures were in place correctly, the options seem to me relatively limited.  The first, which is relatively grotesque, would be that the Guardian or a representative of CAFCASS would have to take the child him or herself to the clinic for vaccination.  When I state it in those stark terms it can be seen as obviously impractical.  It would be wholly wrong for a stranger in those circumstances to do it, almost certainly outside the remit of CAFCASS&#8217;s responsibilities, and practical questions of follow-ups and boosters and so on would come into play.

Quite apart from that of course Section 38 of the Act dealing with interim arrangements is unlikely in my judgment to be satisfied.  Section 38(2) is of course well-known: &#8216;A Court shall not make an Interim Care Order or Interim Supervision Order under this Section unless it is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that circumstances with respect to the child are as mentioned in Section 31(2)&#8217;.</span></p>

In those circumstances not only because the Threshold would not be crossed for an order but it would be a wholly improper device would that not be an appropriate route of enforcement.</span></p>

But essentially on public policy grounds and given the now parental consensus which I must accept is genuine I am not proposing to take any steps to order enforcement of that original order.

It remains therefore my view that it is in the best interests of these children to be vaccinated and the reasons are there to be seen in my reported decision which remains in the public domain.  But for the reasons that I have outlined I am prepared to allow the application for variation of the order itself so as to remove the requirements as to vaccination; in other words, the determination of the declaratory relief remains, the rest will go.  At A3 the first sentence under para. 2: &#8216;It is declared that it is in the interests of the children for them to receive all age-appropriate vaccinations, inoculations, immunisations including boosters&#8217; stays, and the paragraph of definition at the conclusion of that paragraph will also stay, but the intermediate four sentences which would be the way of giving effect to the order I now discharge and therefore there will be no requirement upon the parents to take steps either together or individually to have the children vaccinated.  It remains open to them if they agree with the passage of time and that the vaccinations still remain age-appropriate to take a different view.  It is now a matter for their joint exercise of parental responsibility.</span></p>

Of course all the decisions have to be taken in the context of Section 1 of the Act and the responsibility of the Court and of any Guardian to ensure so far as possible that the children&#8217;s welfares are promoted, and there are very many matters in the checklist that the Guardian says still need investigation not least capabilities, risk of harm and the effect of change.  But the truth is that change apparently has been effected.  It may be remarkable and for that reason I completely understand the Guardian&#8217;s cautious reluctance to conclude the case, but in the end I am persuaded that the Court needs not prolong these proceedings any longer and will not be required to make substantive orders beyond those which are now proffered as consensual.  There may be some drafting points as to precisely what should be ordered and what should be recited or undertaken but I am sure that those can be resolved by discussion today, but my overall judgment with in the end no hesitation is that these proceedings should be brought to an end today.</span></p>
