The application challenges the conclusion of the local authority as the supervising body under the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (&#8220;DOLS&#8221;) that PH meets two of the qualifying requirements for a standard authorisation, namely the capacity requirement and the best interests requirement, and further challenges the purposes and conditions of the standard authorisation.  It has been agreed between the parties to this application that the question whether the capacity requirement is met should be dealt with as a preliminary issue.  Other issues may have to be considered at subsequent hearings depending on my decision on the question of capacity, although it seems that a consensus is emerging concerning those matters as a result of negotiations that have been ongoing between the parties.   </p>

Thus, I have been asked at this hearing to address a wider question, namely whether PH has the capacity to make decisions concerning his residence and care.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0in">HD is a genetic degenerative neurological disorder that affects muscle coordination and leads to cognitive decline and dementia.  It commonly begins in middle age and almost invariably leads to a gradual decline and a reduced life expectancy.  As the disease advances, the patient suffers from involuntary movements called chorea which become steadily more apparent, along with a decline in cognitive abilities.  In addition, the patient exhibits increased behavioural problems.  There is sadly as yet no cure for HD and in the latter stages of the disease the patient requires full time care.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0in">PH was born in 1961.  For over twenty years he was in a relationship with another man, R.   In 2000, PH was diagnosed with HD and for the next ten years he was cared for, with great devotion, by his partner R.  As is invariably the case with sufferers of HD, his condition steadily deteriorated and his behaviour became erratic and volatile.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0in">Eventually, it was arranged by R and those assisting him, including PH&#8217;s social worker D, that PH would be admitted to Y Court, a unit which specialises in the care of persons suffering from HD.  On 25 November 2010, R drove PH to Y Court, pretending that their visit would be temporary, and then left him there.  On the following day, Z Ltd, as the managing authority responsible for Y Court, gave an urgent authorisation under Schedule A1 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> for the detention of PH at Y Court for seven days.  Not surprisingly, PH&#8217;s behaviour during the initial period of his detention at Y Court was disturbed and on occasions violent.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0in">On 7 December 2010, the local authority, having carried out the assessments required by the schedule and satisfied itself that the qualifying requirements were met, gave a standard authorisation for PH&#8217;s ongoing detention at Y Court.  It was the clear view of the doctors responsible for treating PH, and his social worker D, that he lacked the capacity to make decisions about his residence.  The authorisation purported to have been backdated to 3 December, the date on which the urgent authorisation had expired.  The question of whether a supervising authority has the power to backdate a standard authorisation and, if  so, whether that power was lawfully exercised in this case, has not been argued so far in these proceedings. </p>

He telephoned the police from Y Court on a number of occasions asking to be &#8220;rescued&#8221;.  On 14 December, he was assessed under the Mental Health Act but found to be not suffering from a mental illness that required him to be sectioned under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">that Act</ref>.  On 6 January 2011, a best interests meeting, attended by the relevant professionals and R, concluded that further assessments should be carried out, that a move would not at that stage be in PH&#8217;s interests, and that he should therefore remain at Y Court.

The respondents to the application are the local authority, Z Limited, and R.  Preliminary directions were given two days later by a District Judge sitting at Archway, including an that order that the case be transferred to the Royal Courts of Justice to be heard by a High Court Judge.  On 7 February, the matter was listed before me for the first time.  On that occasion I made an interim declaration pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/48" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 48</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> that there was reason to believe that PH lacked the capacity to make decisions as to where he should reside.  I gave further directions, including granting permission to the parties to instruct an independent psychiatrist to provide a report on PH&#8217;s capacity to litigate and to make decisions concerning his care, treatment, residence and contact.  Pursuant to that direction, Dr Hugh Rickards, a consultant neuro-psychiatrist, well respected as an expert in HD, was duly instructed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0in">On 8 April, Dr Rickards  filed his report, in which he recorded his view that PH did have the capacity to make decisions as to his residence.  As this was contrary to the view held by the medical professionals responsible for treating PH, it became clear that a contested hearing as to capacity would be required.  For various reasons, the hearing on 12 May listed before Hogg J did not proceed and the matter was listed to come back before me on 26 May.  On considering the evidence filed, however, it became apparent that the time allowed (one day) would be insufficient to complete the hearing, which involved taking oral evidence from seven witnesses as well as legal argument on behalf of the four parties plus extensive reading time.  I was, however, able to accommodate the case on circuit on 9 and 10 June and therefore adjourned the matter to those dates.  The order on 26 May recorded that PH would be willing to remain at Y Court until the hearing on 9 June on the basis that suitable arrangements were being made for alternative accommodation in the event that he was found to have capacity.   </p>

Equally, it is unnecessary for the court to adopt an approach, also advanced by Miss Morris on behalf of the Official Solicitor, that the statutory test should be construed &#8220;narrowly&#8221;.

Clearly, the opinion of an independently-instructed expert will be likely to be of very considerable importance, but in many cases the evidence of other clinicians and professionals who have experience of treating and working with P will be just as important and in some cases more important.  In assessing that evidence, the court must be aware of the difficulties which may arise as a result of the close professional relationship between the clinicians treating, and the key professionals working with, P.

Equally, in cases of vulnerable adults, there is a risk that all professionals involved with treating and helping that person &#8211; including, of course, a judge in the Court of Protection &#8211; may feel drawn towards an outcome that is more protective of the adult and thus, in certain circumstances, fail to carry out an assessment of capacity that is detached and objective.

Dr Rickards felt that he was so concerned about getting home that it was very difficult for him to speak of those factors.  Dr Rickards accepted that he could not absolutely say that PH had showed the capacity to weigh up information.   </p>

On the evidence of those responsible for caring for PH, he tends to cram food into his mouth and has difficulty understanding the need to chew.  As a result, there is an increased risk that he will choke and/or aspirate food.  This is a common problem with sufferers of HD.  Dr Rickards expressed the view, that whilst this was a problem for PH, it did not give rise to a severe level of risk.  He accepted that caring for someone with HD requires specific understanding and expertise of this risk, and other risks arising with HD.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0in">Dr A interviewed PH at Y Court on 19 May 2011, six weeks after Dr Rickards&#8217; interview.  On this occasion PH was quietly spoken and his speech was markedly hesitant, and repetitive.  Dr A undertook formal cognitive testing including a minimental state examination and the Addenbrooke&#8217;s cognitive Examination (ACE-R).  Dr A states that both of these rating scales are well validated for use in dementia.  PH&#8217;s score under the mini-mental state examination placed him in a moderate scale for dementia although that examination process has no real tests of frontal lobe function which is a problem in HD.  For that reason, Dr A conducted the ACE-R examination which specifically includes frontal lobe testing.  PH&#8217;s score was well below the cut off for dementia.  Summarising the outcome of these tests, Dr A said that a prominent feature of these was inattention and lack of concentration plus prominent short term memory impairment.  His scores were &#8220;significantly lower and reflect the prominent cognitive impairment this patient is experiencing.&#8221;  Dr A then spoke to PH about his future residence.  When asked what he would like to happen, PH instantly replied: &#8220;I would like to go home&#8221;.  Dr A explored the implications of </p>

According to Dr A&#8217;s report: &#8220;PH looked genuinely surprised and taken aback and initially denied that this was the case&#8221;.  He records that PH said: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know why he would find it difficult to look after me&#8221;.  When asked by Dr A what he would need for him to return home, PH replied that he would need someone to look after him, make sure he got up in the morning and had a bath,: &#8220;that sort of thing&#8221;.  He told Dr A that he was &#8220;protective of people looking after me&#8221;. When Dr A clarified what this meant, he agreed that he would only want certain people looking after him, and that having a lot of carers would be difficult.  When Dr A said to him that it would be impossible to provide care at home with only one carer, PH said &#8220;I would deal with it&#8221;.   </p>

When Dr A asked him what would happen if R could not look after him, PH said that he would see if someone else could come and look after him.  He said he thought it would be alright if there were several carers.  He then spoke of how R owed him money - &#163;1m &#8211; and then went on to say &#8220;R would have to come and look after me&#8221;.

He concludes that PH is unable to process complex information due to inattention, lack of concentration and lack of cognitive function. In Dr A&#8217;s opinion, his residence and care needs amount to complex information.  PH, in Dr A&#8217;s view, clearly cannot understand his need for intense twenty four hour care&#8221;.  Dr A further believes that his ability to retain information is limited because of his prominent short term memory impairment.  As to the capacity to use or weigh up the information, he concludes: &#8220;PH has prominent attention difficulties and lack of concentration which severely impair his ability to weigh up information. He can clearly decide whether he wants to drink or a cup of tea but on more complex matters such as where he is residing [he] is unable to understand and process and assess the difficulties that are involved in such a decision.&#8221;  Dr A accepts, however, that while finding speech difficult, PH has the ability to communicate a decision.   </p>

He reiterated in reply to Miss Davidson on behalf of the local authority that PH is very limited in insight about his care needs. While he says that he is able to manage it, Dr A does not think he appreciates the extent of those needs.  Cross examined by Miss Morris on behalf of the Official Solicitor, Dr A acknowledged that there is an emotional element in the question of future residence but &#8220;there are other processes going on&#8221;.  Miss Morris also asked whether, if PH lacked the capacity to make a decision about his residence at this stage, he could acquire such capacity at a later date by the concrete experience of being at home with carers.  Dr A thought this was unlikely.   </p>

He no longer has the mental ability to evaluate the practicalities that this would entail, and lacks the insight required to assess the overall situation.&#8221;  Like Dr A, Dr B addresses in his report the four specific features of capacity in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/3/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3(1)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref>.   Like Dr A, Dr B believes that PH has the ability to express himself but is lacking in respect of the other three features.  He describes how during his visit on 9 May, PH repeatedly asked the charge nurse for some chocolate and was unable to recall her repeated explanation that they had run out of stock and that  had sent out for more.  Dr B observes that as PH is unable to understand that there is no chocolate in the building, he is &#8220;equally incapable of understanding the far more complex issues relating to where he is to live&#8221;. Given that he was unable to recall what he had been told about the chocolate, he would, in Dr B&#8217;s view, be equally unable to retain any information regarding the issue surrounding where he is to live. Furthermore, Dr B believes that he cannot process even the simplest of information.   Dr B concludes: &#8220;my assessment is unequivocal.  PH does not currently have capacity and will never regain it.&#8221;   </p>

According to Dr C, he was not orientated in time, although he was to place and person, and his short term memory was significantly impaired.  Dr C concluded that PH was not able to weigh up the information concerning his future residence due to poor insight into his physical and mental health condition adding to the limitation of his own capabilities and what his care needs entail.  Dr C observes: &#8220;this lack of insight and understanding of limitations prevented him from balancing the pros and cons remaining at Y Court&#8221;. </p>

He insisted to Dr C that he was able to do things for himself, which he manifestly is unable to do.  Dr C pointed out that the swallowing problems are particularly acute, given that one third of people with HD die with problems of aspiration or associated pneumonia.  Cross-examined by Miss Morris, Dr C described how he had discussed this issue with PH.  He had told him that according to staff he was now having difficulty with swallowing and eating but for PH, it was &#8220;not a problem&#8221;.  In Dr C&#8217;s opinion, this minimisation of the problem demonstrates his lack of understanding  as to his care needs and his incapacity to weigh up the pros and cons involved in the decision about his future residence.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0in">Dr Rickards himself acknowledged that his assessment suggested that PH was more capacitous than had appeared from the assessments carried out by the other doctors.  He suggested that this could have been because he perceived the others as being opposed to his wish to return home, or associated in some way with the regime at Y Court, and was therefore less inclined to cooperate with them.  Having had the benefit of hearing Dr Rickards&#8217; evidence first, and having heard him express this suggestion, I looked carefully for evidence of this in the testimony of the other witnesses. I found little to support that view.  In particular, Dr A and D, his allocated social worker, knew PH before he was admitted to Y Court, and were clear that his lack of capacity pre-dated his admission.  I think it unlikely that their earlier conversations with him could have been influenced in the way suggested by Dr Rickards. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0in">Although neither Dr A nor Dr B nor Dr C has a curriculum vitae as academically distinguished as Dr Rickards, in my view they each have obvious and valuable expertise in HD.  Interestingly, each of them brings a slightly different type of expertise to the case &#8211; Dr A as a consultant psychiatrist specialising in old age and dementia, Dr. B as a GP but with a unique depth of expertise in HD through his years working at Y Court, and Dr C, with his expertise in mental capacity assessment and interest in medico-legal matters.  With respect to Dr Rickards, I consider that the overall expertise of Doctors A, B and C, coupled with their much greater experience of PH as a patient, justifies the court attaching greater weight to their combined views in this case.  In addition, D, although not as experienced as the clinicians, was to my mind a manifestly fair and perceptive witness whose opinion demands very great respect.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0in">All four of those witnesses &#8211; doctors A, B and C, plus D &#8211; are clear that PH lacks the capacity to make the decision as to his future residence. Specifically, I accept their evidence and I am satisfied that the evidence demonstrates that PH lacks capacity to understand and to weigh up many of the salient features involved in the decision as to his future residence.  Although he wants to go home, he has no understanding of what being at home would now be like.  I think that it is likely that he believes that, if he </p>

Although he has on occasions expressed an understanding that  he would have to receive a greater degree of care at home, I am satisfied that he has in fact no clear understanding of what it would be like to receive care twenty-four hours a day, from a range of different carers, some of whom he would like but others of whom he would undoubtedly dislike.  Although he has said different things at different times, I find on balance it is likely that he believes that R would continue to be his sole or at least his principal carer when in fact R has made it clear that this is not now an option.  PH has frequently asserted that it is &#8220;not a problem&#8221; and that he &#8220;will deal with it&#8221;.  To my mind, those assertions demonstrate that he lacks any real understanding of the complexities of his situation.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0in">On specific matters, I accept the evidence that PH lacks a true awareness of his need for personal care, in particular with eating because of the dangers of choking and aspirating food. I am also satisfied that he has little if any, appreciation of what will be involved in caring for him in other ways including when he is out in the community.   He is unaware of the extent of his own behavioural problems and therefore cannot appreciate how difficult it will be for carers to manage them.  He has increased problems with mobilisation, which requires support at a level that I anticipate he will find difficult to accept.  Although he said to Dr Rickards that he accepted that he needed twenty-four hour care, looking at the evidence as a whole, in particular evidence of his comments to others before and after Dr Rickards&#8217; interview, I do not believe that he has any real appreciation that this is what is involved.  Miss Morris submits that he knows that, if he wishes to remain at home, he will have to tolerate twenty-four hour care.  That submission, to my mind, is not supported by the evidence, considered as a whole.  On the contrary, I am satisfied that he is unable to consider the realities of what life will be like if he were to go home. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0in">I agree with the submissions advanced by Miss Davidson and Miss Scott on behalf of the local authority and Z Limited respectively to the effect that PH has little appreciation of the nature of his condition, or of the deterioration in his capabilities or of the extend of his needs, including his need to be kept safe or that he needs to be looked after by a team of appropriately-trained and experienced carers to meet his complex needs.  I agree with Miss Scott that he does not really know what going home means.  The evidence, in particular that of Dr A, satisfies me that he has no real understanding of the fact that living at home broke down last year, or the reasons why it broke down, and therefore has no awareness of the risk that it would break down again should he return there.  Dr Rickards candidly conceded that he had not seen evidence that PH could weigh up the pros and cons of a move home. I am satisfied, on the evidence of the professionals taken as a whole, that he lacks that capacity. I agree with Miss Scott that there is nothing before the court on which I could say that he has the capacity to weigh up and use information even if he has the ability to understand and retain it.   </p>

Accordingly, on the narrow question of the application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/21" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 21</ref>A, I find that PH lacks capacity in relation to the question on whether or not he should be accommodated in Y Court for the purposes of being given care and treatment.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0in">The evidence is also sufficient to lead me to the conclusion that PH lacks the capacity to make any decision as to his future residence or care.  I therefore make a declaration to that effect pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/15" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 15</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref>.  But Miss Morris, on behalf of the Official Solicitor, urges that, if I find that the circumstances are justified  in making such a declaration, I should express it as an interim declaration, for two reasons. First, the focus of the Official Solicitor&#8217;s case at this hearing has been on the application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/21" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 21</ref>A and he wishes to have the opportunity to adduce further evidence before a final declaration is made.  Secondly, given the terms of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(3)</ref> to which I have already referred, namely that a person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision unless all practicable steps to help him to do so have been taken without success, the court should not make a final declaration until further steps have been made to assist PH to acquire the capacity.  Although I have very considerable doubts as to whether it would ever be possible for PH to re-acquire the capacity to make decisions as to his future care and residence, I accept Miss Morris&#8217; submissions on this point.   </p>
