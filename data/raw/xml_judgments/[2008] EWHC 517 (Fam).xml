Their father had not given instructions to his lawyers that would enable them to consent to this course, but I took the view after hearing submissions that it was appropriate for the children to know how their application had been determined, whatever the end result.  None of the children asked to speak with me directly and in light of the advocacy provided on their behalf I did not offer that opportunity.</p>

During the marriage they lived in Worcestershire in a property which is still owned by the father.  The parties purchased a second property in France, the successor to which is a house in the village of Francescas.  In circumstances that are in dispute, the parties moved to France in July 2005 and initially lived together with their children in that property.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties&#8217; relationship deteriorated and it is apparent from the proceedings of the Tribunal de Grande Instance D&#8217;Agen that Mrs C made an application within that jurisdiction by a request dated 23 November 2006.  On  21 December 2006 and at a conciliation hearing that court authorised the pursuit of a divorce and acknowledged the parties&#8217; separation by assigning the French property to mother for her use with the children, granting father one month to re-locate.  The children&#8217;s normal residence was declared to be with their mother and, in the absence of agreement, their father was granted staying including holiday visiting rights with them.  The parties were to share parental authority and provision was made for maintenance.  It is apparent that there were further proceedings in Agen in February and July 2007 in respect of which I have seen no record but in any event there is as yet no agreement as to the nature and effect of any of the applications and orders that were made in any of the French hearings.</p>

In her statement of defence mother asserts that the move to France in 2005 was for a temporary purpose and that the children&#8217;s habitual residence remained in England and Wales.  In addition she asserts that their father abandoned them to go to Spain and exposed them to an intolerable situation which would persist were they to return.  She raises Article 13 defences including the objections of each of the children to their return.</p>

Almost nothing is now agreed between them.  The proceedings have been set down for hearing as near as possible to the time deadline that is prescribed and at the time of handing down this judgment neither party has obtained permission to adduce oral evidence.  It remains to be seen whether that will be necessary although sufficient time has been allowed to take account of the possibility that it will, should a judge grant permission for the same.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The one issue that differentiates this application from many others is that C(A) is now 16 and by reason of Article 4, the Convention has ceased to apply to him.  This court is not precluded from considering an application by father for his return but that has to be in the exercise of the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (Abduction: Child of 16)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] 2 FLR 51" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] 2 FLR 51</ref>).  On 13 February 2008 C(A)&#8217;s father confirmed through his counsel that he did indeed seek to pursue his return.  As is clear from the affidavit of Ms Hutchinson the children take a joint as well as a several view of these proceedings and there will arise real questions about the different considerations that the court will apply to C(A) in contrast to his younger siblings and the questions of discretion and enforcement that will in any event arise.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The position of C(A) is clear.  The Convention does not apply to him because of his age and different legal principles will be applied by this court when considering his father&#8217;s application for him to return.  Similarly, the question whether he should be separately represented within these proceedings is answered by the application of a different test from that relating to his brothers and sisters who are subject to the terms of the Convention.</p>

	  <num>16.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If I consider the test relating to C(A) I have no doubt that it is in his best interests to be a party to these proceedings and that he should be entitled to instruct the solicitor of his own choice.  He need not use a litigation friend unless he chooses to do so.  When I consider how the case that C(A) wants to put inter-relates with the case of his brothers and sisters (and that of each of his parents) I am persuaded that the separate representation of the younger children will add to the court&#8217;s understanding of the issues that arise under the Hague Convention.  There is little expense and delay in the separate representation of the C(B), D and P having regard to the representation of C(A), indeed their guardian ad litem could choose to use the same solicitor.  As to intrusion, that is the only real argument that father has once the debate about the test to be applied has been resolved.  I have considered this very carefully indeed: it is almost always a powerful argument, but on the facts of this case I have decided that it does not outweigh the benefit to be obtained from separate representation.</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.89in">&#8220;that children should be heard far more frequently in Hague Convention cases than has been the practice hitherto.  The only question is how this should be done.  It is plainly not good enough to say that the abducting parent, with whom the child is living, can present the child&#8217;s views to the court.  If those views coincide with the views of the abducting parent, the court will either assume that they are not authentically the child&#8217;s own or give them very little independent weight.  There has to be some means of conveying them to the court independently of the abducting parent.  </p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.89in">There are three ways of doing this. They range from full scale legal representation of the child, through the report of an independent CAFCASS officer or other professional, to a face to face interview with the judge.  In some European countries, notably Germany, it is taken for granted that the judge will see the child.  In this country, this used to be to be the practice under the old wardship system, but fell into disuse with the advent of professional court welfare who are more used to communicating with children than many judges.  The most common method is therefore an interview with a CAFCASS officer, who is not only skilled and experienced in talking with children but also, if practising in the High Court, aware of the limited compass within which the child&#8217;s views are relevant in Hague Convention cases.  In most cases, this should be enough.  In others, and especially when the child has asked to see the judge, it may also be necessary for the judge to hear the child.  Only in a few cases will full scale legal representation be necessary.  But whenever it seems likely that the child&#8217;s views and interests may not be properly presented to the court, and in particular where there are legal arguments which the adult parties are not putting forward, then the child should be separately represented.</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.89in">Hitherto, our courts have only allowed separate representation in exceptional circumstances.  And recently in <span style="font-style:italic">In re H (A Child)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2006/1247" uk:canonical="[2006] EWCA Civ 1247" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWCA Civ 1247</ref>, the view expressed in the Court of Appeal, that if the test for party status were to be revised in any direction, it should in future be more rather than less stringently applied.  But the Brussels II Revised Regulation requires us to look at the question of hearing children&#8217;s views afresh.  Rather than the issue coming up at a late stage in the proceedings, as has tended to take place up to now, European cases require the court to address at the outset whether and how the child is to be given the opportunity of being heard.  If the options are canvassed then and there and appropriate directions given, this should not be an instrument of delay.  CAFCASS officers and, in the few cases where this appropriate, children&#8217;s representatives are just as capable of moving quickly if they have to do so as anyone else.  The vice has been when children&#8217;s views have been raised very late in the day and seen as a &#8216;last ditch stand&#8217; on the part of the abducting parent.  This is not the place they should take in the proceedings.  There is no reason why the approach which should be adopted in European cases should not also be adopted in others.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;I would finally comment that &#8216;exceptional&#8217; or not, this is a highly unusual case.  Cases under the second paragraph of Article 12 are in any event few and far between.  They are the most &#8216;childcentric&#8217; of all child abduction cases and are very likely to be combined with the child&#8217;s objections.  As pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic">Re D</span>, it is for the court to consider at the outset how best to give effect to the obligation to hear the child&#8217;s views.  We are told that this is now routinely done through the specialist CAFCASS officers at the Royal Courts of Justice.  I accept entirely that children must not be given an exaggerated impression of the relevance and importance of their views in child abduction cases.  To order separate representation in all cases, even in all child&#8217;s objections cases, might be to send them the wrong messages.  But it would not send the wrong messages in the very small number of cases where settlement is argued under the second paragraph of Article 12.  These are the cases in which the separate point of view of the children is particularly important and should not be lost in the competing claims of the adults.  If this were to become routine there would be no additional delay.  In all other cases, the question for the directions judge is whether separate representation of the child will add enough to the court&#8217;s understanding of the issues that arise under the Hague Convention to justify the intrusion, the expense and the delay that may result.  I have no difficulty in predicting that in the general run of cases it will not.  But I would hesitate to use the word &#8216;exceptional&#8217;.

However expert any Cafcass officer may be in obtaining a child&#8217;s views, much will depend on the way that that officer elicits those views i.e. what questions he asks and how he interprets the answers. That officer is not able to advocate a child&#8217;s views within the proceedings and in particular to respond to the evidence and submissions as they unfold, giving the child&#8217; position where appropriate.  The process of reporting does not allow a child to engage in the proceedings.  It would also be emotionally harmful for any one of the older children, given their closeness in age, to be refused permission to be separately represented where another is permitted to be so.  For this court, that is a decisive factor having regard to the closeness of these children and the decision that I have already made in respect of C(A).</p>

This is not a case where the children are unaware of the issues or of their parents&#8217; very different stances.  Accordingly this is also not a case where the children will be exposed by the proceedings to issues with which they have not previously been involved and to that extent arguably already harmed.  By the nature of their ages and understanding and the events that have happened i.e. facts that have affected them as distinct from events that have yet to occur, the substance of the issues in these proceedings have already well and truly intruded into their lives.  It is difficult to see how their involvement in the proceedings to have advocated that which they already very firmly express can be any more intrusive or harmful for them.  The very partiality of their position and their parents&#8217; positions will cause them harm, not their involvement as parties to the proceedings.    They already oppose their father and not having the opportunity to say what they think and why they think it is more likely in my judgment to cause them harm than allowing them to express their views and wishes and to have their positions advocated professionally by their lawyers.</p>
