In it, I made findings of fact about the circumstances surrounding the death of Poppi Worthington in December 2012.  The judgment also raised issues about the manner in which her death had been investigated.</span></p>

In October 2014, the family proceedings ended with the making of orders in relation to the other children of the family.  In the same month a coroner&#8217;s inquest was held in circumstances that provoked criticism.   Steps now have been taken to secure a fresh inquest.  A Serious Case Review is also in progress.  A reporting restriction order, the current version being dated 14 January 2015, is in force.  On 16 March 2015, Cumbria Constabulary announced that criminal proceedings are not to be taken against either of Poppi&#8217;s parents.  On 30 March 2015, I directed that a hearing should be listed to consider an anticipated application by the father that the findings of the fact contained in the March 2014 judgment should be reconsidered.  I decided that the fact-finding judgment should not be published in the meantime.</span></p>

The application, which amounted to an application for a rehearing was supported by the Children's Guardian, but opposed by the local authority and the mother.  Having considered the parties' submissions, I gave my decision that there should be a further examination of the medical evidence at a hearing later this year.  I now give reasons.  In the circumstances, I will say no more than is necessary to explain my conclusion to those who did not argue for it.</span></p>

Opinions have now been given by Dr Nathaniel Cary (pathologist) and Dr Liina Kiho (histopathologist).  Their views diverge in a number of respects from those of Dr Armour.  An opinion has also been obtained from Dr Victoria Aziz, who is described as a forensic examiner.  </span></p>

On behalf of the local authority and the mother, it is said that the issues are ones of nuance and interpretation that do not amount to a reason for reopening the matter.  It is also said that the process by which the new evidence was gathered may have had shortcomings.</span></p>

In particular, it contains an alternative unifying hypothesis for the post-mortem appearances.  That hypothesis was not overlooked at the earlier hearing, but it did not receive the degree of attention that is now being paid to it.  Arguments about any consequences arising from the process by which the further opinions were obtained cannot be resolved without significant further inquiry, and a decision on the father&#8217;s application should not in my view be postponed for that to occur. </span></p>

There is a public and private interest in litigation being final.  The impact of a renewal of the litigation on the family members can be significant, as is undoubtedly the case here.  Further proceedings are also expensive, in this case to the public, and consume court time that is needed for other cases.</span></p>

The first is by way of an application to appeal out of time on the basis of fresh evidence.  The second is by way of an application to the trial court for a rehearing.  In this case, the latter course has been selected.  It is argued on behalf of the mother that the former course would have been better.  However, it is acknowledged that the appeal route would be likely to lengthen the overall process in circumstances where the earliest resolution is in the interests of the children.  In the overall circumstances, and bearing in mind that this court has had an ongoing involvement since the conclusion of the care proceedings because of issues of publicity, I find that the father's application is appropriately made here.</span></p>

The new evidence must be such that it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, though it need not be decisive, and it must be apparently credible, though it need not be incontrovertible.

By this I mean something more than the mere fact that different judges might on occasions reach different conclusions on the same evidence ... The court will want to know ... whether there is any new evidence or information casting doubt on the accuracy of the original findings."</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">  To this, the President added that </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">"one does not get beyond the first stage unless there is some real reason to believe that the earlier findings require revisiting.  Mere speculation and hope are not enough.  There must be solid grounds for challenge.  But for my own part I would be disinclined to set the test any higher."</span></p>

However, I have expressed a provisional view that it should be published at or around the time that the rehearing begins, rather than it being withheld until that hearing ends.  There is a proper public interest in the course that these proceedings, and the other procedures surrounding Poppi&#8217;s death, have taken.  The media will be able to describe matters more effectively if the original findings can be described at the point when they come under review.  I have also raised the possibility of the further hearing taking place in public.  I will hear from the parties and the media about these issues at the next directions hearing. </span></p>
