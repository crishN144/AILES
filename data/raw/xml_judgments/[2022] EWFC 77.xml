The facts of that case has some resonance with the circumstances in this case.  The violation of the child&#8217;s rights occurred because the domestic court was unable to require a putative father to take a DNA test and the law prevented the court from drawing inferences. This resulted in the child being trapped in a legal limbo where the proceedings continued without resolution of the question of her identity.  This led to a violation of both Article 8 in respect of her private life and Article 6 in respect of the right to fair trial.</p>
