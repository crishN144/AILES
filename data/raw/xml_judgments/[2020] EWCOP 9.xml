At the successful conclusion of the litigation the person in whom trust is reposed then suggests a further transaction out of which its associate will derive a personal benefit. The adviser suggests that a private trust is the preferable arrangement, and that its associated trust corporation should be appointed trustee and should charge for acting, although there are many other trust corporations who could fulfil the role. So the client is retained for the long term.&#8221; [paragraph 28]  </p>

Irrespective of whether any party to the process has or lacks the relevant capacity, conveyancing is a necessary part of purchase or sale of property. A deputy&#8217;s authority to purchase or sell property on behalf of P can therefore only be effective if it incorporates authority to complete the conveyancing process on P&#8217;s behalf. That the process is unlikely to be administered by the deputy personally is within the ordinary understanding of permitted delegation.      </p>

To that extent, characterising any requirement to &#8220;draft and advise in relation to employment contracts relating to a business belonging to P&#8221; as &#8220;unexceptional&#8221; is something of a stretch. Moreover, it is the experience of the central registry that applicants for deputyship in such circumstances generally seek specific authority to deal with the business, and the authorisations granted are individually framed for the needs of the particular case.

I am not persuaded that it suggests anything about what tasks a deputy is authorised to do on behalf of P.

I am conscious of the vagueness of the term. Seeking legal advice will be obviously an &#8220;ordinary&#8221; part of discharging some functions of deputyship but not others. This is what I understand the Official Solicitor to be saying when she takes the position that obtaining advice on behalf of P will sometimes be within the &#8220;general&#8221; authority, and will sometimes require specific authority. The effect is the same. In respect of non-contentious matters, the deputy&#8217;s approach should be to ask themselves if the subject of the advice is within their authority ie will their existing authority be sufficient to act on the advice if taken? If it is, then seeking advice is likely to be an &#8216;ordinary&#8217; part of that function. If it is not, seeking advice is likely to be outside their authority.  </p>

Moreover, the deputy will be required as part of the normal best interests decision making process to consider whether the cost of the advice/work is proportionate to P&#8217;s estate and the importance of the issue to P; and to evidence that decisionmaking process. Any costs will be either limited to fixed rates or subject to SCCO assessment. In my judgment, those requirements are a proportionate means of protecting P&#8217;s interests. It is not helpful for me to &#8216;fix&#8217; a financial limit to the non-contentious legal tasks within a deputy&#8217;s authority (subject to conflict of interest considerations below). In any case where the deputy is in doubt, of course application to the Court can and should be made.      </p>

As concluded above, conduct of proceedings requires specific authorisation but there is necessarily a stage before proceedings are embarked upon, when a capacitous person or a deputy on behalf of P needs to form a view about whether it is appropriate to go down the path of litigation. When such a need arises, it is common to respond by seeking legal advice.

The evidence of merits need not always be in the form of independent counsel&#8217;s opinion but most commonly it will be.

I acknowledge that a &#8216;standard&#8217; approach has the attraction of clarity but the current concern is to address the risks of conflict of interest. Perversely, a &#8216;standard&#8217; authority may act as an incentive for a deputy to find occasions to instruct his own firm to &#8216;use up&#8217; this sanctioned source of business. Moreover, once the early stages of advice have been obtained, that fact in itself is likely to have an impact on any later consideration of whether it is in P&#8217;s best interests for advice/tasks to be obtained from a different source. As Ms. Clement put it, &#8220;it is almost always in P&#8217;s best interests to avoid duplication.&#8221; In my judgment, the concerns about standardised authority of a threshold for instructing a deputy&#8217;s own firm outweigh its merits. </p>

The Official Solicitor points out that there is a conditional fee agreement in place in respect of HPP&#8217;s damages proceedings. The original agreement was signed by the original litigation friend &#8211; HPP&#8217;s then partner. However, an amended CFA was subsequently entered into by the next litigation friend, Michael Knott. This second (current) version included an increased success fee (20%) [<span style="font-weight:bold">D79</span>] even though by then liability had been admitted. The Official Solicitor points out that the <span style="font-style:italic">only</span> person able to decide whether or not to enter into this new agreement on behalf of HPP was Michael Knott, who was at the time a partner in Irwin Mitchell LLP and a Director of Irwin Mitchell Trust Corporation. With no external control at all, the conflict of interest could not be clearer. The Official Solicitor considers that, if she were acting as litigation friend for HPP, it is &#8220;certainly possible that she could obtain terms for [him] which are better than those presently being  offered to him by Irwin Mitchell&#8221; [<span style="font-weight:bold">position statement paragraph 31</span>].     </p>
