The wife has incurred total legal fees of &#163;463,331. The husband has incurred total legal fees of &#163;159,044. The total amounts spent by the parties, but in particular by the wife, in this not particularly large or complex case, are depressingly disproportionate and I shall make some further comments below on this subject.</p>

My impression of him is that he is a driven character with an addictive personality - his character carries with it the plus side of entrepreneurial energy (and he has had some success in this regard) and the minus side of a tendency to engage in addictive activities and to take personal and financial risks and live life &#8216;close to the line&#8217;.</p>

Her role in the marriage was largely as a home-maker and she has not had paid employment for a very long time (save in a largely notional capacity within the husband&#8217;s business in a way which provided tax advantages). My impression of her is that she is a colourful, generous and expansive character, but with a tendency to financial indiscipline and poor decision-making. </p>

	    <p class="NoSpacing" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2019 the wife discovered a &#8216;burner&#8217; mobile telephone which, on inspection, revealed that the husband had very regularly been secretly visiting prostitutes in the months and years leading up to that point. This discovery very understandably caused major distress for the wife and the shadow of the discovery and its consequences continues to this day to resonate in the parties&#8217; acrimonious dealings with each other. The husband immediately evinced a degree of remorse for his behaviour and quickly sought to remedy the situation by leaving the family home and attending a month long general addiction programme at the Priory Clinic followed by a shorter sex addiction programme at the Paula Hall Clinic, although the wife was later convinced that these attendances were no more than insincere &#8216;window dressing&#8217;. A brief attempt at a reconciliation in October/November 2019, following these attendances, was not successful and the parties have lived separately since then, the wife remaining in the family home, initially with the children and then on her own. The husband rented accommodation in London for some time, but more recently has occupied the parties&#8217; holiday home in Spain. The husband has a new non-cohabiting partner who lives in London. The wife remains single.</p>

In the period after that, all this money has been dissipated. These events, and the allegations and counter-allegations arising out of them, have made the prosecution of the financial remedies proceedings yet more acrimonious than they might otherwise have been.</p>

As is recorded on the face of my order for that day, I urged the parties nonetheless to engage in some form of non-court dispute resolution such as a private FDR before trial; but these thoughts appear to have fallen on deaf ears and a depressing feature of this case is that it has reached trial without any of the normal structured attempts at settlement.</p>

It is part of the picture and I do not make light of it. I do not accept, however, that this adequately excuses or explains the wife&#8217;s failure to engage properly in negotiation over a long period. Having seen her giving oral evidence I have the very clear impression that her mindset is that she has preferred to incur a grossly disproportionate level of legal costs pursuing combative litigation without any real care for the effect of this on the remaining pool of assets and its ability to meet both parties&#8217; future needs. I have the clear impression that she feels justified in conducting herself in this way, seeing it as a just punishment for the sins of the husband; but she cannot expect fully to escape from the financial consequences of this decision-making. </p>

On 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2022 an order for sale of a property owned by the parties was made by consent. This was an obviously sensible step to take because this property was standing empty and its sale enabled a sum of more than &#163;1,000,000 to be used to reduce the mortgage on the family home, the interest on which was having a draining effect on the parties&#8217; resources. A buyer was found and was ready to proceed, but the wife actively sought to renege on the previous consent order at the hearing before me on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2022 and, even after I ruled against her on that, she was sufficiently slow in executing the documents on the sale that I had to sign them on her behalf under Senior Courts Act 1981, section 39. Her issues with anxiety/stress/depression may have contributed to her failures here, but, again, it is not an adequate explanation or excuse.</p>

I do not exempt the husband from this criticism; but one egregious example of the lack of restraint is the inclusion in the wife&#8217;s narrative section 25 statement of large tranches of allegations of coercive and controlling behaviour by the husband during the marriage, notwithstanding the consensual prior directions orders which made clear that this issue was not being pursued. The comments of Peel J in <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">WC v HC</span><span style="color:#000000"> [2022] EWFC 22 have resonance here: &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Parties, and their legal advisers, may be under the impression that to describe the other party in pejorative terms, and seek to paint an unfavourable picture, will assist their case.

Of course I am not privy to the privileged conversations between the wife and her Solicitors, and it is difficult for a trial judge to know exactly the cause of such a matter, but it is on any view hugely disappointing to note that a Solicitor, who was well aware of the consensual prior directions on conduct allegations, would draft a statement in this way or would fail to prevent a statement to be presented with these contents.</span></p>

In essence it is a business which is the entrepreneurial initiative of the husband and is run by him as managing director.. The legal structure of the business has a number of complications (with a number of dormant companies); but for present purposes it is unnecessary to go further than to note that the wife and the husband own 50% each of the shares in a holding company which itself owns 100% of the shares in the company which is in essence the trading operation and where any value which exists actually lies. It is common ground that all the holding company shares (together with the other shares she holds in dormant operations) should be transferred to the husband from the wife under a property adjustment order such that, whatever else happens, the husband will become the sole owner of the business.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span class="within-new" style="color:initial">Ms Kate Hart has carried out a careful valuation exercise of the trading operation and concluded that if it was sold as a going concern its value would be based on an asset based valuation of &#163;317,262. I note that &#163;144,408 out of the &#163;317,262 worth of assets on the balance sheet consists of the husband&#8217;s Director&#8217;s Loan Account so, to him, that would rather depress the value of the shares. Further, Ms Hart accepted that to a significant extent the husband&#8217;s personal presence in the business was an important part of its success, such that selling it on his retirement as a going concern may have its difficulties. A valuation on an EBITDA x Multiplier basis would, in Ms Hart&#8217;s view, produce a lower result, hence her reliance on the asset based valuation. Her EBITDA calculation produces a relatively low figure, notwithstanding an estimated maintainable turnover of &#163;2,230,000 per annum &#8211; the business appears to exist on fairly modest margins with high business expenses. There was no credible evidence of any serious attempt by the husband to sell the business as a going concern and, on a balance of probabilities, my view is that it is likely that he will continue to run the business for the foreseeable future such that it is more appropriate for me to treat it in my analysis here as an income producing asset rather than as a capital asset. I shall build into my assessment the income the business is likely to produce (and, of course, it may perform better or worse than expected). I do not ignore the possibility that, one day, he may be able to sell it as a going concern, but for the present and foreseeable future it is in my view not appropriate to treat this business as a realisable asset. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span class="within-new" style="color:initial">The substantive challenge by Mr Warshaw to Ms Hart&#8217;s analysis was not to query any of her accountancy methodology or conclusions, but to assert that her findings were of no particular help because the husband has routinely &#8216;skimmed&#8217; cash from the business for many years, perhaps to the extent of &#163;20,000 per month, and that the husband&#8217;s presentation of the real business income figures to Ms Hart, as well as his presentation of the profit figures to HMRC, were hugely fraudulent. This assertion is vehemently denied by the husband. I have given this matter very careful consideration and, it must be said, there is some evidence which points in the direction of Mr Warshaw&#8217;s case. It is clear that the household did operate on &#8216;cash&#8217; for many purposes for many years &#8211; for example it was accepted that there was c &#163;40,000 in cash in the house when the marriage finally broke down, it was accepted that one of their daughter&#8217;s school friends in 2013 discovered more than &#163;10,000 in cash in her school gym bag in 2013 which was placed there in error by the husband and it was accepted that the parties paid private school fees in cash for some years (apparently and understandably to the alarm of the school bursar). The question I have to answer, however, is whether (having heard both parties&#8217; written and oral accounts of this) this was cash which was legitimately drawn for spending from properly accounted places or was cash &#8216;skimmed&#8217; from the business in a dishonest way amounting to unlawful tax evasion. Ms Hart found nothing in her investigation to enable her to conclude that tax evasion was occurring, though accepted that her investigation fell short of an &#8216;audit&#8217;. Mr Warshaw pursued an argument to the effect that the parties&#8217; lifestyle (private school fees, large mortgage, expensive holidays, Bentley and Land Rover motor cars etc.) pointed in the direction of dishonest conduct, and I found some force in his submissions to this effect; but on the other hand the danger in this approach is that there were better years in the business when a high lifestyle was affordable and there was also use of capital (pension drawdowns, director&#8217;s loan account drawings, borrowings) the combination of which perhaps makes it difficult to draw a clear conclusion from a lifestyle versus tax return declared income comparison in any particular year. Further, as we discussed in the course of oral submissions, a conclusion that the cash lifestyle was part of a fraudulent and long-standing tax evasion scheme might lead to a reference by me of this business to the HMRC (I have received helpful submissions on this from both counsel, citing cases such as </span><span class="within-new" style="font-style:italic;color:initial">A v A; B v B</span><span class="within-new" style="color:initial"> [2000] 1 FLR 701, </span><span class="within-new" style="font-style:italic;color:initial">S v S</span><span class="within-new" style="color:initial"> [1997] 2 FLR 774 and </span><span class="within-new" style="font-style:italic;color:initial">Y v Z</span><span class="within-new" style="color:initial"> [2014] 2 FLR 1311) under which the husband may be the main target, but the wife might also be tainted, causing her not to be immune from recoupment by HMRC of unpaid tax in the civil or even criminal courts, representing the benefits that she has gained from what has happened. On balance, whilst there are areas of uncertainty here, I have concluded that it has not been established on a balance of probabilities that the unorthodox use of cash by this family fell into the category of dishonest tax evasion and I therefore propose to accept the evidence of Ms Hart about the business and to reject the case advanced by Mr Warshaw to the effect that the parties were engaged in longstanding and substantial fraudulent tax evasion. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1in"><span class="within-new" style="color:initial">A significant portion of the money was taken by the wife from the bank as cash (c.&#163;150,000) and spent. Some of the spending was on routine day to day matters. Other parts of the spending, I think probably the majority, was on luxuries and unnecessary purchases &#8211; expensive jewellery and clothes, expensive hotels and meals out, a huge number of taxi fares. The wife&#8217;s own oral evidence contained many examples of concessions on this and she was expressly unrepentant. She regarded the money as having been given to her in compensation for the husband&#8217;s behaviour and her mindset was, in her own words: &#8220;</span><span class="within-new" style="font-style:italic;color:initial">I was reckless, yes, but it was my money&#8230;I was an aggrieved wife. I spent a lot on clothes and indulged my children. I was pissed off with my husband&#8230;It was my money to do with what I thought fit&#8230;I stayed at the Hotel de Paris in Monaco at more than &#163;1,000 per night&#8230;I spent &#163;10,000 on bangles at the Harrods store at the airport&#8230;.I spent &#163;2,000 on a leather jacket</span><span class="within-new" style="color:initial">&#8221;. It is not possible to inventorise this spending with any degree of precision, but a large amount of money was undoubtedly dissipated in the spirit of vengeance against the husband&#8217;s use of prostitutes. In reaching this conclusion I should also note that in the period since the separation the husband has also not obviously economised in his life-style spending. Whilst his spending was less scrutinised in the hearing than that of the wife, I think that he did make some spending decisions which were consistent with a fairly high post-separation life-style and it is also correct to note that he has not paid any maintenance to the wife since separation and has not (at all) honoured the obligation imposed upon him (by consent) in the order of Recorder Campbell KC dated 19</span><span class="within-new" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:initial">th</span><span class="within-new" style="color:initial"> April 2022 to pay maintenance of &#163;1,500 per month subsequent to the completion of the sale of the property in June 2022.</span></p>

Mr Warshaw has sought to persuade me that I should regard the money taken back from the children as a loan of monies that should be regarded as binding and enforceable &#8211; and the wife has produced a pro forma loan agreement to support that argument. I do not accept the wife&#8217;s case on this. I have not been persuaded that the taking back of monies lodged in the children&#8217;s respective accounts amounted to the advance of a loan by them. My conclusion is that the money at all times remained the property of the wife and was parked in the children&#8217;s account as cover if she was pushed by the husband and the money was retaken as and when she felt she needed it. Even if I am wrong about, and that there is an argument for saying these are enforceable debts, I am satisfied that it is fanciful to think that the children will pursue legal proceedings against their mother for the return of the monies &#8211; the wife accepted in her oral evidence that such a scenario was highly unlikely and I agree, these are at best very soft debts which are very unlikely ever to be pursued. Whilst the children are not formally bound by this decision (since they are not parties to this case) I think it highly unlikely that they will ever seek to argue that the money parked fairly briefly in their accounts really was their property for which they can demand its return.</span></p>

He returned some of it to the wife when she needed it for &#8216;living expenses&#8217;. He then paid a large number of the wife&#8217;s Solicitors&#8217; bills in sums which in total substantially outweigh what he was given for safekeeping. On the wife&#8217;s case a full account has been given by him in a document (p.614 in the bundle) which reconciles the transactions and concludes that the wife owes him &#163;99,807. I have not been persuaded that this accounting document is inaccurate, indeed I find on a balance of probabilities that it represents a genuine and accurate assessment of the situation. I have not been persuaded that the wife&#8217;s brother retains any money by way of safekeeping. In the course of the evidence I heard a good deal about the wife&#8217;s purchase of a Patek Philippe watch for &#163;63,000 from her brother. Mr Newman sought to persuade me that it was a sham transaction. Even if it was at the time a sham transaction, the wife&#8217;s case (which I accept) is that she returned the watch to her brother and, in effect, the transaction (if it ever existed) was cancelled and the &#163;63,000 allegedly paid for the watch was diverted towards paying her Solicitors&#8217; bills. My conclusion is that the watch purchase was, in the context of this case, something of a red herring; though the fact that it was ever contemplated does cast some light on the wife&#8217;s financial indiscipline. I am satisfied that the wife does have to repay her brother the money owed to him and that this cannot be properly regarded as a soft debt.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.12in"><span class="within-new" style="color:initial">On the first day of the hearing, however, I was informed by Mr Newman that the husband had recently discovered that his Royal London pension has the benefit of an old style guaranteed annuity rate of 9.45% such that, if he converted the fund of &#163;326,764 into an annuity now, he would receive an immediate income of &#163;30,898 per annum on a single life level payment basis. At the time of the PODE report the purchase of a single life level payment basis would have produced, according to the report, an annuity return of 4.417% per annum; but this was before recent political/market events have caused a rise in gilt rates and a linked rise in annuity rates such that the equivalent figure now would be somewhere between 6% and 6.5% &#8211; it is of course anybody&#8217;s guess at the time of writing as to where these figures will move in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, in the search for fairness, my view is that I should enhance the value of the Royal London pension policy in my asset schedule by 1.5 times to reflect its real value, hence I shall enter a figure of &#163;490,146 rather than &#163;326,764. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1in"><span class="within-new" style="color:initial">The discovery of the guaranteed annuity rate has substantially undermined the conclusions of the PODE report. Not only is the figurework for the production of an equal incomes outcome largely redundant; but also it must be noted that making a pension sharing order against a pension with a guaranteed annuity rate is hugely destructive to its real value - the portion externally transferred to another pension scheme would simply lose the hugely advantageous guaranteed annuity rate in the transfer &#8211; and a pension sharing order is not thus an attractive option.</span></p>

I am unaware who was at fault. Should the PODE have been given this information by the husband? Should the PODE have been given this information by the pension administrators? What questions should have been asked of the pension administrators which were not asked? Whoever was responsible for this, for the purposes of this case the &#8216;equal incomes&#8217; conclusions of the PODE report now have to be treated as largely unhelpful.</p>

The wife would be dependent on the husband&#8217;s decision as to when an annuity was taken (there is no power to order that he takes it any particular time) and, if he died early, the annuity and the wife&#8217;s share of the annuity would die with him. Further, there may be tax issues if he took the annuity at the same time as he continued to earn above the higher tax rate threshold. Further, such an order would also be subject to future variation applications and, in view of the way this litigation has proceeded, I am wary of setting up a situation which might end up in more litigation.<span class="within-new" style="color:initial"> Mr Newman has suggested the payment of a lump sum in cash (or a different distribution of cash resources to create a Duxbury fund for the wife) may be the best way of dealing with this. I have in the end favoured this way forward, though not using Mr Newman&#8217;s suggested figure of &#163;150,000 for these purposes. </span></p>

There may also be some scope in due course for him to pay himself some dividends as well, but reducing the director&#8217;s loan account may be a priority.

Housing needs barely featured in the course of the evidence and submissions in this case; but I can identify no reason why their housing needs should be any different from each other. Each have put forward property particulars and the range is &#163;875,000 to &#163;1,250,000 and SDLT and other purchase costs will be payable on their respective purchases. As ever, the range in these prices represents a range of factors such as size, location and attractiveness, but whilst the upper end of this range may be more representative of how the parties have lived during the marriage (though still well short of even that), it may be that each of the parties will have to be looking towards the bottom end of this range, or perhaps even a little lower, as a result of a combination of high legal costs and poor spending decisions in the past. I am satisfied that housing at the bottom end of the range, or even a little lower, would not fall short of meeting essential housing need for either party.</span></p>

As is often the case in these disputes, the income needs figures advanced on each side bear very little relationship to the amount of income actually available. On my analysis the only earned income available going forward is (until 2029) the husband&#8217;s earned income (which I have assessed at &#163;63,661 per annum net or &#163;5,305 pcm net). The only income (from 2029 onwards) is the annuity income on the respective pensions, which will, on any view, be a significant diminution in the earned income figure. Yet the income needs figures put forward are, respectively, &#163;76,860 per annum or &#163;6,405 pcm for the wife and &#163;108,000 per annum or &#163;9,000 pcm for the husband. The simple truth is that neither party is likely to be able to live at the level which they may previously have enjoyed.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.12in">Given the respective earning capacities, the limitations on pension sharing orders here and the desirability of not leaving open income orders which are capable of giving rise to future variation applications, I think there is a strong justification for a departure from equality here based on the provision of an adequate Duxbury fund for the wife to use as her source of income in the years ahead, on top of her housing need, and I take the view that this is the solution which sits most easily here with the court&#8217;s duties under Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, section 25A to bring about a clean break. Whilst I could make a spousal periodical payments order, the acrimonious litigation spending in this case makes it unattractive for me to leave open a position where there could be further litigation, for example on a spousal periodical payments variation application or a future capitalisation argument. Using At a Glance Duxbury tables (the figures for a female aged 59) I have concluded that it is reasonable for me to say that the wife has a need for a Duxbury fund of something in the region of &#163;421,000 providing an income for life (including her state pension) of &#163;30,000 per annum on top of her housing needs. Part of this could be from pension funds (provided I avoid a pension sharing order on the Royal London policy). In assessing a division which meets the wife&#8217;s housing and income needs I have in mind my comments above about a litigant who overspends on legal costs having to meet needs at a lower level than might otherwise be the case and I am cognisant of the fact that &#163;200,000 is included on the wife&#8217;s side of the asset schedule which is notional rather than actual. I am also cognisant that, as far as the figures allow it, part of the Duxbury fund can be treated as being provided for out of the wife&#8217;s notional half share of the assets &#8211; she &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">should be required to amortise, that is to say, to spend, her Duxbury fund</span>&#8221;: see Mostyn J in <span style="font-style:italic">CB v KB</span> [2020] 1 FLR 795.  </p>

This solution avoids another complicated transaction and all the uncertainty that arises out of that. It will, in due course, be open to him to sell it if he so wishes and he will take any advantage from a sale at a better than expected value and any disadvantage from a sale at a worse than expected value. If he decides to sell the Spanish property and concentrate on an English house purchase then, perhaps with a little short-term borrowing, he should be able to meet his housing need at the level discussed above.</p>

	      <p class="NoSpacing" style="margin-left:1in">I have been asked to consider whether the husband should give an indemnity to the wife in relation to the transfer of the business to the husband. I consider that he should give such an indemnity for the payment of any Capital Gains Tax on the transfer, but only on the basis that the presentation to the HMRC is on the basis of the valuation report by Ms Hart. If she felt obliged to present a different picture to the HMRC, and the tax liability ended up being commensurately higher, then I consider that the parties should be equally liable for any additional liability. I consider that the husband should be responsible for meeting any unpaid tax on pre-transfer dividends attributed to the wife.</p>

I note that such a claim was made, and I have no reason to believe it was not genuine, but if anything arises in this category it should fall equally between the parties.</p>
