The child concerned is D born in 2013. The court delivered a written judgment on 20 July 2020 following a contested hearing on 24 June 2020 concerning F&#8217;s application dated 14 October 2019 for child arrangements orders, specific issue orders and prohibited steps orders. The order drawn arising from that judgment has not been appealed by the M. </p>

Nonetheless, the F&#8217;s written submissions (drafted by his Counsel Ms Hartley) were helpfully sent to the M on 8 October 2020. At 8.41h on the morning of the hearing, due to start at 10h, M&#8217;s Direct Access Counsel Ms Tyler sent a position statement to the court. Until that morning it was not known that the M would have any legal representation. I am very grateful to Ms Tyler for providing a detailed document given her late instructions. The written documents and case law referred to by both Counsel has been of great assistance. </p>

For this reason we do not see that it has any direct relevance to family proceedings. (4)(c) can have no relevance to public law proceedings and can thus be disregarded in the present case. The other rules are simply examples of circumstances that will be relevant when considering the result that justice requires in the individual case. In family proceedings, however, there are usually special considerations that militate against the approach that is appropriate in other kinds of adversarial civil litigation. This is particularly true where the interests of a child are at stake. This explains why it is common in family proceedings, and usual in proceedings involving a child, for no order to be made in relation to costs. The reasons for  departing from the principle that costs normally follow the event differ, however, depending upon the nature of the family proceedings. On this appeal it is necessary to identify the policy considerations that should inform the approach to costs that is required in the interests of justice in care proceedings. </span></p>

Nor does it wish to reduce the chance of their co-operation around the future life of the child by casting one as the successful party entitled to his costs and another as the unsuccessful party obliged to pay them. The proposition applies in its fullest form to proceedings between parents and other relations; but it also applies to proceedings to which a local authority are a party. Thus, even when a local authority's application for a care order is dismissed, it is unusual to order them to pay the costs of the other parties." &#8230;&#8230;.. </span></p>

There are of course some wicked, neglectful, selfish or merely misguided parents who are not motivated to do their best for their children, but these are not the generality of parents, even those whose children are the subject of care proceedings. Local authorities are not motivated by love, in the way that parents are motivated by love, but they do have statutory duties to investigate and take action to protect children if there is reasonable cause to suspect them to be suffering or likely to suffer significant harm: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/47" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 47</ref>.

Children's lives do not stand still. Their needs change and develop as they grow up. The arrangements made to cater for those needs may also have to change. Parents need to be able to co-operate with one another after the case is over. Unless there is to be a closed adoption they also need to co-operate with the local authority and the people who are looking after their children. The local authority need to be able to co-operate with them. Stigmatising one party as the loser and adding to that the burden of having to pay the other party's costs is likely to jeopardise the chances of their co-operating in the future. </span></p>

Thus, for example, if a mother who is bringing up the children on modest means had not only to bear her own costs but also to pay the father's costs, when unsuccessfully resisting his application for more contact with the children, the principal sufferers might well be the children. Nor can it be ignored that, if local authorities are faced with having to pay the parents' costs as well as their own, there will be less in their budgets for looking after the children in their care, providing services for children in need, and protecting other children who are or may be at risk of harm&#8230;&#8230; </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0in"><span style="font-style:italic">[39] In my judgment, this jurisprudence permits the following conclusions to be drawn: (i.)Despite occasional references to a possible distinction between jurisdiction and discretion in the operation of CPR 3.1(7), there is in all probability no line to be drawn between the two. The rule is apparently broad and unfettered, but considerations of finality, the undesirability of allowing litigants to have two bites at the cherry, and the need to avoid undermining the concept of appeal, all push towards a principled curtailment of an otherwise apparently open discretion. Whether that curtailment goes even further in the case of a final order does not arise in this appeal. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in"><span style="font-style:italic">(ii.)The cases all warn against an attempt at an exhaustive definition of the circumstances in which a principled exercise of the discretion may arise. Subject to that, however, the jurisprudence has laid down firm guidance as to the primary circumstances in which the discretion may, as a matter of principle, be appropriately exercised, namely normally only (a) where there has been a material change of circumstances since the order was made, or (b) where the facts on which the original decision was made were (innocently or otherwise) misstated. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in"><span style="font-style:italic">(iii.)It would be dangerous to treat the statement of these primary circumstances, originating with Patten J and approved in this court, as though it were a statute. That is not how jurisprudence operates, especially where there is a warning against the attempt at exhaustive definition. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in"><span style="font-style:italic">(iv.)Thus there is room for debate in any particular case as to whether and to what extent, in the context of principle (b) in (ii) above, misstatement may include omission as well as positive misstatement, or concern argument as distinct from facts. In my judgment, this debate is likely ultimately to be a matter for the exercise of discretion in the circumstances of each case. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in"><span style="font-style:italic">(v.)Similarly, questions may arise as to whether the misstatement (or omission) is conscious or unconscious; and whether the facts (or arguments) were known or unknown, knowable or unknowable. These, as it seems to me, are also factors going to discretion: but where the facts or arguments are known or ought to have been known as at the time of the original order, it is unlikely that the order can be revisited, and that must be still more strongly the case where the decision not to mention them is conscious or deliberate. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in"><span style="font-style:italic">(vi.)Edwards v. Golding is an example of the operation of the rule in a rather different circumstance, namely that of a manifest mistake on the part of the judge in the formulation of his order. It was plain in that case from the master's judgment itself that he was seeking a disposition which would preserve the limitation point for future debate, but he did not realise that the form which his order took would not permit the realisation of his adjudicated and manifest intention. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in"><span style="font-style:italic">(vii.)The cases considered above suggest that the successful invocation of the rule is rare. Exceptional is a dangerous and sometimes misleading word: however, such is the interest of justice in the finality of a court's orders that it ought normally to take something out of the ordinary to lead to variation or revocation of an order, especially in the absence of a change of circumstances in an interlocutory situation. </span></p>

The F applied for a penal notice on 9 March 2020, which came before the court on 12 May 2020. On that day, my clerk tried to connect the M to the call three times but there was no response. The court gave the M an extension to 27 May 2020 to file her first statement (with a penal notice attached) and extended time for the second statement to be filed to 9 June 2020. The court further directed that the Children Act application should proceed on 24 June on the basis of oral submissions only, unless otherwise decided by the trial judge before the hearing. The order I made on 12 May 2020 records that F&#8217;s solicitors contacted M on nine separate occasions between 24 February 2020 and 11 May 2020 without receiving any response.

She knew from before that hearing that F had solicitors who were trying to engage her in the proceedings. The M has a demanding professional career and is highly intelligent. It is inconceivable that she had no mobile telephone for a &#8216;couple of months&#8217; as she asserts in her email on the day before the hearing. Her email sent to my clerk at 16.17h on the day before the hearing indicates she had tried to contact the Judge, the court and Ms Blake my clerk. No emails had been received by my clerk or myself, and M had Ms Blake&#8217;s email address in the order and used it on the day before the hearing. The M had email access, yet did not reply to the F&#8217;s solicitors countless [justified] communications. She chose to ignore the letters sent by the solicitors for F as she regarded them as harassing which they were not at all. </p>

The M has ignored these court proceedings hoping that they would go away. She has chosen not to communicate to the court until over 5 months later, the day before the hearing listed on 24.6.20. She has not made any attempts to email the F or his solicitor or the court &#8211; a simple email could have been sent setting out that she was ill and sought more time. The GP letter contains information that she had had symptoms of a viral illness. The assertion that she could not respond to court proceedings as a result is likely to have come from the mother. The letter does not say when the mother saw the GP for this illness, when the symptoms arose nor when it was diagnosed, the letter is merely dated 2 days prior to the court hearing. The mother was able to talk animatedly almost without stopping for an hour before me, she appeared very able to set out her case and arguments. It is not necessary to adjourn the final hearing. The M has had ample opportunity to read the papers, and put her case prior to the listed final hearing and has chosen not to. In any event I heard from her in detail and at length when she eventually arrived in the hearing on 24 June. </p>

When the statutory instruments are traced through, it becomes apparent that following the amendment to the rule by statutory instrument on 25 March 2002 the rule ceased to be an absolute rule. Had the intention been to restore that position, the word "general" would have been removed when the exceptions were added in 2008. Further, as noted above, the principle that costs follow the event does not apply in family proceedings. The exclusion of CPR 44.10(2) therefore fits logically into the wholly discretionary approach to costs in family proceedings and reinforces the view that, in referring to a "general rule" in CPR 44(1)(i), the intention of the draftsman was to leave the court with a residual discretion. </span></p>

The general &#8216;no order as to costs&#8217; refers to the preparation for and attendance at that hearing. It does not, for example, relate to the costs of preparing the statements directed by that order. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0.24in">On 20 January the M&#8217;s case was that the F presents an abduction risk, the order makes that clear at paragraph 7b. Given that issue, DJ Rollason (correctly) decided that it was necessary for there to be an expert instruction in order to determine the application. At the final hearing I found that there was no risk of abduction and I did not accept that the M had any genuine belief that the F would abduct D. In those circumstances I consider that it is just to include the costs of the expert report in the overall costs to be paid. It would be entirely <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">unjust</span> for the F to have to bear the entire costs of the expert given the issues at the FHDRA and my findings. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0.24in">The 12 May 2020 hearing was primarily concerned with the F&#8217;s application for a penal notice although also considered the F&#8217;s application to attend by videolink due to the advice then in force against international travel. The order made on that day included attaching a penal notice to the order of DJ Rollason in an effort to obtain evidence from the M. The costs of the hearing were reserved. The hearing would not have been necessary had the M complied with the order dated 20 January, and unfortunately, she did not comply with my order of 12 May despite the penal notice. </p>

In my judgment, taking all matters referred to herein into account, it is just to order her to make a contribution to the F&#8217;s costs in the sum of &#163;15,000. This is to be paid by 31 December 2020. </p>
