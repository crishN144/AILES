It was provided that RG was to be marketed for sale for &#8220;not less than &#163;8.5 million without agreement of the parties or further order from the Court&#8221; and, in relation to the property in Spain, that it shall be marketed for &#8220;&#163;3.75 million for six months and shall be sold for such price as may be agreed between the parties or, in default of such agreement, as determined by the court&#8221;.

RG had been valued at &#163;7.5 million and also &#163;7 &#8211; 8 million but the parties had been advised that it could reach &#163;10 million.  Indeed, each party had put in his/her Form E that the value of the property was &#163;10 million.  Red Book valuations were unsurprisingly lower.</p>

The wife had found a property (&#8220;BL&#8221;) which she wished to purchase for &#163;2.6 million.  The agreement and order was predicated on the basis that the husband would pay for the purchase of the property in the event that the former marital home had not been sold by the time of its completion and that the wife would repay him when she received her share of the two properties to be sold.  Accordingly, the order went on to provide that the husband would:</p>

Thus, the wife would end up with &#163;4 million more than the husband from the sales of their properties.  The explanation given to me was that compensated her for the fact that the husband was to keep his own construction companies and thus the parties would leave the marriage with approximately equal sums and having achieved a clean break so that each could go his or her respective way.</p>

In the judgment of Deputy District Judge Berry it is recorded that the property was &#8220;presently estimated to be worth &#163;9 million&#8221;.  Since then, the property has remained on the market and has attracted no offers other than one of &#163;6 million which the parties both agreed to reject.

It did attract an offer of &#163;2 million (rather than &#163;3.75 million) which the parties also rejected.  The parties fell out about the marketing of the property.  The agent suggested reducing the price to &#163;2 million and, against her advice, the property continued to be marketed at a reduced price of &#163;2.75 million attracting little interest.  At the end of January 2017 a revised offer from the party who had offered &#163;2 million was made in the sum of &#163;1.75 million.  That subsequently fell through for unconnected reasons.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is common ground between the parties that the events of the last six/seven years have been extremely unfortunate so far as the wife is concerned.  If the properties had sold at somewhere near their expected prices the wife would now be left with the property at BL unencumbered; she would have had liquid capital of somewhere between &#163;3-4 million on midpoint figures and &#163;4.5 million at upper end estimates and she would have the pensions which were transferred to her.  Her capital fund might have been subject to a small claw-back to the husband depending on whether the properties were sold before or after February 2012.</p>

This is to be contrasted with the expected figure of &#163;3 million plus.

The figure of &#163;1.74 million arose from the judge concluding that the wife&#8217;s intended income fund (excluding pensions) under the agreement was &#163;2 million and she deducted from that figure the amount of the deposit of &#163;260,000 so as to produce the figure of &#163;1.74 million.

The judge had aggregated the figures of &#163;1.3 million and &#163;700,000 referred to at paragraph 12 of this judgment so as to produce the figure of &#163;2 million.  She had then cross-referred to the table appearing at D29 of the submissions made on behalf of the wife which refers to the addition of &#163;2 million as &#8220;a <span style="font-style:italic">Duxbury</span>&#8221;.  In fact, the &#163;2 million was never intended to represent a <span style="font-style:italic">Duxbury</span> fund but was instead the equalising payment that was to be made to the wife from the proceeds of sale of the two properties.  She would, of course, have had substantially more than &#163;2 million as a fund to be used as she liked, but obviously primarily for income, if the properties had achieved anything like the figures for which the parties were hoping.</p>

She concluded that the court had power to release a person from undertakings given to the court if just to do so or conditionally by release if the person was to give a different, fairer, undertaking in substitution.  The judge found that the one fact in the case which might allow her to release the wife from her undertaking was the delay in selling the properties and the fact that had either party known that the properties would remain unsold after six years, the wife would have been unlikely to have her claims for maintenance dismissed and replaced by an arrangement whereby she was lent money which she would have to repay.

No court would have expected her to forego maintenance for six years or pay for herself or to pay for her housing mortgage interest as a loan.

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.39in">I have found this a difficult case to resolve.  It is a classic example of the tension between change of circumstances on the one hand and integrity of a freely negotiated agreement on the other.  There is much force in many of the points made on each side.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.39in">I specifically reject a number of the arguments put to me.  First, I do not have sympathy with the argument that the wife could have crystallised the situation by applying earlier for an order for sale leading to a quicker resolution.  It is, of course, true that she could have applied earlier but HHJ Hughes specifically made a finding that neither party had acted unreasonably in relation to the sale of the two properties and I should not go behind that.  Furthermore, I cannot assume that, even if the price  had been lowered, it would necessarily have been to a price that would have made the properties such a bargain that they were bound to have sold.  The fact that every property has a price at which someone will buy it does not take the matter further.</p>

Those cases involved appeals against consent orders and there is nothing in <span style="font-style:italic">Birch</span> which leads me to conclude that the power to release from an undertaking is so constrained.</p>

It was a highly material factor and was not lightly to be interfered with.  Insofar as there was to be a material change to the agreement that should be kept, in my judgment, to a minimum.  This brings me to replacement undertakings.</p>

Furthermore, it was pointed out that indeed the wife did indeed give a replacement undertaking, namely that referred to at paragraphs 26-27.  </p>
