	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am concerned here with two children, LM who is now 20 months of age and KR, who is 5 weeks old.  Their parents are KW (&#8216;the mother&#8217;) and GM (&#8216;the father&#8217;).  The Local Authority became involved with this family as a result of injuries sustained by LM on the 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2015. At 10.16 am on the 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January a telephone call was made by the father to the emergency services.  A paramedic arrived at the home in under 10 minutes.  The account given by the mother was that LM had been sitting on the floor propped up by cushions when she fell backwards on to a carpeted surface. The father was upstairs in bed having worked a nightshift.  This account has been maintained by the mother throughout these proceedings and during the course of a criminal investigation.  In her evidence the mother told me, with very visible distress, that such was the force of LM&#8217;s contact with the floor that the noise of the impact made her feel physically sick.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">LM was presented to the A &amp; E Department at Cumberland Infirmary at 11.55am.  The history recorded was that following hitting the back of her head (the occiput) LM cried and approximately two minutes later became floppy and then rigid.  That episode lasted around five minutes and then LM vomited.  On examination LM was found to be improving in colour, coordination and limb movements were normal.  There were no bony injuries and no boggy swelling.  The recorded Glasgow Coma Score was 15, i.e. fully conscious.</p>

In view of the vomiting she was kept in over night.  The general impression was of a child who had sustained a minor head injury.</p>

Later, Mr Peter Richards, Consultant Paediatric Neurosurgeon at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford was to undertake a review of the neurological evidence in order to assist the Court with an expert opinion.

Over the surface of both cerebral hemispheres, but more so over the right than the left, there is fluid of intermediate density between brain (grey) and cerebrospinal fluid (black). There are a couple of areas particularly over the right cerebral hemisphere and the left parafalcine region where there is high signal likely to represent fresh subdural blood.&#8221;</span></p>

The examination revealed bilateral retinal haemorrhages.  In the light of these concerns LM was transferred to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle for a MRI scan.  With a child of this age that is a difficult undertaking and although LM had been sedated the scan failed.  She was transferred back to Cumberland on the 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January.  Thereafter she remained clinically alert with no neurological signs and was well enough to be discharged the following day i.e. 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2015.  The plan was for  LM to undergo a further MRI scan under general anaesthetic.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">One further important feature of concern was LM&#8217;s head circumference.  An anti natal scan (34 weeks) revealed the head circumference to be around the 97<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> centile.  There is no record of a measurement taken at the time of delivery but a reading recorded by the health visitor only a short time after the birth revealed a circumference fractionally above 99.6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> centile.  On the 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2014 LM was seen by the GP for routine assessment.  No abnormality was found apart from an increased head circumference, now significantly above 99.6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> centile.  The GP notes state <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;happy baby but note head circumference now off chart.  Repeat 10d paeds if accurate, mum reports dad has a big head&#8217;</span>.  On the 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May LM had routine immunisations.  The records reveal <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;head circumference increased further to 42.3cm, from 42cm (19th May 2014), continues in line over 95</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span><span style="font-style:italic"> centile, ref paeds, may just be constitutional&#8217;</span>. This picture was very much the same at the time of the second series of routine immunisations in June and July 2014.  LM&#8217;s overall presentation, especially eyes, fontanelle, and sutures caused no concern and, as both parents head measurements were above the 99.6 centile this was considered to be a familial characteristic.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">The question of LM&#8217;s pattern of head growth has been investigated during the course of these proceedings by Professor John Wyatt.  Professor Wyatt was a Consultant Neonatalogist at University College London Hospitals between 1988-2011.  He continues to research the mechanisms, prevention, consequences and treatment of brain injury in newborn babies.  He considered LM&#8217;s pattern of head growth unusual and found the CT and MRI imaging to be consistent with the presence of a benign macrocephaly.  In particular Professor Wyatt noted that the appearances on the scans were consistent with chronic enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces which was also consistent with the large head circumference.  The term used for what has been observed is: Benign Enlargement of the Subarachnoid Spaces (BESS).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">Professor Wyatt has reviewed the ten references Zahl et al provided, to support the above assertion and, on the basis of that research, concludes that there is significant published evidence to confirm that subdural haemorrhage may occur in infants with chronic enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces following relatively trivial head injury, including the kind of low impact head trauma that might occur within the ambit of normal handling.  The hypothesis appears to be that stretching of the bridging veins in the subdural space, consequent upon the enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces, may predispose an infant to developing SDH.  Accordingly, Professor Wyatt concludes:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">&#8220;In my opinion, since there is clear evidence that [LM] had chronic enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces from the time of birth, it is certainly possible that the subdural haemorrhages seen on CT and MRI scans may have occurred as a result of minor or trivial head injury during normal infant handling.  &#8221;</span></p>

Dr Newman did not consider retinal haemorrhages, in this context, could be explained by a minor fall and took the view that it was more likely consistent with a shaking type injury.  He considered that the retinal haemorrhages documented were not related to birth, seizures, vomiting, isolated raised intracranial pressure, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, minor trauma or immunisations.  He emphasised however, that retinal haemorrhages should not be viewed in isolation but in conjunction with all the clinical findings.  Succinctly capturing what is, in my judgement, the essence of good practice in these cases Dr. Newman stated:</p>

Professor David Taylor, professor emeritus in Paediatric Ophthalmology at University College London, also considered the site of the retinal haemorrhages to be unlikely if associated with BESS.  Professor Taylor identified BESS as outside his expertise but, as I have noted, was able to observe (on the basis of the published research) that it is not normally associated with retinal haemorrhages in any event.</p>

Severe RHs are common in shaking injuries and unusual in accidental injuries, unless the accidental injury is one involving a large amount of force.

I think it important to record that I have not found it easy consistently to follow Mr Richards&#8217; analysis, or to identify the logical nexus between his analysis and the apparent conclusions in the report.  Mr Richards is one of the most highly regarded paediatric neurosurgeons in the country and, in addition, provides great assistance to the Courts, as an expert witness.  This he has done with distinction over many years.  During this period some of the received shibboleths of NAHI have fallen away as Mr Richards is astute to identify.  He emphasises that this is an area of medicine in which there are significant &#8216;unknowns&#8217; which must always be factored in to any conclusion.

This is because the event as described, a low level fall backwards, is not thought to cause fresh subdural haemorrhaging and retinal haemorrhaging. However, it has to be appreciated that many children who have such low level falls never have neurological imaging and never have specialist ophthalmological examination. The majority are either not taken to hospital because they are clinically well, or seen in hospital and discharged without imaging. Without positive imaging they do not have formal ophthalmological examination. LM came close to being in this category and had she vomited less, such that she was not admitted to hospital, the features that were identified would never have been found.</span></p>

How can we know? Nonetheless as the medical profession has often reminded me, absence of evidence is not to be equated with evidence of absence.  An &#8216;unknown&#8217; is precisely that, neither more nor less.  Again however, as the medical profession has also impressed upon me in the past, if low level falls in infants were associated with SDH, retinal haemorrhages and/or transient cerebral irritation or encephalothopy then such might be seen clinically, they are not.  This is the primary basis, as I understand it, upon which the medical profession considers it unlikely that low level falls cause fresh subdural and retinal haemorrhaging.  Moreover, as Mr Richards identifies, the scanning of children following relatively minor trauma supports the opposite view, i.e. that such is unlikely to cause retinal or subdural bleeding.  Mr Richards develops his analysis thus:</p>

Infants cannot be experimented on in laboratories to determine what forces are required to cause subdural haemorrhaging, acute traumatic effusion and retinal haemorrhaging. Studies where infants are routinely scanned even if there is no clinical indication to do so have not been carried out. It is therefore possible that acute subdural haemorrhage and retinal haemorrhaging following very minor trauma is more common than we think. Nobody knows. On the basis of those children who are scanned following relatively minor trauma it is thought unlikely to cause fresh subdural bleeding, acute traumatic effusion and retinal haemorrhages. However, we do not know this with scientific certainty.</span></p>

Many outside of Japan consider these publications as indicative of a cultural resistance to accepting the concept of non-accidental inflicted injury and that the cases described as occurring as a result of low level falls were, in fact, missed cases of non-accidental injury. However, the Japanese authors maintain their position that the significant injuries were caused by low level falls. Similar publications have not been generated outside of Japan.&#8221;</span></p>

Whilst, again, there has been no scientific verification of this concept, there are a number of publications linking the development of intracranial haemorrhage and retinal haemorrhage with low level of traumatic events in the presence of benign enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces. LM had benign enlargement of the subarachnoid space identified on MRI scanning and this is likely to have accounted for her large head, which was not growing at an abnormal rate. This, therefore, may be a vulnerability such that she suffered intracranial haemorrhage from a low level fall where intracranial haemorrhage would not normally be expected.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">It is clear that the experts have listened carefully to each others views and been prepared, where appropriate, to moderate their opinions.  If Mr. Richards will forgive me for saying so, his acquiescence to the six points above seems to me to be more consistent with the body of the analysis of his own report.  It is entirely right that experts should stimulate full professional enquiry but that does not bestow the right to indulge in professional debate on controversial issues where that is at the expense of their own reasoned risk assessment.  It is this &#8216;professional diagnosis&#8217; that the Court and the parties require. As has been repeatedly stated the Court process is not concerned with resolving wider controversial medical dispute or providing a forum for the ventilation of competing theories.  (See, e.g.: <span style="font-weight:bold">A Local Authority (1) K (2) N (3) N (By his children&#8217;s guardian MK) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2011/1156" uk:canonical="[2011] EWHC 1156 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] EWHC 1156 (Fam)</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] 2 FLR 165" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] 2 FLR 165</ref>). </span> I consider that in his wish strongly to emphasise the importance of factoring in &#8216;unknown causes&#8217; in the diagnostic process, Mr Richards permitted his reasoning to stray into the tendentious rather than confining it to the professionally objective.

It progressed relatively quickly and, on the mother&#8217;s initial account, moved to cohabitation in March 2013.  The father puts it a bit later than this in May of that year.  For the mother it was her first &#8216;live in&#8217; relationship.  She became pregnant quite quickly and on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> March 2014 LM was born.  The mother, unusually these days, lives in a community where her extended family also live within a few hundred yards.  Her parents live across the road; she has other family members whose homes can be seen from her own.  Health visitors visiting the mother in the weeks after LM&#8217;s birth noted that she reported &#8216;having good family support&#8217;.   The health visitors had no concerns at all.  They regarded mother as &#8216;very competent in handling her baby well and appropriately&#8217;.</p>

He told me that in addition to his shifts he was always prepared to make himself available for overtime work.  I have seen photographs of this couple&#8217;s large and well furnished home.  I have noticed from the photographs taken by the police in January 2015 that the home was well kept, tidy, organised and cared for.  This couple plainly took pride in their home.  It is also obvious that LM was surrounded by toys and objects designed to stimulate her.  I had a strong sense from the photographs and from both the written and oral evidence of the parents that LM was the centre of this household.  </p>

The parents told me that from around early November 2014 LM became unwell.  Though the medical records, which have been thoroughly scrutinised, reveal no illness outside the normal childhood range of infections, it is clear that both parents appear to have become very anxious and were speculating as to whether LM might have some compromise of her immune system.  She did not.  From this period and in consequence of her chest and throat complaints both parents noted that LM had become &#8216;twiney&#8217;, which is their word for her being generally more fractious.</p>

Even when she returned to work in January, she had full responsibility for LM during the nights.  The evidence is that father never cared for LM at nights.  The obvious reason for this of course is that he was working.  It is to my mind self evident that this must have placed an exhausting responsibility on the mother, particularly when she returned to work herself in January at a time when LM&#8217;s health was giving cause for concern. When she was interviewed by the police on the 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June and 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> July 2015, the mother was unprepared to acknowledge any stress, fatigue, frustration or indeed difficulties of any kind.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">As the advocates probed, through cross examination, into this family&#8217;s life at the relevant periods, it became clear that there were a number of significant stress factors within the home.  What is most concerning is the mother&#8217;s refusal or inability to recognise them.  These kinds of issues are usually addressed in social work assessments.  It is both unfortunate and regrettable that this did not occur here.  It strikes me that these essentially social work issues are better explored in the relative calm of an assessment room, speaking to familiar social workers, rather than by cross examination in a witness box in the High Court.  That said both parents were able to engage with the questions in a forthright and articulate manner.  They did not appear to be overwhelmed by the experience of giving evidence, though the mother was at times, understandably, greatly distressed.  I make allowance for the fact that people may not give of their best in such circumstances and may find themselves saying things that they would not do otherwise.  I also bear in mind that parents in this situation maybe less than candid or indeed tell lies for complex reasons.  I have in mind the directions given to juries in such circumstances, pursuant to the guidance in <span style="font-weight:bold">R v Lucas <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1981] QB 720" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1981">[1981] QB 720</ref> and R v Goodway <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1993] 4 All ER 894" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1993">[1993] 4 All ER 894</ref></span>.

They communicate primarily through text messages.  Some of the language is blunt and occasionally bawdy.  LM is sometimes referred to as &#8216;a little shit&#8217; as well as other apparently derogatory terms.  I do not draw adverse inferences from any of the language used.  I do not consider it has any forensic relevance, it is simply the lexicon of this family and many others.  In particular I do not consider it casts any light on the nature of the mother&#8217;s relationship with her daughter.  On this point I look at the substance of what is being communicated not the language.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">Although the mother is surrounded by extended family members living, as I have said, in very close proximity, it is clear that she very rarely avails herself of their support.  Due to the father&#8217;s work commitments, the demands of child care and the mother&#8217;s own work commitments when she returned to work in January, this couple were existing as &#8216;ships in the night&#8217;.  As is clear from the text records and indeed on the parents own stated cases, when mother got out of bed, dad would get into it on his return from work.  The mother was very concerned to ensure that LM had returned to her own bed before the father got home.  The text messages repeatedly focused on this and I find there was an anxiety on the part of the mother that the home should be comfortable and quiet for the father&#8217;s return.  I do not infer that the mother was afraid of incurring father&#8217;s wrath or displeasure, rather I see this as a facet of her determination to be a successful mother and partner.  As the Guardian said in her evidence, the mother sets herself very high standards and wishes to be seen to be coping.  Like the Guardian I got the sense that the mother wanted to be able to show people that she was managing well and independently.  </p>

The father told me that they never did this, nor did he appear to think this was in any way odd or unusual.  The extent of the couples outings seem to have been limited to shopping and on such occasions LM was with them and often PGF too.  This was a relatively fledgling relationship in which, inevitably the parties were still getting to know each other.  The structure of the daily routine, as I have set out, did not afford them much time together either.  I do not doubt that the adults were happy and that LM was a very wanted baby, but the strains placed on the mother are obvious. The opportunities for the mother to share her concerns with her partner, were inevitably limited.  </p>

The mother plainly considered that LM responded better to her father as far as sleeping routines were concerned and both parents agreed LM was &#8216;Daddy&#8217;s girl&#8217;.

With the benefit of hindsight this episode is probably explained as the understandable response of anxious parents with their first baby.  There are other instances of it in the papers.  On another occasion the mother thought she had found blood in LM&#8217;s nappy but on investigation there was nothing untoward.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">As January progressed it is clear that LM remained generally out of sorts and fractious.  By way of example, on the 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January the mother texted the father suggesting that she would take LM back to the doctors the following day.  Shortly before midnight the mother referred to LM as not settling and to her &#8216;twining for over an hour&#8217;.  Characteristically, she told the father that she had put LM on his side of the bed.  It was plainly a very cold January night, the mother told me in evidence that LM&#8217;s room was particularly hard to keep warm.  It is a theme that runs through the text messages.  On the 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January LM was awake in the early hours (as I have earlier described).  On the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January LM was difficult to manage even in her father&#8217;s care.  He texted &#8216;she is driven me fuckn bonkers!!xx&#8217;.  He had earlier referred to her &#8216;bad temper&#8217; and the fact that she &#8216;won&#8217;t behave&#8217;.  On the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January the father talks of LM&#8217;s own tiredness.  He gave her Calpol because she &#8216;just wouldn&#8217;t behave&#8217;.  </p>

On the 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January the mother texted &#8216;she will not settle wen I put her 2 bed..&#8217;  At 21.20 hours the mother texted &#8216;I&#8217;m off 2 kip just hope I can sleep 2nite&#8217;.  Three hours later those hopes appeared to have been forlorn, the text this time read &#8216;she is in our bed she won&#8217;t stop crying&#8217;.  Father responds &#8216;not agen&#8217;.  The mother responded: &#8216;she won&#8217;t keep her covers on so she&#8217;s freezing&#8217;.  She added &#8216;she&#8217;s on ur pillow happy as larry now&#8217;.  I sense that the mother felt that the father always softened when he felt LM was missing him.  At shortly after 11.30pm the mother described LM as &#8216;flat out&#8217; and stated that her plan was to move LM back to her own room as soon as possible.  At 23.39 she sent this text &#8216;I&#8217;m 2 tired 2 cope with the screaming, but it is very cold&#8217;.  At 4.42 the mother texted the father to say &#8216;she still there now!&#8217;&#8230; &#8216;on ur pillow wide awake&#8217;&#8230; &#8216;shes gonna twine or day a bet&#8217;.  </p>

Despite what I find to be compelling and cogent evidence to the contrary, revealed by the text messages, the mother maintained that position in her most recent statement and endeavoured, with increasingly unconvincing effort, to stand by this account in her evidence.  Moreover, in her statement, 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2015, the mother made the following observation in relation to the support of her extended family:</p>

As far as the head banging is concerned she will do this both to the front and the back of her head and she is now picking things up and banging herself with them.  In the hospital we noticed that she was banging her head on the metal cot bars.  We asked for a padded bumper to protect her but didn&#8217;t get one so we organised padding ourselves.  For the last couple of months she has been putting her hand up to the right side of her head by her ear.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">The mother told me in the witness box that the next day LM was, as predicted, tired and &#8216;twiney&#8217;.  The father had gone to bed and LM was sitting on a rug in the front room.  She said that she had been surrounded by cushions but she had shuffled herself away from them.  Apparently in temper she flung herself backwards on a carpeted wooden floor.  In her evidence the mother emphasised that the noise of the contact was so distressing to her as to make her feel physically sick.  She had obviously told MGM a similar account because that is reflected in MGM&#8217;s statement.  Ms Heaton emphasises the importance of the consistency of the mother&#8217;s account as an indicator of reliability.  Broadly, she is right to do so, but I note that this detail is absent from the mother&#8217;s statement of the 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April which is the key description of the events of 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January within these proceedings.  There her account is: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;she screamed initially but was relatively easily calmed and waved at herself in the mirror&#8217;</span>. Also, in evidence the mother added that LM emitted what she described as &#8216;a piercing cry, like a pain, I knew she had hurt herself&#8217;.  The mother described the cry as &#8216;high pitched&#8217;.  These details were also not in her statement.  It was the father who telephoned the ambulance, (the mother concurrently telephoned the GP) and the father who travelled in the ambulance.  The mother told me that these arrangements were made for practical reasons.  I suspect, now having heard all the evidence, that these two parents instinctively, perhaps even unspokenly assumed that &#8216;Daddy&#8217;s girl&#8217; would want her daddy with her in the ambulance.  </p>

If the tribunal is left in doubt, the doubt is resolved by a rule that one party or the other carries the burden of proof. If the party who bears the burden of proof fails to discharge it, a value of 0 is returned and the fact is treated as not having happened.

When assessing alternative possible explanations for a medical finding, the court will consider each possibility on its merits. There is no hierarchy of possibilities to be taken in sequence as part of a process of elimination. If there are three possibilities, possibility C is not proved merely because possibilities A and B are unlikely, nor because C is less unlikely than A and/or B. Possibility C is only proved if, on consideration of all the evidence, it is more likely than not to be the true explanation for the medical findings. So, in a case of this kind, the court will not conclude that an injury has been inflicted merely because known or unknown medical conditions are improbable: that conclusion will only be reached if the entire evidence shows that inflicted injury is more likely than not to be the explanation for the medical findings. &#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">The Guardian considered that the mother set herself extremely high standards and that it was important to her self esteem to be seen to be coping independently.  By January 2015 both parents were working different shift patterns, LM was unwell and the mother had become highly over anxious about her daughter&#8217;s health.  The father too had become anxious, considering that LM might even have some disorder of the immune system.  She did not.  She had, as the doctors have emphasised, no more than ordinary childhood illnesses.   I suspect the father was dragged into the wake of the mother&#8217;s own over anxious perceptions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">By 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January the mother was plainly exhausted.  It is idle to pretend otherwise.  The evidence from the transcribed text messages tells its own voluble truth.  The mother and father have both resisted this obvious fact.  I do not believe that the mother is necessarily, telling lies or deliberately creating a false impression.  I think that she may well not have appreciated just how tired she had become throughout long disturbed nights with a fractious child and working during the day in a demanding and caring role.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">Also significant was the mother&#8217;s belief that LM was deliberately playing up for her at night.  The mother appeared to struggle with the fact that when she retrieved LM from her bed crying and apparently unhappy she would very quickly be &#8216;dancing around&#8217; as the mother put it and wreathed in &#8216;smiles&#8217; when taken to the parents bed.  This was an oppositional dynamic that the mother, even in the witness box at this hearing, seemed to struggle to understand and to know how to address.  In addition to all this, LM&#8217;s bedroom was obviously very cold that January.  I formed a clear impression that committed though this loving mother was to the welfare of her child she nonetheless struggled to understand her daughter&#8217;s needs and her general development.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">The mother/daughter relationship had become stressful and the mother&#8217;s desire to succeed as a parent inhibited her reliance on the cohesive family support that appears to be available to her.  During the course of the mother&#8217;s evidence I sensed that she was very determined to please her partner.  It struck me that in this role too she set herself very high standards.  However troubled her night might have been she was determined LM would have returned to her own bed by the time the father got home.   This she appears to have achieved regularly albeit only when both she and the child were exhausted.  This was undoubtedly the case on the 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">This analysis of the mother&#8217;s circumstances reveals a situation which is paradigmatic to shaking injuries i.e. mounting exhaustion and frustration in an isolated carer.  The identified stress factors neither individually nor cumulatively establish a finding of non accidental injury.  Their significance is that they form a context within which the medical evidence has to be evaluated.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">No one particular discipline of medicine provides a &#8216;conclusive&#8217; explanation in this case.  This too is a common situation where infant head injuries are concerned.   Retinal haemorrhages are not pathognomonic of non accidental injury; fewer or milder retinal haemorrhages cannot differentiate between accidental or pathological / non accidental cause.  What remains clear is that short falls caused by rolling backwards are not associated with retinal haemorrhaging, there is no independent scientific validation of such a link. The presence of BESS has plainly caused all the experts to think very carefully about the diagnostic significance of fresh subdural blood and acute traumatic effusion.  Whilst the experts have confirmed that the medical evidence can support any of three conclusions: accidental injury; non accidental head injury or unknown causation, that does not mean that each is ultimately of equal weight.  Strong and compelling evidence from a parent, where found to be reliable and accurate may reinforce an otherwise contentious medical explanation.  Similarly, an account given by a carer, judged to be unreliable and inaccurate, set against a backdrop of identified risk factors, may reinforce medical opinion supportive of a finding of non accidental head injury.  In this case the only explanation which most logically and comprehensively unites the totality of the medical and lay evidence is a non accidental inflicted shaking injury, most likely caused by a momentary loss of control on the part of a frustrated carer.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">During the course of cross examination Mr Rowlands asked the mother whether she was afraid to tell the truth because she feared the father would leave her.  I was dubious as to the value of such a question but, without hesitating, the mother responded <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;I think he would have understood after I had told him the full story&#8217;</span>.  I fully accept that the mother was responding to a hypothetical question and I have not attributed any forensic significance to it in my findings.  It may be that this can be explored in future assessment. I highlight it because it signals to me that having been living together for many months now without the responsibility of being primary carers for their children, this couple may have got to know each other better and learned to communicate their feelings to each other more effectively.  If this is so and it is for others to assess, that may well alter the matrix of risk when considering whether they might resume the care of their children in the future.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">There is no dispute but that in the event of the court finding this to be a non accidental injury the mother was the perpetrator, given that she was alone with LM at the time of her collapse.  I find accordingly.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">I have been at pains to emphasise the potential that this couple appear to offer to their children.  I declined to endorse a care plan which contemplated a final order placing the children in the care of the maternal grandparents under the aegis of a Special Guardianship Order.  The Guardian also withdrew her support for such an arrangement during the course of the evidence.  I consider that both these children are entitled to a full exploration of the potential for them to live with their parents.  To date that inquiry has been unsatisfactory.  A detailed, rigorous, creative and fully comprehensive assessment is required.  It must be carefully thought through and meticulously planned. In my assessment it should seek to involve the wider family with whom this judgment should be shared.  I consider that the use of family group conferencing would be particularly appropriate here as the Guardian suggested.</p>
