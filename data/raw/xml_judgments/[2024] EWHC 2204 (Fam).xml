I am satisfied that the documents and orders have been served by the Claimant&#8217;s solicitor in accordance with the Court&#8217;s order throughout.  Most recently, I am satisfied that the documents filed for the hearing on 5 July 2024, and the order generated on that date, were sent to the Defendant by WhatsApp and e-mail.  It is apparent that the WhatsApp message containing the relevant documentation was delivered to the Defendant on 5 July, albeit that there is no confirmation that it was read, nor is there any way of verifying whether the Defendant read the e-mail.  Since 5 July 2024, the WhatsApp messages from the Claimant&#8217;s solicitors to the Defendant appear not to have been delivered, let alone read; however the Defendant has been served by e-mail in accordance with the court orders;</p>

The Defendant followed her there, and allegedly forcibly removed her passport, and the passports of the children, thereby stranding them in that country.  The mother managed to instruct solicitors in England (Dawson Cornwell LLP) who issued a wardship application in October 2022.   Early in 2023, the children and the mother attempted to flee Sudan but they were prevented from doing so by the authorities.  The Defendant allegedly discovered the mothers attempt to leave Sudan; he travelled there, allegedly punished the mother and older children, and then (it is said) took them on an arduous journey to Kenya.</p>

However, the Defendant, unable to travel, allegedly sent his cousin Hassan Mohamed Ali, together with the children's older brother Mohamed, from England to attend the mother's burial on 28 December 2023. The maternal family allowed the paternal cousin and brother to visit the children; it is the maternal family&#8217;s case that the children were taken that day by force, and at speed, and without their belongings, and removed back to Sudan.</p>
