There are all sorts of reasons why people can appear to remember things that have not occurred or fail to mention things that have occurred. It is my job to scrutinise all of the available evidence to determine what I believe is likely to have happened.

The same applies to when they are giving evidence. The Court must consider all of the matters in the round and judge the evidence on its merits. I am to look at the explanations given for matters that might otherwise strike me as being unusual and assess those explanations. There are many reasons why victims of abuse would not have reported that abuse at the time. Whilst a failure to report could be because the events complained of did not happen, it could also be because the victim was scared of the consequences should they report the abuse, or because they felt trapped and unable to seek help.</span></p>

It is not unusual in the British Pakistani community for women to tolerate abuse and for marital disputes to be settled within the family or with the assistance of elders in the community. It is also common for a wife&#8217;s family to put pressure on the wife to remain in an abusive marriage.

I understand the difficulties in giving evidence. Cross-examination must be a difficult process for witnesses who are having to answer questions and give their recollections under intense pressure before strangers. Nonetheless, the Mother continually gave overly long answers that veered away from the question, and she regularly spoke so quickly it was very difficult to follow and note down everything that she said. This was despite my repeatedly explaining to her that she had to focus on the questions and give answers in short sentences so that all of her words could be translated for the Father and written down by me.</span></p>

She told me that she knew nothing about the recording until her mother raised it with her. This was important evidence as the Father argues that the Mother was complicit in the recording and that her recorded comments see her goading the Father into behaving badly. The Mother told the police a different story. She said that the kids had made the recording, but that she had forwarded it to her mother so that her mother could hear what she was being subjected to. This is a notable difference and her explanation that this may have referred to her sending a copy to the Mother later was unconvincing.</span></p>

The Mother has raised her own issues with the translation to the police. The Father says that the translation is fundamentally flawed as it was translated in Urdu and not Mirpuri and Urdu translations will result in certain phrases having entirely different meanings. The original of the audio has never been disclosed into these proceedings. The issue with the translation was raised halfway through the Father&#8217;s evidence while he was under oath although it had been foreshadowed by Ms Marron at the outset of the hearing. No application for disclosure of the audio file was made by either party notwithstanding the Mother confirming that it may well be available. Both advocates appeared to agree that I would have to determine what weight to give the transcript where both parties have raised criticisms with it and there may well have been a language issue with the translation.</span></p>

In the absence of overwhelming control and coercion that is unlikely to amount to rape, as, to the Father, she will have apparently consented. On one occasion, however, probably in around 2015, the Father forced himself on the Mother after she expressly said no. He did it because he felt it was his right to do so. At no point during the episode did the Mother consent and she tried to get him to stop but he would not. The Father knew that she was not consenting.  He raped her on that occasion. </span></p>

That applies equally to her inconsistency over the year in which it occurred. I do not accept that it will have been black and white to the Mother whether or not she has been raped. It can be notoriously difficult for people in abusive intimate relationships to know and understand where the boundaries lie in sexual relationships and very often it can take the clarity of separation for them to process what happened. It is important that even on those occasions where the Mother suggested there were multiple rapes, she defaulted to describing the one off occasion in a manner consistent with the current allegation.</span></p>

It is very unusual in my experience for a controlling father to direct that a mother and her children are to spend significant periods of time with the maternal family- that is the antithesis of control.

Firstly, her evidence is that she went. This is important because control and coercion as an offence carries with it the need to prove subordination, harm, fear and/or submission. The likelihood is that her strong-willed husband, who would expect that his role was to make decisions and give sound advice, would strongly recommend that she did not do certain things. The fact that she went to the wedding is more consistent with his having advised her not to go but her making decision contrary to his advice. It is common for wives in this situation to leave the marriage and then construe those sorts of incidents as control when, in fact, they fall a long way short of the threshold for criminal behaviour. In many relationships there is a power imbalance, and the weaker party feels unhappy and dissatisfied. It requires much more for the conduct complained of to be criminal.</span></p>

However, the audio recording also shows her pushing and prodding at him. It may be because the Mother was complicit in the recording and was trying to elicit certain responses.

His friend, Mr T, lives across the street. That appears to show someone else in the passenger street with the window down. The Father said it was Mr T in the passenger street and he was smoking which is why the window was down. The video supports his account that he did not stop the car.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.13in;border:none"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In my view non-molestation orders are primarily designed to give short term relief to parties at the conclusion of a relationship or when there has been a flare up between parties who have separated or who are no longer on civil terms. A non-molestation order is an extremely serious order, often impinging on the rights of a citizen to go about their daily business in a way that would otherwise be lawful. In this case the Mother&#8217;s application relates primarily to a one-off incident in September 2023, incorporating reference to a previous event in August 2023.</span></p>

Even if I am wrong about that, the Mother has the benefit of the protection of the interim order for over 12 months, which is a period in excess of how long such an order would ordinarily last. There have been no proven breaches, and, in those circumstances, I would not have acceded to a request to extend the order. I cannot find that the Mother needs the protection of the Court through such a draconian order. If she did initially need protection, I would not be satisfied that she needs continuing protection beyond today. The Mother reminds me that the Father has demonstrated a lack of insight as far as the effects of his presence on the children is concerned, however that does not warrant the imposition of such a draconian order.</span></p>
