In her application, the mother sought special arrangements to be made when attending Court, including the provision of separate waiting rooms and a privacy screen in the Court room.</span></p>

The mother intimated that she intended to make an application for a Child Arrangements Order under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. Deputy District Judge Staves, a part-time Judge, gave a series of directions, notably consolidating the Family Law Act and the pending Children Act applications and dispensing with the need for a First Hearing Dispute Resolution Appointment in the pending Children Act proceedings. Expert evidence was permitted in the consolidated proceedings, the Deputy District Judge giving directions on the basis of an application made by the Respondent father for an independent &#8220;psychiatrist or psychologist.&#8221; The father&#8217;s application recorded his, &#8220;grave concerns about [the mother&#8217;s] behaviour directed towards both him and the children.&#8221; The Deputy District Judge granted the application, notwithstanding the fact that the application did not comply with the requirements of Part 25 of the Family Procedure Rules. The Deputy District Judge did not have the benefit of any draft letter of instruction nor any details of the proposed expert. The field of expertise of the proposed expert was not resolved on the face of the Order, that Order referring only to generic &#8216;expert evidence&#8217;.  Directions were then given with a view to a three-day Final Hearing to take place remotely by video. It is unfortunate that in making those Orders, the Court lost the opportunity to hold a First Hearing Dispute Resolution Appointment in the Children Act proceedings. Further, it is of concern that the Court lost control over the issue of expert evidence by the manner in which expert evidence was approved by the Court, without any oversight of the issues the expert was required to address necessary to resolve the proceedings justly and without oversight as to the field of expertise or identity of the expert.  Although the Deputy District Judge directed properly that the Final Hearing be listed before a District Judge, in the event, the hearing was listed before a Recorder, another part-time Judge.</span></p>

Paragraph 20 of PD12J requires that, where the Court fixes a fact-finding hearing, it must at the same time fix a Dispute Resolution Appointment to follow. That did not happen. Further, PD12J requires that, subject to limited exception, the hearings should be arranged in such a way that they are conducted by the same Judge. Judicial continuity is expressly noted in PD12J to be important. Judicial continuity was not achieved. </span></p>

[The father] is controlling not just of [the mother] but also the children&#8230;[the father] has shown coercive behaviour, but also it has come to light that a lot of non-consensual sex has also taken place between [the mother and the father] and she has been scared and allowed him to do this to her.

He will also tell his partner and his children that they are not aloud [sic] any contact with each other when it is his turn to see the children, if they are together in the house he will stand over them until they separate.

The mother then tried to find alternative counsel, but, having been told how much that would cost, she then decided to proceed with the hearing, representing herself, but with a paralegal from her solicitors in attendance, to take a note. In the meantime, the father, whose counsel, Ms Foster, was also unavailable on 29 and 30 July, had indicated his agreement to the mother&#8217;s request for an adjournment, but when he heard that the mother had decided to proceed, he also agreed with that course of action, and he has been represented by Mr Cooper of counsel.&#8221;</span></p>

It had been the expectation that on the second day of the hearing, the mother, as a litigant in person, would directly cross-examine the father, the alleged perpetrator of domestic abuse.

On the morning of day 2, the intention was to hear the respondent [father] being cross examined by the applicant [mother]. But during the overnight adjournment, it occurred to me that PD12J was engaged and that I should consider whether special measures should be deployed to protect the victim of alleged domestic abuse from having to engage in directly addressing the alleged perpetrator in her questions and being directly addressed by him in his answers. I raised my concern with Mr Cooper and the applicant on the morning of Day 2. Mr Cooper agreed that PD12J was engaged and suggested the option of asking the applicant to put her questions in writing and of me putting them to the respondent on her behalf, and the applicant said that she would welcome that option, and so the hearing was adjourned for a short time to allow her to put the questions in writing, which she did with the help of her solicitor, who then sent me a list of questions and referred me to the pages in the exhibits to which she wanted the respondent to be taken. I then put those questions to the respondent.&#8221;</span></p>

I also referred him to the passage in her report where she said, &#8220;analysis of [the father&#8217;s] attachments might suggest that he would use coercive anger to manage his feelings about relationships&#8221; (11.24), &#8220;he remained preoccupied with his feelings of alienation and the financial impact of the current proceedings on his ability to provide for this children in the future&#8221; (13.10), and: &#8220;in his description of his children, [the father] would readily become distracted by his negative thinking about [the mother] and this would detract from his focus on his children&#8221;.

I am also satisfied that if what he was doing was causing the children to suffer even based on the limited communication which takes place, he would know that this was the case, and he would have stopped doing it. Having said that, I do find that the use of the stickers for leaving messages is off and it would not surprise me if the children think it is odd but I do not accept that they are frightened or scared by this. Alongside that it is extremely likely, given the strength of her views and the way she expresses them, that the children are aware of the applicant&#8217;s belief that the respondent is causing her and the children harm&#8230;I do have a concern that the applicant&#8217;s deep rooted belief about the effect of the respondent&#8217;s behaviour may become instilled in the children;</span></p>

This Court is bound by those findings of fact. The focus of this Court&#8217;s determination now is behaviour that post-dates the Recorder&#8217;s findings.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-size:11pt">This Court now has a wealth of evidence before it, not available to the Recorder, which cannot be ignored and which casts further light on the parties&#8217; relationship. Whilst this Court does not and should not go behind the findings previously made by the Recorder, it is clear that the Recorder heard evidence regarding only a snapshot of the parents&#8217; relationship in the vacuum of Family Law Act proceedings. Dr Proudman on behalf of the mother correctly points out that it appears that no consideration was given by the Recorder to the requirements of Part 3A to the Family Procedure Rules and Practice Direction 3AA, requirements which ought to have been embedded in the legal landscape of cases such as this, to ensure that the important safeguards the rules and Practice Directions provide for were in place.</span><span class="apple-converted-space" style="font-size:11pt">&#160;Further, as is clear from the Recorder&#8217;s note of judgment, significant weight was attached by the Recorder to the </span><span style="font-size:11pt">the impression created by the demeanour of the mother and father when giving evidence, based on their tone, manner and other aspects of their behaviour in answering questions. The mother was, at the relevant time, a litigant in person, whilst the father was represented by Counsel. The mother made serious allegations of domestic abuse and verbal abuse, including allegations that the father was abusive to the children. At no stage throughout the hearing before the Recorder was the mother assisted by special measures or participation directions pursuant to Part 3A of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 nor Practice Direction 3AA. The Court is under a duty to ensure that a vulnerable person is identified and the need for special measures and participation directions are addressed expressly.  The Recorder only turned his mind to the issue, &#8220;during the overnight adjournment.&#8221; The hearing was then stood down only for a short time, putting the mother under further pressure to write questions by way of cross-examination of the father and send those questions to the Judge. The mother attended the hearing, seemingly under the impression that the hearing was to consider the Occupation Order application and not a Fact Finding Hearing in the Children Act application. She attended the hearing believing, in the context of the Family Law Act application, she would be required to directly cross-examine the person she had accused of domestic abuse. No ground rules hearing was held, contrary to rule 5.2 of Practice Direction 3AA, FPR 2010 to give participation directions as to the conduct of the advocates and the parties and to put necessary safeguards in place for the vulnerable party. Consequently, the mother was required to look at her alleged abuser and he was able to look at her throughout her cross-examination by Counsel for the father. It seems that no thought was given as to whether the father&#8217;s camera should be switched off during the video hearing. It does not seem that thought was given to the provision of breaks during the hearing generally and specifically during the mother&#8217;s evidence. It is a matter of regret that it appears that Counsel for the father did not draw the Recorder&#8217;s attention to the relevant provisions of the Rules and Practice Directions. This Court acknowledges that at the time of the hearing before the Recorder, the now clear provisions brought in by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2021/17/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 63</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2021/17" uk:canonical="2021 c. 17" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Domestic Abuse Act 2021</ref> had not then been put into effect by the revisions to Family Procedure Rule Part 3A.2A, those provision only coming into effect on 31 January 2022.</span><span class="apple-converted-space" style="font-size:11pt">&#160;However, the provisions of FPR 3A and PD3AA together with the provisions of PD12J were effective at the date of the hearing before the Recorder. Further, Family Procedure Rule 1.1 requires the Court to put into effect the </span><span style="font-size:11pt">overriding objective of enabling the Court to deal with cases justly, having regard to any welfare issues involved. Dealing with a case justly includes, so far as is practicable, ensuring that the parties are on an equal footing.</span></p>

As all parties recognise, the landscape has shifted considerably since the Recorder&#8217;s findings in the Family Law Act proceedings. It is with that in mind that both parents seek the Court to make findings on allegations not determined by the Recorder. This Court now has, amongst other things, evidence of video recordings of events in the family home, since the decision was made by the Recorder to refuse the mother&#8217;s application for an Occupation Order. There have been two further police investigations. Further, the Court has evidence relating to other events said to have taken place prior to the date of the Recorder&#8217;s findings, which both parents invite the Court to consider as part of a wider pattern of alleged behaviour. It is incumbent on the Court to consider at all stages of the proceedings whether a Fact Finding Hearing is necessary. This Court determined as part of its case management decisions that a Fact Finding Hearing was necessary, being the first Fact Finding Hearing exclusively within these Children Act proceedings. </span></p>

This Court determined, having regard to the unresolved allegations made by both parties and with this Court&#8217;s focus being on the children who are the subject of the Children Act proceedings, rather than between the adults in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1996</ref> proceedings, that a further Fact Finding Hearing was necessary to  provide a factual basis for a future welfare report or other assessment, to provide a basis for an accurate assessment of risk, to consider any final welfare-based Orders in relation to child arrangements and to consider the need for a domestic abuse-related activity. It is regrettable that the allegations were not grappled with at an earlier opportunity. This Court gave extensive case management directions leading to this Fact Finding Hearing, with full and proper input from all parties, including directions for both parties to exchange schedules of allegations and narrative statements. Directions were given for the disclosure of relevant documents from the police and the Local Authority. A Ground Rules hearing was held and participation directions were put into effect. Those ground rules were revisited throughout the Fact Finding Hearing. Judicial continuity has been maintained since the August 2023 appeal hearing. In giving those directions, the Court put into effect the overriding objective under FPR 1.1 to deal with the case justly. </span></p>

There is only one civil standard of proof, namely that the occurrence of the fact in issue must be proved to have been more probable than not. Neither the seriousness of the allegation nor the seriousness of the consequences makes any difference to the standard of proof to be applied in determining the facts. If the Court finds it more likely than not that something did take place, then it is treated as having taken place. If the Court finds it more likely than not that it did not take place, then it is treated as not having taken place. Where a fact is required to be proved, a 'fact in issue,' the Court must decide whether or not it happened. There is no room for a finding that it&#160;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">might&#160;</span><span style="font-size:11pt">have happened. The law operates a binary system. The fact either happened or it did not. If the Court is left in doubt, the doubt is resolved by a rule that one party or the other carries the burden of proof. If the party who bears the burden of proof fails to discharge it, the fact is treated as not having happened. If the party does discharge the burden of proof, it is treated as having happened.</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

I didn&#8217;t want to go to music school because he wants me to go his friend&#8217;s house. He got angry and called me mean and an actress&#8230;I felt really scared. He stood by the door and would not let me through the door. He nudged my arm. My hand really hurts. He grabbed my wrist hard. He tried to snatch my arm. He has a camera on. It&#8217;s really intimidating. He never listens to me. He poured freezing cold water on my legs [previously] and I was scared the socket would explode, a week before last.&#8221;</span></p>

The father was asked in a private room in the home to explain what had happened. He told the police officer, &#8220;My daughter won&#8217;t go to school. She&#8217;s having a tantrum.&#8221; &#8216;G&#8217; can be heard stating in a distressed manner, &#8220;he wouldn&#8217;t let me through the door.&#8221; The father told the police, &#8220;This is </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">my</span><span style="font-size:11pt"> weekend caring for the children and their mother is interfering. She encourages my daughter not to do what she knows she should be doing.&#8221; He described wearing his own body worn camera, &#8220;so there can be no more fake incidents.&#8221; He told the police officer, &#8220;She&#8217;s decided she won&#8217;t go to music school. My wife wants </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">my</span><span style="font-size:11pt"> time with the children to go really badly. We have a court order that says she will remove herself when it&#8217;s </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">my</span><span style="font-size:11pt"> time. She will not remove herself. She keeps putting herself between me and children. [&#8216;G&#8217;] was screaming when nothing was happening. My wife was smiling when she was filming it. She&#8217;s insisting on sitting with the children during </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">my</span><span style="font-size:11pt"> time. This was the first big test. I had to take her mum&#8217;s phone off her [&#8216;G&#8217;]. She [&#8216;G&#8217;] screamed and said it was hurting her but it wasn&#8217;t.&#8221; The investigating officer is then shown the father&#8217;s body worn camera footage of the incident replayed on his laptop.  The footage shows the father standing next to &#8216;G&#8217;s bunkbed, where &#8216;G&#8217; is lying on the upper bunk. The father is seen to tell his daughter, &#8220;You&#8217;re putting pressure on me by not coming to your music lessons&#8230;is it normal for children to say I don&#8217;t want to go anywhere?&#8221; &#8216;G&#8217; replies, &#8220;Is it normal for you to force me to do things?&#8221; The father continues, &#8220;Did you like us being late yesterday? Was that fun? You&#8217;re making us late every day. You&#8217;re behaviour&#8217;s bad. You&#8217;re not bad. You&#8217;re a good person trying to do the right thing. That doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re bad. I&#8217;ll leave you alone if you get up. Otherwise, I&#8217;ll stay here as you&#8217;re sabotaging it again. I&#8217;m trying to understand why you&#8217;re doing these things. Is that what they teach you at school? I&#8217;m going to stay here until you&#8217;re getting up&#8230;if you&#8217;re not getting up then I&#8217;m staying here.&#8221; The father then identified that &#8216;G&#8217; had a phone in her hand. He says, &#8220;Is that mama&#8217;s phone?&#8221; He then approaches the bed again and says, &#8220;Give it to mama.&#8221; &#8216;G&#8217; then exclaims, &#8220;Why are you hurting me? Get away from me! You&#8217;re grabbing me!&#8221; The father can be seen to reach towards the child&#8217;s arm. &#8216;G&#8217; screams. The mother comes to the door of the bedroom and the father approaches the mother stating, &#8220;Why are you smiling?&#8221; There is no evidence of the mother smiling. He continues, &#8220;Why are you interfering? Please go away. Why would you be smiling while your daughter is screaming?&#8221;   &#8216;G&#8217; is heard to exclaim, &#8220;Leave me alone! Leave me alone!&#8221; The father replies, &#8220;I&#8217;ll leave you alone when you get up for music. We are going to music today. I don&#8217;t want mama&#8217;s phone to distract you.&#8221; The father then approaches the child&#8217;s bed again and exclaims, &#8220;I&#8217;m taking that phone away until you have breakfast.&#8221; The child then screams. The mother is heard to say, &#8220;What is going on?&#8221; The father replies, &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to help [&#8216;G&#8217;] come down. Please leave us alone.&#8221; The father instructs the child, &#8220;Give me the iPad. I&#8217;m not going anywhere. If you&#8217;re going to use it, I&#8217;ll take it away. You&#8217;re making it up. I know you&#8217;re a good actress. I&#8217;m filming this. That&#8217;s called acting. That&#8217;s called pretending. I realise you&#8217;re acting. Are you suddenly not afraid anymore? You threw things at me.&#8221; &#8216;G&#8217; then exclaims, &#8220;leave me alone!&#8221; The father continues, &#8220;Perhaps you could be more careful. Perhaps you could try not to hurt me. If you get up, I&#8217;ll go away. It&#8217;s quite simple.&#8221; The child then repeatedly asks the father, &#8220;let me through the door, let me through.&#8221; The father replies, &#8220;Why do you want to go through door? Why?&#8221; The child responds, &#8220;I need the toilet.&#8221; The father replies, &#8220;You&#8217;re just going to the toilet?&#8221; The child then begins to become more distressed and screams, &#8220;Let me through the door! Let me out!&#8221; She calls out for her mother&#8217;s help, &#8220;Mama! Mama!&#8221; repeating to the father, &#8220;Let me through the door!&#8221; The father tells the child, &#8220;Will you calm down? When you calm down, I&#8217;ll let you through the door.&#8221; The child continues to scream, &#8220;Mama! Mama!&#8221; and &#8220;Let me through the door!&#8221; The father persists, &#8220;Calm down and &#8216;I&#8217;ll let you through.&#8221; He then blocks the bedroom door and holds it shut. The child cries out in high distress, calling for her mother, hyperventilating and screaming, &#8220;Why won&#8217;t you let me through the door?&#8221; The father tells the police officer viewing the footage, &#8220;I won&#8217;t let her through because shell go straight to her mother.&#8221;  The video footage continues with the child pleading, &#8220;Why won&#8217;t you let me through the door? Is that too much to ask? Mama! Mama! Mama!&#8221; At this point, the mother having called the police, the footage shows the police arriving at the family home. The father tells the police officer watching the replay of the footage with him, &#8220;she had a bit of tantrum. I&#8217;m afraid her mother&#8217;s encouraging her.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-size:11pt">The video footage makes for disturbing viewing. The child is patently in a high state of distress. The father manifestly is seen to be behaving in a controlling, domineering manner preventing the child from leaving her bedroom. His behaviour is patently emotionally abusive. In his narrative to the police, the father sought to blame both the child and the child&#8217;s mother for a situation so demonstrably created by him. The events are vividly captured on the father&#8217;s body worn camera. The father&#8217;s narrative demonstrates a complete lack of insight into the damaging effect of his behaviour, with seemingly no understanding of how intimidating it would feel for a then 10-year-old girl to be blocked from leaving her room for a prolonged period, preventing her from seeking the comfort of her mother and being recorded in bed on a body worn video camera. His lack of empathy is troubling. The father&#8217;s attempts to impose a narrative on the child that she was acting, is further evidence of his harmful behaviour towards her. In this Court&#8217;s judgment, the child&#8217;s distress was real, genuine and palpable.  Furthermore, the father&#8217;s narrative to the police that the mother was, &#8220;encouraging her&#8221; is evidence of an </span><span style="font-size:11pt;color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">id&#233;e fixe</span><span style="font-size:11pt"> that permeates throughout the evidence.</span></p>

This is really disappointing. I&#8217;m being abused here. Can&#8217;t you arrest her? She is blackening my name and if you take me away, you&#8217;re supporting her. It&#8217;s abusive.&#8221; In behaviour similar to that at the time of the 14 February arrest, the father then controls the pace of the arrest, keeping the police waiting while he uses the toilet, selects clothing and then brushes his teeth. The police are remarkably accommodating.</span></p>

The father again, with legal advice, gave a &#8216;no comment&#8217; interview and provided a written statement in which he recorded, &#8220;My wife and I are going through a protracted, difficult divorce process. We separated on 18 December 2022, cohabiting with two children and trying to arrive financial settlement. I was advised in 2020 to protect self from false accusations by recording interactions in the home. I was advised by the police to record interactions to protect myself.&#8221; The father denied pushing his son, stating, &#8220;[&#8216;B&#8217;] complained of stomach ache. She [the mother] deliberately blocked me going to [&#8216;B&#8217;]. I placed my body between him and the mother to check he was ok. I did not intentionally push him&#8230;[&#8216;B&#8217;] banged his nose on something, maybe the fridge door. I did not see it happen.  I did not push or hit him. He was taken aback and complained he hurt his nose. I put frozen peas on his nose.&#8221; In respect of &#8216;G&#8217;, the father stated, &#8220;[She] has been acting out recently. It has been difficult getting her up on days when </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">I&#8217;m in charge</span><span style="font-size:11pt"> of the children. I tried to encourage and cajole [&#8216;G&#8217;] to get out of bed. I took the duvet off her to try to get her to get up. I&#8217;d heard of a trick where if you put water on someone&#8217;s foot that would make them want to go to the loo. I poured water on my hand and touched her foot. I did not intend to frighten her or use violence. [&#8216;G&#8217;] needed to go to music class. Once again, she was not getting up. I pulled the duvet off her and tried to reason with her, sitting on her bed. [&#8216;G&#8217;] did not want to go because I would take her to meet some of my friends afterwards&#8230;I tried to reason with her. She was messing about with her mother&#8217;s phone. I tried to reason with her and took phone off her so she was fully engaged in our conversation. I did the same with the iPad. At one point she started screaming. I tried to calm her down. She tried to avoid engaging with me by leaving the bedroom at one point. I asked her why she was leaving. I was in the doorway. I did not intend to trap her in room to exercise control. I did not intend to frighten her or use violence against her. I tried to maintain a loving relationship with my children. As a parent I do have to exercise a degree of parental control over two young children. I never sought to constrain [&#8216;G&#8217;s] behaviour, activities or movement to a degree which objectively could be seen as oppressive. I have to tell her off as normal parenting, as reasonable and in her best interests, not to threaten or humiliate her.&#8221; </span></p>

In this Court&#8217;s judgement, the mother gave her evidence in a direct manner. She answered questions in thorough cross-examination by Mr Hankinson without evasion. Further, her core evidence was supported in all material aspects by the written documentary evidence and video evidence available. The mother presented to me a straight forward, honest witness, who did her best to assist the Court. She presented as quiet and timid in the witness box. This is in stark contrast to the observations made by the Recorder when he conducted the hearing by video in August 2021. In respect of the August 2021 hearing, the mother told the Court, &#8220;I was not ready for a Fact Finding Hearing. We were going for something very different. I did not know what was going to happen. I did not understand the process. I felt intimidated. They [the father and his Counsel] were both there on the screen. I felt like [the father] was giving a different version of reality. He told [the Recorder] there were only two floors in the Paternal Grandmother&#8217;s property and one bathroom and [fewer] bedrooms. There was not. It has three floors, four bedrooms and two bathrooms. Even then, I was not believed.&#8221; I have considered whether in the hearing before me the mother was attempting to give a false impression to the Court that she was vulnerable and timid. I entirely reject such hypothesis. On the contrary, the mother was in my judgement genuinely tearful at times and plainly found the process of giving evidence to be distressing, notwithstanding the participation directions put in place.</span></p>

The mother spoke of the father filming the children intrusively, making them feel uncomfortable. She described the body worn camera he carried at all times around his neck. Further, &#8220;he hid a device under the bed or on the sofa. He was giving a narrative while recording us, that was not the same as reality...It was him being obsessive and blaming us. We always felt watched wherever we go and whatever we do, even when he was not in the house. They could see even when he was not there, the camera was there.&#8221; The mother described the father taking pictures of the neighbours&#8217; children, intimidating them in their own garden, &#8220;Even the neighbours&#8217; children experienced that&#8230;he had an issue with the neighbours, if a ball came over the fence&#8230;he took a photo of the children.

She told the Court that she was downstairs in the hallway by the door.

She told the Court that she walked away and the father followed her, still talking to her. She told the Court, &#8220;He has a habit of closing doors when talking to me, to separate us. He pushed the door on me. A flash of his anger. His anger always comes in flashes. I put my hand up to cover my face. The edge of the door hit me on the forearm.&#8221; The mother demonstrated the action in the witness box, holding her arm over her face. She told the Court that the father used such force that the door came off its hinges. She provided photographic evidence of the door hanging by its lower hinges only, the upper hinges having separated from the door frame. The mother told the Court that she did not report the incident to the police for two days, stating, &#8220;I&#8217;m scared to do things when he is in the house that would upset him. I was injured on the Friday. He left on the Saturday. I called the police on the Sunday. I collected my thoughts and thought, all this is wrong...It was painful. I was terrified&#8230;I was scared to react because of how it would develop. Most of the time it is control, intimidation and fear.&#8221;</span></p>

The mother flatly denied the suggestion. The mother was clear that she did not consent to intercourse nor did she consent to him photographing her during intercourse throughout their marriage. This Court takes care not to draw any adverse inference against the mother for delayed reporting of the allegations of rape. It is clear that the mother did not report the incidents in her country of origin. She later reported the events to the police in the United Kingdom. It does not appear that the police signposted the mother for support via her GP or for therapeutic work. Indeed, it does not appear that the mother&#8217;s allegations were considered by way of any thorough police investigation. The allegations were largely dismissed by the police, it seems, without the father being questioned. The mother&#8217;s reports of the incidents were documented. The Court was informed that it was only when direct access Counsel become involved that the mother was given advice regarding seeking findings on the allegations and to provide a detailed statement. The mother was consistent in her evidence that, during the holiday in her country of origin, she was very clear to the father that she did not want sex but he continued regardless. The mother was consistent further in her evidence, during thorough and proper cross-examination, that the father would regularly video her during intercourse, contrary to her express requests that he should not. The mother asserts that the father&#8217;s behaviour fits into a pattern of abusive, dominating and controlling behaviour, where he demands what he is entitled to. In this Court&#8217;s judgement, the mother&#8217;s evidence regarding the two incidents of rape was clear and reliable. Consistent with her other evidence generally, the mother answered questions in cross-examination in a direct manner without evasion. Her evidence was detailed and compelling. </span></p>

It means you are making false allegations.&#8221;  Further, it was put to the father that despite telling the Court at the Dispute Resolution Appointment on 28 July 2022 that he had not been allowed to see the children for four months, he had in fact been invited by the mother to attend a music concert at school where &#8216;G&#8217; was performing on 9 July 2022 and he had attended. The father responded to Counsel, &#8220;You are confusing literally seeing someone and meaningful contact.&#8221;</span></p>

The father demonstrated not the slightest insight into the impact of his actions and behaviours on the children. In evidence to the Court, he found it impossible to think empathetically towards the children. He was unable at all to reflect on the clearest possible evidence of his controlling and abusive behaviour, that being the video evidence he took on his body warn camera during the incident when he prevented &#8216;G&#8217; from leaving her bedroom, resulting in the situation escalating to one of the child demonstrably experiencing such a high level of prolonged distress. The father took the decision to video record all movements in the family home. In doing so, he is hoist with his own petard.</span></p>

Dr Lopez concluded that the mother did not present with any mental health disorder, although there was evidence of stress associated to her then living arrangements, where she was cohabitating with the father. Dr Lopez concluded that the mother would have capacity to achieve a less acrimonious relationship with the father, were she to not feel the need to protect herself: &#8220;as a parent, [the mother] has learnt that it is &#8216;important to be together&#8217; which would have increased her determination to stay in a relationship that she might have perceived as controlling.&#8221; Dr Lopez concluded that overall, the mother&#8217;s attitude to the father, &#8220;would predict that there would be significant risk that the relationship would continue to be acrimonious and characterised by reciprocal accusations that would have a significant impact on the children emotionally. She would continue to feel powerless to affect change in her life&#8230;she would have greater difficulty keeping the children at the centre of her thinking.

However, he sent me material from &#8216;Psychology Today&#8217; on the internet and asked me for my views. The webpage includes ideas about alienating parents and he questioned whether I was aware of what was happening in his family. The Respondent was fixated with the view that the Applicant was an alienating parent. The Respondent was not able to understand what was happening and this was concerning. I believe that this is because of the way he thinks and he is incapable of understanding how someone else might feel. This was especially emphasised when he wrote a disturbing poem to his son. I was extremely worried by the contents. I question why the Respondent repeats that the Applicant and children are violent to him. The Respondent described his daughter as a &#8216;mean witch&#8217; whilst she was watching a movie and when his son playfully grabbed his nose, he described this as an assault&#8230;I was concerned that it was not safe for the parties to be in a house together.

I feel the Respondent is quite unstable. I understand that people can appear to be perfectly rational when they are, in fact, anything but.

Ms Davey records, &#8220;Everything [the mother] is describing on how she is feeling and how she presents herself is a what a victim of abuse would be presenting.&#8221; Ms Davey is not an independent expert. She was not appointed by the Court. This Court finds little evidential value in this letter when seeking to determine the factual disputes between the parties. The letter is of assistance to the Court, however, to the extent that it informs the Court of Ms Davey&#8217;s view that the mother has difficultly in remembering certain memories and dates. Ms Davey tells the Court, &#8220;This&#8230;is very common when a person has been subjected to domestic abuse. Parts of the brain called the amygdala and the hippocampus are damaged due to the abuse and trauma leaving a person struggling to remember things easily&#8230;Anxiety and being blamed for everything from the husband (manipulation tactics) (blame shifting) is a mental torture that victims endure daily, it will break their spirit, make them question their sanity and doubt their own thoughts.&#8221; The Court takes into consideration the mother&#8217;s vulnerabilities when assessing the quality of her evidence. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.03in"><span style="font-size:11pt">The father seeks to rely on evidence by way of a letter from Dr Kraft dated 19 August 2021. He describes himself as a registered UKCP Psychotherapist. He is not an independent expert. He was not appointed by the Court. No permission has been given for the father to rely on any expert evidence other than that of Dr Lopez. The letter from Dr Kraft contains no statement of truth nor does it comply with any of the requirements of Family Procedure Rule 25. Far from being independent, the father told the Court during cross-examination that Dr Kraft is known to him as a friend. The father was particularly evasive in his answers during cross-examination as to his relationship with Dr Kraft. Dr Kraft&#8217;s letter records that the father engaged in psychotherapy sessions. Dr Kraft proffered an opinion that the father, &#8220;has experienced long periods of prolonged trauma due to his partner&#8217;s behaviour.&#8221; Dr Kraft recorded, &#8220;I believe that the adverse impact on [the father&#8217;s] emotional and mental wellbeing has mostly been caused by external sources &#8211; specifically his partner&#8217;s behaviour towards him and how she has alienated his children from him&#8230;I have been compiling more and more evidence week by week to support this view.&#8221; In this Court&#8217;s judgement, the letter from Dr Kraft has no evidential value in these proceedings. Dr Kraft&#8217;s opinion is plainly based on the father&#8217;s self-reporting, without Dr Kraft having considered any of the documentation in these proceedings and without him meeting the mother. It is particularly troubling that in his role as a psychotherapist, Dr Kraft would consider it appropriate to &#8220;compile&#8221; evidence to support the father&#8217;s view that the mother has, &#8220;alienated his children from him.&#8221;  The evidence does not assist the Court in determining the factual disputes between the parties. </span></p>

He hasn&#8217;t been very kind to me in the past. He shouted at me and said that I was mean lots of times. It made me feel scared and I didn&#8217;t like it.

There is no evidence of a high level of emotional abuse or harassment; generalised aggressive or stalking behaviours, no sexual violence, no pattern of coercively controlling behaviour, no escalating abuse or violence and no lethal behaviours, which would indicate a current high risk from ongoing domestic abuse. If the risk of domestic abuse was high it would not be safe to promote contact, however this is not the case. It is, however, my assessment that the main risk factor currently presented to the children from the parental relationship is one of parental conflict&#8230;Having considered Cafcass&#8217; parental alienation tool, [&#8216;G&#8217;s] views suggest some elements of parental alienation, however, when considering Dr Lopez assessment, it is highly likely father has not been emotionally available to [&#8216;G&#8217;] or provided her with the emotional warmth needed which has influenced her to believe her father does not like her, thus there are other behaviours exhibited by father which also contribute to the dynamic. It is evident that factors, such as fathers&#8217; limitations to meet [&#8216;G&#8217;s] emotional needs, have contributed to the currently strained relationship, as opposed to parental alienation being the standalone reason. Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest current parental alienation in respect of [&#8216;B&#8217;]&#8230;It is highly likely that when [&#8216;G&#8217;] has displayed certain rejecting behaviours towards her father (due to aligning herself to her mother), it has triggered father to become confrontational (for example referring to her as the bad witch), raise his voice and to display coercive anger or frustration which she has interpreted as &#8216;mean&#8217; behaviour that has caused her to feel &#8216;scared&#8217;.&#8221;</span></p>

He presented as torn emotionally between parents; he had said he was not allowed to speak with his mum when it was his dads time (even though mother was in the house).

It is therefore understandable that they associate [the father] as the reason for the conflict and the distressing experiences they have been through (due to the parties&#8217; conflict). It is clear, particularly when considering [&#8216;B&#8217;s] wishes, that he is scared to see his father again as he believes the &#8216;bad things&#8217; will happen again. The children have learnt that if they do not see their father, then their life is happier, calmer, and safer.&#8221;</span></p>

Dr Lopez described that he would have greater difficulty interacting and connecting with the children in a way that would promote their security or attachment, where he will struggle to prioritise his children&#8217;s needs above his own without appropriate support&#8230;It is my opinion, (particularly when considering the children&#8217;s verbalised experiences and their views), [the father&#8217;s] responses towards them and mother (whether intentional or not) have demonstrated his limitations in being able to keep the children in mind. He has been unable to place the children&#8217;s emotional needs above his own needs and feelings (particularly his very strong and fixed feelings in respect of mother alienating him from the children). This has caused him to respond in ways that have been emotionally harmful to the children, such as making the children feel they could not speak with their mother.&#8221;</span></p>

He verbalised that the course describes fathers having to accept their abusive behaviours and therefore he was not willing to engage as he does not accept his is a perpetrator of domestic abuse. In my opinion, (regardless of the reasons that led to his behaviour responses), his role and behaviours witnessed and experienced by the children have been emotionally damaging and have caused them significant distress. In my view, [the father] needs to recognise and acknowledge these abusive behaviours with support from Caring Dads intervention. Given that his view is strongly fixed on parental alienation being the only reason for the children&#8217;s views, he has not demonstrated that he can be reflective or consider his role in this. This view is mirrored by [Local Authority Children's Services]&#8230;The children&#8217;s descriptions suggest [the father] has displayed elements of control towards mother (by way of trying to micromanage his time with them and ensuring mother does not communicate with them).&#8221;</span></p>

This Court has had the unique opportunity in these current proceedings of exploring the relevant evidence and thoroughly testing it. The Family Court Adviser expressed uncertainty, &#8220;as to the mother&#8217;s role in respect of parental alienation&#8221; and &#8220;whether the mother has instructed the children&#8221; to say negative things about their father.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.2in"><span style="font-size:11pt">As a general rule, a paying party should be ordered to pay the amount of any summarily assessed costs within 14 days. The father asserts that payment of these costs would impact his ability to meet his liabilities to the mother arising from the Orders made in financial remedy proceedings. He asserts that it would take him one year to raise funds to meet this costs Order. This Court rejects those submission as not amounting to satisfactory reasons to delay payment of this costs Order. The mother, reasonably, seeks payment in 21 days. In this Court&#8217;s judgment, payment of the total sum of &#163;50,445.40 in 21 days is just in all the circumstances. If payment is not made in respect of this judgment sum within the time specified, interest will accrue. The mother would be entitled to seek to enforce any outstanding judgment debt.  </span></p>
