She is represented by Mr Gordon Semple through her guardian, Ms Anglim.  JN&#8217;s mother is TN (hereafter &#8216;the mother&#8217;).  The mother is represented by Ms Rachel Jones of counsel. JN&#8217;s father is KC (hereafter &#8216;the father&#8217;).  His current whereabouts are unknown. The parents are Lithuanian nationals. JN was born in the United Kingdom and has a British birth certificate. According to the mother, JN also has a Lithuanian birth certificate and passport. </p>

In addition, on 24 February 2020 the mother fled to a domestic violence refuge after alleging that she had been the victim of domestic abuse at the hands of her then partner, EP.  EP also stood accused of offences related to people trafficking. </p>

Whilst the mother was scheduled to be deported on 30 October 2020, the Home Office has provided an assurance that the deportation will not take place until this court has determined whether it is in JN&#8217;s best interests to return to Lithuania with her mother.  If the court determines that this course of action is in JN&#8217;s best interests, the Home Office has confirmed that JN will be able to return to Lithuania with her mother when her mother is deported from the United Kingdom. </p>

As a result of this, the local authority&#8217;s care plan is one of rehabilitation of JN to the care of her mother.  Within this context, the mother seeks the rehabilitation of JN to her care at the earliest opportunity.  The Children&#8217;s Guardian is also of the view that it is in JN&#8217;s best interests to be rehabilitated to the care of her mother.   </p>

Notwithstanding this information, the Children&#8217;s Guardian went so far as to describe the situation set out above as an &#8220;impasse&#8221;.  The reality, however, was that the Lithuanian State Child Rights Protection and Adoption Service had confirmed in clear terms that it would, if necessary, intervene appropriately in the family, in accordance with Lithuanian law and practice and based on assessment, once the mother and JN had arrived in Lithuania. </p>

Within this context, I gave further time to the Children&#8217;s Guardian to consider her position ahead of this hearing. </p>

It is intimately connected with the question of the best interests of the child, given the construction for the regulation and the logical connection between the questions. That said, the starting point for the enquiry into the second question is the principle of comity and co-operation between member states of the European Union enshrined in the European Union Treaty which the provisions of B2R were designed to reflect and implement (see, for example [2] [21] and [23] of the preamble to BIIR). In particular , the judicial and social care arrangements in member states are to be treated by the courts in England and Wales as being equally competent: <span style="font-style:italic">RE K (A Child) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/895" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 895" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 895</ref> at [24] per Thorpe LJ.&#8221; </p>

It is not for the courts of this or any other country to question the &#8220;competence, diligence, resources or efficacy of either the child protection services or the courts&#8221; of another state: see <span style="font-style:italic">In re M (Brussels II Revised: Article 15)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2014] 2 FLR 1372" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] 2 FLR 1372</ref>, para 54(v), per Sir James Munby P.

This principle goes both ways. Just as we must respect and trust the competence of other member states, so must they respect and trust ours.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Whilst this judgment is given in what is now the lengthening twilight of the transition period following the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the principle of comity as applied to judicial and social care arrangements in different jurisdictions in cases concerning children and families does not, of course, derive solely from Council Regulation (EC) 2201/2003.  Comity is an established common law principle based on courtesy, respect and reciprocity (see <span style="font-style:italic">Buck v Att-Gen </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1965] Ch 745" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1965">[1965] Ch 745</ref> at 770).  Whilst it has been noted, not always favourably, that the principle of comity is of &#8220;very elastic content&#8221; (see Dicey and Morris on Conflict of Laws 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Ed. at [1-008]), it has been accepted that, in the context of family law cases with an international element, the principle of comity encompasses administrative, judicial and social services.  Within this context, and by way of example, in cases involving the Convention of 25 October 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction it is well established the court should accept that, unless the contrary is proved, the administrative, judicial and social services in another jurisdiction are as adept at protecting children as they are in this jurisdiction (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (Abduction: Grave Risk)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 2 FLR 141" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 2 FLR 141</ref>, <span style="font-style:italic">Re M (Abduction: Intolerable Situation)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] 1 FLR 930" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] 1 FLR 930</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re L (Abduction: Pending Criminal Proceedings)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 1 FLR 433" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 1 FLR 433</ref>). </p>

The mother accepts that she has exposed her daughter to criminal conduct by being involved in offending related to human trafficking and forced slavery, including at one point keeping an individual in bondage in the loft in property where JN also resided and thereafter in a cupboard under the stairs. As a result the mother was convicted and received a custodial sentence of 2 years and 4 months, by reason of which JN had to be taken into care, there being no other person able to exercise parental responsibility in respect of her.  In addition, the mother failed to adequately meet JN educational needs, resulting in an adverse impact on JN&#8217;s attainment and social development.   To the mother&#8217;s credit she has accepted, and evinced credibly an intention to address the grave shortcomings as a parent evidenced by the aforesaid matters. </p>

The comprehensive and balanced parenting assessment undertaken by the local authority concludes as follows: </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.43in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;[13.22] Based upon all of the above information, this is a positive parenting assessment of [the mother]. There is no evidence to support a hypothesis that she is unable to meet JN&#8217;s basic care needs or that JN has suffered significant harm whilst in her mother&#8217;s care or is likely to suffer significant harm if she returns to her mother&#8217;s care.  In line with Article 8 and the right to family life, consistent with the child&#8217;s welfare, everything must be done to preserve the family. It is not enough to show that a child could be placed in a more beneficial environment. (Baroness Hale re B). Therefore whilst JN may have made certain improvements in foster care this is not a basis on which to make a decision regarding her future care. There are areas in which [the mother] needs to improve her parenting, specifically to avoid a repetition of her overprotective approach which has resulted in JN being able to have greater control over decisions such as her whether to go to school or not. [The mother] admits that she was preoccupied with JN&#8217;s health, borne out of a fear of losing her which on refection was not rational. [The mother] also accepts that this over protectiveness limited JN educationally and socially which in turn has had an impact on her language skills, her attainment and the benefits of having peers, to play and talk and learn how to communicate with and develop autonomy and resilience within these interactions which will build her sense of self-esteem. [The mother] needs to reflect further on how her well intentioned actions to safeguard JN, have in fact had the opposite effect and she must ensure that in order for JN to develop and achieve and become a well-rounded adult she needs to experience a broader spectrum of life experiences that promote her well-being. More importantly [the mother] needs to continue to take full responsibility for her behaviour which led to her incarceration and how JN had had to cope with the loss of her mother, conclusion regarding why she is no longer caring for her and the worry that she has had to endure. The dominant issue however is risk and [the mother&#8217;s] part in exposing JN to this by her decision making. Whilst there is little evidence of impact on JN from what has taken place, the risk was nevertheless present and [the mother] must ensure that this is never repeated to minimise the potential for harm to JN in the future.&#8221; </p>

It is plain from the assessments before the court, and from the report of the Children&#8217;s Guardian, that any role for agencies in respect of the family moving forward will be purely supportive in nature.  Further, within this context and as I have already set out, upon the departure of JN and the mother from this jurisdiction and their arrival in Lithuania, the Lithuanian State Child Rights Protection and Adoption Service has made clear that the territorial unit will visit the family, check how mother ensures JN&#8217;s rights and best interests, determine what help the family needs and, if indicated following an assessment, (a) the family will be supervised by the Lithuanian State Child Rights Protection and Adoption Service, (b) JN will be provided with therapeutic services and (c) the mother will be supported by Lithuanian social workers.  This court has every confidence that the Lithuanian State Child Rights Protection and Adoption Service will proceed in the manner they have indicated.  Within this context, it cannot be said in my judgment that making an order at the conclusion of these proceedings in respect of JN is better than making no order at all.   </p>

But care is also needed in cases involving an international element to ensure that professionals do not simply assume that the child protection system in a foreign jurisdiction operates in the same way as the system in this jurisdiction, or that because the system in another jurisdiction operates differently it is necessary to impose on that system the expectations and approach that is taken in this jurisdiction.  At certain points in this case the Children&#8217;s Guardian appears to have approached the Lithuanian State Child Rights Protection and Adoption Service as if it were an English local authority over which the court has jurisdiction, rather than an agency in a foreign sovereign State subject to the laws and practices in that State and over which this court has no jurisdiction.    </p>
