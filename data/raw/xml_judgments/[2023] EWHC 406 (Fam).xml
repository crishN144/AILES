The findings sought by the mother concerned allegations of domestic abuse. Recorder Bradberry concluded the allegations made by the mother were not proved to the required standard.</p>

Two of the grounds of appeal concern the same issue; that the judge failed to comply with the court&#8217;s duties under Part 3A and Practice Direction 3AA Family Procedure Rules 2010 (&#8220;FPR&#8221;) and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2021/17/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 63</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2021/17" uk:canonical="2021 c. 17" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Domestic Abuse Act 2021</ref> (&#8220;DAA&#8221;).

The father&#8217;s application was made on 15 December 2021, over 12 months ago. The fact-finding hearing took place in September 2022. It is a matter of very great concern that the proceedings have been ongoing for over a year. Whatever the outcome of the father&#8217;s application, delay in itself is inimical to the welfare needs of this young child (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(2)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>).

As a consequence he made an application to the court in December 2021 for an order to spend time with X. A Cafcass safeguarding letter was prepared and the first hearing was before the magistrates in April 2022. Bearing in mind the allegations made by the mother concerned allegations of domestic abuse FPR PD12J was engaged. Directions were made by the magistrates for disclosure from the police, local authority, a letter from the mother&#8217;s GP and for the filing of a Scott Schedule of allegations the mother relied on, with provision for the father to respond. The application was re-allocated to District Judge level.</p>

He gave permission for the mother to rely on five video clips of covert recordings of the father relied upon by the mother. The mother had installed covert recording in their home prior to the parties separation, due to her concerns that the father posed a risk of sexual harm to X. Other directions for further evidence were made and the matter listed for a two-day fact-finding hearing in early July. That hearing was adjourned at the mother&#8217;s request and re-listed in September 2022.</p>

The mother gave evidence over two days and the father for half a day. During the course of her evidence, the mother was shown some of the video recordings she relied upon, as there were issues about what she reported was in the video and what could be seen in the video recording. By the nature of the allegations relied upon by the mother, she would have been asked about intimate issues regarding the parents&#8217; relationship. It is agreed that all parties&#8217; cameras remained switched on during the evidence, so both parents were able to see the other when they gave evidence.</p>

It is of note that in the written judgment there is no reference to FPR Part 3A or any real consideration of the mother&#8217;s vulnerability in her giving evidence as a result of the allegations of domestic abuse. The order dated 23 September 2022 recorded the (non) findings made by the court, gave directions for indirect contact and ordered a section 7 report from Cafcass together with an interim report to address interim contact. The next hearing was fixed for 17 October 2022.</p>

The question on appeal in each case will be, first, whether there has been a serious procedural or other irregularity and, secondly, if so, whether as a result the decision was unjust. We are alive to the fact that many witnesses will give their evidence in a way which falls short of the standard that they would have wished for, or their advocates had hoped. Sometimes, this may be because of the very nature of human frailty, at other times it may be because a witness was deliberately deflecting or obfuscating or, worse still, lying.</span></p>

Those considerations and that analysis does not appear in the judgment.
