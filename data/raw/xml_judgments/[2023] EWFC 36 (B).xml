The project was in its early stages at that point. The staff at the loss-making bakery were being laid off and that business was being wound up. I was told by W that about &#163;10,000 - &#163;15,000 had been spent on a licensing application in the early part of January. I accept this evidence and find that H was not obliged to invest the kind of money he subsequently did into the premises. It was his choice. In evidence, H stated that being a restaurateur was the only business that he knew. Whilst that may be true in one sense, setting up a new restaurant also ran contrary to his long-held ambition to travel and have an easier life free of the commitment required to run a successful restaurant business. There would have been any number of options for investment of the parties&#8217; nest egg at this stage. It was H&#8217;s active choice to invest heavily in another restaurant business.</span></p>

It would be paternalistic and patronising to override their agreement simply on the basis that the court knows best.

But unconscionable conduct such as undue pressure (falling short of duress) will also be likely to eliminate the weight to be attached to the agreement, and other unworthy conduct, such as exploitation of a dominant position to secure an unfair advantage, would reduce or eliminate it (para 71). The court may take into account a party&#8217;s emotional state, and what pressures he or she was under to agree. But that again cannot be considered in isolation from what would have happened had he or she not been under those pressures (para 72).</span></p>

The parties are unlikely to have intended that their ante-nuptial agreement should result, in the event of the marriage breaking up, in one partner being left in a predicament of real need, while the other enjoys a sufficiency or more, and such a result is likely to render it unfair to hold the parties to their agreement. Equally if the devotion of one partner to looking after the family and the home has left the other free to accumulate wealth, it is likely to be unfair to hold the parties to an agreement that entitles the latter to retain all that he or she has earned (para 81).</span></p>

There is a world of difference between, say; (i) a childless couple whose marriage lasts for 2 years, enjoying only a modest lifestyle, at the end of which one party might need no more than short term maintenance or a highly attenuated housing budget (perhaps restricted to time limited rental), and (ii) as here, a couple with 3 children, who have been together 20 years, who each contributed to the welfare of the family in different ways, and who enjoyed a high standard of living. I adopt the words of King LJ which seem to me to describe accurately the flexibility of the discretionary exercise. Of course, the court will always, in conducting the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s25</ref> evaluation, have regard to the fact of a PNA and its terms. I would not therefore adopt the approach of W&#8217;s counsel, which seemed to me to be too straitjacketing. Nor do I consider that the two stage gateway process suggested by H&#8217;s counsel is made out on the authorities.&#8221;</span></p>

She works and they also receive some support from her family, which may have to be paid back or may be a soft loan. H has yet to identify employment which he considers to be congenial and fears he will not do so at age 58. He is a long way from the carefree existence he set out for at the end of the marriage. That said, he has a roof over his head and his partner (and mother of his two children) brings home an income. I am afraid that H may be right in fearing that his options for congenial employment are limited &#8211; but he is still young enough to work and he will be able to find </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">some</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> work, even if it is work he would rather not do. So, whilst H is now shorn of capital, he is not destitute. He has a home, a partner with an income and he has the ability to go and earn some money.</span></p>

The first is that any sum I awarded would be swallowed up in H&#8217;s litigation with the landlord over the unpaid rent. Whilst the authorities encourage me to do what I can to avoid a predicament of real need, here I am unable to do anything which will actually assist H in a practical sense. H has no entitlement to more and I am not required to award him money which I can see will just disappear in further litigation he faces.</span></p>

The balance of his evidence is not for a roof over his head (although I accept he has also mentioned this, it did not seem to me to be the driving issue for H). That is not the kind of alleviation of real need which I consider to be appropriate in this case. H&#8217;s opportunity for risking capital generated during the marriage must now be considered to be at an end.</span></p>
