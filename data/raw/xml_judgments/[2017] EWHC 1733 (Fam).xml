	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On Monday 26 June 2017, at the end of a long day of (mostly) legal argument, I announced that I would be acceding to the application for recognition of a Nigerian adoption order. I also indicated I would provide a written judgment as soon as time permitted and that the appeal period would run from the time the order, consequent upon the judgment, was made.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I should make clear at the outset that I am indebted to both Ms Cronin and Ms van Overdijk for two quite exceptional Skeleton Arguments. Their thorough analyses of the legal framework (statutory, regulatory and case law) are unparalleled in terms of content and discussion. Their arguments, concisely put, were extraordinarily well articulated both in writing and orally.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The position taken on behalf of the SSHD was neither supportive nor directly resistant to the application. Ms van Overdijk merely invited me to take account of her submissions when determining the application. During the course of argument, I confirmed with her that the SSHD was seeking a rigorous examination of the various issues rather than inviting me to accede to or refuse the application.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The impact of an order recognising the Nigerian adoption order of their two year old son &#8211; V &#8211; is that they will be treated as his &#8220;parents&#8221; in immigration law (see paragraph 6 of The Immigration Rules HC 395); and V will be their dependent child under the family points-based system visa arrangements (HC 395 paragraph 319H). The current position is that V has been refused entry to the UK as the child of a points based migrant under paragraph 319H (b) and paragraph 319H (l). &#8220;The applicant must be the child of a parent who has &#8230; valid entry clearance, leave to enter or remain &#8230; as (i) a relevant points based system migrant &#8230;; and (l) All arrangements for the child&#8217;s care and accommodation in the UK must comply with relevant UK legislation and requirements. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The regulations require prospective adopters to obtain a certificate from the Secretary of State for Education which, amongst other matters, certifies that if an adoption order is made &#8220;the child will be authorised to enter and reside permanently in the UK&#8221; &#8211; see r.4(2)(a)(ii). Ms van Overdijk indicates that the Secretary of State cannot and will not issue such a certificate of eligibility for a foreign adoptive child whose parents are temporary residents. Moreover, the applicants have been informed by the local adoption agency that they are ineligible to be assessed as prospective adopters for V because they do not have indefinite leave to remain. This advice accords with Department for Education and Home Office guidance and practice relating to prospective intercountry adoptions.</p>

The reference in s. 66(1)(e) to foreign adoptions &#8216;recognised by the law of England and Wales&#8217; does not prescribe the circumstances in which such adoption would be recognised but in its terms plainly relates to the recognition of foreign adoptions at common law.</p>

The concept of domicile has &#8220;particular importance &#8230; as a connecting factor in family law.&#8221; &#8220;A person must always have a domicile but can only have one domicile at a time. Hence it must be given the same meaning in whatever context it arises&#8221; [see paragraph 37]. In addition, &#8220;The object of the rules determining domicile is to discover the system of law with which the propositus is most closely connected for the range of purposes mentioned earlier. &#8230; the concept of domicile is not that of a benefit to the propositus. Rather it is a neutral rule of law for determining that system of personal law with which the individual has the appropriate connection, so that it shall govern his personal status and questions relating to him and his affairs&#8221;  [see paragraph 44].</p>

That position would appear to have resulted from the content of a letter by Mrs M (Assistant Chief State Counsel / Probation Officer) in a letter dated 14 January 2016 addressed &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">To whom it may concern</span>.&#8217;  The letter states that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">It is informative that the supervision order stated in the enrolment of the order is to be carried out by the Social Welfare Agency in the country where the Applicants and the juvenile are domiciled, in this case the United Kingdom &#8230; We therefore do not have any objection to the Applicants taking the child to any country where they are domiciled</span>.&#8221;</p>

Within her Skeleton Argument, Ms van Overdijk suggested there remain concerns (unassuaged by the Applicants&#8217; further evidence) that the Nigerian court may have been misled by them in the sworn evidence filed in support of the Motion to adopt. If that is correct, then argues Ms van Overdijk, it would be sufficient to engage the public policy threshold for refusing recognition; and she suggested that I may wish to hear oral evidence if I were to be sufficiently concerned.</p>

They were entitled to put their trust in a lawyer who held himself out as an expert in achieving international adoptions. It must be assumed that he knew the requirements of the law; and unquestionably he was responsible for drafting Mrs W&#8217;s Affidavit. In all of her dealings with Mrs M, the probation officer, Mrs W was transparent and entirely honest. Mrs M knew exactly when and for how long Mrs W had been in Nigeria and looking after V prior to the adoption hearing. The important factors for her (and for the judge) were the altogether pleasing &#8216;bond&#8217; that had developed between Mrs W and V and his future best interests. </p>

For present purposes, it is unnecessary to go beyond the structure of his decision summarised within the headnote which makes clear &#8211; that in determining an application for the recognition of a foreign adoption at common law and a 1986 Family Law Act application, the court had to act in a manner compatible with the right of the parents and child to respect for their family life under Article 8 of the Convention; that the strict application of the common law status conditions as to domicile and habitual residence to the very particular circumstances of that case, with a concomitant refusal to recognise the adoption lawfully constituted in Nepal &#8230; by reason of the failure to comply with those conditions would be an interference in the Article 8 rights of the parents and child which would be neither necessary nor proportionate &#8230;; that where family life existed between the parents and child for the purposes of Article 8 the court could not reasonably refuse to recognise their actual situation; that recognition of the adoption in that case was manifestly in the child&#8217;s best interests and its refusal would leave her without a permanent legal relationship with those she considered to be her parents &#8230;; that while it was important to maintain all the rules which the developed English law of adoption had devised to safeguard the welfare of children who were the subject of foreign adoptions, it would be contrary to public policy to apply those rules in a way which resulted in the breach of the fundamental rights of the parties; that in all the circumstances of that case, it would not be contrary to public policy to recognise the Nepalese adoption at common law; and that although neither parent had been domiciled or habitually resident in Nepal at the time they adopted the child, the court would recognise the adoption order at common law and make a declaration under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref>.</p>

The reality of the relationships between parents and child is what matters rather than the legality or otherwise of the adoption order. Ever since V was placed in the home of Mrs W&#8217;s sister when only two days old, Mr and Mrs W have viewed him as their prospective son. When the adoption proceedings were concluded, they viewed him as their son and a full member of their family. Mrs W has made a significant attachment to V not just during the time she was looking after him as his mother in Nigeria but also during the almost daily video messaging between them. Mr and Mrs W yearn to be able to arrange for V to join them in this country. Until now, as the result of the decision of the SSHD, they have been prevented from living as a family. Without an order recognising the Nigerian adoption they would not be able to spend the next two years here in the UK together as a family. Their Article 8 rights would be infringed in a way that was neither necessary nor proportionate. </p>
