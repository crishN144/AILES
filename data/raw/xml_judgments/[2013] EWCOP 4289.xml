	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The background to these proceedings is one that is not an uncommon for the Court of Protection.  The subject of the proceedings - and I&#160;should say, because one of the members of the family is present, that I&#160;shall be referring to people in an anonymised way because as and when this transcript is corrected it will be a public document - is a lady (&#8220;UF&#8221;) who is now 84.  She has been diagnosed as suffering from vascular dementia of a moderate level.  She, as I&#160;understand it, lived at home alone for some years until after her release from a detention under s.2 of the Mental Health Act, she was placed in a residential care home.  My understanding is that, in the period leading up to that section, there was a care package in place for her at her home.  The evidence also indicates that she has suffered from pain which has been treated, as I&#160;understand it, with a dosage of morphine, which has been reduced over time, certainly, through 2013.  The evidence indicates as one would expect that her treatment with painkillers may have had an impact on her thinking and behaviour.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">It is also sadly the position, although not uncommon so far as the Court of Protection is concerned, that there have been long-standing problems and disputes between the children of UF.  In short, after her release from section under s.2 of the Mental Health Act and her placement in the care home, there have been a series of assessments and a number of best interests meetings.  They have resulted in standard authorisations under the deprivation of liberty safeguards (&#8220;DOLS&#8221;) provisions in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> (the &#8220;MCA&#8221;) being given.  Standard authorisations are authorisations which authorise, and so render lawful, a deprivation of liberty of a person in a care home or a hospital.  The assessments leading to those standard authorisations have, as required by the MCA, included assessments founding conclusions of the assessors that:  (1) UF does not have the capacity to make relevant decisions as to where she should live, and (2) UF&#8217;s best interests were promoted by her remaining at the care home.  The best interests assessors in their reasoning have had regard to the long-standing and current disputes between the children of UF. As I&#160;understand it, at present the earlier package of care at home was in part funded by the local authority and was part self-funded.  UF has executed a power of attorney, I&#160;understand, in favour of a legal executive in a firm of solicitors, who has the day-to-day management of her financial affairs on the basis that it is the view of that executive and of others that she does not have the capacity herself to deal with those affairs.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The position has now been reached that one of UF&#8217;s daughters, AF, who had made her views known to but had not attended the best interests meetings, as I&#160;understand it because of difficulties of communication between her and her siblings, is of the view, having seen her mother on a regular basis, which is something she continues to do, that her mother may have capacity to reach the relevant decisions.   But, in any event, AF reports that her mother has expressed and is expressing to her in strong and, to her mind, worrying terms that she does not wish to be at the care home.  This has caused AF concern.  Her view expressed in evidence to this court is that her mother is very unhappy at the care home.  Indeed, she has said that in her view the placement is endangering her mother&#8217;s life.  In her view, her mother would be much better placed back in her own home with an appropriate package of care.  An alternative, suggested by AF is that her mother could come to live with her in her part of the country.  Counsel today described that as a backstop.  I&#160;think that that is a fair description of how it is put forward.  I should also record that the indications at present on the evidence are to the effect that UF has indicated that that is not a place where she would wish to reside.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">At the heart of the dispute, again not unfamiliar to the Court of Protection, is the choice to be made between care in a residential home and care at home with a support package which provides physical safety, and many of the arguments in favour of the support package at UF&#8217;s home relate to the promotion of the emotional security and happiness of UF.  These are very human stories and issues.  They present, of course, members of the family with difficult issues and problems.  Also, but without the same emotional element, they present employees of the relevant local authority and those from whom members of the family seek advice with practical problems and with problems arising from the technicalities of the MCA and in particular the labyrinthine provisions relating to its DOLS.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Part of the background to this case, and why it has ended up before me, is that problems have been encountered relating to the provision of legal aid to fund UF&#8217;s representation on a non-means tested basis.  The parties and the District Judge followed the approach set out in a decision of mine in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Re HA</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2012/1068" uk:canonical="[2012] EWCOP 1068" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWHC 1068 (COP)</ref>.  In that case, which had a number of similarities to this one, I indicated that, in my view, the relevant application to court remained an application under s.21A MCA, but the most appropriate way of managing it was for the court to take control of the proceedings and itself to authorise a continuing deprivation of liberty if that is what the court thought was the correct course to take.   Notwithstanding the considerable difficulties that can exist in identifying whether or not there is a deprivation of liberty, in this case it is common ground before me that, given the statements made by UF that she does not wish to be in the care home and the steps being taken in the care home to ensure that she remains there, this is a case in which it is, if not inevitable, extremely likely that it would be found that whilst she is in the care home there would be a deprivation of her liberty.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">As in a number of cases, on the evidence presently before the court, there is no immediately available alternative placement for UF.  This is because issues have yet to be formulated with sufficient particularity and supported by evidence, again an echo of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Re HA</span><span style="font-size:14pt">, concerning the viable alternatives.  Standing back for a moment and asking what the issues in this litigation are likely to be if it is found that UF does not have the capacity to make the decision for herself as to where her home should be and the support package she should have in that home, it is plain that the factors that the court will have to take into account in determining best interests will include the availability and detail of the available options.   The primary options being (1) remaining in the care home under a similar regime to that which presently exists, and (2) a move home with an extensive support package at home.  The consideration of that support package would need to be informed by its availability both physically and financially.  Thought will have to be given to the attitude that UF would be likely to have towards the relevant carers.  All that engages issues as to who would be providing it, how much it would cost and who would be paying for it.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">That is the background.  The difficulties arise from the divergence in view between AF, the daughter who opposes the otherwise unanimous view of UF&#8217;s children that it is in her best interests to remain in the care home.  Naturally, the fact that AF is in the minority does not mean that she is not correct.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Section 21A is plainly in the statute as part of the regime put in place to fill what is known as &#8220;the Bournewood gap&#8221;.  The case law thus far on how s.21A operates is fairly scant.  My understanding is that there is a case which has very recently been heard by the Court of Appeal which might throw some light on this.  For some time, it has seemed to me that attention has not yet been directed to the problems that might exist if a court considering the evidence that was before it, necessarily at a later time to the times upon which the relevant standard authorisations were given, reaches different conclusions to the relevant assessors and those responsible for granting the standard authorisation.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Such points may well not be academic because issues could arise whether a deprivation of liberty was unlawful through periods of time during which DOLS authorisations based on conclusions that are different to those reached by the Court were in place.  In that context, the relevant public authorities may face claims for damages.  To my mind, there must be an argument that, in testing the legality from time to time of standard authorisations, an administrative law test is the appropriate one.  However, equally, to my mind, and this is supported by the approach taken thus far in the Court of Protection, in the exercise of its powers under 21A the Court of Protection is not carrying out any sort of appeal or review jurisdiction.  Rather, it is assessing the relevant qualifying requirements itself and reaching its own view on the evidence presented to it.  It is almost inevitable that when doing that the Court will have to pay close attention to what will, on the evidence before it, best promote the best interests of the relevant person in the immediate, medium and long term and so carry out its own best interests assessment.  That is an inevitability in this case should it proceed.  Also, as I&#160;have explained, if this case proceeds there is a high likelihood or an inevitability that if it is thought that the least restrictive way to best promote the best interests of UF is that she should be in a care home, so long as she protests at being there, she would be being deprived of her liberty and therefore that would need to be authorised.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">So, as I&#160;read it, s.21A gives the Court of Protection the task of itself considering and making its own mind up on whether a standard authorisation should continue or should stop, or whether certain variations should be made to conditions relating to it.  It therefore, has to consider amongst other things whether or not the relevant person has capacity and also best interests.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Another point that arises is who can make an application under s.21A?  On its face, that is not restricted.  So a family member could, of his or her own motion and for himself or herself, make the relevant application.  The application can be made on behalf of the person detained.  Also, the application could be made by the representative appointed under Part 10.  That is made crystal clear by the provisions that P (i.e. the person detained) and that representative do not need permission to bring the proceedings.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">What happens on the ground, when somebody in the position of AF (i.e. a child or family member who thinks that the decisions of others on and relating to the placement of a person are flawed) wishes to challenge that decision and so wants an application under s.21A to be made?  What are the persons who he or she consults then meant to do?  Part of the advice could be, &#8220;Well, make the application yourself&#8221;.  Alternatively, and sensibly, there is force in seeing whether the application should be made by or on behalf of P.  That would often involve, it seems to me, making enquiry of the representative on his or her position.  So far as I am aware no such enquiry was made here but, as the representative agreed with the best interests decision on placement that was made, a clear inference is that he or she would not be inclined to initiate or to take any steps to challenge that decision or the ensuing deprivation of liberty.  That leaves, therefore, as realistic possibilities (a) a family member bringing the application themselves, and (b) the application being made by or on behalf of P.  If P does not have litigation capacity, P, pursuant to the Rule 141 of the Court of Protection Rules 2007 (&#8220;the Rules&#8221;) must have a litigation friend.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The application was made as an application by UF.  The experienced solicitor who was instructed by the daughter AF in respect of it did not form the view, and probably at that time was not in a position to form a view one way or the other, that UF had litigation capacity.  The application was presented in UF&#8217;s name, and in a supporting statement AF describes herself as making her first statement as a litigation friend of her mother, UF.  For present purposes, I&#160;shall assume that the relevant certificate was lodged.  It is not in the papers before me, but if it was not lodged that was an oversight.  That approach presents the court with the issue whether or not the self-designated litigation friend should continue to act as the litigation friend.  I&#160;propose to look at this issue in this case disregarding the problems that arose relating to the continuation of non-means tested legal aid.</span></p>

With hindsight and the assistance of the submissions made today, in particular by Mr.&#160;O&#8217;Brien on behalf of UF, that course, it seems to me, had some difficulties.  This is because I&#160;accept his submission that the determination of the issue of capacity to make the decision on where UF should live cannot be made without appropriate detail being provided of the relevant choices which the relevant assessor has to take into account in determining whether or not UF can give appropriate weight to the factors that are relevant to the decision on her placement.  But, in any event, that direction floundered by reference to funding problems to which I&#160;shall return.</span></p>

In the context of an application under s.21A, if the Official Solicitor is to be the litigation friend, that approach (particularly if it involves the gathering of evidence on capacity to make the relevant decision and funding and that timetable) is in most cases likely to be inappropriate, hence the pragmatism adopted by the District Judge.</span></p>

To that, I&#160;also add the following two points:  first, it seems to be common ground that the attorney has been proceeding on an uncontested basis that she lacks capacity to manage her financial affairs; second, the experienced solicitor acting for UF is not, in my view, understandably, and on what I&#160;have seen correctly, in a position to say that he feels that UF has the capacity to give him instructions directly.  I&#160;mention the latter because the subject matter of the litigation has enormous overlap with the subject matter of the issues that UF would have to take into account in deciding where she should live.  So, subject to the funding point and whether or not, as the Official Solicitor describes it, he would be a last resort appointment, there seems to be no impediment to the Official Solicitor carrying out one of his functions by acting as UF&#8217;s litigation friend in these proceedings.</span></p>

I do not agree that that is a fair classification of these proceedings because AF&#8217;s siblings are involved and the local authority is not their agent or representative.  In short there is a family dispute as well as a dispute between one member of the family and the local authority.</span></p>

I&#160;agree that members of a family, even if there is a family dispute concerning P&#8217;s best interests could, albeit I&#160;think rarely, appropriately act as P&#8217;s litigation friend in proceedings relating to that dispute.  However, it seems to me that he or she would need to demonstrate that he or she can, as P&#8217;s litigation friend, take a balanced and even-handed approach to the relevant issues.  That is a difficult task for a member of the family who is emotionally involved in the issues that are disputed within the family and it seems to me an impossible task for AF to carry out in this case.  One only has to look at her statements to see that she is clearly wedded to a particular answer.  You do not see within her statements a balanced approach or anything approaching it, such as:  &#8220;This is the problem.  These are the relevant factors for and against&#8221;.  That is not a criticism.  Rather it seems to me that it is a product of the result of there being long-standing family disputes and the existing clear divisions of opinion within the sibling group as to what will best promote UF&#8217;s best interests.</span></p>

Essentially this is because AF has an argument which she definitely wishes to run in advancing the best interests of her mother and this, coupled with the family history, means that AF cannot realistically consider the alternatives dispassionately.  When you add in the need to construe the words of Rule 140 by reference to the overriding objective, it seems to me clear that this is a case in which AF should not continue to be the litigation friend of UF.</span></p>

As I&#160;have already indicated, there is evidence in the assessments which is internally compelling that UF does not have capacity to make the relevant decisions and this conclusion is supported by views taken thus far as to her capacity to conduct her financial affairs and to litigate.  Further, as it seems to me that this is a case which cries out for somebody with the independence of the Official Solicitor to address both UF&#8217;s capacity to litigate and to make the relevant decisions, the court should not take the course set by the District Judge of embarking on getting evidence on what is in effect a preliminary enquiry as to UF&#8217;s capacity to make decisions on where she should live and how she should be supported there until the Official Solicitor, or some other independent person, has addressed this task in an appropriate timescale, or in light of this judgment has refused to do so.</span></p>

Indeed, it seems to me unfair to try to impose that task and its burdens upon her.  She has a view which she is perfectly entitled to have and to advance in the dispute with her family and the local authority but, leaving the funding issue on one side, in my view it is not appropriate for her to do this as her mother&#8217;s litigation friend.</span></p>

The local authority have agreed that they will put in evidence identifying the position relating to support for UF at her old home which will engage issues relating to funding and indeed any public / administrative law point that the local authority would wish to take in that context.  In turn, AF will set out her position which will include her stance on UF&#8217;s capacity and on the alternative care options.  </span></p>

The order will also provide that the property and affairs attorney is to be notified of these proceedings and the local authority have agreed to write to the attorney explaining the position.  It will be very helpful if the position on self funding of a package of care at home was known.  It seems to me that the availability and funding of such a package is something that the local authority will have to consider and raise with the attorney, but I&#160;am grateful to them for taking on that task.  If and to the extent that AF wishes to advance a placement with her, it seems to me that the ball, if I&#160;can put in this way, is in her court to provide the appropriate particulars for that and others can react to that evidence.</span></p>
