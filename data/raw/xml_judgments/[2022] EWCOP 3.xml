P was found by the police in a state of extreme neglect, suffering from malnutrition and in an exceptionally poor state of care. Since that time, P has been being looked after by the Local Authority (&#8216;LA&#8217;) with considerable input from various NHS bodies. P currently lives in a flat together with a team of carers. She has suffered both physically and mentally as a result of her traumatic experiences. </p>

In the course of proceedings, P has been found by the court to lack capacity in relation to care and residence, property and affairs and decisions about contact with her parents for the purposes of s.48 Mental Capacity Act 2005 (&#8216;MCA 2005&#8217;). She has also been assessed as lacking litigation capacity and is represented by the Official Solicitor (&#8216;OS&#8217;).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The matter first came before me on 14 September 2020; I took the view, supported by the LA and the OS, that given the great sensitivity of the case, and the potential press interest in the circumstances in which P was found, the case should be heard in private. This is contrary to the normal practice in the Court of Protection where cases are open to the public but subject to transparency orders to ensure that P cannot be identified. I was particularly concerned, at that stage, about the potential impact on P if there should be any media or social media commentary about her case which might come to her attention and cause her distress. </p>

There has been some disclosure by the police into the Court of Protection proceedings. In June 2021 the police contacted the solicitor to the LA seeking disclosure of certain documents from the Court of Protection to the police. On 23 July 2021 an application by the police for disclosure was made in these proceedings. The matter came back before me on 15 October 2021.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">At that hearing I expressed my considerable concern about the length of time that it was taking the police and the Crown Prosecution Service (&#8216;CPS&#8217;) to carry out an investigation of the matter and reach a charging decision. It was over 2 years since P had been found and yet there was no charging decision, and the police at that hearing informed me that they were hoping to make a charging decision in early 2022. </p>

The volume and necessity of remote hearings brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic has presented a challenge to the extent to which this &#8220;ordinary&#8221; course can be followed but the need for transparency has not abated.

After the concerns that I raised at the hearing in October 2021, the police filed a detailed witness statement from DI Miller setting out the investigations that had been undertaken and seeking to explain why the process was taking so long.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Ms Crowdy submitted that any press reporting of the Court of Protection proceedings risked the identification of P and that this could interfere with the criminal trial. I have to say that I found it quite hard to understand the specifics of the impact on the criminal trial upon which she was relying. She said there was a risk that a future juror would attend the Court of Protection proceedings and either see documents which might be prejudicial or hear submissions. In my view these concerns are significantly overstated, not least because in respect of the primary documentation this would not normally be released to members of the public who attended Court of Protection hearings, whether in person or remote. As far as potential future jurors hearing submissions are concerned, as I return to below, this is the type of matter which would be routinely dealt with in a criminal trial, both in the jury selection process but also the Judge&#8217;s summing up if there had been any publicity around a case. </p>

The relevant principles are set out at [18]. I do not find that case of much assistance as the issue was a very different one, namely that of a stay of proceedings.

 <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Of course, one factor to be taken into account, and it may well be a very important factor, is whether there is a real danger of the causing of injustice in the criminal proceedings. There may be cases &#8211; no doubt there are &#8211; where that discretion should be exercised. In my view it would be wrong and undesirable to attempt to define in the abstract what are the relevant factors. By way of example, a relevant factor telling in favour of a defendant might well be the fact that the civil action, or some step in it, would be likely to obtain such publicity as might sensibly be expected to reach, and to influence, persons who would or might be jurors in criminal proceedings. It may be that, if the criminal proceedings were likely to be heard in a very short time (such as was the fact in the Wonder Heat case in the Victoria Supreme Court) it would be fair and sensible to postpone the hearing of the civil action. It might be that it could be shown, or inferred, that there was some real &#8211; not merely notional &#8211; danger that the disclosure of the defence in the civil action would, or might, lead to a potential miscarriage of justice in the criminal proceedings, by, for example, enabling prosecution witnesses to prepare a fabrication of evidence or by leading to interference with witnesses or in some other way.&#8221;</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Despite the fact that the norm is now for Court of Protection proceedings to be held in public subject to a reporting restriction order, I did agree initially that this particular case should be held in private. That was because I was very concerned about the impact on P of allowing any reporting, particularly in the light of the very unusual facts and the consequent danger of her being identified and highly personal information being put in the public domain and causing her distress. At the time I made that order, I thought that P was likely to become much more engaged with the outside world and was at real risk of hearing and understanding any public comment which might have a negative impact upon her.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">However, as time has gone by, the evidence suggests that that risk is not so great. In practice, P has engaged very little if at all with the outside world, never goes outside her accommodation and does not listen to the news or read any commentary. She might hear something on the radio, but the chance of her realising it was about her or really engaging with it seems quite remote. I therefore consider that the risk of personal distress to her is significantly less than I had initially feared. I accept that there is still some such risk, but that must be balanced against the other factors in play. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In any event, if there are criminal charges and a trial there will undoubtedly be press coverage and steps will have to be taken to manage this and to protect P so far as is possible. Sadly, when someone (whether a vulnerable adult or a child) is caught up in court processes, particularly criminal justice processes, it is not always possible to fully protect them from commentary that may be very upsetting. I cannot discount the possibility that P will be identifiable, but in practice she is wholly insulated from the outside world, other than through the radio. Therefore, this is not a case where even if she was identified she would be distressed by social media or other press comment, save to the limited extent referred to. I therefore accept that if I allow the press to report this case, albeit anonymised, there will be some interference with P&#8217;s Article 8 rights, but I think it will be a limited one.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The justification for such interference is the media&#8217;s Article 10 rights and the public&#8217;s legitimate interest in knowing what has happened in this case. There is a strong public interest in knowing how the criminal justice system, including the police and the CPS are operating. That is even more the case at the present time when it is known that there are very long delays in getting cases to trial, or even to reach charging decisions. The effect of the current restriction on reporting the Court of Protection proceedings is that there is no ability of the public to be informed about what is happening in the police investigation. This is a case which may well attract a level of public interest because of its extreme and unusual facts. However, I do not accept that that means that such interest is &#8220;salacious&#8221;. There is a legitimate public interest in the fact that deeply distressing cases, such as that of P, happen in the UK and how they are dealt with by the relevant authorities. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I accept that there are considerable complications for the police in this case, in particular because P herself can only give such limited information about what has happened to her. It is not for me to judge the strength of the arguments put forward by DI Miller as to why the investigation has taken so long. However, I do think that the public has the right to know that in a case such as this it will have taken over 2 and a half years to even get to a charging decision. If there are charges brought, it is unknown how much longer it will take to get to trial. Delays in the system of justice, whether the police or the CPS, are a matter of legitimate public interest. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I do not accept the argument that the public will ultimately know about these matters because if there is a trial the delays will then be obvious.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I do not accept the argument advanced by the police that to allow the press to attend and report on the Court of Protection proceedings might undermine the integrity of the criminal trial. Firstly, I simply cannot see why it should. The Court of Protection case is focused on P and her welfare interests. Reporting on those proceedings will not involve evidence about the conduct, and certainly not the culpability, of her parents. Secondly, it is often the case that there are civil proceedings or inquiries in the public domain before a future criminal trial. One need only consider high profile recent examples such as the Grenfell Tower inquiry or the Manchester Arena inquiry. These involve very considerable press coverage, but that does not prevent any future criminal trial from proceeding fairly. If the criminal trial judge is concerned that publicity may have an impact on the jury, doubtless s/he will make clear to the jury that they should disregard any press commentary. </p>

There is no danger of any press comment now having an immediate impact on a jury member as it seems inevitable that if there is a criminal trial it will not be for many months, if not over a year. The very passage of time will lessen the impact of any publicity, and in any event such impact can be fully dealt with by the normal trial processes.</p>
