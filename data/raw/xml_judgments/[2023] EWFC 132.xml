During the course of last week various communications were sent to the court by him and by his Nigerian lawyer on his behalf requesting an adjournment of his application for a period of four months.  The adjournment was sought on the basis that he was suffering from a serious heart condition and would be unable to participate in the process without compromising his health and potentially endangering his life.  The husband supported his application by sending the court various medical documents, which he asserted should not be disclosed to the wife or her advisers given the private nature of the information contained within them.</span></p>

I then considered and refused what I deemed to be the husband&#8217;s application for an adjournment.  I gave reasons for this in a second judgment in which I made it clear that I was not satisfied that the husband&#8217;s medical condition would prevent him from participating in the hearing.  I noted, for example, that he had attended two recent hearings in Nigeria on 20 June 2023 and 4 July 2023 and that he had given evidence on one of these occasions.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">On 31 January 2023 the husband represented to the court that the proceedings in Nigeria had effectively been stayed by virtue of an appeal brought by the wife in that jurisdiction which had yet to be listed.  He did not, however, inform Mr Justice Francis that he had instructed his Nigerian lawyers to oppose a stay and argue that the divorce should proceed notwithstanding her appeal.  This was relevant information which should have been communicated to the court.  The husband&#8217;s failure to do so created a misleading impression that there was no particular urgency in relation to his English stay application as nothing substantive would be happening in Nigeria.  Had the court known the true position, it is likely that the case would have been timetabled with greater expedition. Absent a suitable undertaking from the husband to ensure a level playing field, consideration would have been given to the grant of a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Hemain </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">injunction.  It now transpires that the husband has been able to persuade the Nigerian court at first instance to proceed substantively with his divorce application which will next be considered at a hearing on 26 September 2023.  Accordingly, the effect of the adjournment sought by the husband might well have been to render the question of a stay academic as by the date of any adjourned hearing a divorce could have been pronounced in Nigeria.  In my view, this is precisely the outcome the husband sought to achieve.</span></p>

I required the husband to be informed of my decision and to be told in particular that I would be sympathetic to any request by him to have frequent breaks and that, based upon my reading of the papers to date, it was my view that the factual disputes relevant to the stay application were limited such that the case could be dealt with either on submissions or with cross-examination restricted to no more than an hour.  I further indicated that the court would be assisted by the husband completing his column of a document entitled &#8216;Schedule of Factual Disputes&#8217; (in fact, despite its title, most of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">relevant</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> facts set out in the document are either not disputed or, it seems to me, incontrovertible).  The husband was in breach of two court orders directing him to complete the document despite at one stage assuring the wife&#8217;s solicitors that he would do so by 19 May 2023.</span></p>

I do not accept this assertion, but in any event, he was well aware that the hearing was taking place.  If it was true that he had not received a link, he could have made this known to either the wife&#8217;s solicitors or the court prior to its commencement.

This included a provision that in the event of her remarriage and departure from the home, custody of the children would vest automatically in the husband.  Her evidence, which I accept, was that unless she agreed to these terms the husband would not have granted her a religious divorce which she had no realistic means of obtaining otherwise.  She did not have legal advice.  The husband seeks to rely upon this agreement, but in my view its only real relevance is as evidence of controlling behaviour on his part.  I consider that it was disreputable of him to seek to impose terms of this nature on his wife.  If upheld (and no court in England and Wales would approve an agreement of this nature) it would have deprived the wife of her financial entitlement and left her in a position where she might not have been able to meet her needs.  It sought to restrain her freedom to remarry indefinitely and to impose an automatic custody provision which was inimical to the welfare of the children.</span></p>

At the husband&#8217;s behest, however, she was willing not to do so immediately, as he had taken steps to renew his Belizean passport which had not been returned to him by the consulate.  The parties both appreciated that in the event of a divorce application the Home Office would need to be notified and that this would likely have consequences for the husband&#8217;s ability to reside in the jurisdiction.  The Belizean passport enabled him to enter the jurisdiction without a visa; without possession of the document his ability to come and go freely would be affected.  The husband was fully aware of the reasons for the wife&#8217;s decision not to proceed immediately with a divorce; her patience was entirely for his benefit.  As an email sent by him on 18 December 2021 makes clear, he also knew that the wife would not wait indefinitely.</span></p>

In her ruling, the learned judge found, after considering statements from the parties&#8217; Nigerian lawyers, that the husband was domiciled in Nigeria and that accordingly the court had jurisdiction to entertain his petition for divorce.  She took into account that the wife had not filed an answer taking issue with the husband&#8217;s assertion of domicile.  In her ruling, the learned judge further considered whether the wife had been aware of the existence of the Nigerian divorce proceedings when she filed her English petition on 14 March 2022.  She concluded that she had been so aware as they had been brought to her attention by email on 18 March 2022, a conclusion which led to her being highly critical of the wife.  Given that the email of 18 March 2022 post-dates the filing of the wife&#8217;s petition, I have to confess that I find this aspect of the judgment difficult to understand.  I can only assume that the court was provided with incorrect information as to the date upon which the English proceedings were commenced.  The learned judge then considered the application for a stay of the Nigerian proceedings.  She refused to grant a stay on the basis that section 9(1) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 2003 only enabled a stay to be granted where there were competing proceedings in another court having jurisdiction under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/45" uk:canonical="1973 c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>; the English proceedings fell outside the scope of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/45" uk:canonical="1973 c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> and accordingly there was no power to grant a stay.  The learned judge did not consider as part of her ruling issues of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">forum non conveniens </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">and I agree with the submission made by Mr Perrins that no issue estoppel therefore arises.</span></p>

The parties chose to base themselves in England from that time onwards.  Although the husband worked in Nigeria throughout the marriage, it is not the place he considered to be his home after 2011; his home was in England with his family and his life was centred around this jurisdiction.  I accept the wife&#8217;s evidence that after 2011 the husband spent more time in England than in Nigeria.  In 2020, he acquired a UK residence permit and between March 2020 and September 2022 he spent little time in Nigeria.  The wife&#8217;s case is supported by the husband&#8217;s own evidence in the Children Act proceedings where he sought to emphasise his role in the lives of the children stating that he has always been &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">a present</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8217; father and that he has cared for each of them.

In March 2022, when each of the parties issued their respective petitions, they had been habitually resident here for approximately 11 years.  By comparison, the time they had lived together in Nigeria was relatively insubstantial.  They had made a joint decision to live permanently in this jurisdiction and to that end the husband had obtained a residence permit, intending ultimately to acquire UK nationality.  They had chosen to make their home in England and Wales and to bring up and educate their children here. The youngest child has hardly spent any time in Nigeria at all.

The wife delayed filing her English petition at the behest of the husband to avoid prejudicing his ability to travel easily between Nigeria and England.  Before issuing her petition, she emailed the husband to let him know that she was about to do so in circumstances where he was refusing to leave the matrimonial home so as to give him a final opportunity to reach agreement with her.  The husband reacted by causing his Nigerian petition to be issued immediately and surreptitiously.  I do not consider that he genuinely believed that Nigeria was a more appropriate forum for divorce.  Rather, he was seeking to prevent the wife from pursuing her legitimate claims before the English court, no doubt because he was vexed by her refusal to abide by the Khouli agreement which he had required her conclude as the price for granting her a religious divorce.</span></p>

First, that position has been achieved in part through the husband&#8217;s manipulation of the English process.  He held up the proceedings by filing an acknowledgement of service and answer challenging jurisdiction when in reality there was no challenge he could mount; he delayed filing his application for a stay for 6 months; he gave a false impression to Mr Justice Francis on 31 January 2023 that the divorce proceedings in Nigeria were effectively on hold.  Secondly, when the respective divorce petitions were issued, in my judgment, England was very clearly the most appropriate forum for divorce and the husband&#8217;s contention that the proceedings should be stayed had no merit.  I do not consider it would be fair to allow the husband to take advantage of the delays in the English court system to argue that an initially unmeritorious claim has acquired greater validity by virtue of the passage of time, especially when he has contributed to the delay.  Thirdly, despite the Nigerian trial being part-heard, it seems to be that the proceedings in that jurisdiction are mired in procedural complexity.  There are two extant appeals to the Court of Appeal and at least one of the first instance decisions appears to have been based in part upon an obvious mistake as to the date of the wife&#8217;s English petition.  The ongoing proceedings are also subject to a separate petition to the Chief Justice which as far as I am aware has yet to be resolved.</span></p>

She is the primary carer for three children and could not simply leave them behind.  I also note from a transcript of the evidence given on 7 March 2023 that, despite the husband having accepted that the English courts have exclusive jurisdiction in respect of the children, he is seeking orders for custody in Nigeria.  In those circumstances, the wife will reasonably be resistant to taking the children to that jurisdiction, fearing that they might be prevented from returning.  By contrast, the husband should have no difficulty in coming to court in England in person or, if necessary, remotely.  He has previously instructed leading counsel here.  I consider that he would easily be able to secure representation should he choose to do so.</span></p>

I consider that a judge in England is much better placed to undertake such an assessment than a judge in Nigeria.  The assessment will involve considering, amongst other matters, an appropriate budget for housing in London, a reasonable income budget for the wife and children living in London, the wife&#8217;s earning capacity and any related costs (such as the cost of childcare) which she might have to incur in order to exercise an earning capacity.  I also note that one of the issues raised by the husband concerns the ownership of the former matrimonial home in London and the suggestion that his father may somehow continue to have an interest in the property. Such an issue, should it be pursued, is more appropriately dealt with by the English courts.  The English court will be able to consider whether the wife is entitled to a share of other assets built up during the marriage including any part of the husband&#8217;s business interests found to be matrimonial.  Claims of that nature are not available in Nigeria.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.3in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I do not consider that there will be any cost saving if the litigation takes place in Nigeria.  Having examined the expert evidence, it is apparent to me that the claims available to the wife in Nigeria are more limited than those she could make in this jurisdiction: for example, capital assets including business interests are only taken into account in assessing maintenance; apart from properties, capital is not typically divided or otherwise shared under Nigerian law; in general, any claim for a share in a property must be based upon the spouse having made financial or tangible non-financial contributions to the property (although there are exceptions to this principle). Given the extent of the parties&#8217; connections with this jurisdiction and the limited claims available to the wife in Nigeria, it seems likely to me that following any Nigerian proceedings the wife would succeed in obtaining leave to pursue proceedings under Part III of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984</ref> (although this is not a point which I need to determine at this juncture).  Were that course to be pursued, the likelihood is that the overall costs of litigation in two jurisdictions would be higher.</span></p>
