I note that the mother did not mention these proceedings in her statement, referring only to the later proceedings in 2011. It appears that contact broke down in due course, on father&#8217;s account because the mother was obstructive, on her account because of the father&#8217;s aggression, drug use and the fact that he would fall asleep on the sofa during visits. </p>

The father is from Guinea and although he speaks quite fluent German it is not his first language and is heavily accented and very colloquial, which gave rise to a real challenge for the interpreter. The mother has some knowledge of English, but it was established that she should hear all the questions and give all the answers in German through an interpreter for the sake of accuracy and consistency.  The interpreter who accompanied her at the outset did not appear to have any great skill, adequate training or confidence in court interpretation and was therefore replaced by a more skilled colleague after a slow and evidentially treacherous beginning. Both mother&#8217;s solicitor and I have a working knowledge of the language and not only did it appear that serious misinterpretations were occurring, but also that the interpreter was unable to do his job in accordance with his oath. Mother&#8217;s solicitors noted some significant discrepancies and it was necessary to listen to the recording with the help of a skilled interpreter to ensure that what mother was saying in her answers in cross-examination was properly understood by those in Court. This has compounded the time required to hear this matter, but it is not the parties&#8217; fault. </p>

She was clear that she believed that the father had consented to the move. Clearly she had not been present when he was alleged to have consented, and her source of this information was the mother, and also the children, who she said both told her that he had given his permission.  She told me that the father has told her that he had changed his mind in a phone call on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2015. It is also consistent with the mother&#8217;s account that she thought that the mother would be returning to visit her in the school holidays &#8211; although it seems they had not discussed whether DA would also be coming.

This argument emerged during the hearing and has muddied murky waters considerably. Mother&#8217;s own evidence was that she did not know that there was travel restriction on the father, because he had another child and had told her that all his documents were sorted, and she was not to ask him any more about it. If that was truly the state of the mother&#8217;s knowledge, I am puzzled by the fact that, had the immigration issue been a real issue, there would have been no incentive for the father to agree to the move to the UK. I can only resolve this point by observing that that like many other aspects of this case, assertions at times fly around in the face of logic. I do not intend to accord this last-minute assertion made on the mother&#8217;s behalf any weight, indeed I find it has been a last-minute makeweight advanced on her behalf in a case where she is desperate to remain in the UK.

Her written evidence is that she left because of her marriage to Mr LR, and her evidence as to this was unusual and rather ambiguous. She said it was natural that she should move to be with her husband, but that her primary reason was to get away from Mr MB. Miss Renton reminds me that the children had been in Essen &#8211; so out of direct harm&#8217;s way - since 2010, and that he had been released from prison since 2009. She says that the mother did not think to move until 2013, but even then she did nothing to action that until a year later. There were orders in place to prevent his contact, and I am not aware of any need to seek emergency protection from him having arisen subsequent to his release. I do not in this case minimise the impact upon this family of what occurred at the hands of Mr MB, and there appears to be a strong element of abiding trauma in his regards harboured and shared by both children, and, no doubt, the mother. DA was in receipt of some kind psychological counselling as a result of this, and I find it likely, (despite the accurate observations by Miss Renton), that the &#8220;Mr MB factor&#8221; has been very real, on-going, traumatic and current emotional situation for the mother and, unfortunately, both children have been affected by this, on the evidence of Miss Odze, but that he did not pose any identifiable, actionable threat to them after his release. Further, I am far from satisfied that the mother&#8217;s main, most important motive for moving to the UK was because of Mr MB&#8217;s presence in Germany. That is an invention in my judgment.

For example, having also heard at great length from the father, and taking into account the enormous frustration which he must be feeling, nevertheless he was at times quite openly aggressive and insulting. He called the maternal grandmother stupid, and frequently lost his temper, which makes me accept the mother&#8217;s evidence that he was aggressive towards her. On the other hand I reject her assertion that the father told her it would be easier to travel to London than to Essen when she says he approved the move. It may be hypothetically the case, but certainly not the case in the light of the absolute restriction on his leaving Germany.</p>

I also record that beyond what might he reasonable frustration at the technical difficulties, my appraisal was that he presented as ranting, angry and uncontrolled at times. He was not a sophisticated witness, and despite the raw emotion, much of what he told me rang true. Given his limited literacy, I do not underestimate his difficulty in following the proceedings, and focussing on dates and details, and the added problem of giving evidence by video with the use of an interpreter.  I have made every allowance for all the difficulties, but I found that he was at times very unfocussed on the facts of his own case and at times worryingly unclear about dates and events which form part of his own evidence. That is not unusual &#8211; events date from last summer and into early this year, but he appeared at times unwilling to listen to the questions being asked. He readily and unhelpfully went off-track over and over again. He was not able to give yes or no answers to many of the questions he was asked &#8211; rather than agree or affirm he would repeatedly say &#8220;maybe&#8221;.  On the central matters in issue he was clear. </p>

Rather, in his mind he had &#8220;given up&#8221;, i.e significantly reduced his cannabis use, but a significant reduction is not the same as abstinence. Nevertheless his case was that he was abstinent.  This illustrates that he can be highly elastic in his account at times, although this was clearly some time ago now.</p>

Looking therefore at the documentary evidence to see if there is any assistance, his credibility in relation to the proceedings in Germany is supported by the documents from the court there. It is less easy to be certain in relation to the document he has provided from the Youth Office in Hamburg.

He had twice had to apply for contact, once when the mother moved unilaterally without telling him about her plans. The mother had every reason to conceal or her real plans from the father, including the marriage, because had he known the extent of them it is highly unlikely that he would have agreed to the specific plan to move. </p>

I find she misled him about why she was going to the UK in April &#8211; she said it was for a friend&#8217;s wedding. He also knew that she had bought tickets to travel in June, but it is likely that he thought that this was for the purpose of a holiday. He did not know that she had re-registered the children from school or from their place of residence. It was clearly in the mother&#8217;s best interests to pull the wool over the father&#8217;s eyes, because it is likely that she would have been alive to the possibility that he would not readily have consented and she was set on her move. She did not even provide him with a contact address in the UK, and I am satisfied that she was  generally unresponsive to his attempts to contact her by phone. </p>

It chimes with the mother telling the father in March that she was going to the UK in April, but not telling him that she was getting married there, and with him subsequently discovering, possibly while they were there in April, that she was going to get married and therefore requiring her to return to the Germany. Neither party have dealt with this to any extent.

It is notable that the father does not in any way follow this line in his own evidence. If AM&#8217;s words can be relied upon, the father was saying this clearly before the mother and children went to the UK.  The father is categorical that neither the mother nor AM ever mentioned that they were moving to the UK.

It is a telling omission from his case and likely therefore not to be an accurate recollection, because it would have served him in his application to raise the fact that he withdrew his consent prior to the move. In itself it is illustrative of the degree of confusion in parts of the evidential matrix of this case. I am driven to conclude that although AM&#8217;s words are clear, there is some indication that she is confused in relation to this, at least in terms of her memory.

He had by this time already contacted the youth office, and his lawyer, and had not had any contact at Christmas as the mother had promised. It is highly unlikely that he acquiesced in this way, nor do I accept her evidence that she believed until the point of his application that he consented to her living in Germany. On all the evidence and from her actions I find that she must have known that the father would not only not have agreed, but would also have sought to pursue her.  I prefer his version of the evidence in relation to the calls between them because it is more consistent. He is clear that he never agreed to them remaining and was not prepared to broker contact, which is wholly consistent with his uncompromising stance and demeanour.</p>

It is unlikely that the father told her he would withdraw his application if contact could be arranged, because he is very uncompromising.  Even if he did so that would not support a defence of acquiescence in my judgment. Sadly there has been no scope for compromise in this case. It is indeed not too late for the father and the mother to agree arrangements for contact and that would have been by far and away the best approach and solution to this unhappy situation, and the fact that the father is now seeking a return without attempting a compromise is not in any way to his credit. He will be well aware that his application is causing maximum stress to the mother and thereby likely to cause maximum stress and upset to his daughter and to DA.</p>

Thos words were carefully considered and can be applied just as sensibly to physical or psychological harm as to any other situation. Every child has to put up with a certain amount of rough and tumble, discomfort and distress, it is aprt of growing up. But there are some things which is it not reasonable to expect a child to tolerate. Among these, of course, are physical or psychological abuse, or neglect of the child herself. Among these, we now understand, can be exposure to the harmful effects of seeing and hearing the physical or psychological abuse of her own parent. Mr Turner accepts that is there is such a risk the source is irrelevant, e.g where the mother&#8217;s subjective perception of events leads to mental illness which could have intolerable consequences for the child.</span></p>

More importantly, the situation which the child will face on return depends crucially on the protective measure which can be put into place to secure that the child will not be called upon to face an intolerable situation when she gets home. Mr Turner accepts that if the risk is serious enough to fall within article 13(b) the court is not only concerned with the child&#8217;s immediate future, because the need for effective protection may persist. </span></p>

Whilst the argument in terms of AM&#8217;s own physical safety in Germany is weak in terms of any direct threat which Mr MB might pose, and there is no inherent risk in terms of her physical safety were she to return, I am satisfied that she is likely to be genuine in her concerns about him whether or not rooted in his present reality. It will be of little comfort to her that the father is apparently in touch with Mr MB and advocates that he has &#8220;turned his life around&#8221;. I have no reason to believe that the mother is anything other than likely to be afraid of Mr MB in abstract but very real terms as a result of the trauma he caused her. Whilst she does not specifically argue that a return would cause her mental ill-health, it is quite safe to assume that there is an element of abiding trauma in her case, despite having lived in the same country until July of last year. </p>

DA had a good relationship with his step-father, but this has not been tested out in terms of his step-father caring for him. To date his primary carer throughout his life has been his mother and he has also derived considerable emotional comfort from his sister &#8211; they even share a room, and he turns to her before he turns to his mother. It is absolutely inevitable in my judgment if the mother were to return to Germany for any significant period of time with AM, that she would be extremely anxious for DA&#8217;s welfare even if he were safe with Mr LR. Into the mix I add the fact that it is perfectly plain that DA&#8217;s security has been hard won given the difficulties he appears to have had. I accept the criticism that there is little evidence in support, but in this respect i am satisfied by the mother&#8217;s account of his problems and also of the fact that he has made gains since coming to the UK.

As regards transmission of her trauma, DA has shared it throughout his childhood, AM throughout her life, AM demonstrated to Mrs Odze just how Mr MB had stuck a knife into the mother. As regards the transmission of her negative views, in any return scenario, it is highly like that the mother will leave AM in no doubt as to who is the villain, responsible for breaking her heart and forcing her to return to Germany against her will which is likely in turn to do further damage to AM&#8217;s fractured opinion of, and relationship with, her father.

She would be scared if she went back, and angry because of her father.  Her body language when contemplating a return being ordered was described as follows: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220; She became quieter, more subdued, sad and almost tearful...she conveyed the message in words and demeanour, in a way that was palpable to me, how much she preferred to remain here where she ( and DA) felt more emotionally safe being free from nightmares&#8221;.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have assessed her objections in the light of the fact that there is likely to have been a heavy degree of exposure the mother&#8217;s hostile and belittling attitude to the father, and I record that in the past, despite the mother&#8217;s hostility, AM wanted to see her father, which in turn makes me confident that her objections are at this point in time are likely to her own. In addition Mrs Odze assesses her as resilient and therefore as not being drawn into the parental conflict, which gives added strength to the independence of her views and objections. The mother will have passed on her negative views about the father to AM and Mrs Odze was clear that they are at large and the situation is naturally talked about within the family.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> I have born in mind the nature of AM&#8217;s objections: she does not want to be parted from DA, or leave the UK and she feels this acutely. Her objections go well beyond just a preference to remain here. She and her brother are relieved of their shared nightmares and it is safe to assume that a return to a situation of shared apprehension is something she would strongly object to. The consequences of a return to Germany for DA and her shared fears are also at the heart of her objections. DA sees nothing good in Germany. I have considered the observation of Mrs Odze that AM does not object to a return to Germany as a country in Convention terms, but upon reflection I am inclined to disagree. AM&#8217;s objections are set out paragraphs 24 to 28 of Mrs Odze&#8217;s report. When I total up the picture, it does in my judgment pass the threshold and amount to an objection to a return to Germany as the place which holds a particular fear for her of the presence of DA&#8217;s father. I may be wrong about that, but even if I am, I view AM&#8217;s objections in the context of her situation as a whole and I have no reason on the basis of Mrs Odze&#8217;s evidence to doubt their authenticity.</p>

In relation to DA, there were protective legal measures in place restricting the father&#8217;s contact.  Real protection for AM would have to be emotional protection from the consequences of the intolerability of separation from her brother, and/or her mother. Even if they were not to be separated, and all returned together, there is potential for the knock-on detrimental consequences which have been explored earlier in this judgment. However the concern I have is that the fears for the children are deeply connected to the trauma of their mother. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">  The door is open to the exercise of my discretion. I find that there are really compelling reasons for not returning AM summarily to Germany. These are rooted in the close life-long relationship she has enjoyed with DA. He is a vulnerable child. It is clear that he harbours strong fears about a return and it is clear that AM shares those fears. It matters not that they are not rooted in her own direct experiences. They have been generated by the hugely significant attack on their mother and her extended, abiding trauma, and I cannot in the circumstances minimise this aspect of the case. For DA that trauma arose in Germany and his father&#8217;s presence there, however innocuous now, is frightening for him. It is impossible to hive AM off from this pervading dynamic, although potentially therapy might assist. The real problem is that there are no &#8220;protective measures&#8221; which could address this shared trauma in a concrete and definable way. The father is definitely not perceived as protective in relation to Mr MB, and indeed, it is concerning to know that he appears to be actively aware of his situation and be at the very least slightly connected to him. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In addition, separation temporarily, which is possible, or even longer term, which is also possible, is highly likely to place AM in an intolerable situation. A return would be likely to expose AM to a situation which she would find intolerable in terms of separation from her brother, or if he were to return with her, she would in effect find herself as the author of his misfortune and that too is likely to prove intolerable. To place AM in an intolerable situation would in my judgment be contrary to the policy of the Convention. </p>
