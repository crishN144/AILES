The Second Defendant, MF, was her partner for many, many years. It was an intense and for each of them the most important relationship of their lives. RB was English and a schoolteacher. MF is Iranian and a Professor with a doctorate in one of the exact sciences.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 15 August 2002 the local authority began proceedings under the inherent jurisdiction, prompted apparently by concerns expressed by the A home about MF&#8217;s behaviour and his involvement with RB. The same day, 15 August 2002, the local authority applied ex parte to Johnson J who made an order forbidding MF to remove RB from the A home. That application had been supported by a witness statement from a social worker dated 14 August 2002 which alleged that MF had forbidden the staff at the A home to continue administering a drug called Baclofen which had been prescribed by RB&#8217;s GP. It also insinuated, though it did not in terms explicitly allege, that MF had sexually abused RB who, it was said, was by then suffering from dementia and lacked capacity, inter alia, to consent to sexual relations with MF: &#8220;There are also concerns in respect of the sexual relationship between [RB] and her partner [MF] &#8230; There were also concerns about alleged sexual abuse&#8221;. The witness statement had attached to it a letter report dated 10 July 2002 by Dr V A Watkin, a Consultant Old Age Psychiatrist, saying: </p>

I have transcripts of part of the proceedings and of Bracewell J&#8217;s judgment, both of which I have read. Bracewell J made interim declarations as to incapacity and best interests, including declarations that RB lacked capacity in all material respects, that she should continue to reside at the B home (the placement at the A home having broken down in December 2002, according to the local authority due to MF&#8217;s behaviour; RB moved to the B home in February 2003), that it was not lawful, not being in her best interests, for RB to receive intimate and/or personal care from MF and that it was not lawful, being contrary to her best interests, for any person, including MF, to engage in sexual relations with RB. The order provided for MF to visit RB at the B home and, subject to conditions, for the home contact to continue.</p>

(I note in passing that Ryder J was the seventh judge to be involved, previous orders having been made by Hedley J and Bennett J as well as by Johnson J, Bracewell J, Roderic Wood J and McFarlane J.) I have transcripts of part of the proceedings and of Ryder J&#8217;s two judgments, both of which I have read: <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2006/974" uk:canonical="[2006] EWHC 974 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWHC 974 (Fam)</ref>. Ryder J made a declaration by consent that it was not in RB&#8217;s best interests to have Baclofen administered to her and, having heard evidence on these matters, further declared that it was in RB&#8217;s best interests for MF to exercise contact with her behind closed doors at the B home but not when feeding her. The order provided for MF to apply if he sought determination of the factual allegations underlying the order made by Bracewell J on 10 May 2004 but went on to stipulate that:</p>

Relying in particular upon the evidence of Dr Jefferys (see below), the local authority&#8217;s case was that it was in RB&#8217;s best interests to continue living at the C home; that &#8220;there would be a high risk of a care package at home breaking down due to MF&#8217;s non-compliance and/or interference with carers and/or health professionals and due to aggressive and/or abusive and/or unacceptable behaviour on the part of MF towards carers and health professionals&#8221; (this being particularised in a schedule); and that it would not be in RB&#8217;s best interests to visit MF at home (though the contact he was currently having at the C home was in her best interests) or for MF to determine what medication she should receive or to give her personal care beyond that he was already providing. The Official Solicitor&#8217;s position, as set out in his fourth and final statement dated 20 November 2008, was to essentially the same effect. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During the hearing I heard a substantial amount of oral evidence from a number of witnesses. I need not, in the circumstances, go through them all, though there is one matter I should mention before coming to the heart of the matter. MF wished to call three lay witnesses but the local authority and the Official Solicitor indicated that, although they did not accept their evidence in all respects, they proposed not to cross-examine them. In these circumstances I ruled that there was no need for any of them to be called to give oral evidence and that I would take their witness statements as read. In the event, and as matters turned out, nothing of great importance turned on any of this evidence and there is no need for me either to analyse it or to detail the respects in which the local authority and the Official Solicitor sought to differ from it. On the third day, 3 December 2008, I heard oral evidence from Dr Peter Jefferys and Dr Nabji Kahtan. I have a transcript of their evidence which I have re-read. Dr Jefferys is a Consultant in the Psychiatry of Old Age. In accordance with various directions given by the court he had produced ten reports, the most recent being dated 20 November 2006, 4 December 2007, 20 February 2008, 30 June 2008, 1 December 2008 (commenting on Dr Kahtan&#8217;s report &#8211; see below) and 2 December 2008, all produced on the joint instructions of the local authority and the Official Solicitor. Dr Kahtan is a Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist. He produced a report dated 27 November 2008 on instructions which had been given by MF&#8217;s solicitors on 25 June 2008.  </p>

On 5 December 2008, although MF had not concluded his evidence, I heard evidence from Dr Michael Gross and Mr Mamode Sohewon (I have a transcript of their evidence which I have re-read) and then further evidence from MF. Dr Gross is a Consultant Neurologist. In accordance with directions given by the court, he had produced reports dated 25 April 2007, 4 September 2007, 6 February 2008 (jointly with Dr Jefferys), 2 June 2008, 10 July 2008 and 29 October 2008.

But the main reason for exploring a number of other more peripheral matters as I explained it on 4 December 2008 no longer exists. And this fundamental change in the human and forensic realities has to be taken into account in any decision as to whether, and if so to what extent, it is still appropriate for me to explore such matters.</p>

Third, did the local authority ever apologise to MF for making the allegation and (if not) why did it assert that it had? Fourth, was the evidence available to the local authority sufficient to justify making the allegation (related to which is the more general question of whether the evidence as a whole was sufficient to justify the commencement of the proceedings)?

The plain and simple fact, as I have already recorded, is that at the very outset of the litigation the local authority voiced concerns about possible sexual abuse. This has given rise to a number of controversies, fuelled, I have to say, by the very unfortunate manner in which the local authority has, down the years, sought to respond to MF&#8217;s complaints on the topic. The first arises in this way. On 28 May 2003 the solicitors then acting for the Official Solicitor wrote a letter to the solicitors then acting for MF in the course of which they said, referring to a round table meeting the previous year:</p>
	      <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>

	      <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">Unsurprisingly, that drew a response from MF&#8217;s solicitors in a letter dated 4 June 2003 drawing attention to what the social worker had said in her witness statement dated 14 August 2002 and more particularly to what had been said by Dr Watkin.</p>

True it is that the phrase &#8220;sexual abuse&#8221; was not used in the local authority&#8217;s Part 8 Claim Form, but it appears both in the social worker&#8217;s witness statement (paragraph 20, quoted above) and, as we have seen, in Dr Watkin&#8217;s letter exhibited to that statement.</p>

This issue, which, quite needlessly, has done much to exacerbate matters, arises in this way.

I can take this shortly. There was, in my judgment, material in its possession in relation to possible sexual abuse which justified the local authority in saying what it did in the evidence it put before Johnson J. Whether it was prudent for the local authority to do so is, perhaps, more debateable. It has conceded that it did not have in its possession &#8211; in fact it has never had &#8211; the <span style="font-style:italic">evidence </span>to establish what it was alleging. As the local authority said in the letter of 10 October 2006, &#8220;it has not been able to substantiate the allegation&#8221; that MF sexually abused RB. I cannot help thinking, and this is not just with the benefit of hindsight, that it might have been better if an allegation of this kind &#8211; an allegation which, unless it could be substantiated, was inevitably going to sour relations and cause MF very great distress &#8211; had not been made unless and until the local authority was in possession of the relevant evidence. It was not a vital component of the case put to Johnson J, nor, as the local authority has been at pains to point out, was it something that it needed to rely upon to obtain the relief it successfully sought from Bracewell J. Almost inevitably, the mere fact that the allegation was made, and then not pursued, has infuriated MF and served in the event only to exacerbate the situation. </p>

Indeed, he says, the reason why the local authority did not follow the appropriate procedures is because there never was any sexual abuse &#8211; an allegation which if it means what MF seems to be insinuating is utterly devoid of any foundation. It may be that the proper procedures were not followed but that fact, if fact it be, cannot in my judgment have any bearing on the question of whether or not the local authority was justified in ventilating its concerns with the court.</p>

In these circumstances, if the allegation had been pursued the local authority would inevitably have failed &#8211; being unable to prove what it was asserting.

The fact is that Baclofen, previously prescribed by her GP, was administered to RB for only two limited periods in 2002, from 16 April to 4 May and again from 4-12 July 2002; as Ms Greaney points out, the details are conveniently summarised in Dr Jefferys&#8217; report of 23 January 2004. On each occasion, and whatever MF may now have come to believe, it was stopped promptly when MF objected, so it is difficult to see how either the A home or the local authority can sensibly be criticised.

They included the handwritten document; there was no difference between it and the typed up version. And as Ms Greaney also points out, this document is also revealing for another reason, for it referred to the Baclofen issue and recorded concerns about its harmful side effects &#8211; in other words, assisted MF&#8217;s case &#8211; yet it had very properly been included in the bundle by the local authority.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The matter arose in his way. In his report dated 30 June 2008 Dr Jefferys reported at length on an interview he had had with Mr Sohewon on 19 June 2008. MF subsequently produced to the court a statement apparently dated 28 July 2008 and purportedly signed by Mr Sohewon challenging significant parts of Dr Jefferys&#8217; account of what he had said to him on 19 June 2008. But when Mr Sohewon attended court to give evidence on 5 December 2008 he surprised everyone by repudiating that statement. Put shortly, his oral evidence was that the contents of the statement did not represent his evidence; that it had been written by MF; and that he (Mr Sohewon) had not read it before signing it. He added (transcript page 71) that when he signed it he was busy and did not pay much attention to it; MF had asked him to sign &#8220;Just to prove that you were present with Dr Jefferys&#8221;. Asked about this by MF, Mr Sohewon said (transcript page 71) &#8220;I did a mistake. I should have read it &#8230; But I trusted you.&#8221; Cross-examined by Ms Greaney, Mr Sohewon confirmed (transcript page 83) that he agreed with Dr Jefferys&#8217; account of their interview:</p>

At the end, MF said (transcript page 82) &#8220;I have got nothing else to say. I have said everything.&#8221; When, subsequently, MF asked for permission to cross-examine Mr Sohewon I refused (see paragraph [24] above). By then the trial had concluded, apart from submissions. More important, I was satisfied that MF had had a more than adequate opportunity to ask Mr Sohewon questions and, in the course of asking those questions, to make clear where and why he disagreed with what Mr Sohewon was saying. In short, I took the view that no useful purpose would be served by allowing MF a &#8216;second bite at the cherry&#8217;.</p>

In a letter to me dated 10 January 2009, MF said: &#8220;I claim strongly that Mr Sohewon has been interfered with in order to protect [the local authority&#8217;s] interest as well as the Official Solicitor&#8217;s interest.&#8221; He says that the oral evidence Mr Sohewon gave was not the truth.

It follows that no reliance can be placed upon the statement purportedly given by him on 28 July 2008. Dr Jefferys&#8217; account of their meeting on 19 June 2008 is correct. Dr Jefferys says so; and Mr Sohewon, as we have seen, agrees.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the first place, MF has, as I understand it, relied in support of his complaint to the GMC about Dr Jefferys on the assertion that Dr Jefferys&#8217; account of his meeting with Mr Sohewon was not merely wrong but dishonest. Moreover, and as we shall see, Dr Kahtan relied in particular upon Mr Sohewon&#8217;s statement of 28 July 2008 in coming to his conclusion that Dr Jefferys was both lacking in impartiality and biased. So the question of Mr Sohewon&#8217;s witness statement is at the heart of MF&#8217;s complaint to the GMC. But for the reasons I have given, there is no substance in any complaint against Dr Jefferys so far as it is founded on Mr Sohewon&#8217;s alleged witness statement. Dr Jefferys&#8217; account of his meeting with Mr Sohewon was neither wrong, let alone dishonest. Mr Sohewon, in his oral evidence, which I accept, agrees that Dr Jefferys&#8217; account of their meeting is correct. That, in my judgment, is the end of the point. </p>

The local authority, supported by the Official Solicitor, invites me to find that MF sought to mislead the court by filing what purported to be a witness statement setting out Mr Sohewon&#8217;s evidence but which in fact had been written by MF. It also invites me to consider whether any further action should be taken against MF arising from these events. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am not prepared to find that MF set out deliberately to mislead the court, though his conduct was both foolish and reckless. MF is a man with strong and entrenched views who, much of the time, does not listen to what people are saying. He hears (or rather thinks he hears) what he wants to hear. And, I suspect, on occasions he attributes to others views which are in fact his own, treating silence or the absence of vigorous dissent as agreement with what he is saying. It must be for others to determine whether any further action should be taken. For my part I do not propose either to take any further action or to suggest that anyone else does.</p>

Given what Mr Sohewon had said, Ms Hodes was fully entitled to cross-examine MF vigorously on the point and to do so in the terms of which complaint is made. Indeed, I would go further. It is precisely what one might expect counsel to do in such circumstances.</p>

Most worryingly, in his last report, he appears to have misunderstood or misquoted a senior nurse at RB&#8217;s current placement in painting a picture of MF as someone who does not have RB&#8217;s best interests at heart. The statement by this nurse suggests a worrying lack of impartiality on the part of Dr Jefferys. While it is possible that Dr Jefferys simply misheard or misunderstood the comments made, it seems more likely that he has been biased against MF from the start.&#8221;</p>

To that very pertinent question there was no clear answer. I asked him (transcript page 125) whether he stood by paragraphs 300-305 of his report as written.

He was clear that it was because the local authority&#8217;s application to the Land Registry was &#8220;untrue&#8221; inasmuch as it was said the local authority had &#8220;asked [RB] to pay for her accommodation and she had failed to pay&#8221; (transcript page 9).

Notice of the local authority&#8217;s application to register the charge was given by the Swansea District Land Registry on 29 April 2005; the notice was addressed to RB. The application was supported by a statutory declaration dated 22 March 2005 which deposed that &#8220;The owner has failed to pay the sum assessed as due to be paid by her to the Council for the Part III accommodation.&#8221; On 15 December 2006 MF wrote to the local authority asking the following question: &#8220;Did you ever ask her to pay for her accommodation and as she failed to pay then you decided to put a charge on her property?&#8221; The local authority&#8217;s response, in a letter dated 4 January 2007, was &#8220;the charge was placed on the &#8230; property following instructions from the Council&#8217;s Assessment and Income Manager as a result of unpaid invoices for accommodation charges.&#8221; On 23 April 2008, MF, acting, he said, as RB&#8217;s attorney pursuant to the enduring power of attorney the Court of Protection had registered on 25 October 2006, applied to the Land Registry seeking removal of the charge. On 14 May 2008 the local authority wrote to the Land Registry objecting to the application, asserting in effect that the charge had been lawfully created in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/41/section/22" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 22</ref> and pointing out that RB was the sole owner of the property and that MF had no registered interest in the property. The local authority questioned MF&#8217;s locus to make the application and observed that his appointment as RB&#8217;s attorney was currently in issue before the Court of Protection &#8211; an assertion seemingly at odds with the fact that the power of attorney, as I have said, had been registered by the Court of Protection on 25 October 2006. Following a response from MF the Land Registry wrote on 1 September 2008 stating that the matter must now be referred to the Adjudicator to HM Land Registry pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/9/section/73/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 73(7)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/9" uk:canonical="2002 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Land Registration Act 2002</ref>.

Why on earth should he do otherwise? The fact that on many &#8211; even most &#8211; matters he has, in the event, seen &#8216;eye to eye&#8217; with the local authority is no basis for an allegation of collusion. It merely reflects the reality that in this particular case, in the light of all the evidence, the Official Solicitor&#8217;s appraisal of where RB&#8217;s best interests truly lay accorded with the local authority&#8217;s view. He was entitled to take that view just as he was, I am sure, acting with complete propriety in doing so.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 17 November 2008, my clerk, on my instructions, wrote to the MP drawing attention to these allegations, asking whether he had any material to substantiate these (and all the other allegations) beyond what was set out in the letter and its enclosures, and inviting him to produce this further material as soon as possible. The MP replied on 19 November 2008 saying that it was MF who had supplied all the documents and &#8220;requesting you to withdraw my letter as a Witness Statement&#8221;. My clerk responded on 26 November 2008, pointing out that the MP had not answered the questions set out in his letter of 17 November 2008. A further letter from the MP dated 26 November 2008 did not take matters significantly further. On 28 November 2008 the local authority wrote saying that it had received an email from the MP &#8220;apologising and withdrawing his witness statement.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Greaney&#8217;s submission, as set out in the position statement she had prepared for the hearing in December 2008 at a time when it was thought that the MP would be giving evidence, was that his evidence was irrelevant and inadmissible in its entirety, propounding facts on the basis of a partial selection of documents that he had seen. I am inclined to agree.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">More important, however, is the almost complete lack of substance in the various allegations made by the MP. I have covered the ground already and need not repeat what I have already said. The MP was entitled to be very critical (as indeed I have been) of the local authority&#8217;s response to his inquiries about the so-called apology letter. But that apart, each of the allegations he made was completely groundless. There was no proper basis for making any of them. They were unjustified and unsubstantiated. It is concerning that the MP should have allowed himself to be persuaded by MF to associate himself with so many groundless allegations. It is concerning in the context of legal proceedings in a court (I say nothing, of course, about proceedings anywhere else) that a Member of Parliament should make so many allegations, of such a very serious nature, against public authorities and professional persons when the allegations are based on such exceedingly flimsy foundations.</p>

And I have also described (paragraphs [95]-[98], [102]-[103]) the essential differences between Dr Jefferys and Dr Gross and explained (paragraph [104]) why in the event I preferred Dr Jefferys&#8217; analysis. Fundamentally, as I said, this was because I am sadly driven to conclude that MF would not have been able, however much he might try, to cooperate with any community care package that might have been provided for RB. The reality &#8211; the overwhelming probability &#8211; is that there would have been a continuation and repetition of MF&#8217;s often unacceptable and sometimes aggressive behaviour.</p>

His final submission is that no evidence came to light during the hearing in December 2008 to make him alter those views. The local authority&#8217;s stance is the same; its position at the end of the hearing remained as it had set it out at the beginning of the hearing.</p>

I acknowledge that in relation to some of the specific incidents relied upon by the local authority and the Official Solicitor there may be more merit in MF&#8217;s contentions than they are prepared to acknowledge. I have also borne very much in mind the points made by Ryder J to which I have referred (paragraphs [9]-[10] above), points which in many respects accord with my own impressions of the evidence. But, be all that as it may; the inescapable fact is that what remains more than suffices to vindicate Dr Jefferys&#8217; analysis and to make good the local authority&#8217;s case.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The sad fact, as the local authority correctly submits, is that there is a very substantial history of non-cooperation by MF with numerous care agencies and professionals, much of it documented in great detail. And whatever may be said by way of explanation or extenuation in relation to some of these incidents, the overall picture is clear. Nor, sadly, was I able to detect anything in MF&#8217;s presentation or evidence during the hearing in December 2008 which gave even the slightest hint that his attitude might have changed or indeed be capable of change. There was simply nothing which even began to suggest that the future might be different from the past. I have already quoted (paragraph [98] above) Dr Jefferys&#8217; considered view on the matter. I was not at all surprised by his answer; and it accords entirely with the view I have formed having now heard all the evidence.</p>

This is not the occasion, nor is there any need, for an elaborate explanation of the law or of how it applies in this case.
