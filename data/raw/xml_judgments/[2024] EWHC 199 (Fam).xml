The reason for this unusual approach is that the F was a Member of Parliament and the M is now an MP. HHJ Williscroft undertook a fact finding hearing and made very serious findings of fact against the F. The view taken by the Courts was that there was sufficient public interest, given F&#8217;s public position, as to justify naming the parents.

Because of that application, the matter was listed before me as the Family Presider for the Midlands. However, the Government Legal Department made clear that it would seek a costs order in its favour if successful in its defence of the DoI. I determined that I would not make a Protective Costs Order without a fully argued application at the conclusion of the hearing. The M then withdrew her DoI application, but I determined, given the fact the case was already listed before me, and the very lengthy nature of these proceedings, that it was appropriate that I continue to hear the case. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The first issue is that of the contact. I take into account <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1</ref>(2A) CA which states that it is generally in a child&#8217;s best interests to have a relationship with both parents. That is undoubtedly correct, but necessarily a fact specific judgement has to be reached, both as to what is in the particular child&#8217;s best interests, and the nature of the relationship that exists between the child and the parent.  Although Dr Proudman referred me to a number of decisions, cases like this turn almost entirely on their own facts, and the approach of other judges in other cases is of limited assistance. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The evidence suggests XX enjoys contact with the F, although unsurprisingly as a 5 year old, sometimes has to be encouraged to engage. However, given XX&#8217;s young age and the fact the M is the primary carer, XX&#8217;s wishes and feelings are in no sense fixed. This is not a case where XX&#8217;s existing relationship with the F is such that XX is likely to feel angry or resentful if contact is limited. </p>

He said he was &#8220;forced to sit through the fact finding hearing&#8221; when it was entirely his decision to contest each and every factual allegation. He thinks the Guardian is biased against him because of his prominence and thought that led to previous Guardian&#8217;s not attending court, when that is in fact the complete norm in cases such as this, save for the welfare hearing. He feels Dr Proudman is mounting a campaign against him when, to be fair to Dr Proudman, she is merely representing her client&#8217;s interests. He said he felt he &#8220;was being made an example of&#8221;, rather than accepting that the findings of fact are very serious and the proceedings traumatising for the M. </p>

The fact that he does not accept the findings of rape, and the fact that he is so keen for a relationship with XX so that he can show her what he is truly like, does not bode well for how he will talk to XX when unconstrained by court proceedings. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Most importantly I do not consider the F has any real understanding or insight into what the M has and still is going through, and how distressing this whole process has been for her. He fought the fact finding hearing &#8220;tooth and nail&#8221; despite the extreme distress that must have caused the M. He says that he has now changed, but I am far from convinced. Firstly, he applied for an adjournment of this hearing a few days before the date on the grounds that he did not have a barrister. He appears to have given no consideration to the impact of the litigation, and a further adjournment, would have on the M. There was no reason to believe that he would have a barrister at any later hearing. Secondly, he effectively placed the burden on the M by saying that she should have therapy in order to deal with him having contact. Thirdly, he had seemed to have given very little consideration to the impact on XX of the M having to go on supporting contact. I am afraid that my conclusion, and I appreciate this will sound harsh, is that the F&#8217;s main concern remains himself and what is best for him, rather than what is best for XX. Despite his voiced concern and respect for the M, his actions do not support such concern. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The M is unsurprisingly traumatised both by what happened during the relationship, but also by nearly 5 years of litigation. If the contact continues then that trauma and distress will continue, and will have an impact on XX. It may be that the M is over anxious, and I am sure that therapy to help her with past trauma would assist. However, that distress is her reality and her anxiety about XX and any contact with the F is perfectly understandable in the circumstances. The F has taken some steps to consider and learn from the findings that have been made by HHJ Williscroft, but in my view he still has a considerable way to go before I would be confident that direct contact was in XX&#8217;s interests, and not merely his interests. </p>

All too often such communications are ill-considered and ill-judged with the consequence that every minor dispute or misunderstanding is met with an application to the judge. More importantly, the distress and anxiety caused to the other parent and to the children at the centre of such a raging dispute cannot be overestimated, nor can the damaging consequences where the focus of the litigation veers away from what, on any objective view, would and should be regarded as the real issues going to the welfare of the children concerned. </span></p>

Neither the judge nor the court staff can, or should, be expected to field communications of this type.  In my view judges must be entitled, as part of their general case management powers, to put in place, where they feel it to be appropriate, strict directions regulating communications with the court and litigants should understand that failure to comply with such directions will mean that communications that they choose to send, notwithstanding those directions, will be neither responded to nor acted upon.&#8221;</span></p>

The easy accessibility to the court and the other parties as a result of emails means that Guideline 5 in Re P which says that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s91(14)</ref> orders are: &#8216;generally to be seen as a useful weapon of last resort in cases of repeated and unreasonable applications&#8217;, has even more resonance now than it did in 1999. It seems, however, that the phrase &#8216;weapon of last resort&#8217;, when put together with Guideline (4) which says that: &#8216;The power is therefore to be used with great care and sparingly, the exception and not the rule&#8217;, has led to an understandable, but perhaps misplaced, reluctance for judges to make orders under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s91(14)</ref>, save for the most egregious cases of which, on the facts as found by the judge, this is one.</span></p>

This situation is anticipated by Guideline 6 of Re P: &#8216;In suitable circumstances (and on clear evidence), a court may impose the leave restriction in cases where the welfare of the child requires it, although there is no past history of making unreasonable applications.&#8217; In my judgment the sort of harassment of the father seen in this case, in the form of vindictive complaints to the police and social services, is an example of circumstances where it would be appropriate to make an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s91(14)</ref>, even if the proceedings were not dogged by numerous applications being made to the judge.</span></p>

In particular the provision at <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 91</ref>A(2), if brought into effect, gives statutory effect to Guideline 6 of  Re P (see para 39 above) by permitting a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s91(14)</ref> order to be made where the making of an application under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> would put the parent or child at risk of physical or emotional harm.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The F has not made multiple applications. However, his conduct of this application has been far from thoughtful towards the impact on the M. He strenuously resisted all parts of the fact finding hearing. He has sought adjournments of these proceedings on a number of occasions, despite the impact that will necessarily have had on the M. Dr Proudman also relies on his conduct in the financial remedy proceedings, but I do not consider I am in a good position to reach conclusions on that, so I do not take the conduct in those proceedings into account.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My principal reason for making a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.91(14)</ref> order and for making it for 3 years, is to give the M a break from litigation and the strain that places upon her as XX&#8217;s primary carer. This litigation has been going on for four and a half years, the large majority of XX&#8217;s life. One cannot underestimate the toll that litigation takes, particularly where one party has been the victim of very serious abuse by the other. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my view, the M needs a period to feel confident that she will not have to see the F, whether on a screen or in person, and will not have to return to court unless a judge considers that is appropriate. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have carefully considered the length of the period. Dr Proudman submits that it should be 5 years. Mr Harrill also argued for 5 years on the grounds that the litigation had lasted nearly 5 years. In my view the correct balance is struck by three years. That gives a long pause for the M and XX, but takes into account the efforts the F has made to change. I remind all parties that a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.91(14)</ref> order is a filter and not a bar. If the F can show the Judge that there is a real change of circumstances, then he will be permitted to make a fresh application. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The third issue is the change of name. As I understand the parties&#8217; final positions, the M wishes XX&#8217;s surname to change from Griffiths to Kniveton, with Griffiths as a middle name. She says this will give XX a choice as to what name to use. The F accepts both names as surnames, with a hyphen and the Guardian supports a non-hyphenated surname. I think this is a somewhat arid debate as doubtless the M and XX when XX is older will use the name they choose, save on formal documents. I think it is a mistake to try to airbrush the F out of XX&#8217;s consciousness by removing Griffiths as a surname. XX has to understand the truth of who they are and in my view it will simply confuse XX for the surname to change. On balance I will order the surname changes to Griffiths Kniveton without a hyphen. </p>

The F can send letters and cards four times per year and at Christmas and XX&#8217;s birthday.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I will make a prohibited steps order to stop the F contacting the M and XX, save for the extent allowed. I will not make an order stopping him going to the school because I do not consider such an order is justified. The F has not breached court orders in this case, and although there are valid criticisms of his conduct, he has throughout shown respect for the court and its orders. There is no justification for making the type of draconian orders that are sometimes required in Family Court litigation. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, Dr Proudman asks for the M&#8217;s costs to be paid by the F. It was established during the hearing that HHJ Williscroft had made an order for &#8220;no order for costs&#8221; after the fact finding hearing, which was not appealed and I do not believe was even contested. Dr Proudman now seeks to reopen that order, but such an application is years out of time and has no sensible basis.  The M was represented at that hearing, by Dr Proudman, and if she wished to seek and contest her costs that was the moment to do so. The costs of the fact finding hearing have therefore been determined. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to the welfare hearing, it would be very unusual to order costs of such a hearing. The F was perfectly entitled to pursue his application for a CAO and although I have found against him, his conduct during the hearing and indeed in the lead up to the hearing was not vexatious. It is not in the best interests of children for their parents to be discouraged from seeking a CAO because they are worried that a costs order will be made against them, save where they do so in a frivolous or vexatious manner. For these reasons I do not consider a costs order to be justified. </p>
