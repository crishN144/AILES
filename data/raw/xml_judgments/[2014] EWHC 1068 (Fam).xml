The mother, represented as before by Miss&#160;Jones, suggests that if Y were to be left as now, living at home with her mother and her brother, L, there would be no risk of the kind that would be needed to justify removal in the public law arena.  Moreover Miss&#160;Jones submits that on an evaluation of Y&#8217;s welfare interests, balancing any risks with the advantages of maintaining the status&#160;quo, it would not be in her interests to move now to live with her father.</span></p>

If that were to happen then it is the father&#8217;s position that he would facilitate contact between Y and her mother in accordance with advice from the Local&#160;Authority and the children&#8217;s guardian, Miss&#160;Nicholls.</span></p>

There is, furthermore, mounting concern on the part of the Local&#160;Authority about the mother&#8217;s mental state and that, because of her own obsessional anxiety, at times she has been emotionally unavailable to Y.  The Local&#160;Authority considers that Y&#8217;s continued placement with her mother is neither sustainable nor conducive to Y&#8217;s wellbeing if contact between her and her father is to take place as intended by the court.</span></p>

Miss&#160;Nicholls has become increasingly concerned about the mother&#8217;s emotional wellbeing.  She, too, is mindful that the mother has been unable to support Y in developing her relationship with her father by moving towards unsupervised and staying contact.  </span></p>

Some might best be categorised as attitudinal; a fixed and unwavering resistance on the part of the mother to permitting unsupervised staying contact because of her beliefs about sexual wrongdoing.  Other problems have arisen in that Y, once more, has sustained a number of very largely unexplained injuries, particularly bruises to her buttocks and close to her genital area, sufficient on the last occasion to cause the Local&#160;Authority to initiate a Section&#160;47 investigation with an associated child protection medical.</span></p>

It is also highly material that in every contact he has had with professionals &#8211; social workers, the guardian, family support workers, contact supervisors &#8211; the father has never once appeared to be either under the influence of alcohol or suffering from the effects of too much to drink on the previous evening.

There is good reason for the requirement of supervision, it seems to me. It is extremely likely that the mother will be very distressed as the result of the impact upon her of recent events.  She will find it deeply upsetting that Y will now be living with her father.  It will be vital to monitor the extent to which she is able to present herself in a way that Y will not find disturbing.
