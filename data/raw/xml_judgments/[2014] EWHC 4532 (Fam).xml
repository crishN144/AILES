Once I had opened the door, I saw a room.  In the left-hand corner of the room was a wardrobe and there were toys all over the floor.  In the right-hand corner of the room against the window was a double bed that looked very soiled.  On the wall beside the bed was a large area of damp and the wallpaper was coming away.  There was a very strong and overpowering smell of urine and faeces in the room.  I saw the child curled in an almost foetal position on the bed lying on a pillow.  She sat up when we came into the room and she was holding an empty pink bottle.  I went towards the child and she stood up and came towards me.  I saw that her clothes were wet and that she was wearing a nappy that was falling off between her legs.  Once in a different room, I could see that the child&#8217;s clothes were wet and she was shivering.  The strong smell was coming from her and it was clear that she had not been changed or cleaned all day.  I removed the child&#8217;s nappy to find dried and fresh faeces.  The nappy was so swollen with urine that the child was unable to walk properly.  There were also dried faeces on the child&#8217;s body and her skin was soaked in urine that had leaked from her nappy and gone through her clothes.&#8221;</span></p>

At her age her physical and emotional and educational needs are for safety and security, nurture and stimulation.  She has an additional need to ensure that the progress which she has made, in the transition from the pre-August 2010 of global developmental delay to April 2011 and subsequent assessments of her significant progress in all developmental areas, is maintained and enhanced.  This will have to be undertaken not by adequate parenting but by a parent skilled in dealing with emotional responses, able to give and receive appropriate guidance.  The likely effect on CB of a change in her circumstances would be the transfer of her attachment.  </span></p>

At four years of age the decision needs, for these reasons, to be taken now.  A failure in placement for CB would be dramatic in view of her disorganised attachment history.  </span></p>

I am firmly of the view that face-to-face contact for her now and in the foreseeable future would be positively harmful in the likely emotional disturbance and upset it would cause to her.  The mother has shown herself to be persistent and resourceful and it is clear that she will leave no stone unturned in her effort to reverse the earlier decisions.  Sadly, that stance simply now underlines how far apart her case is from the factual situation of her daughter trying to settle in a new home with a new family.  It is often said - and it is particularly apposite to this case &#8211; that, where a birth parent cannot be supportive of a child moving on to a new life and to a new family, it would be inappropriate to order face-to-face contact because the risk of disruption is too great.  The entire process has lasted three years, two of those in court.  It could not possibly be right after that length of time to take any action which might undermine the best progress that the child has had in those three years of moving to a permanent prospective adoptive family.&#8221;</span></p>

Indeed, I cannot see any real change from 2012 other than the passage of time.  There is no evidence to suggest that any of the key elements of the District Judge&#8217;s judgments, to which I have just referred, have changed.  Rather the mother&#8217;s sustained efforts to challenge the evidence and the judge&#8217;s conclusions serve to demonstrate, in my view, that nothing of substance has, in fact, changed.  The mother&#8217;s reliance on having a wide support network, the support of her family and on her being more settled do not address the reasons why care and placement orders were made in 2012 and the circumstances which led to and justified those orders being made.  </span></p>

Having regard to the 2012 judgments and the evidence in the guardian&#8217;s report for these applications, it is clear to me that the mother&#8217;s prospects of success lack any &#8220;solidity&#8221;.  In my view, the mother realistically has no prospect of successfully opposing the adoption application.  I appreciate that it will be extremely painful to the mother to hear this, but my decision on this part of the case has to be governed by my assessment of what is in CB&#8217;s best interests throughout her life.  There is, in my judgment, no other option available to the court because every other option would introduce an element of instability which would cause CB significant harm. </span></p>

The guardian also refers to the resultant deterioration in her emotional health and the development of behavioural problems.  This is not a freestanding piece of evidence, but can be linked with the evidence given during the course of the care proceedings, in particular as to CB&#8217;s attachment disorder and the consequences of the parenting she had received.</span></p>

The only outcome in this case which can provide that long-term stability and security is adoption.

In June 2013, DJ McPhee said that the risk of disruption which contact would be likely to cause was too great to permit it.  This remains the position.  The mother&#8217;s powerful opposition to any course other than one leading to CB&#8217;s reunification with her would inevitably result in contact being emotionally confusing and harmful, as described by the guardian.</span></p>

CB&#8217;s welfare needs, both in the short term and, critically, throughout her life, come down powerfully in favour of my dismissing the mother&#8217;s applications because of the emotionally damaging consequences of any outcome other than adoption.  This conclusion is, in my judgment, necessitated by the overriding requirements of CB&#8217;s welfare.</span></p>
