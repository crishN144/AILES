F has been comprehensively assessed and over a very prolonged period.  I find that she has been in a permanent vegetative state for many years; at least five and in all probability eight.  In those circumstances it seems to me the current options for her treatment are no longer viable, and the balance if there is one all falls one way.  Therefore the declarations which are sought are in F&#8217;s best interests &#8211; that is to withdraw clinically assisted nutrition and hydration &#8211; I endorse the views of the clinical team, the Official Solicitor and the family.  </span></p>

The evidence contained within the papers is well summarised by Ms. T, F&#8217;s daughter: she asserts that she did </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:14pt;color:#000000">not</span><span style="font-size:14pt;color:#000000"> think that her mother would have wanted to be kept alive in a state such as this.  She recollected that her mother had a neighbour with Multiple Sclerosis who was in a wheelchair; she recalled her mother saying that she would not want to live in that fashion.  Nothing was put in writing by her mother that would assist in the determination of her current circumstances.  She, and indeed all the family, support the application.  As I say it is not entirely clear of the reason, but the guidance in relation to the consultation and continuing consultation with the family has not in fact been well complied with here.  I am not asked specifically to rule on it and, I do not do so, since it has not become a major hurdle.  </span></p>

It is evident that many years ago, at least from 1993 onwards, she had significant liver failure caused by chronic abuse of alcohol.  She retired through ill-health in 1997.  She had been admitted to hospital on a number of occasions in 2000, 2001 and 2006.  Her health came to a crisis on 11</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt;color:#000000">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt;color:#000000"> January 2007 when F was found slumped across her bed apparently with concussive symptoms.  The records at the time and the Glasgow Coma Scores that were taken demonstrate, together with the CT scan, extensive intracerebral haemorrhaging involving the right frontal lobe.  It is described in the papers as acute and bilateral subdural haematoma.  Over the next two days, whilst in hospital, there was a reduction in her level of consciousness.  On 28</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt;color:#000000">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt;color:#000000"> February 2007 F was transferred to a different hospital where she has remained ever since.  In general terms, she has been assessed over a long period (8 years) as being in a vegetative state with no perception of her surroundings.  She is not communicative, although she has and does make moaning sounds and can blink her eyes (but these are considered to be entirely reflexive movements).  In 2010 it was recorded by a nurse that F was in a persistent vegetative state, having no communication or interaction with family or care staff.  </span></p>

The current application was triggered, as I understand it, by an anxiety about the Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.  That in fact has been dealt with on a temporary basis and forms no part of this judgment.  What is evident from the evidence produced by the Authority is that it is the unanimous view of the treating clinicians F has been in a vegetative state now for eight years, and to undertake any further surgical processes would be invasive and from which she would not derive any benefit.  In addition, of course, they seek other declarations which I shall make at the end of this judgment.</span></p>

Here the condition of the patient, who was totally unconscious and in whose condition there is no prospect of any improvement, is such that life prolonging treatment is properly to be regarded as being in medical terms useless.  For my part I cannot see that medical treatment is appropriate or requisite simply to prolong a patient&#8217;s life.  When such treatment has no therapeutic purpose of any kind, that is where it is futile because the patient is unconscious and there is no prospect of any improvement of this condition.

		      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt;color:#000000">This approach follows very closely the recommendations of the Law Commission in their Report on Mental Incapacity (1995, Law Com No 231) on which <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> is based. It had been suggested in Re F that it might be enough if the doctor had acted in accordance with an accepted body of medical opinion (the Bolam test for medical negligence). However, as the Court of Appeal later recognised in Re S (Adult Patient: Sterilisation) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] Fam 15" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] Fam 15</ref>, there can only logically be one best option. The advantage of a best interests test was that it focused upon the patient as an individual, rather than the conduct of the doctor, and took all the circumstances, both medical and non-medical, into account (paras 3.26, 3.27). But the best interests test should also contain &#8220;a strong element of &#8216;substituted judgment&#8217;&#8221; (para 3.25), taking into account both the past and present wishes and feelings of patient as an individual, and also the factors which he would consider if able to do so (para 3.28). This might include &#8220;altruistic sentiments and concern for others&#8221; (para 3.31). <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">The Act</ref> has helpfully added a reference to the beliefs and values which would be likely to influence his decision if he had capacity. Both provide for consultation with carers and others interested in the patient&#8217;s welfare as to what would be in his best interests and in particular what his own views would have been. This is, as the Explanatory Notes to the Bill made clear, still a &#8220;best interests&#8221; rather than a &#8220;substituted judgment&#8221; test, but one which accepts that the preferences of the person concerned are an important component in deciding where his best interests lie. To take a simple example, it cannot be in the best interests to give the patient food which he does not like when other equally nutritious food is available. </span></p>

Here we can see a possible genesis for the references in the Code of Practice to the "prospect of recovery" and the "overly burdensome" nature of the treatment. Similarly in Bland, Lord Goff referred to the class of case where "having regard to all the circumstances (including the intrusive nature of the treatment, the hazards involved in it, and the very poor quality of life which may be prolonged) it may be judged not in the best interests of the patient to initiate or continue life-prolonging treatment" (p 868). But he expressed no view as to the precise principles applicable to such cases, because Anthony Bland's case was in a different category, where the treatment was of no benefit to him at all. Here there was no weighing operation to be performed because treatment was useless: "I cannot see that medical treatment is appropriate or requisite simply to prolong a patient's life when such treatment has no therapeutic purpose of any kind, as where it is futile because the patient is unconscious and there is no prospect of any improvement in his condition (p 869)". Here we can see a possible genesis of the word "futile" in the Code of Practice and in that case it referred to treatment which was of no benefit at all to the patient. </span></p>

There was no question of withdrawing clinically supported nutrition and hydration or ventilation or other supported breathing or, by the time of the hearing, intravenous antibiotics. The treatments in question were all highly invasive. I might have drawn a distinction between them. Invasive support for circulatory problems had been used successfully in the past and the patient had rallied. Renal replacement therapy had not so far been needed and so it might be difficult to predict both its effectiveness and its impact upon the patient's overall wellbeing. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, on the other hand, although it had been used successfully in the past, is designed to restart a heart which has stopped beating or lungs which have stopped breathing, in effect to bring the patient back to life. I can understand why the judge thought it premature to say that it should not be attempted. But given the particular nature of this treatment, given its prospects of success, and particularly given the risk that, if revived, the patient would be even more seriously disabled than before, I would probably have declared that it would not be in the patient's best interests to attempt it.

Thus it is setting the goal too high to say that treatment is futile unless it has "a real prospect of curing or at least palliating the life-threatening disease or illness from which the patient is suffering". This phrase may be a partial quotation from Grubb, Laing and McHale, Principles of Medical Law (3rd edition 2010), para 10.214, where the authors suggest that "Treatment can properly be categorised as futile if it cannot cure or palliate the disease or illness from which the patient is suffering and thus serves no therapeutic purpose of any kind". Earlier, they had used the words "useless" or "pointless". Given its genesis in Bland, this seems the more likely meaning to be attributed to the word as used in the Code of Practice. A treatment may bring some benefit to the patient even though it has no effect upon the underlying disease or disability. The Intensive Care Society and the Faculty of Intensive Medicine, who have helpfully intervened in this appeal, supported the test proposed by Sir Alan Ward. But this was because they believed that it reflected clinical practice in which "'futility' would normally be understood as meaning that the patient cannot benefit from a medical intervention because he or she will not survive with treatment". That is much closer to the definition adopted by the judge than by Sir Alan. </span></p>

At least on the evidence before the judge, this was not, as Sir Alan Ward put it, a situation in which the patient was "actively dying". It was accepted in Burke (as it had been earlier) that where the patient is close to death, the object may properly be to make his dying as comfortable and as dignified as possible, rather than to take invasive steps to prolong his life for a short while (see paras 62-63). But where a patient is suffering from an incurable illness, disease or disability, it is not very helpful to talk of recovering a state of "good health". The patient's life may still be very well worth living. Resuming a quality of life which the patient would regard as worthwhile is more readily applicable, particularly in the case of a patient with permanent disabilities. As was emphasised in Re J (1991), it is not for others to say that a life which the patient would regard as worthwhile is not worth living. </span></p>

The purpose of the best interests test is to consider matters from the patient's point of view. That is not to say that his wishes must prevail, any more than those of a fully capable patient must prevail. We cannot always have what we want. Nor will it always be possible to ascertain what an incapable patient's wishes are. Even if it is possible to determine what his views were in the past, they might well have changed in the light of the stresses and strains of his current predicament. In this case, the highest it could be put was, as counsel had agreed, that "It was likely that Mr James would want treatment up to the point where it became hopeless". But insofar as it is possible to ascertain the patient's wishes and feelings, his beliefs and values or the things which were important to him, it is those which should be taken into account because they are a component in making the choice which is right for him as an individual human being.&#8221;</span></p>

That question is not the same as is it in the patient&#8217;s best interests that he should die?  The latter question assumes that it is lawful to perpetuate life, but such perpetuation of life can only be achieved if it is lawful to continue to invade the bodily integrity of the patient by invasive medical care.  Hence the focus is on whether it is in the patient&#8217;s best interests to give the treatment rather than whether it is in the patient&#8217;s best interests to withhold or withdraw it.  If the treatment is not in his best interests the court will not be able to give its consent on his behalf and it will follow that it will not be lawful to withhold or withdraw it.  Indeed it will follow that it will not be lawful to give it.  It also follows that, provided of course that they have acted reasonably and without negligence, the clinical team will not be in breach of any duty towards the patient if they withhold or withdraw it.&#8221;  </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt;color:#000000">The important distinction of diagnosis (between minimally conscious state and vegetative states) so far as the court is concerned self evidently dictates a different path, with different considerations and vastly different outcomes.  In relation to a permanent vegetative state it may mean that the life sustaining treatment is futile, whereas in a minimally conscious state the court takes an holisitic balance sheet approach.  That distinction is evidently and well set out by the judgment in WM, which pre-dates the guidelines but in which a diagnosis was made which was subsequently shown to be incorrect.  The Court must examine therefore diagnosis with some considerable degree of care.  In essence, without setting out the entirety of the guidance which is substantial, it seems to me that the guidelines which are set out in them ordinarily should always be followed by applicants in circumstances such as this.  Indeed, the guidance itself sets out that it is an area where the tools which are set out extensively within them are ones which should be precursors to applications being made.  There are good examples, but I preface it all by the fact that it is evidently of the utmost - indeed the most vital - importance that every step should always be taken to diagnose a patient&#8217;s true condition </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:14pt;color:#000000">before</span><span style="font-size:14pt;color:#000000"> the application is made.  If that does not occur what has happened in this and indeed in other cases in my experience is that there is inevitably delay, uncertainty and anxiety, as well as increased cost.  </span></p>

Firstly there are the assessments which are available to the court, provided by the applicants, but from practitioners, who may not necessarily have the necessary training and expertise which I would have expected.  Section 2 of the guidance makes it clear that &#8220;assessors for the diagnosis of which the court is concerned should meet the minimum requirements set out, both as to experience and training&#8221;.  It may be here that that is the case, but I am not confident that it is so.  </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt;color:#000000">I have however had the advantage of the evidence provided by Professor Wade.  He, of course, was part of the working party that gave rise to the guidance in the first place.  He obviously does have the experience and training that one would expect in such a sensitive case.  Unhappily, the formal assessments detailed in the guidance have not been carried out either.  Those assessments are there for good reason.  Authorities must understand that in future without that evidence, it is likely that the application may be subject to summary rejection.  The guidance makes it clear that structured assessment tools should ordinarily </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:14pt;color:#000000">always</span><span style="font-size:14pt;color:#000000"> be used for assisting the court, and those who apply to it.  It refers to three main assessment processes:  The first is the Wessex Head Injury Matrix (&#8220;WHIM&#8221;); second, is the Sensory Modality Assessment and Rehabilitation Technique (&#8220;SMART&#8221;); and, third, is the Coma Recovery Scale as revised (&#8220;CRSR&#8221;).  The guidance recommends that the use of one or more of those three assessments should be used as instruments of formal structured assessment over time in such applications.  Though it is not necessarily prescriptive it does recommend, for example, that if there were to be a WHIM assessment that should be carried out on a specific number of occasions (in fact ten) and over an extended period over a number of weeks.  In relation to the SMART assessment, it is a detailed assessment.  It is developed to detect awareness, functional and communication capacity.  The SMART assessments are ones which need to be carried out by suitably qualified persons.  They are very sophisticated tools of invaluable insight and assistance.  The court expects a high level of certainty with respect to diagnosis, because as earlier cases have shown it is easy to reach a diagnosis which in fact is subsequently shown to be incorrect (some 40% I am told).  The court can only reach a safe conclusion once it has regard to the clinical evaluation </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:14pt;color:#000000">and</span><span style="font-size:14pt;color:#000000"> having regard to the WHIM or the CRSR or probably better still a SMART if that is necessary in the particular case.  If there is any degree of uncertainty or disagreement on the level of responsiveness then the SMART test, as the court&#8217;s experience shows, is essential to resolve it.  </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt;color:#000000">Ideally the guidance suggests that at least two of those assessments should be carried out (the WHIM, the CRSR or the SMART) in support of any application made to the Court of Protection.  Additionally, where assessments are to be used in support of an application to the court to </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:14pt;color:#000000">withdraw</span><span style="font-size:14pt;color:#000000"> treatment as life sustaining therapy or treatment, a SMART assessment should also be used.  Here no SMART assessment has been carried out.  Here, fortunately from the experts familiar to the court, it is considered that the equivalent of a CRSR assessment &#8220;can be properly deduced and inferred&#8221; from the length of time.  There were WHIM assessments (although they were in fact not carried out in compliance with the guidance as suggested).  </span></p>

I am not clear that the clinicians and the evidence supporting this case does amount to a &#8220;specialist rehabilitation team&#8221;.  I am not satisfied either that the best interests meetings have been carried out in accordance with the guidance.  </span></p>

I conclude that the patient is in a permanent vegetative state, has been so for five years and probably eight; that so far as the prognosis is concerned F will neither improve nor will she recover awareness.  I am satisfied, indeed sure, that it is right to make the declarations sought.  The reality is that any short term measures would be risky and unnecessary.  The unanimous views of the treating doctors and clinicians and of the independent experts is one where it is in the best interests of the patient for support to be withdrawn.  That view is supported by the family.  Here there is no risk of an incomplete or erroneous diagnosis.  I am satisfied that (having regard to the definition in </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:14pt;color:#000000">Bland</span><span style="font-size:14pt;color:#000000">), F&#8217;s life is futile.

The advices of Dr. Badwan, which are always helpful and to the point, are clear and support the other evidence in this case; the court is therefore prepared to make the declarations as sought.  The guidelines are set out for good reason.  It is not just that it is good practice and a gold standard that should be adhered to, but because the court is in fact being asked to sanction a course of conduct which, if granted, almost always leads to the death of a patient.  The law recognises the overriding importance of the sanctity of life.  Therefore the guidance </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:14pt;color:#000000">must</span><span style="font-size:14pt;color:#000000"> be complied with in relation to all such applications so that the court can deal with the matter swiftly, humanely and justly.
