The Mother was unfaithful to Mr Walker from sometime late in 2016 and early 2017. That their relationship was birthed in the context of the Mother&#8217;s dishonesty in her previous relationship never really escaped the parents&#8217; minds. The Mother&#8217;s and Mr Walker&#8217;s relationship ended on 16 April 2018 and, the following day, the Mother moved into the Father&#8217;s home &#8211; a property owned by him. The parents had difficulties conceiving Ben, but I am told he was a planned baby. Olivia was an unexpected joy to their lives. The relationship ended on 22 March 2023 &#8211; a date I will discuss in greater detail later in this judgment.</span></p>

The FHDRA took place on 6 July 2023. At a hearing on 24 August 2023 the Court ordered the children have indirect contact with the Father and prohibited the Mother from allowing the children to spend any time with Mr Walker. Those orders were appealed by the Mother on 30 August 2023. She sought to set aside the Prohibited Steps Order and an order substituting the interim indirect contact for pre-recorded videos of the children once per month. The appeal was allowed in so far as it related to a case management decision concerning Mr Walker. The appeal against the welfare orders were dismissed. The Court ordered there to be supported contact at a contact centre.</span></p>

I recognise there is a build-up over the course of proceedings and, for some, a strong desire to seize the opportunity to ensure their perspective of the truth is spoken in Court. Furthermore, the adversarial nature of this process rarely reveals the best qualities in those who appear before the Family Court. In evaluating each of the witnesses I have been careful to have this fallibility in mind and strained not to be unnecessarily critical of those who appeared before me. However, even making all the allowances I can, I regret that each of the witnesses who appeared before me were most unimpressive. The toxicity of the intergenerational familial conflict sweated out of the parties and those whom they called. Each of the witnesses made very poor impressions and each, I find, gave evidence with advocating their own interests in the conflict first and foremost in their minds. This is very far from being a case where I can determine the issues by preferring one party&#8217;s evidence to the exclusion of the other&#8217;s. Instead, as will be set out, I will accept some parts of the parties&#8217; evidence whilst rejecting other parts.</span></p>

The credibility and reliability of that parent should not be assessed simply by reference to their demeanour, degree of emotion or other aspects of their presentation. This of course works in both directions. It is as problematic to rely on an impression that a witness has an 'honest' tone, manner or presentation, for example that they appear "genuinely upset", as it is to rely on an impression that the tone or manner of a witness appears 'dishonest', for example that they cross their arms or look at the floor. These principles must apply both when the court is evaluating the parent in the witness box and when the court is evaluating the significance of the observations of other's regarding the parent's demeanour at a given point.&#8221;</span></p>

At one point when he was in the well of the Court listening to the Mother, early in her evidence, he held his arms outstretched as if a football player complaining at a referee&#8217;s decision.

She was argumentative, sarcastic, immature, would at times not directly answer questions against her son&#8217;s interests and retorted questions back at counsel. She was prepared to offer direct evidence of events when, on probing, she would go on to admit to never being present.

Instead, the Father at times co-opted his parents to prevent the children being re-located away from him. Having listened to them both, I have no doubt that living with the Father and the Paternal Grandmother would have been quite unbearable. Similarly, living with a person with the Mother&#8217;s combative, loud and reactive &#8216;fight style&#8217; would have been challenging. I accept the Mother felt trapped and the Father limited her agency by his presence (what he described as being around her &#8220;24/7&#8221;), by limiting her ability to leave the home with both children, by use of belittling communication, criticism of the Mother&#8217;s parenting and critical remarks of her mental health.</span></p>

In the Father, the Mother found a person who was generally not empathetic to her needs. Instead, he was attuned to how to exploit her vulnerabilities. Whilst he claimed to me that he just wanted to help the Mother, his recordings demonstrated that he lacked empathy.</span></p>

Her &#8220;fight style&#8221; in conflict with the Father was use of loud, aggressive and extremely abusive language. Furthermore, the Mother, I will find, resorted to use of physical violence, including in the children&#8217;s presence. At times the Mother sounded beyond any restraint. The children could be heard screaming and crying immediately after hearing the Mother&#8217;s hot and angry screams. At times the Mother goaded the Father by comparing him to Mr Walker, which she knew would trigger his jealousy and anger. I accept she is an extremely reactive person and her volatility could escalate rapidly.</span></p>

I am, however, compelled to conclude that the act of recording represented a prioritisation of the Mother&#8217;s own needs over the children&#8217;s. For so long as the Mother expended her energy and focus on recording, she was not doing everything to promote the children&#8217;s best interests.</span></p>

The Father&#8217;s lie was inconsistent with the Paternal Grandfather&#8217;s evidence that no such thing was said. The purpose of the Father&#8217;s lie was to embellish his account of the Mother&#8217;s behaviour to make his version more believable and paint the Mother as someone whom those in authority perceived to be dangerous. I further reject the claim the Police directed the Mother not to take Ben. Had that been the case it is likely it would have been recorded in the disclosure.

In a raised voice and then later shouting the Mother said words such as, &#8220;Fucking pussy,&#8221; &#8220;I hate you,&#8221; &#8220;I am taking my belongings,&#8221; and &#8220;You&#8217;re a fucking piece of shit.&#8221; The Mother&#8217;s claim to have not been verbally abusive was manifestly false and dishonest.

The single recording of the Maternal Grandmother saying that the Mother was off her medication tells me nothing of the context, time or duration. I am unable to give it weight. Whether the Mother looks after her mental health will undoubtedly be an issue that touches on the Mother&#8217;s parenting capacity that the FCA will analyse and I will consider at the final hearing.</span></p>
