	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Despite the end of the marriage in 2006, despite there being proceedings for its dissolution in England since January 2007 and despite the husband&#8217;s implicit assertion that the proper jurisdiction for divorce proceedings is Spain, the husband has never sought to bring proceedings there.  Despite the order of Mr Justice Ryder of 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2007, neither party has filed a report from an expert in Spanish matrimonial law stating what law, that is to say English or Spanish, a Spanish court would apply to the determination of financial provision.  Nevertheless, Mr Reade has realistically accepted that in the light of the Court of Appeal decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Moore v Moore <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2007/361" uk:canonical="[2007] EWCA Civ 361" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] EWCA Civ 361</ref></span>, and in particular paragraph 6 and 67 of the court&#8217;s judgment, a Spanish court will apply English law.  If then I am driven to find that the English court has no jurisdiction to hear the wife&#8217;s matrimonial proceedings, these parties will remain married and will be unable to resolve their financial differences, despite both accepting that the marriage is at an end.  Furthermore, if proceedings are begun in Spain, it is common ground, as I have said, that the Spanish court will apply English law to determine the real issue in this case, which is what financial provision, if any, is to be made by the husband for the wife.  The Spanish judge will thus, most likely, need the assistance of expert evidence on behalf of the parties as to what financial provision an English judge would be likely to make, applying English law.  The parties would thus not have the most suitable body to decide upon financial provision under English law, namely an English court.  This of course is not a criticism of the Spanish court, merely, I would have thought, a statement of the obvious.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The husband told me in evidence that the practical reason why he wants the disentanglement of the assets to be negotiated and/or decided in Spain is because the assets are there and Spanish lawyers can more easily resolve it.  He further told me that if the wife&#8217;s proceedings here are dismissed for want of jurisdiction, he will begin divorce proceedings in Spain.  In my judgment this is really not an answer to my question, which I posed at the very beginning of this hearing, which is why the husband is seeking to have the English proceedings dismissed.  He accepted that the marriage is at an end and that he wants a divorce.  I must say that I have to suspect that, as in <span style="font-style:italic">Moore v Moore</span>, the husband&#8217;s attitude may be driven by tactical considerations, namely either to wear down the wife and/or in an expectation that a Spanish judge would award the wife significantly less financial provision than an English judge.  </p>

The wife says that the husband bought all the issued share capital in Cashmeres of Scotland Limited, a company registered in Gibraltar.  She says that the funding of that company amounted to about &#163;1.307 million, of which the husband put in his net proceeds of sale from Canal View, a lump sum from his pension, together with other resources.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The pattern of the parties&#8217; life after the move to Spain was, I find, as follows.  The husband pursued his business activities in both England and Spain and Gibraltar.  He retired as a director of City Centre, Simmondswood and Sean Louis Investments, but he remained as a consultant to City Centre Commercials until December 2006.  He remained the majority shareholder in each of the three companies until 1 October 2005.  I have little doubt that he remained the driving force behind each of those companies, at least until that date and perhaps a little after it.  Significantly, he purchased the Maghull property with his own money and extended it with his own money.  I suspect that it was put into Sean&#8217;s name not because he had gifted it to Sean, indeed there was no evidence of that, but because he wanted to have a property in England to use when he visited England without alerting, in particular, the Inland Revenue in whose eyes he had purported to become a tax exile.  For tax reasons the husband should not return to England for more than 90 days in any one year without him running the risk of becoming subject to United Kingdom tax.  The wife told me, and I accept, that each of them kept clothes and belongings in the Maghull property so that that minimised what they had to bring from Spain on their visits.  Furthermore the wife had a key to the house and each party had free and unrestricted access to it.  </p>

So far as the wife is concerned, Mr Reade, when asked by me both at the beginning of the hearing and in final submissions, whether he was asserting that at or after the move to Spain the wife had acquired a domicile of choice in Spain, replied that he was.  He broadly argued that she had lived there for four years, that she had no business interests in England, that her home was in Spain.  She was a shareholder in and the legally recognised &#8220;administrator&#8221; of Monarch Properties, the Spanish company.  Furthermore, she left England for Spain with her husband for fiscal and emotional reasons and lived with him there until the marriage broke down in October 2006. </p>

In his skeleton argument of 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"/>September 2007, Mr Sharpe specifically stated at paragraph 10 that the wife had always retained her domicile of origin.  Mr Reade&#8217;s skeleton argument dealt solely with habitual residence and did not in any way controvert the assertion that the wife had always retained her domicile of origin.  Finally, in the husband&#8217;s examination-in-chief in answer to a very specific question by Mr Reade in examination-in-chief, stated, candidly, I thought, that he could not answer for the wife&#8217;s domicile.</p>

Again, at the very beginning of the hearing, I specifically asked Mr&#160;Sharpe whether he was submitting that both the wife and the husband were domiciled in England as at 17 January 2007.  He replied in the affirmative, though he made it quite clear that his primary case as to jurisdiction was founded on the habitual residence and domicile of the wife.  In the light of that, I must say that I was rather surprised that when it came to the husband to give his evidence, little, if anything, was said by him about either him abandoning his domicile of origin and/or acquiring a domicile of choice in Spain.  He did say, it is true, that he would live in Spain &#8220;for the foreseeable future&#8221; and Mr Reade said that his evidence was largely contained in his statements, but his statements are focused, in my judgment, on rebutting the wife&#8217;s case as to her habitual residence. </p>

He submitted that a mere wish to live in a sunny and warm climate and to enjoy the company of friends was hardly enough to establish that the husband had a settled intention to live in Spain permanently.  Indeed, as I have said, the husband retreated significantly from his statements.  He did not think he would stay in Spain for the rest of his life, he told me.  The fact that he has never sought Spanish citizenship is, in my judgment, relevant.  It is, of course, not in itself conclusive, but it is a persuasive factor.  His evidence that he would not give up either his British passport or his British nationality is again a persuasive factor but not in itself conclusive.  His purchase of an English property in Maghull, again is a relevant and persuasive factor though, in itself, not conclusive.  Similar considerations apply to his shareholdings in the three companies and his consultancy.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Munby J. then decided two further points of law, one with which I respectfully agree and the other about which, equally respectfully, I am somewhat doubtful.  The first point was whether, for the purpose of the regulation, someone can be habitually resident in two different countries at the same time.  Munby J. decided that they could not for the reasons he gave in paragraphs 39 to 44 inclusive of his judgment.  I agree with his analysis and would follow it.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The second point was whether there is some distinction between what is referred to in Article 3(1) as being &#8220;habitually resident&#8221; and what is referred to as having &#8220;resided&#8221; in a member state.  In that case the husband contended that &#8220;resided&#8221; meant habitually resided.  The wife contended that it connoted something less than habitual residence, ie that it was enough that there was a pattern of occupation of a base in a country.  Munby J. decided in favour of the wife&#8217;s submission.  His reasoning appears between paragraphs 46 and 49 respectively of his judgment.  In essence it is that what is required by the regulation are two things: (i)&#160;habitual residence on a particular day, and (ii) residence, though not necessarily habitual residence, during the relevant immediately preceding period. &#8220;Residence&#8221; means just that; it refers to residence and does not connote habitual residence.  This reasoning finds its conclusion, so far as the facts are concerned, in paragraph 85 of his judgment, but I shall read also paragraph 84 to put it in context: </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Strictly speaking, in the case before me it is perhaps unnecessary for me to go into this matter.  I say that because the wife&#8217;s case is and has always been that she has always been and remained habitually resident in England, notwithstanding the move to Spain.  Nevertheless what troubles me about the conclusion of Munby J. on this point is that I do not think it accords with the proper construction of Article 3(1) and does not seem to me to explain why the words &#8220;if he or she resided there for at least six months immediately before the application was made and&#8230; has his or her domicile there&#8221;, are there at all.  I ask rhetorically why in the fifth and the sixth indents in Article 3(1)(a) do the words &#8220;if he or she resided there for at least (a period of one year or six months) immediately before the application was made&#8221; appear at all, and why in the sixth indent is there another set of words relating to nationality, or in the case of the United Kingdom and Ireland relating to domicile of the applicant?  </p>

That is why the fifth indent allows jurisdiction to lie with the courts of the Member State in which the applicant is habitually resident if he or she resided there for at least a year.  Since some Member States did not find the rule set out in those terms sufficient and bearing in mind the frequency with which the spouse's new residence is in the State of nationality or of 'domicile', in the sense in which this term is used in the United Kingdom and Ireland, the sixth indent adds the possibility of having the matrimonial proceedings heard by the courts of the Member State in which the applicant is habitually resident if he or she resided there for at least six months immediately before the application was made, provided that that State is the State of nationality or of domicile as defined in the United Kingdom and in Ireland. That provision was introduced as a result of the political compromise adopted in December 1997 following a formal statement by some States that acceptance of that forum was an essential prerequisite of vital importance for an overall compromise solution.</p>

The existence of the connection will be assessed by the court.  Although the possibility of including a provision determining habitual residence similar to the one in Article 52 of the 1968 Brussels Convention was discussed, in the end it was decided not to insert any specific provision on the matter.  However, although not applicable under the 1968 Brussels Convention, particular account was taken of the definition given on numerous occasions by the Court of Justice, i.e. 'the place where the person had established, on a fixed basis, his permanent or habitual centre of interests, with all the relevant facts being taken into account for the purpose of determining such residence'.  Other proposals were therefore rejected whereby it would be sufficient for the applicant to have his or her habitual residence there for a total of at least one year in the five years immediately before the application was made, even when combined with nationality or 'domicile'.&#8217;</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It seems to me that the critical points made by Dr Boris are these.  First, discussion of the delegates centred around the situation of the spouse returning to his/her country of origin as a consequence of the breakdown of the marriage.  Second, the grounds adopted in the Regulation are based on the principle of a genuine connection between the person and the Member State.  Third, the existence of that connection will be assessed by the court.  Fourth, the solution in the Regulation takes into account the situation of the spouse returning to his or her country but does not mean establishing a ground based solely on the forum of the applicant.  Fifth, nationality or, in respect of the United Kingdom and Ireland &#8216;domicile&#8217;, demonstrates that there is initial connection.  But, sixth, that is not enough.  Residence for at least six months prior to the presentation of petition is also necessary.  Seventh, a proposal was made, but rejected, that jurisdiction can be established by the applicant, establishing habitual residence &#8220;for a total of at least one year in the five years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition.&#8221;  </p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Thus, what, as I understand it, the fifth and sixth indents of Article 3(1)(a) of the Regulations seek to do is to compel the court, in assessing the connection of the applicant to the jurisdiction sought to be embraced, to look at two fundamentals.  The first is whether the applicant is a national of the relevant member state or, in the case of the United Kingdom and Ireland, whether the applicant is domiciled there.  But, second, since an applicant returning to the United Kingdom either retained his or her domicile of origin, ie the United Kingdom, notwithstanding that he or she lived in a foreign country having left the United Kingdom or upon return to the United Kingdom there and then abandoned his or her domicile of choice and reverted to his or her domicile of origin, ie the United Kingdom, then the Regulation is at pains to make it clear that what else is required to establish jurisdiction in the United Kingdom is habitual residence of the applicant.  As Dr Borr&#225;s said at paragraph 28 of the explanatory report: &#8220;Point (a) uses habitual residence in order to determine international jurisdiction.&#8221;  </p>

The answer is not less than six months immediately preceding the presentation of the petition.  Habitual residence may be shown to have existed for more than six months, as indeed Munby J. found in <span style="font-style:italic">Marinos v Marinos</span>, see paragraph 78 to 80 inclusive of his judgment.  But the minimum period of habitual residence is six months and it must run for at least six months prior to the presentation of the petition.  If then I am correct on this point there is no need to insert into the Regulation words as suggested in paragraph 46 of the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Marinos v Marinos</span>.  </p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">As I have said, the wife&#8217;s case is that, notwithstanding the move to Spain in 2003, her habitual residence remained in England and did not change at any time prior to 17 January 2007.  It is not the wife&#8217;s case that she ceased to be habitually resident in England after the move to Spain but then at some point prior to 17 July 2006, ie not less than six months before the date of her petition for divorce, reverted to being and continued thereafter to be, habitually resident in England.  Mr Sharpe&#8217;s case starts from the position that up to the move to Spain in 2003, the wife was undoubtedly habitually resident in England but in 2003 she sold her house and business in England and moved with the husband and her two children to Spain.  At that time her only ties, leaving aside nationality and passports, in England were her mother and her extended family, and of course her wish to remain medically treated in England.  Shez returned very soon to England, the mother remained in Spain.  The husband and wife together purchased a home, La Nucia, which was their matrimonial home.  I have to say I am not overly impressed with Mr Reade&#8217;s point that the wife was a shareholder in and the &#8220;administrator&#8221; of Monarch Properties.  I very much doubt that she took any active part in the business and her position no doubt suited the husband.  Nevertheless, in so far as it is a factor, it is perhaps a small indicator.  Nor is the opening of a Spanish bank account anything other than a minor indicator.  </p>

She could, if she had wished, access free medical care as the result of the husband paying the equivalent of English national insurance contributions.  The wife drove a car with local number plates.  In 2005, when Nikki returned to live in England, the wife no doubt had a painful choice to make.  Did she stay with the husband or was she to go to England and look after Nikki fulltime, or was she going to split her time, reasonably equally, between the husband in Spain and Nikki in England?  She chose to stay in Spain.  As far as I can see, her visits to England after Nikki&#8217;s return stayed at much the same frequency and duration as before.  </p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On the other hand, it is undoubtedly the case that the wife, and indeed the husband, did not seek to become Spanish citizens.  Each retained their British nationality and British passports.  The husband was careful to avoid, I am sure quite legitimately, paying any income or capital taxes in Spain.  The wife retained her registration with her English general practitioner.  The husband and wife regularly and frequently, so far as the 90-day limit allowed, visited England and stayed in the Maghull property.  I am satisfied that that property has at all times been the husband&#8217;s property; he paid for it, and for the extension.  The husband and wife undoubtedly had free and unhindered access to it and left in that property enough clothes and belongings to use during their visits.  The wife of course visited her children and mother and came for medical treatment. </p>

First, she said that &#8220;the plan&#8221; on moving to Spain was to make money and then return to England to buy properties here.  That assertion appears nowhere in any of her statements.  At paragraph 2.7 of her March 2007 statement she said that they intended to set up a property business in Spain, move on to the United States of America, but spend a portion of the year in England.  When that was put to her by Mr Reade, she agreed that what she had said in evidence was probably not their intention then.  </p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The second matter was that she said in evidence that she had no commitment to Spain and in 2006 wanted to return to England.  She wanted to be back home, as she put it, and have a holiday home in Spain.  However, as Mr Reade pointed out to her in his cross-examination, that appeared to be the exact opposite of what she said in her statement of March 2007, namely that she sought &#8220;long-term ancillary orders&#8221; encompassing a reasonable &#8220;home&#8221; in Spain and a &#8220;pied-&#224;-terre&#8221; in England.  Furthermore, in each of her statements of March, August and September 2007, the wife gave as her address the Spanish apartment.  In so far as she has given an English address, it first appears in her statement of November 2007 in support of her application for maintenance pending suit, and is no more than a &#8220;care of&#8221; address.  I reject her evidence that she has <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">no</span> commitment to Spain.  The fact that she seeks sufficient monies from the husband to buy a &#8220;home&#8221; in Spain, and not in England, is in my judgment a strong indicator as to the country where the wife herself perceives to be the habitual centre of her interests.</p>

Accordingly, had the wife been unable to rely upon Article 3(1)(b), ie the parties&#8217; common domicile in England, I would have dismissed the petition for want to jurisdiction.  As it is, I find that the English court does have jurisdiction and thus the divorce and ancillary relief proceedings will continue here.  I am relieved to be able to so find because the consequences of declining jurisdiction would have been a somewhat absurd situation, as I explained at the beginning of this judgment.  </p>
