His emotions ran close to the surface throughout both hearings that I conducted, and he appeared overwhelmed by his upset on more than occasion. I have no reason to doubt his sincerity when he describes the extent of his love for his children, and can well understand why the prospect of their adoption is such a frightening and distressing prospect. I found it notable that the father was unable or unwilling to acknowledge his own role in the demise of his relationship with his children, choosing instead to focus on the actions of the mother. I was left in no doubt as to the extent of ill-feeling that he continues to bear towards her. There was more than one occasion where I felt that the father lost sight of the children in pursuit of his own need to deflect blame for the current circumstances. </span></p>

However, the real question here is how an adoption order sits with the agreed position that contact ought to resume at the end of these proceedings. It cannot be said that the father and D&#8217;s relationship does not exist in the real world in the way that this might be true of the relationship between the father and the other children. Whilst a meaningful relationship might currently be on hiatus, the quality, substance, and importance of the father&#8217;s role in D&#8217;s life will inevitably change if contact takes place consistently and safely.

The importance of the father&#8217;s role in D&#8217;s life will increase if contact takes place consistently and safely (although the court would perhaps be unwise to consider that a foregone conclusion). That said, D&#8217;s desire for contact and the expectation that this takes place is just one consideration. It does not alone give basis to stop an application for an adoption order in its tracks. The court is required by statute to consider whether there should be contact arrangements in place before making an adoption order, and post-adoption contact orders are routinely made. </span></p>

Whilst there are losses, the benefits that will come with permanency carry greater weight. I acknowledge that this is a serious interference with the father&#8217;s Article 8 rights, but I have identified factors that significantly reduce the degree of interference and make adoption a proportionate measure in response to the children&#8217;s circumstances. This outcome also balances the respect for family life that the mother, step-father, and children are entitled to within their family unit. That is where the children&#8217;s main family life exists, and I remind myself that where a child&#8217;s rights come into conflict with those of adults, it is the child&#8217;s rights that should prevail. </span></p>

My intention is to then defer making the adoption orders for 28 days from the handing down to give the father time to seek permission to appeal if he wishes to do so. I acknowledge that this is a balanced case, and that I am disagreeing with at least one professional (although I have explained my reasons why). Given the irreversible nature of an adoption order, it is better that any questions of appeal are dealt with prior to the order taking effect. I shall explain the appeal procedure to the father before judgment is given. </span></p>

The step-father, mother, and Children&#8217;s Guardian all agreed that it was, whilst the father did not oppose. The court noted the size of the sibling group, and determined that additional redactions were required to minimise the risk of identification. The court considered that removing reference to the precise ages of the youngest three children and their genders struck the appropriate balance and maintained the integrity of the judgment. </span></p>
