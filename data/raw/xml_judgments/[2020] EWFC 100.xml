	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.12in">S was born on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2017, the daughter of HR (the mother) and IH (the father).  She was born at 37 weeks and she was diagnosed pre-birth as suffering from various abnormalities, including ventriculomegaly, meaning that two of the four brain ventricles were enlarged and filled with fluid, a cleft palate and micrognathia, that is an undersized lower jaw, and a series of other conditions which do not matter for these purposes. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.12in">The combination of conditions presented significant difficulties with feeding and breathing and S spent her first six weeks in the special care baby unit at hospital, initially at Sheffield Hospital where she had been born, and then at Pinderfields Hospital.  On 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October an MRI head scan showed no intracranial haemorrhages and, specifically, no subdural haemorrhages. </p>

I describe it as that because the father was not living there permanently, but was spending most of his time there, including most nights.  By then, both parents, who had spent much of the previous six weeks in hospital, had received training in dealing with S&#8217;s particular needs.  She had to be, amongst other things, positioned on her side to assist her breathing and she was fed by means of a special oral bottle with high calorie feed.  Her parents were, understandably, anxious about her breathing and feeding and this was a challenging situation for any parent.  </p>

The ambulance arrived quickly, by when S had turned blue and her heart had stopped beating and she was seen to be retching.

This means that the injury was at the lesser end of severity of what is, in any case, a severe event.  The parents accept that the likely mechanism causing the subdural haemorrhages was S being shaken and the blood vessels in the brain being ruptured by the forces of acceleration and deceleration that shaking brings.  It is also agreed by the medical professionals and the parents, and I accept, that it is impossible to date the rib fracture with precision, but its positioning is consistent with someone holding S tightly around her chest, and that the probability is that the rib fracture occurred at the same time as S was being shaken, so as to cause her brain injury. </p>

The parents have, respectively, had the benefit of the expertise of Mr Tyler QC for the mother and Mr Bickler QC for the father, and they have both argued their client&#8217;s cases with great skill.  The local authority have been represented by Mr Hargan and Ms Hildyard with conspicuous fairness, and they have provided me with exemplary documentation for which I am grateful.

It is highly unlikely that it would happen in the presence of both parents, but it is far more likely to happen when one parent is in sole charge.  I accept that, in theory, the mother would have had the opportunity, for example when the father was putting the kettle on, but it would require a very sudden loss of control which is a far less likely scenario than a response to a build-up of tension over a period of time and then a sudden loss of such control; and </p>

This was the first time that the father had ever been left in sole charge of S for any length of time.  He was faced with a very challenging task, including having to provide her with suction and oxygen on a number of occasions, a task which he himself says is much more easily done by two people than done singlehandedly, which is what he was faced with. </p>

He had been suffering with a mouth abscess and had been seriously under the weather earlier in the week.  The father has a large number of convictions or cautions for public order offences, in which violence has been used by him, either towards members of his family, particularly his younger sister, and complete strangers.  He has a history of loss of control.  I accept that he had not given cause for concern of his treatment of S before and I have no doubt that he loved her dearly, but faced with challenging circumstances, he had little by way of reserves to fall back on. </p>

She has formed a series of disastrous and abusive relationships, but there was nothing in the recent past that I have been told of which might cause alarm bells to ring. </p>

I say that because it is inherently more likely that one parent, having been found to behave in a reprehensible manner on one occasion, would have done so on a second occasion, than both parents would have independently committed the same sort of assault, on one occasion each. </p>

On 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, the day after S&#8217;s admission, the mother twice messaged the father to tell him to make sure that the house did not smell of the weed that he took and that he did not drink.  On 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January she told him that he was heavy-handed towards her (the mother), which led him to respond &#8216;I just hope I haven&#8217;t done it while getting her sick out.&#8217; </p>

The mother says the father was asked to leave and she told the police that, following the scene, she spent the night with her friend, MW.  She says that the father could not have spent the night at her home because he did not have the key. </p>

The father&#8217;s initial denial had included a story, that he now says was false, about him spending that night with his aunt, but that account is shown to be untrue because the call that the father made to the police was made on the landline from the mother&#8217;s home.  The father says that after the row, he went to the mother&#8217;s house.  It was not locked.  He went in and took himself to bed and was subsequently joined by the mother, who returned home late.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.12in">There is no doubt that the father rang the police, saying that he had done it and that he did so from the mother&#8217;s home.  It is hard to take what he said as being anything other than admission that he had carried out the assault on S.  He has not put forward any other sensible explanation.  I accept his evidence that the mother was there.  I do not know why she has lied to the police on it and she has offered no explanation.  I of course understand why the father should want to distance himself from the phone call of admission.  I do not accept that he was saying anything other than the truth because I cannot imagine why he should seek to take the blame for the mother if he felt that she was responsible for S&#8217;s death.  As to the mother, this is another example of her giving an account which is unreliable. </p>

As I have said, I clear the mother from any direct involvement in the causation of S&#8217;s injuries.  I accept that she had no reason to suspect what the father might have done, and I find has done, on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January.  In part, as I have already said, this is because of the failings of the hospitals in the period between 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December and 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January. </p>

First they say no reasonable parent could have delayed calling for medical help for the prolonged period that happened on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January.  It should have been obvious to the mother that S was very ill from the moment that she got back in.  There was a very severe change in S when compared with how she was when the mother went out.  </p>

To delay for what I have found to be a prolonged period, in excess of an hour, a figure that the mother gave, could only have increased S&#8217;s suffering and that caused her significant harm, and on that basis the s.31 threshold is crossed.  As I say, I do not have any clear picture of what was going on in that hour because I have not been given an explanation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.12in">Secondly, the local authority and guardian say that leaving S with a known cannabis user, as the mother plainly did know, was unreasonable parenting.  The mother, in evidence, sought to distance herself from knowledge of the father&#8217;s cannabis-taking in a way that does her no credit.  She said that she was unaware of his taking cannabis, certainly with any frequency, yet on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January she expressly gave him permission by text to use cannabis when he had the care of both R and S.  He says that he smoked cannabis most days and I am sure that the mother knew that.  Her texts on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January further establish her knowledge of his cannabis use; but I am not prepared to find that knowledge of his taking cannabis, in itself, is sufficient to pass the threshold, even in the case of a child like S, who needed exceptionally good parenting.  I have no evidence of the effect of cannabis upon the father, what impact it had on his perception, what strength of cannabis he was taking and so forth. </p>

This tragedy would probably have been avoided if the warning signs were picked up, as they should have been. I do not know the reason why they were not and I hope that there will be a proper investigation.  It may not have helped that scans were taken not only in Wakefield but also in Sheffield and Leeds.  Whether information was shared as it should have been must also be established. </p>
