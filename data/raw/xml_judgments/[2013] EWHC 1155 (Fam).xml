Anything less than a 50/50 threshold would of course, by linguistic definition, mean that it is improbable that the appeal will be allowed and in such circumstances it would be hard to say that any appeal had a real prospect of success; rather, it could only be said as a matter of logic that it had a real prospect of failure&#8221;.</span></p>

It is precisely the same test as that which the courts apply when considering summary judgment: see rule 24.2.  The rationale is the same.  If a claim or defence has no real prospect of success, the court will prevent the litigant from pursuing it.  Likewise, if an appeal has no real prospect of success, the court will prevent the litigant from pursuing it.  The main practical difference is that, for obvious reasons, more appeals are weeded out by this process, than first instance claims or defences&#8221;.</span></p>

The husband is aged approximately 45, and the wife is aged approximately 46.  They have three children, now aged 14, 12 and 6.  Their only substantial capital asset, as found by the District Judge, is the former matrimonial home, which had an agreed value for the purpose of the hearing before the District Judge of &#163;975,000.  It is subject to an interest only mortgage of &#163;600,000, and there were arrears on the mortgage of about &#163;13,000, giving a net equity of approximately &#163;330,000.</span></p>

He proposed that, in return as it might be called, for the wife receiving the entire capital that the parties had accumulated during the marriage, her right to claim maintenance should be dismissed.

The husband conducts his business through a partnership with a Mr. J.   The partnership agreement provides that the profits and losses are to be divided equally between them.  In respect of their drawings, the partnership agreement specifically provides that the amount that each partner may draw during an accounting year should be fixed at the commencement of the year, and neither will be entitled to draw more except by agreement.  It also provides that, at the end of the year, an account will be taken by the partnership accountant so as to determine what, if any, further profits remain to be divided between the partners.  These will be divided equally within a month of that determination, unless they agree otherwise.</span></p>

There is on that point, in addition in my judgment, a reasonable prospect of the husband satisfying a judge on appeal that the District Judge&#8217;s order in respect, in particular, of maintenance is based too heavily on estimates of future income, which may, in fact, turn out not to be achieved.</span></p>

One can see, going forward, why there might be some justification for all the profits not being distributed, having regard to the fact that the husband&#8217;s capital account is overdrawn by &#163;300,000.  But, subject to that, once the accounts are drawn and the profit is identified, both partners are entitled to draw all of their profits.  So it might be more prudent to await the receipt of the accounts for each year before deciding precisely what amount should be awarded.  What I have in mind, and is done in some cases, is that the court identifies an annual amount to be paid during the course of the year and a top-up at the end of the year - although whether that is an order which the judge on appeal, if he/she decides that the appeal is justified, finds attractive is, of course, a matter for him/her, not me.</span></p>
