In February 1996 they began to cohabit in the husband&#8217;s property.  In October 1996 the matrimonial home, was purchased by the husband for &#163;550,000 with a mortgage of &#163;390,000.

In October 2011 the wife issued another petition for divorce with a Form A also being issued in October.  In March 2012 a decree nisi of divorce was pronounced.  On 2 July 2012 Mostyn J., upon the wife having amended her petition for divorce to ask for judicial separation, rescinded the decree nisi and pronounced a decree of judicial separation.  The reasons for this course of events will become apparent in due course.</span></p>

It was a condition of the husband&#8217;s bail, following his arrest in June 2010, that he live apart from the wife and children.  What appears to have triggered the husband&#8217;s behaviour was the onset of frontal lobe dementia.  He was first diagnosed with this condition by Dr S, a consultant neurologist, in September 2010, which he formally confirmed in his report in March 2011.  This diagnosis was confirmed by Dr C a consultant neurologist, in April 2011.</span></p>

(&#8220;DH&#8221;), i.e. 84.6% of the issued share capital.  The balance is held as to 12.4% by Mr R, the managing director of DH and as to 3% by the directors of L Ltd., an Irish company wholly owned by DH.  In the spring of 2012 three offers were received for the shares in DH ranging from about &#163;55m to about &#163;62m.  On 11 July 2012 Heads of Agreement were entered into between DH&#8217;s shareholders and B Ltd. Clause 1 recites that, except for clauses 10-15 inclusive, the Heads of Agreement are not intended to be legally binding.  Clause 3 provides that the entire issued share capital of DH will be sold for &#163;63.75m on &#8220;cash free/debt free&#8221; basis payable in full in cash upon completion.  An exclusivity period of 6 weeks from 11 July was agreed (clause 12), i.e. that the shareholders and DH would not seek to sell the shares to anyone else during that period.  However, clause 12.4 provides that if B Ltd gives notice not to proceed with the transaction the exclusivity period etc. would lapse.  Thus if the sale goes through at a price of &#163;63.75m the husband&#8217;s gross proceeds of sale would be c. &#163;53.9m. What are the net proceeds of sale of the husband&#8217;s shares is hotly disputed.</span></p>

It is agreed that the former matrimonial home, held in joint names of the wife and husband, should be transferred absolutely to the wife.  It is mortgage free and valued at &#163;1.9m.  Net of costs of sale it is worth &#163;1.843m on the wife&#8217;s schedule (Appendix 4 to Ms Bangay&#8217;s opening) and &#163;1.862m on the husband&#8217;s schedule attached to Mr Le Grice&#8217;s position statement.</span></p>

The husband&#8217;s position is that the former matrimonial home should be transferred to the wife and she should be paid a lump sum of &#163;8m provided that the sale of DH to B Ltd is completed.  Completion of the sale should be a condition of the order of the court.  If the condition fails to materialise the order for the lump sum should fall away and the wife&#8217;s claims be adjourned with liberty to restore.  It is recognised that such a fall back position is &#8220;unsatisfactory&#8221;.  However, the prospect of the sale proceeding is sufficiently good to justify the wife&#8217;s claims being heard now rather than in proceedings under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63" uk:canonical="1975 c. 63" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Inheritance (Provision for the Family and Dependants) Act 1975</ref> should the husband die in the near future.</span></p>

She should be paid a lump sum by the husband equivalent to 50% of the net proceeds of sale of the husband&#8217;s shares in DH (having made certain add backs).

The EFRBS can lend money to the company at a commercial rate of interest.  The trustees of the scheme can invest the monies to get the best return for the employee.

His opinion is that DH is worth in excess of &#163;60m and if a sale price of more than &#163;60m with B Ltd cannot be achieved the sale is unlikely to proceed.  However, under a little gentle prodding by me, he said that he would not stick rigidly to &#163;60m.  If the best sale price was &#163;55m, the sale would not proceed. If it was &#163;57m the sale would probably not proceed.  I infer from his evidence that the closer a sale price became to &#163;60m the more likely it was that the sale would proceed.</span></p>

There is no need for me to resolve this issue.  I would expect in the normal course of a commercial transaction there to be some horse trading, after due diligence is completed, as to the figure of &#163;63.75m.  If that figure is knocked down by B Ltd and agreed then the husband&#8217;s net proceeds of sale will be proportionately less, and thus the wife&#8217;s share in them will be proportionately less.

However, I find that there is no contractual basis at all for Cavendish to be paid a bonus fee (put in Mr Le Grice&#8217;s schedule at &#163;200,000).  It will be remembered that the bonus was only due if DH was sold by 1 May 2012.  It was not.  Mr R told me that there are negotiations between DH (and presumably D Foundation) and Cavendish for a bonus to be paid.  But, in my judgment, I find that these negotiations are inchoate.

At all events the district judge&#8217;s failure to despatch the issue by reference to the relevant legal principle, in my view, conferred upon the circuit judge an entitlement, at any rate in principle, to despatch it differently.&#8221;</p>

The First Respondent wished to incentivise the directors of D Ltd to try to achieve his aspirational target value. His shares, which were held in the trust were then sold in six equal tranches to Isle of Man companies owned by Efurbs set up to benefit the individual directors (the Third to Eighth Respondents). </p>

The directors insisted on having a proprietary interest in the shares so that the terms of their incentivisation would be honoured.  In my opinion, they were concerned that the First Respondent might renege on the deal once the value had been achieved and this afforded them some security.

I think this is a disgraceful statement to make and totally lacking in understanding of the commercial realities facing DH. Whilst it is true that the directors stand to be enriched by their agreed incentivisation packages they have been fundamental in raising the value of the business from approximately &#163;18 million under the SH valuation to the &#163;63.5 million that has been currently offered for the business.</p>

On 5 May 2011, SH, DH&#8217;s accountants, valued each share at &#163;15.15 at 10 February 2011 based on the year end figures of 2009 and on 24 January 2012 they valued each share at &#163;21.12 giving a total valuation of c.&#163;18m based on year end figures  of 2010.  Thus it is said that in late 2010 DH was worth c. &#163;18m.  However, it will be remembered that the husband at that time made an initial payment of &#163;500,000 to Mr R on account of the intended purchase of his minority shareholding which Mr R had valued in 2010 at &#163;5m.  Ignoring any discount for a minority stake, that would have valued DH at &#163;42m in 2010.  It is thus very difficult to reconcile SH&#8217;s valuation with the reality of DH&#8217;s value in 2010 as shown by the valuation the husband and Mr R put upon the latter&#8217;s (minority) holding at that time. </span></p>

Historically they compare favourably with previous years but they do not suggest, in my judgment, an increase in value from a base of &#163;18m in 2010 to a figure of &#163;63.75m in 2012.

The letter was plainly an ex post facto attempt at justifying the excess.  No document preceding or contemporaneous with the Side Letters setting out how the excess was arrived at has ever been produced.  In the light of Mr R&#8217;s evidence, I am satisfied there never was any such document created by Mr R or anyone else at the time.  Thus at the time, the excess must have been a figure plucked out of the air, probably by Mr R.

Clause 9.1 provided D Foundation, the charge, with rights in respect of the shares which, I am satisfied, gave D Foundation a power to sell the shares at any time and that had D Foundation exercised those rights there is nothing that the IOM companies/directors could have done to prevent it and the directors&#8217; security of employment might well have been at risk from the new owner of DH.  Thus, it would seem that D Foundation &#8211; effectively the husband &#8211; had no commercial need to incentivise the directors to a sale prior to 3 years from the PCOA completion date.

The nub is that the Side Letters were agreed.  No fraud or dishonesty is alleged.  Even if there may have been a breach of trust under the POAs such breach does not disentitle the directors to the benefits under the Side Letters.  Mr M said that the Side Letters were as a result of negotiations.  The directors had a powerful hand.  Unless they were offered terms encouraging them to sell DH for the best possible price they could walk.  The lack of a link between the benefits under the Side Letters being dependent upon DH reaching a certain sale price was not as odd as it seems because Mr R will not allow DH to be sold if he considers the price unacceptable.  The husband&#8217;s decision in the autumn of 2011 to sell DH was the right decision and as quickly as possible.  The commercial reality was that the directors were essential to the sale and had to be kept on side.  Thus, Mr T, as litigation friend, cannot be criticised for permitting the payments under the Side Letters to be made if and when DH is sold to B Ltd.</span></p>

Thus at this point the husband&#8217;s net proceeds will amount to roughly &#163;40m if a higher figure of &#163;13m is taken for CGT.  From that must be deducted &#163;3.25 in payments to the directors and a figure of c. &#163;1.275m which Mr Bangay accepted during Mr Le Grice&#8217;s closing submissions as a proper deduction representing the likely premium payable by the husband as a warranty insurance premium.</span></p>

First, the husband&#8217;s legal costs of c.&#163;450,000 in defending unsuccessfully the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.37</ref> proceedings.  In my judgment the husband was entitled to legal representation and there is no dispute that a sum of that magnitude was spent by the husband in that regard.  I cannot see that this item amounts to dissipation and/or it seems to me that reattribution would, given the husband&#8217;s incapacity and that Mr T not being able to take </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">any</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> instructions from him, be unfair.

These alleged liabilities did not appear either in the husband&#8217;s Form E or in Mr T&#8217;s statement and no evidence at all was placed before me in this regard.

Both parties agree that this case is a sharing not a needs case.  Ms Bangay submitted that the matrimonial assets should be split equally.  Mr Le Grice submitted that a departure from equality is the fair outcome on account of the husband&#8217;s pre-marital acquest.  Mr Le Grice submitted that this case is clearly not a 50/50 case.  D Ltd was an established business as at February 1996, the date of the start of cohabitation, which, it was accepted by him, moved seamlessly into marriage.  The wife herself gave evidence that it was then a good and successful business.  Mr Le Grice relied on the evidence of Mr R that the purchase of L Ltd in 1992/93 made a huge difference to D Ltd and was for that business a &#8220;life changing&#8221; event.

In his opening statement he submitted that the share sale of &#163;63.75m could be used to reach a broad assessment of D Ltd&#8217;s value at the time of the marriage.  The EBIT of the years ended August 2009, 2010 and 2011 are taken and weighted average applied which produces a price earnings ratio of 3.19.  Taking weighted averages of the EBIT for the years 1996, 1997 and 1998 produces a figure of &#163;7,448,638 which when multiplied by 3.19 produces a value of &#163;23,761,155.   The husband&#8217;s shareholding (taken at a rough 85%) produces &#163;54m as of now, and &#163;20,230,000 as at 1998 which if adjusted for inflation comes to &#163;29,881,000.  The &#8220;marital share&#8221; is therefore &#163;54m less &#163;29,881,000 i.e. &#163;24,260,000 of which half comes to &#163;12,200,000. </span></p>

It was the bedrock on which this marriage was founded.  As against that are the undoubted facts that the marriage was long and the monies were well and truly mingled with marital funds, signifying an acceptance by H that to a great extent the monies, or at least their growth or earnings, would be shared with (or to use the words of the marriage service &#8216;endowed on) W.  I have concluded that &#163;1,000,000 should be excluded.  This satisfies the justice of the sharing principle, and as I will show below, the residual sum will meet W&#8217;s needs.  Any greater excluded sum would not permit W&#8217;s needs to be reasonably met.  But for this factor I would have excluded more.  If W&#8217;s needs suddenly had come to be met or had disappeared by virtue of an unexpected event, such as a windfall, remarriage to a rich man, or death (as happened in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Smith (decd), Smith v Smith</span> [1991] FCR 791, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1991] 2 All ER 306" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1991">[1991] 2 All ER 306</ref> then I would have excluded &#163;2.116m being the actual value of H&#8217;s pre-marital wealth, for the same reasons as I stated in <span style="font-style:italic">FZ v SZ (Ancillary relief: Conduct: Valuations) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] 1 FLR 64" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] 1 FLR 64</ref>.&#8221;</p>

The parties separated not because the parties&#8217; relationship had broken down, but because of the nature of the husband&#8217;s illness leading to inappropriate behaviour.  Social workers, the wife told me in evidence, which I accept, told her in 2010 on three occasions that if the husband returned to the matrimonial home the children could be taken into care.

Mr Le Grice&#8217;s ingenious argument is not only highly arbitrary, indeed artificial, but also it does not chime with what the husband considered was the value of his business interests in 1998.  I, of course, accept that there was then no professional valuation of his shareholding. But the husband was a very shrewd and intelligent person.  In 1998 he sought to protect his wealth by way of a pre-nuptial agreement.  I am satisfied that he most certainly would not have undervalued his business interests, namely his shareholding, because he would have wanted to protect as much as he could.  He put a value of &#163;4m upon his shareholding.  Why, it may be asked rhetorically, should he now, through his litigation friend and legal advisers, resile from that figure?  Had he been able to give evidence to me I am satisfied that, if he had sought to resile from that figure, he could have given no sensible reason for so doing or, at the least, to any significant extent.  To put it bluntly, the husband made his bed in 1998 and must lie on it now.  However, I consider I must allow for some passive growth and inflation.  Wilson LJ in </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Jones</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> was fortunate in being able to calculate passive growth by virtue of an index.  I have no such index.  Thus I must do the best I can.  I propose that an uplift of &#163;4m, to include inflation, would meet the justice of the case, thus bringing the value of the husband&#8217;s shareholding in 1996 to &#163;8m in today&#8217;s money.</span></p>

Half of &#163;30m is &#163;15m which comes out at just under 40% of &#163;38m.  I consider that in all the circumstances of the case, that 40% is a fair and just share of all net assets of the parties.  I am satisfied that that will amply cover the wife&#8217;s income needs, whether assessed as she would have them or reduced.  The value of the former matrimonial home must be included in the share of 40%.</span></p>

He is likely to require highly skilled and therefore expensive nursing in the near future replacing the present system of carers.  But the husband will have ample means to live off to ensure that he receives the best nursing care for the rest of his limited life span.  If from the net assets of &#163;38m a likely figure of &#163;15m is payable to the wife (including the value of the former matrimonial home) and if he pays &#163;4.55m to the directors and &#163;3.49m to the Irish directors, he will still have remaining &#163;14.96m. In the light of these figures it is unnecessary for me to determine whether the husband&#8217;s consultancy agreement will continue.</span></p>

Mr Le Grice on behalf of the husband, submitted that the proper order was that the husband should pay the school fees of the children and periodical payments per child of &#163;15,000 p.a.  By order dated 5 July 2012, Mostyn J. sitting in the Court of Protection made an interim declaration order that &#8220;in the present circumstances&#8221; it was in the husband&#8217;s best interests for a statutory will to be executed &#8220;as an interim measure&#8221; in accordance with the draft annexed to Mr T&#8217;s statement dated 4 July 2012.  It was executed, in fact, by the husband as well as by Mr T, on 5 July 2012.  There is a nil rate band discretionary trust.  The residue of the husband&#8217;s estate is left to pay the wife the income during her lifetime and thereafter to the beneficiaries as defined by clause 6.4.4. upon a discretionary trust.    By a letter of wishes of even date, the husband set out in clause 4 how he would wish his estate to be allocated in the long run, namely, for each of the children and W18%, for W&#8217;s children 10%, 8% for E, 6% for the husband&#8217;s other brother, F, and 1% each for a club, a charity, a nephew and a niece.  He wished his children, including W, to be given first priority if interests under the residuary estate were to be accelerated, but (W apart, who is an adult) the children were young and caution should be exercised so that the funds &#8220;do more good than harm&#8221;.  Care should be taken not to pass capital over too soon in order to encourage the children to &#8220;make their own way and forge their own careers&#8221;.</span></p>

Mr Hagen, the wife&#8217;s junior counsel, told me that there would be serious tax consequences if the beneficiary&#8217;s interest under the proposed trust vested at the age of 25 years.  Under s.32 of the Trustee Act, the trustees could resettle the property but, in his opinion, certainly no later than the age of 20.  If he is correct, which I have no reason to doubt, then any of the children could call for the value of her or his interest at the age of 18 to be paid over, with a possibility (and no more) that that might be extended till 20.  X will be 15 in November.  Thus in a little over 3 years time she could be entitled to have paid over to her the value of her interest, i.e. &#163;2m which will either increase or decrease over the next 3 years, but in any event a very large sum.  Y is now 13, and so in 5 years time she will be able to demand that her interest be paid over.  By contrast, under the statutory will X and Y are most unlikely to receive any part of their &#8220;inheritance&#8221; for a very considerable period of time and probably well after their 18</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> birthdays.</span></p>

Thus I concentrate on para 6 of Counsels&#8217; agreed note.  To the extent that the transfer into the proposed trust was a transfer of value it would be a Potentially Exempt Transfer (&#8220;PET&#8221;) and no IHT would be chargeable upon transfer.  However, such PET would become chargeable in the event of the husband&#8217;s death within 7 years of the transfer.  In the event of the husband&#8217;s death within 3 years of the transfer, the value transferred by the PET would be charged at full death rates, 40%, with the benefit of taper relief at 8% for each year thereafter that the husband survived.  The proposed trust would not be treated as a settlement for IHT purposes.  Consequently there would be no &#8220;relevant property&#8221; charges to IHT purposes whilst held by the trustees and no exit charges when distributed to each child on her or his 18</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> birthday.

It was agreed that if following argument and without collusion the court determined that a particular amount or value was required to be paid or transferred by the husband into the proposed trust, then HMRC would be unlikely to treat the provision as being a &#8220;transfer of value&#8221;.  Mr Goodfellow, however, expressed considerable scepticism (para 11 of the note and orally) as to whether the level of provision being proposed by the wife - &#163;2m for each child &#8211; could realistically be ordered by the court pursuant to its powers under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref>.  Such a level of provision, bearing in mind their different ages and their needs, runs a real risk of not being regarded by HMRC for their maintenance, education or training under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/51/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.11</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/51" uk:canonical="1984 c. 51" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">IHTA 1984</ref>.  Thus Mr Goodfellow submitted that in order to obviate that risk, the court should set out why it considered that the amount ordered to be paid by the husband into the trust for the benefit of the children was truly for their maintenance, education or training.  But he said &#163;2m for each child of differing ages, particularly between the oldest child aged nearly 15 and the youngest aged 4 was &#8220;giving the game away&#8221;.  Mr Ewart sought to counter that argument by submitting that it is sufficient for the court to make the order sought by the wife which thus becomes &#8220;a liability imposed by law&#8221;, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/51/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.5</ref>.5(5) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/51" uk:canonical="1984 c. 51" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">IHTA 1984</ref> and can be made for no consideration and still escape IHT.

Their school fees and such periodical payments as I may think appropriate will be met by the husband from his ample resources even after satisfaction of the wife&#8217;s award.   Furthermore, it is most unlikely that the husband will survive for 7 years following any order for lump sums and thus IHT will be incurred, which Mr Goodfellow told me (without dissent by Mr Ewart) will be a liability of  the husband&#8217;s personal representatives and of the children.</span></p>

Distilling her arguments in paras 71 to 82 of her final submissions, her principal points are these.  The sale may take longer than Mr R optimistically anticipates.  The wife has been advised that the sale may take much longer and Ms Bangay therefore submitted a deadline of 1 December 2012.  The husband may die at any time and the evidence, particularly E&#8217;s, is that he has deteriorated significantly in the past 6 months.  Were he to die, her only remedy would be to challenge the provision made for her under the statutory will by way of an application under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63" uk:canonical="1975 c. 63" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975</ref>.

The Court of Protection proceedings are continuing, the statutory will is an interim measure and it will be critical for that court to know the decision in the instant proceedings before a final statutory will can be authorised.

If a sale does not proceed any lump sum awarded on the basis of the sale to B Ltd proceeding will not prove to be the right figure.  That is because DH has reached a summit in development and in the future the value of DH is likely to decline and not increase.  Finally, he drew my attention to DH&#8217;s Articles of Association and in particular clause 6 which prohibits the sale or transfer of shares unless and until the rights of pre-emption conferred shall have been exhausted.  Notice of any transfer must be given in writing to DH.  The other shareholders are then given the opportunity to buy the shares which the proposed transferor wishes to transfer.

As Ms Bangay said, it is in her interest that DH thrives in anticipation of a future sale.  If DH in the future sells for a figure less than that offered by B Ltd the wife will receive the value of the shares transferred to her, no more and no less.  That is the risk she takes.  There will be no top up.  As for the argument based on the Articles of Association and although DH are not a party to these proceedings, I do not see how clause 6 is an absolute bar to the court exercising its statutory discretion under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/24" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.24</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref>.
