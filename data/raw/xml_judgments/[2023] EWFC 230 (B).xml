Cafcass confirmed via police checks that father had convictions, some of which were in a domestic setting.   In addition, children&#8217;s services were aware of harassment in 2019 and breaches of a restraining order in mother&#8217;s favour; and mother said in her interview that she was subjected to domestic abuse during and after her relationship with the father. She said that the majority of this was coercive control but that on one occasion he attempted to force her to have sexual intercourse with him. She described some other incidents to the Cafcass officer during that interview which are recorded in the safeguarding letter.</span></p>

Both parties participated fully in the preparation of that report, and in addition to the differing accounts as to their relationship, mother was concerned that father did not know about or how to manage the child&#8217;s additional health needs and suspected that his motivation for his application was to continue to abuse on mother and not to have a committed relationship with his child.  Father was not kept informed about the child&#8217;s needs and considered that he was ostracised from being involved.  Father was not named on the birth certificate.</span></p>

The mark had an arc consistent with the bed being lifted up and over at the side.  She had independently supported her evidence with text messages, police disclosure and calling her daughter to give evidence.  Her account was internally and externally consistent.

However, I was satisfied on the evidence that in 2016 mother had put her legs to her chest to prevent father having sexual intercourse with her and that she had pushed father off her.  I was also satisfied that in 2015 that she had previously intimated to father that she was not ready for sexual intercourse after her miscarriage and that father had sought to hasten her willingness to engage in intimacy.  Her body language and actions were that of a woman who was very upset about having sexual intercourse.   Father believed that she should have been ready and so continued to have sexual intercourse with her despite her outward presentation and previous indication of not being ready.</span></p>

I will also order hair strand testing for six months (or for as long a period that hair samples will allow up to six months) regarding father&#8217;s alcohol and cocaine use.  I have already outlined to father that he must not cut or dye his hair and a failure to engage fully in hair strand testing will result in a deemed finding that he chronically uses alcohol and has a significant cocaine problem.  I warn him that such a finding in default will heavily weigh upon the recommendations made by Cafcass. The cost of the hair strand testing will be borne equally by the parties and is essential to the just resolution of father&#8217;s application.  I ask mother&#8217;s solicitors to assist with finding an approved tester and ascertaining a quotation for the testing.  That test must be done by the end of August 2023, (i.e. father must provide his hair samples to the tester within that timeframe).</span></p>
