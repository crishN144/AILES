Dr Proudman also argues that the SSHD has no continuing role in this case and therefore should not be allowed to continue to intervene. </p>

The Applicant arrived in the UK on 7 November 2017 on a visit visa valid for 2 years. She gave birth to a son on 17 January 2018 and applied for asylum the following day. Her application was refused on 9 August 2018 and she appealed to the First Tier Tribunal (FTT). Her asylum application was principally based on an alleged fear that she would be at risk in Nigeria because she had had an affair and her husband (the First Respondent) would refuse to accept her back and her mother-in-law (the Second Respondent) would harm her if she returned. The FTT rejected her appeal, in part because her husband had applied with her for a visa when she was pregnant. There were a number of adverse credibility findings made against her. On 17 January 2019 the Applicant again applied for asylum and this was again refused. </p>

In August 2019 the Applicant made further representations to the SSHD which were refused on 22 January 2020 on the basis that the documents produced by the Applicant were not believed. The Applicant could have challenged that refusal by way of judicial review but did not do so.  </p>

In the first statement she explains that she was subject to FGM when she was 5 years old. She says that her sister died as a result of FGM. She sets out the relationship with her husband&#8217;s family and that the Second Respondent is strongly in favour of FGM. She says that when her husband came to the UK and gave her the two children he also gave her two letters from his family asking him to return EO to them so that she could be circumcised. Her husband told her he was not comfortable with EO being circumcised and thought that the children would be safe with her. She said that she did not trust her husband in this regard and he might change his mind if EO was returned to Nigeria.  </p>

Further, she says that when she was living with her husband&#8217;s family she arranged for EO to be removed from that family and placed with her family who were opposed to FGM.  </p>

The Applicant had apparently initially approached the London Borough of Redbridge, where she at that time lived, and the specialist FGM social worker had advised her to seek an FGMPO. That social worker is no longer working for Redbridge and that authority have taken no further steps. </p>

Even if the evidence presented to the court and the tribunal is the same (at least on the FGM issue) and even if on that issue their different methods of risk evaluation might benefit the appellant (about which we express no concluded opinion), the context and nature of the decision-making process is materially different.  A child or young person in proceedings in the family court for a FGM protection order will be separately represented. She will have her own voice.  That is not the case in the tribunal in a case like this where a young person is not making her own asylum application but, like A, is the dependent of an adult who is.  As we have remarked, whether a person&#8217;s interests are a primary or paramount consideration can and sometimes does lead to a different decision on the same facts.  Furthermore, the assessments of risk being conducted are different.  That is not a question of proportionality, but rather is a reflection of the different focus and function of the statutory schemes.  </span></p>

We do not consider that the Secretary of State has established that the differences between these two methods of evaluation supports her appeal </span></p>

There is no need to add any gloss to that test.  The application of the Rules in the context of the legislation already provides a solution to any asserted tendency not to have regard to what other courts or tribunals may have said on what may be a related issue.  </span></p>

The family court has a duty by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/31" uk:canonical="2003 c. 31" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FGMA 2003</ref>, Schedule 2, paragraph 1(2) to 'have regard to all the circumstances' and, to discharge that duty, the court must consider all the relevant available evidence before deciding any facts on the balance of probability and then moving on to assess the risk and the need for an FGM protection order. Although the family court will necessarily take note of any FTT risk assessment, the exercise undertaken by a FTT is not a compatible process with that required in the family court. It is not therefore possible for an FTT assessment to be taken as the starting point or default position in the family court. The family court has a duty to form its own assessment, unencumbered by having to afford priority or precedence to the outcome of a similarly labelled, but materially different, process in the immigration jurisdiction. </span></p>

That was the reconsideration of a case concerning an application for a worldwide travel ban on the mother taking the child to visit the Egyptian father. The application had been brought by the local authority which was concerned as to the risk of the mother taking the child to Egypt and the child then being subject to FGM. An expert on the risk of FGM in Egypt had been appointed and Cobb J carried out a detailed investigation of the risk both in terms of Egypt generally and the family in particular which he described as the macro and micro factors, see [91] onwards. There are at least two important distinctions between <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re X</span> and the present case. Firstly, the local authority was the applicant for the order having become very concerned about the risk to the child. Secondly, the judge (originally Russell J and then Cobb J) heard evidence from the father and the nature of the risk was that the mother was travelling to Egypt to see the father and his family who were considered to create the risk. It was not clear the degree to which the mother could, or would, seek to protect the child from the risk if she was in Egypt. </p>

In my view this would not be an appropriate course. There will be cases under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/31" uk:canonical="2003 c. 31" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003</ref> where the nature of the risk is sufficiently clear that it is appropriate to make an order on the written evidence alone, but that will be a matter for the judge taking into account factors such as the imminence of the risk.  However, in this case there is virtually no risk whilst EO remains in the UK and in the Applicant&#8217;s care. The Respondents are in Nigeria with no evidence they intend to come to the UK. If they did come to the UK there is virtually no risk that they would be able to take EO back to Nigeria without the Applicant stopping them.  Further, the assessment of the risk of FGM here turns very largely if not wholly on the Applicant&#8217;s evidence as to the likely conduct of the Father&#8217;s family and her ability to protect EO. In those circumstances it appears to me to be wholly inappropriate to grant an FGMPO without hearing oral evidence from the Applicant and the court being able to test that evidence.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">I note Dr Proudman&#8217;s argument that there is no harm in granting such an order and it would merely serve to protect EO if she returns to Nigeria because it could be lodged with the Nigerian court. However, firstly, in my view, it would be wrong to grant an order such as this without the court being satisfied that there is some risk. Cobb J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re X</span> at paras 28 onwards has set out the law in a comprehensive and thorough way and I will not repeat that analysis. What emerges is that the Court must <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;take measures within the scope of the court&#8217;s powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid the risk of FGM where that risk is real and immediate&#8221;, </span>see [28] and the reference to the ECHR law referred to therein. Therefore, if the evidence does not reach a threshold of showing <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;a real risk&#8221;</span> then an order should not be granted. Dr Proudman points out that Cobb J also referred in that case to the fact that even if the risk was relatively modest it might still be appropriate to grant an FGMPO given the level of impact on the child.  In my judgement, without hearing the oral evidence I cannot determine whether the case reaches the appropriate threshold. I make clear that I am not at this stage of proceedings considering the level of risk that is required to be shown at a final hearing, but merely considering whether it is appropriate to make an order at an interim stage on the basis of the evidence that is currently before me.  </p>

The Applicant also says that her concern is protect her daughter from FGMPO. This is in itself perfectly legitimate. However, it does mean that the court should not simply make such an order because it does no &#8220;harm&#8221; and might theoretically protect the child if there was a risk. An FGMPO is an important legal order and should not be granted unless the court is satisfied that there is an evidential basis for doing so.  </p>

Indeed, it is quite common for FGMPOs to be made where the child does not have a Guardian appointed. However, she argues that the child has a standpoint or interest which is inconsistent with, or incapable of being represented by, the Applicant.

Newton J found that the mother would be isolated and unsupported in Sudan and there was reason to believe she would be unable to protect the child. Both sides of the family had actively endeavoured to place pressure on the family to carry out FGM.

She has not suggested that FGM is so prevalent in Nigeria or in southern Nigeria/Lagos where she was living that it is the simple return to Nigeria which poses the risk. Her case is that the risk is posed by the Father&#8217;s family as set out in the emails I have referred to above. That is a matter of assessing the evidence that she has produced and her oral evidence. If the court accepts her evidence then the order may well be made, if her evidence is not accepted then the child has no separate interest or case to be advanced. Dr Proudman argued that it is important that the child is not disadvantaged by the taint that exists on the Applicant&#8217;s credibility. However, on the facts of this case, the Applicant&#8217;s credibility is central to the existence or otherwise of the risk. In that sense it is different from <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re A</span> where there was strong reason to believe the risk existed quite independently of the credibility of the mother.  It is clear in the light of the Suffolk County Council case that in assessing the Applicant&#8217;s credibility the Family Court must consider the matter for itself and not simply adopt or follow the view of the FTT. For the avoidance of doubt, I make absolutely clear that the Family Court must address the Applicant&#8217;s credibility wholly independently from the findings of the FTT. </p>

But the child&#8217;s wishes cannot be in the slightest doubt, she wishes to be protected against FGM, so this is not a situation where a Guardian is needed to ascertain the child&#8217;s wishes and feelings.  The child is 10 years old and allowing her to have a separate voice in the sense of a Guardian expressing her view to the court is of limited value here because whatever understanding she has of FGM the Court will plainly seek to protect her from it. It might be said that there is a role for the Guardian in the process of the litigation but, in my view, that does not stand up to scrutiny. In terms of evidence of risk, that evidence will come from the Applicant. The Respondents have refused to participate in the proceedings, so the only cross examination will be of the Applicant not of the people alleged to create the risk.

Dr Proudman&#8217;s skeleton argument says she is needed to &#8220;assess the complex dynamics of macro and micro risk factors.&#8221; As I have explained above, the Applicant&#8217;s case for an FGMPO is based on the risk posed by her husband&#8217;s family. That is the risk asserted and, in my view, it is important to keep that focused case closely in mind. It is not being asserted that the risk of FGM in Lagos is so great as it will be impossible for the Applicant to keep EO safe, it is a much more focused case. When the Mother lived in Lagos she says that she did arrange for the removal of EO from the Father&#8217;s family in order to protect her, but alleges that her family were then attacked by the Father&#8217;s family trying to locate the child. The evidence that there is any risk to EO in the UK is exceptionally limited. Further, this is not a case where an independent social worker could interview other family members to ascertain their views and the risks they have posed. The husband&#8217;s family have made it entirely clear that they will not participate in the proceedings. Equally, there is no benefit in the social worker ascertaining the child&#8217;s views given that she is not of an age to have any detailed understanding of the issue and the court would seek to protect her whatever her view of FGM.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">Dr Proudman suggested the social worker would have a role in teaching the child strategies to protect herself from FGM in the future. Although there is doubtless benefit in any girl living in a country where FGM is practised to understand such strategies, that cannot be a reason to instruct an expert in proceedings such as this.  </p>

This is another key distinction from the other cases relied upon where an independent body with a safeguarding role had thought it appropriate to bring the matter to court.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">In those circumstances I do not accept that there will be any gap in the evidence if there is no independent social worker evidence. It is important to take a proportionate approach to this litigation and not allow this case to absorb a disproportionate amount of both court and legal aid resources.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">FGM in Nigeria. Home Office Country Information Notes are produced for the purposes of immigration control, however in practice here it is going to cover many of the same evidential issues as would be set out by the expert, namely the level of risk in a particular place and within potentially different parts of the relevant communities. In many cases there will be a place for expert evidence on specific risk, as is shown by <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re A</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re X.</span> This might be particularly the case where there are issues about the very specific nature of the risk. However, here as I have said, the Applicant&#8217;s case is very focused, it is that the First Respondent&#8217;s family intend to carry out FGM by reason of threats they have issued. If the Applicant&#8217;s case on this is not accepted then it is not being argued that the generic risk of FGM in Lagos/southern Nigeria is such that an FGMPO would be appropriate. Even if that becomes the case the crucial issue will be whether the Mother could act to protect the child, which again turns on her own evidence.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">In my view, on the facts of this case, it is not necessary within FPR 25 to appoint an expert. The SSHD has produced a country policy and information note on FGM in Nigeria which is detailed and recent (August 2019) and refers to an independent report by UNICEF which itself has carried out investigations into FGM in Nigeria. The UNICEF report is extensively relied upon in the Country Information Note and sets out figures on prevalence of FGM including specifically in southern Nigeria. That material is sufficient for the court to consider any wider risk of FGM beyond that being put forward on the specific facts of the case. In practice it is highly likely to be the case that there would be no contest on the level of generic risk and the case will turn on the family specific evidence of the Applicant. In those circumstances it is not proportionate to require expert evidence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">In my view a psychiatric assessment is not necessary to determine this case fairly. As I have said, the case turns on the court&#8217;s assessment of risk of FGM and that turns largely if not wholly, on the Applicant&#8217;s evidence. The court does not need evidence as to psychiatric impact of FGM either on the Mother or on the child because as the case is being put that does not go to the risk. The Applicant has been clear that she wishes to protect the child from FGM and will seek to do so in Nigeria. If the court does not accept the Applicant&#8217;s evidence on the nature of the risk from the Father&#8217;s family then that is very likely to be determinative of the case. If the court does accept her evidence then that is equally likely to be determinative.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">I also note that the Applicant had not previously suggested that her mental state is such that she will not be able to protect the child. Her case has focused entirely on the risk posed by the Father&#8217;s family. Dr Proudman now argues that the Applicant&#8217;s mental health will make her unable to protect the child in Nigeria. She says that a psychiatric assessment is needed in order to give the court information on whether any mental health diagnosis will impact on her ability to protect the child. However, as I have already explained, as I understand the Applicant&#8217;s case her mental health is unlikely to be a determinative issue.  </p>
