	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I heard oral evidence from KD, a senior social worker with the Applicant Local Authority, and from Dr Lisa Rippon, Consultant Developmental Psychiatrist. By the time of closing submissions the parties were agreed that CLF lacks capacity to conduct the proceedings and to make decisions about her care, contact with others, and the use of the internet and social media. Mr Karim KC on behalf of the Local Authority submitted that CLF lacks capacity to make decisions about residence but Mr O&#8217;Brien KC for CLF submitted that whilst she lacks capacity to make decisions about her residence in a general sense, she has capacity when presented with concrete choices about where to live, provided that the care arrangements in those places have been determined for her and meet her needs. All parties agreed that CLF lacks capacity to make decisions about the use of contraception but Mr O&#8217;Brien KC submitted that any declaration to that effect should be made on an interim basis only because CLF may gain capacity in that area of decision making after focused educational work. As to capacity to engage in sexual relations, the Local Authority and First Respondent agreed that she has capacity, but Mr Copnall submitted that she does not. JT largely aligned herself with the submissions made by Mr Copnall.</p>

Her mother suffered recurrent bouts of mental illness. In August 2008 a Residence Order was made in favour of JT but the relationship between CLF and her grandmother was very difficult as CLF responded violently when JT attempted to set boundaries in relation to her use of social media. In February 2020 CLF was made subject to a child protection plan and shortly afterwards she was moved from JT&#8217;s care to a placement. Proceedings in the Court of Protection were issued in March 2020 and interim declarations of lack of capacity and best interests were made. The Official Solicitor accepted an invitation to act as litigation friend for CLF. </p>

This is a more restrictive environment than CLF had when in supported living accommodation She has settled in very well and has one to one support at all times. Assessment will usually take about twelve weeks and this is not a long term placement. KD told the court that her visits to CLF usually trigger some form of dysregulation because of the nature of the discussions that she has to have with her. CLF will put her hands over her head and shut down, alternatively she will go into another room, scream, slam the door, and sometimes damage property. Clear and consistent boundaries and a lot of activities, work well to minimise these episodes. KD was able to point to a &#8220;formulation meeting&#8221; in May 2023 at which an attempt was made to identify the triggers for CLF&#8217;s bouts of dysregulated behaviour when her thoughts and emotions would overwhelm her. She could not identify any follow up work or further meetings at which any care or management plan was developed. It is very difficult to engage CLF in any such planning.</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;At interview, CLF could describe where she is living including the address, what is available in the local area, the support she receives from staff and she understands that she is living there permanently rather than visiting.  At the time of my interview, CLF told me that she has not been made aware of any other residences which are available to her and she is happy remaining in her current provision.  Without a concrete alternative, it was difficult to get CLF to compare and contrast her current residence with another potential placement. As I will outline later in my report, I believe that she continues to lack capacity to make decisions around her care and support needs.  If CLF was given the option of looking at two residences with the same type of support, she would be able to weigh-up the positives and negatives of both and would have capacity in this area.  However, I do not believe that CLF would have capacity to decide to move into an environment with a level of support which did not meet her needs.   In my opinion, the difficulties which CLF has with this are secondary to her Learning Disability and Autism Spectrum.&#8221;</p>

She was able to explain the need for consent to sexual relations. I note that CLF has reported an alleged rape.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;At interview, CLF could name different forms of contraception, including condoms, implants, depo, oral contraceptive pill and coil and understood an explanation as to how these are used.  However, in my opinion, CLF did not understand the side-effects and could not provide any benefits of using contraception.  She continued to express the belief that, if she used some forms of contraception, she would not become pregnant, despite being told this was not the case.   CLF believes that withdrawal is an effective form of contraception, despite being told that this was not the case. It is my view that CLF did not understand the relevant information and could not weigh-up the positives and negatives of using contraception.

She did not understand the risks of pregnancy from this method. This was not a question of CLF making an unwise decision, but rather that she could not understand and weigh or use information relevant to decisions about contraception. Furthermore, CLF believed that contraceptive medication made you infertile so that you could never conceive a child after using them. I note evidence that CLF has previously had a contraceptive implant which she reported had been removed. I understand her belief about infertility relates to medication. According to Dr Rippon, this belief too is due to her inability to understand relevant information. In each case her functional inabilities were due to her Learning Disability and Autism Spectrum Disorder.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;[63] At the heart of the Local Authority&#8217;s appeal against Cobb J&#8217;s decision that B has capacity to make decisions in relation to residence is the criticism that the Judge failed to take into account information which, in accordance with the MCA <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/3/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.3(1)</ref> and (4), it was necessary for B to be able to understand, to retain and to use or weigh as part of the process of making a decision, including the reasonably foreseeable consequences of deciding one way or another or failing to make the decision. The Local Authority says that the Judge&#8217;s conclusion on B&#8217;s capacity to make decisions on residence, in particular whether to move to Mr C&#8217;s property or to remain at her parents&#8217; home or to move into residential care, was fundamentally flawed in (1) failing to take into account relevant information relating to the consequences of each of those decisions, and (2) producing a situation in which there was an irreconcilable conflict with his conclusion on B&#8217;s incapacity to make other decisions, and so (3) making the Local Authority&#8217;s care for and treatment of B practically impossible. Mr Lock submitted that the Judge&#8217;s flawed conclusion followed from his approach in analysing B&#8217;s capacity in respect of different decisions as self-contained &#8220;silos&#8221; without regard to the overlap between them. &#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[64] We agree with the Local Authority. The point is simply made. We have already drawn attention to the provision in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/3/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3(4)</ref> of the MCA that information relevant to a decision includes information about the reasonably foreseeable consequences of deciding one way or another, and to paragraph 4.16 of Chapter 4 of the Code of Practice, which provides that relevant information includes the likely effects of deciding one way or another or making no decision at all. The Judge stated (at [27] and [28]), however, that the implications of living with a particular person (here, Mr C), and the risks which this posed, were more appropriately considered under decisions on "care" and contact than residence. He further stated that the evidence showed that B did understand in broad terms the care she would receive if she lived with Mr C in contrast to living at home or in residential care, even though he concluded elsewhere in his judgment that B did not have capacity to make decisions about her care. In the circumstances, having observed (at [27]) that Dr Rippon accepted that B had a "basic understanding" in respect of all of the nine areas covered by Theis J's test, the Judge was able to reach his conclusion (in [28]) that the Local Authority had failed to discharge the burden of proving that B did not have capacity.</p>

That conflicted directly with the Judge's conclusion that B had capacity to decide to move to live with Mr C. The point is reinforced by the fact that Cobb J had already granted an interim injunction prohibiting Mr C from having any contact with B. Permitting B to move to live with Mr C would presumably have placed both him and B in contempt of court for breach of the injunction. The question whether B was able to understand those consequences and to use or weigh them in a decision about whether to reside with Mr C was not explored in the judgment.&#8221;</p>

Although in theory the 'reasonably foreseeable consequences' of not taking contraception involve possible conception, a birth and the parenting of a child, there should be some limit in practice on what needs to be envisaged, if only for public policy reasons. I accept the submission that it is unrealistic to require consideration of a woman's ability to foresee the realities of parenthood, or to expect her to be able to envisage the fact-specific demands of caring for a particular child not yet conceived (let alone born) with unpredictable levels of third-party support. I do not think such matters are reasonably foreseeable: or, to borrow an expression from elsewhere, I think they are too remote from the medical issue of contraception. To apply the wider test would be to 'set the bar too high' and would risk a move away from personal autonomy in the direction of social engineering. Further, if one were to admit of a requirement to be able to foresee things beyond a child's birth, then drawing a line on into the child's life would be nigh impossible.</p>

CLF does not have capacity to make decisions about her care but, as I understand Dr Rippon&#8217;s evidence, she can describe her care &#8211; she understands what care is and what kind of care she is receiving. Hence, she could not make a decision about residence if it involved an assessment of the appropriate level of care in each place available for her. But if the provision of care was decided for her, she would be able to understand, retain, and weigh or use the other information relevant to a decision about residence &#8211; see <span style="font-style:italic">LBX</span> at [43] (above). Mr Karim KC for the Local Authority submitted that the court should not accept the distinction that Dr Rippon had adopted but should apply <span style="font-style:italic">LBX</span>, avoid the trap identified in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B</span>, and find that CLF lacks capacity to make decisions about residence. Mr O&#8217;Brien KC, for the Official Solicitor for CLF, submitted that the danger of considering decision-making in silos, as identified in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B</span>, was that it may result in a situation that would be &#8220;practically impossible&#8221; for the Local Authority to implement &#8211; <span style="font-style:italic">Re B</span> at [63] (above). Here, it would not be practically impossible for the Local Authority to make decisions about the care provision CLF requires, make arrangements for that to be put in place at residence A and residence B, and then allow CLF to make a choice about which residence to live in. Where possible, her autonomy should be respected and protected.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is a risk, in my judgement, in dissecting areas of decision-making such that it becomes practically impossible for those caring for P to implement the assessments of capacity made. It would make it difficult for a Local Authority to implement a care plan if it had been determined that P had capacity to make decisions on, for instance, eight aspects of her care, but not on five others. Furthermore, the process of assessing capacity might become unwieldy. However, in this instance, Dr Rippon&#8217;s evidence is that CLF would have capacity to make decisions about her residence but for the element of choosing the right level of care within those places. I can see that if care decisions could be removed from decision-making about residence, then a declaration that CLF had capacity to make decisions about residence provided that the care arrangements for each available residential option were made for her, would not necessarily be incompatible with a declaration that she lacks capacity to make decisions about her care. However, my concern is that the position is more complex than Dr Rippon has assumed. As well as compatibility with the declaration of incapacity to make decisions about care, I also have to consider compatibility with my finding that CLF lacks capacity to make decisions about contact with others and to use the internet and social media. When considering the practical implications of the declaration regarding residence decision-making sought on CLF &#8216;s behalf by the Official Solicitor, I do not see how a declaration of even conditional capacity to make decisions about residence, is compatible with declarations of incapacity that I make. What might seem an attractive solution in theory, could not be possibly to put into practice. Much of the information relevant to a decision about residence, even with a care package determined for her, will be relevant to care, contact with others and the use of th internet and social media. A choice about whether to live in house A or house B will involve information about access to activities and the community which entails questions about risk; about the neighbours and any risks of conflict with them, or harm from them; about the layout of the house or flat, the ability to monitor CLF within the accommodation, including her use of social media and the internet. Care is not simply a &#8220;given&#8221;: the choice of residence will itself determine the level and kind of care required. Similarly, decisions about contact with others will be contingent upon where CLF lives.  Whilst wishing to protect CLF&#8217;s autonomy as much as is possible, I cannot see a way in which to divorce her decision-making about residence from other decision-making in relation to which it is agreed, and I have found, CLF lacks capacity.</p>

Clearly, her views about residence should be sought and she should be supported to be able to express her opinions and take into account relevant information.</p>

There was some concern during the hearing that when or because she is emotionally dysregulated CLF might lack capacity in this area, but it seems to me that there is simply no evidence that she engages in sex when emotionally dysregulated. She may abscond when emotionally dysregulated, and she may have sex with men after she has absconded, but there is no evidence that she becomes overwhelmed and dysregulated and in that state engages in sex when unable to make decisions for herself about whether to do so.</p>

The difficulty with accepting this submission is that there is clear evidence from Dr Rippon that CLF does understand, and can weigh or use, information that pregnancy can result from sex. I also note her recent use of the &#8220;morning after&#8221; pill. CLF&#8217;s understanding about the withdrawal method is relevant to her decision-making capacity in relation to contraception, but it should not be conflated with her capacity to make decisions about engaging in sexual relations. </p>

She understands and can weigh or use the other relevant information identified by Baker LJ and the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">JB</span> (above). On the basis of the evidence before me, including Dr Rippon&#8217;s opinion evidence, I find that CLF has capacity to make decisions about engagement in sexual relations. As explained below, I find that she presently lacks capacity to make decisions about the use of contraception. I do not consider that these two findings are incompatible. The bar should not be set too high for capacity in relation to sex. There are practical limits on what should be envisaged by the individual concerned. There is a danger in imposing requirements on their decision-making that are higher than those attained by many capacitous people making the same decisions. A lack of understanding about a particular method of contraception or birth control, should not deprive a person of being found to have capacity to engage in sexual relations. It is unhelpful to break down decision-making in relation to a particular area, here sexual relations, into sub-divisions such as the decision to engage in sex whilst relying on the man withdrawing before ejaculation to avoid pregnancy. Firstly, that route will often lead to a result that is &#8220;practical impossible&#8221; to manage: how can anyone manage a situation in which a person has capacity to engage in sex using a condom but not have capacity to engage in sex using the withdrawal method? Secondly, many otherwise capacitous individuals might be found to lack capacity to make very specific decisions. Thirdly, and related to the second objection, the more one breaks down an area of decision-making into sub-divisions, the more complex the relevant information within that area becomes, and the more difficult it will be for people with a learning disability or other cognitive impairments, to avoid conclusions that they lack capacity. The <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> directs those assessing capacity to support people to make decisions for themselves. Framing decisions with ever more precision risks undermining that purpose of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have had to consider the practical limitations identified by Lord Stephens in <span style="font-style:italic">JB</span> (above) in relation to decisions to engage in sexual relations in this case and in previous decisions referred to above. It is necessary, first, to consider the relevant information set out by Baker LJ and endorsed by the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">JB</span>. The specific factual context in any particular case may mean that one or more of the entries on that list may not be relevant and that, in rare cases, additional information might be relevant. There are, however, practical limits and the bar must not be set too high. Whilst, in my judgement, serious or grave consequences of pregnancy to which a woman would be particularly vulnerable, might be considered to be part of the relevant information, other consequences of pregnancy, such as common risks or complications of pregnancy will not be included. Nor will information about potential complications for the child after delivery, or about caring for a newborn or growing child. In each case it should be asked whether the decision-making about engagement in sexual relations is person-specific or general.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the present case I conclude that CLF does have capacity to decide to engage in sexual relations. I do not consider that to be inconsistent with the finding that CLF lacks capacity to make decisions about contact with others. I have sought to explain why such findings are not inconsistent in the cases of <span style="font-style:italic">PN </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">EE </span>(above) and I adopt the same reasoning here. When decision making about sexual relations is general, not person-specific, it is not necessarily inconsistent to find that P lacks capacity regarding contact, but has capacity regarding sex.

Any provisions in the plan directed at protecting him and restricting his contact should be seen as interim measures until the time when he acquires skills to make such decisions for himself.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[59] First, a named worker should be identified and tasked with the specific role of overseeing a programme of education and empowerment. That professional should be someone suitably trained and equipped in these matters. He or she should identify all resources available for the assessment of risk and educating persons with limited capacities to identify and assess risk. TZ should be supported in accessing these education programmes and ways should be identified to assess and check the development of his understanding of these issues. At present, this support is provided by GB, a learning disabilities nurse, who has been assisting TZ to develop his social and interpersonal skills. Evidence to date suggests that TZ does respond to education of this type. Dr X thought it might take 4 to 5 years for TZ to acquire capacity by these means, but the local authority believes that this may be unduly pessimistic.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have regard to the relevant information identified by Bodey J in <span style="font-style:italic">A Local Authority v Mrs A and Mr A</span> (above). Dr Rippon&#8217;s evidence is clear that CLF does not understand, and cannot weigh or use, information about different forms of contraception, their effects, side-effects, and effectiveness. This is primarily because she understands that contraception involving medication or a device (not condoms) will render her permanently infertile. Dr Rippon has recorded:</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;However, at interview, she told me that she did not want to use contraception because she believed it would make her infertile.  CLF also believed that it would stop her periods and she wanted to have periods so that she could tell her children what having them was like, so I told her that this was not the case.  I then described different forms of contraception, their potential side-effects, explained that they were generally safe and told CLF that use of a condom also prevents sexually transmitted infections.  However, she continued to tell me that she did not to use contraception because she wanted to have children in the future (perhaps when she was aged twenty-seven or twenty-eight years).&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">CLF also told Dr Rippon that she believed that the withdrawal method was wholly reliable to prevent her from becoming pregnant. I recognise the sensitivity of referring to the withdrawal method as a form of contraception. It might better be described as a form of birth control. I would not accept any argument that faith in the withdrawal method as a form of birth control was in itself proof of a lack of capacity to make decisions about the use of contraception (or birth control). It is practised by many millions of people. However, I accept that in CLF&#8217;s case, she does not understand, and is unable to weigh or use, information about birth control, including the withdrawal method, because of her Learning Disability and Autism Spectrum Disorder. Even if I am wrong, she clearly lacks capacity in that area for the reasons referred to in the previous paragraph of this judgment.</p>
