On 24 January 2006 I made a further order permitting the mother to disclose my two previous orders to BACP. On 13 February 2006 the mother made a complaint to BACP about DS&#8217;s report of 19 September 2006 and, without having obtained permission from the court to do so, sent BACP a copy of the report. This prompted the father to issue an application on 15 March 2006 seeking the mother&#8217;s committal to prison for contempt of court in sending the report to BACP. That application came on for hearing before me on 15 May 2006. I found the mother guilty of contempt, fined her the sum of 50 pence and made no order as to costs. </p>

On 19 January 2006 the mother had applied to vary the contact order; her application was adjourned the same day by Sumner J. There were further hearings before Sumner J on 19 May 2006, 29 August 2006, 15 March 2007 and 30 March 2007. On the latter occasion Sumner J made an amended order for contact, barred both parents from making any further application without the prior consent of the court and gave directions for a further hearing, including a direction that a Cafcass officer was to report by 17 July 2007 on the viability of future contact between N and his father. Sumner J explained his reasons in the judgment he gave on 4 April 2007: <span style="font-style:italic">G v A </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2007/780" uk:canonical="[2007] EWHC 780 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] EWHC 780 (Fam)</ref>. </p>

(I should add that JJ&#8217;s report attaches, as an appendix, a 27 page document sent to her by the father following their first meeting on 4 June 2008 which was also critical of her approach.) The father had also prepared &#8211; seemingly with professional medical assistance &#8211; a 94 page &#8220;Critique&#8221; of Dr CM&#8217;s psychiatric assessment of the mother which questioned the &#8220;professionalism&#8221; of Dr CM&#8217;s work. </p>

This situation cannot be permitted to continue.

At that stage the court will be able to examine whether the parents have been able to modify their behaviour and stop trying to score points against each other and instead to focus on N&#8217;s best interests. If the parents have not been able to demonstrate significant change to their attitude and approach then consideration will have to be given to the involvement of the Local Authority.&#8221;</p>

Indeed, I observed that it might even be appropriate for the order to be expressed in such terms.

She points to N&#8217;s desperate wish for what he calls &#8220;the trouble&#8221; to stop. She observes that the parties agreed the consent order following many days at court and elsewhere, in which it was anticipated that the parties could proceed with getting on with their lives and, more importantly, that N could have a more settled arrangement. She reminds me that the father&#8217;s counsel, Mr James Bogle, stated in court that it was his client&#8217;s wish for the matter to settle. Yet, immediately following the consent order, she says, the father started making applications which suggests that he had and has no intention whatsoever of making &#8220;the trouble&#8221; go away. It is, she says, abundantly clear from the applications, witness statements and other documents filed by the father, that he wishes to re-open the matter. But, she says, he had this opportunity in July 2008, when all the persons with whom he had a grievance were due to come to court, give oral evidence, and be cross- examined. Yet he did not take that opportunity, agreeing instead to settle the matter and, moreover, signing the consent order, and all the time having the benefit of both counsel and Dr Pelling (in whatever capacity he was advising). And what the father is now seeking is not just a modest adjustment of the consent order; he is in fact, she says, seeking a completely new order. </p>

As previously stated, she would not stand in the way of any agreement reached between the parties to vary the order providing the agreement is consistent with N&#8217;s welfare and is a true agreement, and any amendment designed to clarify the original order so as to enhance the parties&#8217; interpretations of the order could well be of benefit.</p>

She does not support the father&#8217;s application for residence, because in her view it is not in N&#8217;s best interests. In particular, she does not consider that the mother&#8217;s proposed plan to purchase a home for herself and N and to live independently justifies the father in seeking to resile from the consent order and reopen the issues in the case by seeking residence. The division of N&#8217;s time between the parents appears to work and she does not support any change unless agreed. She has in mind N&#8217;s oft stated desire for the litigation to come to an end so that he is not the focus of dispute between his parents. In her view, continuing litigation by either parent can only be detrimental to his welfare. There is no benefit to N in continuing litigation. On the contrary, she is clear that his welfare is being damaged by the on-going acrimony and the consequent stress and anxiety that the litigation causes to his parents.</p>

This will give N and his parents a breathing space to focus and concentrate on making the agreed arrangements set out in the consent order work, without the anxiety of ongoing proceedings or the constant stress of the threat of further litigation, and to focus and concentrate on making the time that N spends with each parent as enjoyable and stress free as possible.</p>

With regards to N&#8217;s emotional needs, for the benefit of these parents, I repeat my previous comments that: &#8220;&#8230;if N is to grow up with a sense of security it will be important to ensure that his relationships with the important people in his life are not placed under threat and he receives clear messages to this effect. Children who have to cope with emotional stress are often negatively affected and may not achieve their full social and academic potential&#8217;. Indeed N&#8217;s recent school report show that signs are beginning to emerge that N is being emotionally affected by the behaviour of each of his parents. It will now be important for each of them to fully acknowledge and act upon this.&#8221;</p>

The guardian is very aware that this is one of the triggers for the father&#8217;s application for a sole residence order, being concerned, so he says, that N would be at risk of harm if this were to happen. Her conclusion, having carefully considered the matter, having noted some improvement in the mother&#8217;s behaviour following the conclusion of the hearing in July 2008, and being satisfied with the overall working of the order, is that she would not stand in the way of the mother&#8217;s desire to move by asking her to renew her undertaking. She is aware of the mother&#8217;s not unreasonable desire to lead an independent life and that over time there may be changes in the grandmother&#8217;s circumstances which might necessitate a move.  In the end, she thinks, the only way in which the issue can be considered in detail is for the question to be tested by the mother living with N. </p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Particularly during the build up to the court hearing in July 2008 the mother displayed some very worrying behaviour in court, to Ms JJ, Dr CM and me. I believe that the drawing up of the consent order has since provided her with some re-assurance that N was not going to be removed from her care or her contact with him restricted. I have since observed some improvement in her behaviour. Nonetheless, I acknowledge that there would be an element of risk were the court to agree to Ms G moving into her own accommodation with N but I believe the safeguarding measures identified above are sufficient for this to now be tested out. Perhaps one of the more positive aspects of such a move would likely be that this would lessen N&#8217;s exposure to the difficult dynamics between his mother and the maternal grandfather.&#8221;</p>

I see from the order submitted to the Judge for his approval that, sadly, only a few issues have been resolved. It seems therefore that the court will be asked to make a ruling. I would hope that the order made would leave the original order intact as far as possible to preserve the consent that lay behind the making of that order. </p>

Essentially, he is a child who knows that there is conflict between his parents. He becomes understandably anxious and concerned about the conflict between his parents and it is the responsibility of all involved in this case to try and protect him from this as far as possible. The Court is already aware of my overall view which is that the division of N&#8217;s time as defined in the July 2008 order is broadly right for him. I would want the parents to expend their time and energy now on making the order work, to try to be more flexible with each other and put the proceedings to one side. I know that N would be profoundly grateful if this could happen.&#8221;</p>

It is unfortunate that the father is pursuing the matter of the mother&#8217;s mental health and it is easy to see why this is offensive to her. The father might want to consider how N would ultimately view this. N loves both his parents, they both have different strengths and weaknesses which are part of who he is. It is sad that neither parent seems able to recognise that in each other. There may be times when the other parent will have to grit their teeth to accede to a request but, if what is being asked will benefit N, then each parent should try to be as accommodating as possible for his sake.&#8221;</p>

He asserts that legal rights are affected, for example in regard to testamentary guardians.

She says that the approach which I had indicated at the outset was, in the event, agreed by all parties. She adds that, if the father is really concerned about the position after death, then appropriate provision can be added to the consent order to the effect that, in the event of the death of either parent, then N shall live with the surviving parent, together with appropriate provision for him seeing members of the deceased parent&#8217;s family.</p>

The basis of the consent order, in an attempt to remove unnecessary conflict, and the court accepted that this would be appropriate, was to avoid the use of such emotive words as &#8220;residence&#8221; and &#8220;contact&#8221;.  She does not see that the arrangements now require being labelled as &#8216;joint&#8217; or &#8216;shared&#8217; residence, and is concerned as to why the carefully crafted and agreed consent order should now require such &#8216;clarification.&#8217;</p>

She says that she has told the father that if he gives her those details earlier he can have the passport earlier.

It cannot, she says, be in the best interest of N that his mother may not know where he will be travelling to. And how can N share the anticipation of the holiday if he and his mother do not know where he is going, some three days before departure?

Since the homework arrangements are likely to change at the start of each academic year, and may be subject to change throughout the year, it would be foolish, she suggests, to try to impose strict regulation of the homework. But, she says, the father&#8217;s desire to be involved in the homework set during the week should be recognised. She suggests that the parents take the homework each week in turn, so that any homework set at the beginning of the week is completed one week by the mother and the next week by the father and homework that is set after the father&#8217;s midweek contact should be supervised by the parent with whom N is spending that weekend, unless the homework has to be handed in before the weekend.</p>

She does not agree that the therapist should prepare a report for the court. &#8220;I consider these proceedings should come to an end and I certainly do not think that there should be any direct instruction for any therapy to raise the question of N&#8217;s name.

This applies whether or not the latter parent actually utilises the relevant holiday period to go abroad and whether or not any Clause 19 notification has been given.

She says that she would expect the parents to inform each other as soon as practicable of arrangements they have made for a holiday. This will enable N to share with both parents his anticipation of the holiday and be supported in this anticipation by both of them. He should not be put into the position of worrying about whether or not a planned holiday will in fact take place. She suggests that paragraph 20 be amended as follows: &#8220;The precise arrangements are that the mother shall deliver the child&#8217;s passport to the school, during school term time, not more than 7 days prior to the proposed trip (<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">irrespective of whether the full details of the itinerary have been made available to her</span>).&#8221; She would expect any parent to advise the other of where their child is going to be at any particular time but that neither should have the ability to control how the other spends their holiday with N. She hopes that both parents can respect this by giving each other full details of their plans as soon as possible and that neither should be frustrated in making those plans by concerns about whether or not the passport is going to be made available to them.  She suggests that the rest of paragraph 20 should remain unaltered. </p>

		  <level>
		    <content>
		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The Respondent Mother suffers from Borderline Personality Disorder and this has harmed and continues to harm N. She has emotionally and physically abused N. He has suffered and witnessed domestic violence. She has disrupted his religious education and continues to try to oust the Applicant&#8217;s key involvement in his son&#8217;s secular education by, for example, refusing to share homework supervision. She continues to pervert N&#8217;s name, in breach of the existing Order. She has violated other terms of the Order. She has stolen property of the Applicant which he had provided for N&#8217;s use, and N is aware of this. It is not safe for N to live alone with her, and her own mother has in effect become a substitute parent, which is not satisfactory. The Respondent has applied to the Court to be released from any fetter on her moving from her own mother&#8217;s home, which would put N seriously at risk; she informed the Applicant on 21 April 2009 that she had found the property to which she wished to move. N has now reached the age of 8 and has thus reached that age when it is normally best for a son to be with his father. The Court should be guided by the general principle that a boy [of] this age, is, on the whole, other things being equal, better to be with his father. In this case other things are not equal but only strengthen the case for Residence with the father.&#8221;</p>

In support of these suggested directions, the father says that a risk assessment is a statutory requirement, that given paragraphs 10, 11 and 12 in the &#8220;Upon the basis&#8221; part of the consent order there is undoubtedly cause to suspect that N is at risk of harm if he were to live alone with the mother, and that expert evidence is needed in this case, including in relation directly to the harm suffered by N. The existing evidence from Dr CM, he says, was methodologically flawed and his work was incompetent.</p>

She observes that although his father is correct that this is not in the original order, this was clearly within the spirit of the order and suggests that paragraph 8(c) be amended to add that &#8220;In the alternate year Yom Kippur as a whole shall be spent with the mother.

And this provision, she says, should take precedence over the &#8216;regular arrangements&#8217; as set out in the consent order. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The third matter raised by the mother relates to times when the father is not able to be with N during the period that N is to spend time with him. In her document dated 19 January 2009, the mother&#8217;s proposal was that the father should inform her, giving not less than 7 days notice, and either request that the arrangement be varied so that N will spend another equal period with the father or seek the mother&#8217;s consent that N stay with another member of the father&#8217;s family. This, as the father was quick to point out, would have given the mother a veto. Her revised proposal, as set out in her position statement dated 30 April 2009, is that in the event that the father is not able to spend time with N for whatever reason and does not wish to change the arrangements, N may spend time with the father&#8217;s family, subject to the father informing mother 7 days beforehand of his being unable to spend time with N, of the identity of the member of the family who will be spending time with N instead of father, the address where N will be staying, if not at father&#8217;s home, and telephone details. In addition the mother suggests that the member(s) of the father&#8217;s family who will be spending time with N instead of father confirm in writing not less than 7 days beforehand that they accept such responsibility.</p>

The result, she says, was that N&#8217;s brother looked after him and mislaid N&#8217;s school bag, which caused N to fret. She is, she says, simply seeking some kind of order that in the event that the father is away for any reason, she be advised of this and to whom the father has delegated the responsibility of looking after N.</p>

Yet he seeks, in the more modest aspects of his forensic ambitions, to have the consent order varied in numerous respects. And, in his more sweeping ambitions &#8211; and this in reality is what he is determined to engineer, whatever and however &#8211; he seeks completely to subvert and destroy the consent order. For what he seeks is nothing less than to re-open the whole matter, in the hope that he will obtain the sole residence order which in over five years of litigation has thus far eluded him. And he persists in this demand despite, indeed in the teeth of, the consent order, and despite the fact, and fact it is (and I make clear that I say this bearing very much in mind everything said by the father in his voluminous written evidence), that he cannot, notwithstanding all his endeavours, point to any new evidence which has come to light or any significant change of circumstance since he agreed to the consent order.</p>

These parents &#8211; the father in particular &#8211; need to shoulder the burden of their parental duties and parental responsibilities. They have an obligation &#8211; a moral and parental obligation; not merely a legal obligation &#8211; to their son (never mind their obligation to the court) to discuss between themselves and to decide how he is to live and how he is to be brought up. They merely abdicate that responsibility if they come to court, particularly in relation to matters as comparatively trivial as some of those on the father&#8217;s list. And what do they imagine their son thinks of them, what do they imagine their son will think of them in future, as a teenager and later as an adult? </p>

For the more the court is drawn into the process of imposing solutions which the parents are unwilling or unable to agree themselves, especially the more trivial the issues to be resolved, the more impotent the parents will become in arriving at their own solutions, the more they will come to rely upon the court as a crutch, as a provider of answers to any and every question, however trivial. Far from encouraging them to assume the <span style="font-style:italic">parental </span>responsibilities which nature and the law have imposed upon them, <span style="font-style:italic">and them alone</span>, the court if it allows itself to be cajoled down this road will simply be encouraging them to avoid, indeed to shirk, their responsibilities. And how long is this process to continue? N is only a little over 8 years old. Is the court to remain involved until he is 16 or 18? Certainly not! </p>

Unless the court now disengages, and, more importantly, unless his parents now buckle down to the twin tasks of making the consent order work and, where appropriate, of giving it the necessary consensual &#8216;tweaking&#8217;, the future for N will, I fear, be bleak. For unless the parents do now buckle down, unless the court declines &#8211; resolutely and with immediate effect &#8211; to arbitrate where the parents refuse to agree, even though they can and should be able to agree, the process will continue until N simply &#8216;votes with his feet&#8217;, perhaps, and worst of all, until he abandons them both, pronouncing a &#8216;plague on both your houses.&#8217;  </p>

But if these opinions were as important as he now suggests in supporting a case for sole residence, why on earth did the father ever agree to the consent order? In large part he relied upon various incidents which have allegedly taken place since I made the consent order. Even assuming for the sake of argument that the father&#8217;s factual allegations are correct &#8211; and much of it is hotly disputed by the mother &#8211; I cannot attach to these incidents, whether viewed separately or in combination, anything like the same gravity or significance as the father would have me accept. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;One of the most appalling aspects of the Family Division, which causes it, amongst many other things, to merit the perception of it as the Third Division, is the way the judiciary routinely ignore expert research carried out under proper scientific conditions. When confronted with research findings they usually hide behind the mantra that each case turns on its own facts and that the court must concentrate on the particular circumstances of the case before it, hence research of a general character can be and will be ignored. This has the useful consequence of enlarging the scope of judicial discretion. The fallacy is obvious to those of a scientific and rational turn of mind: if a general principle or law is established which has exceptions in some cases, then the onus is upon the person who claims an exception to justify that. The existence of the general principle justifies reliance upon it until the contrary is proved, and the burden of proof is upon he who claims the contrary. I am sure that even a judge of the Family Division assumes that sugar will dissolve in his tea and does not say, well, we must not assume that since each cube of sugar and cup of tea turns on its own facts we must examine every cup and cube individually before judicially concluding that the cube will dissolve in the cup.&#8221;</p>

And I would vigorously dispute any assertion that case management directions of the kind I gave on the two occasions of which the father complains are outside the competence of the court. Pro-active judicial case management is an essential feature of practice in the modern family courts. Without such case management the system would simply collapse. And the antics of litigants who, like the father here, seek to defy, without appealing, the orders which the judge to whom a case is reserved has thought appropriate to make as part of his responsibilities to ensure the proper management of the case, merely redound to the disadvantage of other litigants &#8211; and other <span style="font-style:italic">children </span>&#8211; who, patiently awaiting their turn in an already over-long queue, comply with the court&#8217;s directions. </p>
