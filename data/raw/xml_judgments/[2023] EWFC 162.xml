	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 16 February 1994, the parties entered into a deed of separation. W says she has no recollection of it, and in correspondence and Form E made no mention of it, but it bears her signature and it is clear that she engaged Manches and Co, together with Mr Barry Singleton QC and Mr James Turner. Just before signing, W&#8217;s solicitors sent a letter saying they were no longer instructed because &#8220;she is not following our advice&#8221;; that was a matter between her and her lawyers. H had advice from Emsley Solicitors. On a preliminary view, there is nothing to suggest that there is any vitiating factor of the sort identified in <span style="font-weight:bold">Radmacher v Granatino [2010] UKSC 42 </span>which renders the deed of separation invalid. The essential terms of the deed were:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is not entirely clear whether the separation agreement was converted into a draft consent order, which was then submitted to the court for approval and sealing. H says he &#8220;has a memory of a consent order but he is not a lawyer&#8221;. W says &#8220;my financial claims were not dealt with at the time of our separation&#8221;. It seems likely to me that had an order been made by the court; (i) there would be a record of it, but despite extensive searches at court, none has been located, (ii) H or his former solicitors would have evidence of an order and/or (iii) W or her former solicitors would have evidence of an order. But there is in fact not a single document evidencing the making of a final order. There is nothing in any of the lawyers&#8217; files to show that a draft was prepared in correspondence, and then lodged at court.  H lives in hope that a consent order will be found, but I suspect it is a forlorn cause.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Further, since 1999 (per W) or 2002 (per H), H has provided W with generous ongoing financial support. On any view, H was under no legal obligation to do so, but the fact of the matter is that he did, for over two decades. In broad terms, he met W&#8217;s utility bills and paid her a monthly allowance which has increased over time to the sum of &#163;8,500pm from April 2016 onwards, in addition to which he paid for her BUPA cover. Additionally, he bought a car for her, and paid for educational courses. According to W, but disputed by H, he promised he would support her indefinitely.   There are letters written by H&#8217;s business adviser to W&#8217;s bank in 2016/2017 suggesting monies would be paid for the rest of her life, although that strikes me as not necessarily to be seen as anything more than assistance for W to obtain lending and/or banking facilities. H says that he always operated on the basis that he had no obligation to pay anything to W and he would not have made such payments if he thought there would be future litigation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In March 2022, H told W he would cease all payments, and that the house should be sold. The former was within his legal rights, the latter not so. Quite what prompted this abrupt change is not clear. In July 2022, he reduced the payments from &#163;8,500pm to &#163;5,000pm, and from December 2022 he stopped paying anything.  As a result of pressing from W&#8217;s solicitors, in April 2023 H offered &#163;3,000pm on an interim basis, which he increased to &#163;4,000pm in May 2023. Neither offer was acceptable to W and those figures put forward by H have in fact not been paid voluntarily by him.</p>

However, monthly payments more accurately reflects what would happen if the applicant were paying her lawyers from her own resources, and very likely will mirror the position of the respondent.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In <span style="font-weight:bold">BN v MA 2013 EWHC 4250</span> Mostyn J stated that on an application for interim provision, the court should apply the terms of a pre-marital agreement closely unless the applicant can demonstrate to a convincing standard that there is a likely prospect of satisfying the court it should not be upheld. In that case, there was a pre-marital agreement entered into some 15 months before the wife&#8217;s application for financial remedies and interim provision. The facts of this case are readily distinguishable. True, there was a marital agreement (albeit post separation rather than pre marriage), but thereafter H provided ongoing financial support, in the form of housing and general subvention, from 1999 or 2002 onwards. H relies on the delay in prosecuting the financial remedies claim, but in my judgment, W&#8217;s claim for financial remedies is strengthened by that ongoing support, and the significance of the delay is reduced. Time will tell whether W&#8217;s claim for further financial provision succeeds, but prima facie she has an arguable case and it would be unfair on this interim application to hold her too closely to the deed of separation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On a broad overview of the case, I do not at this stage regard W&#8217;s claims as doubtful or speculative, as characterised by H, although they are likely to be significantly curtailed by reason of the deed of separation and the passage of time before W initiated her claim. But W can point to the financial support for at least two decades which, arguably, generated dependency and, on her case, was explicitly on the basis that such support would continue for her lifetime. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dealing with general maintenance first, I conclude that, although the deed of separation provides for no further payment to W, and some 30 years have passed since then, the fact is that H has since 1999, or 2002, provided W with substantial sums. He chose to do so, and should not be criticised for his generosity. On the other hand, W became accustomed to the sums which were regular and steady. If she is correct (and I accept she may not be), H assured her that he would continue to support her indefinitely. My task is to decide what is reasonable between now and a final hearing which might be six to nine months away. I do not think it would be fair to W for an established income stream from H of over &#163;100,000pa to cease, or be significantly curtailed, in circumstances where she has minimal liquid resources of her own to meet her needs. Something approaching the status quo ante should be restored pending fuller consideration. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Given H&#8217;s wealth, I do not consider it to be fair to expect W to in some way access the equity in her property, or sell chattels, certainly at this interim stage, to meet her needs for a relatively short period of time. In my view, the pressing need is to hold the ring until the parties reach settlement or the court makes a final decision. The fact that H offered some monies on an interim basis is at least a partial recognition of that. I propose to order H to pay &#163;8,500pm. It is less than W&#8217;s interim expenditure list of &#163;11,436pm, but some items can be pared down and W has a job earning about &#163;14,000pa gross which puts her in a position to make a contribution of her own. The sums shall be backdated to the date of application, and any arrears shall be paid by 4pm on 3 August 2023.  The application was prompted by H&#8217;s unilateral decision to cease the payments which had been made for many years, and I see no reason why W should bear the loss since the date of application.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As for the LSPO, I am satisfied on the evidence that W&#8217;s solicitors will not enter into a Sears Tooth arrangement, and she is unable to secure monies from litigation funders; the suggestion that she should offer a sale of her home, or a charge over it, to secure funding seems to me to be unreasonable and conflicts with Mostyn J&#8217;s dicta in <span style="font-weight:bold">Rubin. </span>It would be particularly unfair as there is no guarantee she will receive anything from H (he offers nothing) and would thereby be putting her home at significant risk.<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>Her modest bank balances should not be depleted. Nor, in my view, would it be reasonable to expect her to sell chattels and art which are an intrinsic part of her home.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, a LSPO should be made in order to level a playing field which would otherwise lean heavily in H&#8217;s favour. W seeks &#163;227,321. That includes the costs of the hearing on 15 June, today&#8217;s hearing and the FDR, as well as the preparatory work for the hearings. H engages leading and junior counsel, and it is not unreasonable for W to do so. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I considered applying a notional reduction to reflect what would occur on a standard basis assessment, a technique which has on occasions been used by judges of the Division (see, for example, Cobb J in <span style="font-weight:bold">BC v DE <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2016/1806" uk:canonical="[2016] EWHC 1806 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWHC 1806 (Fam)</ref></span> who, at para 26, applied a 15% deduction).  But on balance my view is that to do so would be the wrong approach in this case. This is not an inter partes costs order where such a deduction is routinely applied. It is a solicitor/client sum sought by W to enable her to litigate in circumstances where she cannot reasonably be expected to access her own limited resources. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The approach to quantum, in my view, is simply whether the costs sought are reasonable, in the context of the nature of the litigation, the issues, the resources, and how each party is approaching the proceedings. Scrutinising the figure claimed, it seems to me to be little overstated given that, in my view, this is not an over complex case. I doubt that as much solicitor time as is claimed will be required. I note that W&#8217;s costs to date exceed H&#8217;s by &#163;50,000, and consider that this sort of discrepancy in W&#8217;s favour going forward, and paid for by H, would not be justified. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Insofar as W&#8217;s claimed figure includes incurred costs, they are payable to her current solicitors and are in respect of these proceedings. That is akin to the circumstances in <span style="font-weight:bold">BC v DE, </span>and distinct from the facts of <span style="font-weight:bold">Rubin </span>where the historic costs were in respect of other, concluded litigation.  W is, in reality, dependent upon her solicitors and beholden to them. If she does not pay the outstanding costs, that may affect their ability or willingness to represent her. It is not reasonable to expect them to offer interest free credit, when H has abundant wealth to meet those costs, and in circumstances where I have already indicated that, if I so determine at final hearing, some or all of the costs allowance may be repayable. </p>
