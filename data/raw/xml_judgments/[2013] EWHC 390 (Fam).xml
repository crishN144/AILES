They married in 1993 and finally separated in May 2012.  They have three children aged between 14 and 9, who are in private education.  The husband is a hedge fund manager, currently moving between jobs.  The wife is an artist who has not sold her work for a number of years.  Divorce proceedings began in 2011 and the husband left the family home in May 2012.</span></p>

The family has heavy debts, so that from gross assets worth about &#163;1.4 million there is a net amount for distribution estimated at &#163;209,000 only.  The district judge was rightly appalled at the parties' legal costs, which totalled over &#163;150,000 at the time of the hearing before him, the husband having spent &#163;93,000 and the wife &#163;60,000.  This reflected a large number of attritional interlocutory hearings, for which he held the wife largely responsible.</span></p>

He dealt with any possible bonuses by allocating a small share to the wife over the three-year period.  He made an order for child maintenance.  The overall net effect is to give the husband and wife about &#163;3000 per month once the wife&#8217;s benefits are taken to account, an equal division notwithstanding that she has the care of the children.</span></p>

He described her litigation conduct as being inequitable to disregard.  He also found that private education for the children could no longer be afforded.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">In my judgement the wife has no real prospect of success in relation to the district judge&#8217;s capital orders.  His finding against this background that the wife would not in fact rehouse herself in a property worth little over &#163;200,000 when she is presently living in a house worth &#163;1.2 million cannot be challenged.  In any event, any further argument about this family's remaining capital would be disproportionate and futile.  The sums already spent on legal costs have lost the children the possibility of a better home and probably a private education.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">In reaching this conclusion, I acknowledge that the judge differentiated between the parties in that he allowed the husband to draw his higher legal costs from the common pool while requiring the wife&#8217;s lower costs to be assessed before they are taken into account.  I also accept that the judge&#8217;s reference to the wife's conduct as a factor is somewhat surprising, albeit he did not in his oral judgment explain how he took that into account.  However, stepping back and looking at the overall capital division, I remain of the view that the wife has not demonstrated a real prospect of success in this respect.</span></p>

In comparison to the husband, the wife has no track record as an earner and in three years&#8217; time there will still be three minor children following an 18 year marriage.  I think she should be allowed to argue that in that respect the judge did not make proper allowance for her reasonable needs. </span></p>

I do not agree with the wife's submission that, since issues of capital and income are always interrelated to some extent, there is no harm in granting permission to appeal against the capital provision as well.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">I shall however make the permission subject to a condition that the amount of legal costs that are to be recoverable from the other party in relation to the appeal itself shall not exceed &#163;5000 on either side.  In my view, the court has a responsibility to discourage profligate waste of costs, particularly in a case with a track record like this.  It is a matter for each party to decide what they want to spend, but they cannot expect it to be recoverable if it exceeds that threshold.</span></p>

She has had grounds of appeal settled by one counsel (not the counsel who represented her at trial), a skeleton argument settled by leading counsel, and an appearance today from yet another junior counsel.</span></p>

If that is what it takes to prevent what the district judge described as a haemorrhaging of money, so be it.  So far as I can tell, all the paperwork that she needs for the appeal is in place.  There is no need for transcripts or further documentary preparation on her part.</span></p>
