His CV had been identified by counsel for the children by the r.16.4 guardian immediately before the hearing, and was preferred to the father&#8217;s proposed expert. Unfortunately, the CV was only made available to the mother at the door of the court, and she says, and I accept, that she did not have the opportunity to consider it until later. The CV was evidently sent to the court and the parties at 2.38pm on the day of the hearing. In it, Dr. Hardiman describes his &#8216;main interest&#8217; as in &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">the assessment of families affected by high conflict post separation parenting and/or allegations of parental alienation&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">.</span></p>

Dr Hardiman was to receive a copy of the entire court bundle, including the court&#8217;s prior judgments, save for a &#8216;schedule of findings of fact&#8217; that had been prepared. The principal fact-finding judgment which underlay the process had concluded with a judgment as long ago as 22 February 2021, within which Judge McPhee had himself incorporated earlier findings made by DJ Sethi. Further findings were then made in a judgment on 18 November 2021. A &#8216;Revised and Consolidated Schedule&#8217; was then prepared by the children&#8217;s solicitor incorporating those various findings. Although there were a number of specific findings going back over a number of years, their essence was that the father had behaved in ways that were controlling, manipulative and aggressive towards the mother. Whilst the mother was not always beyond criticism, despite feeling embattled by the father&#8217;s behaviour, she had nevertheless continued to promote the children seeing their father. </span></p>

There had been long-running private law Children Act proceedings before the judge, around arrangements for the children to see their father. At present, they are not seeing him. The father sought the appointment of the psychologist, after an earlier application for such a report by the guardian had been rejected by the same judge on 7 February 2023. There had been a number of other attempts by the judge to find an outside agency or programme that might enable contact between the children and their father to restart, but each attempt had so far failed. The father&#8217;s case as put by Mr Glaser KC was that, if the matter proceeded without further assessment of the whole family, there was unlikely to be an order made which would allow the children to spend time with their father.</span></p>

She argued then that the children had seen too many professionals already, and that she herself does not want to take part in any such assessment. The children are separately represented by a guardian, who supported the order and resists the appeal, but for slightly different reasons to the father. She herself had been sufficiently concerned about the number of professionals who had already engaged with the children that she had determined not to see them again herself ahead of the hearing before the judge. </span></p>

And then that the assessor should determine whether to later involve the children. Despite the judge expressing reservation about the appropriateness of this course &#8211; which he said bore a risk of the court &#8216;abrogating the responsibility&#8217; of taking the final decision, that was the position which he eventually arrived at. He also accepted that there was &#8216;a real difficulty&#8217; about agreeing an assessment without a final date.</span></p>

The matter was adjourned for the still then ongoing ICFA programme to conclude, and it was the disappointing outcome to that programme which led to the father&#8217;s application on 11 December 2023, 2 days before the next hearing, for the appointment of a psychologist.
