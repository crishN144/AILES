It was adjourned. The District Judge found that the wife&#8217;s solicitors were responsible for the adjournment and that their fault was of such a nature and degree that it amounted to &#8220;improper, unreasonable or negligent conduct&#8221; within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54/section/51/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s51(6)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54" uk:canonical="1981 c. 54" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Senior Courts Act 1981</ref> justifying an order that they should pay the costs thrown away by virtue of the adjournment of both the respondent husband and of the wife of his uncle, the second respondent. Those costs, together with the costs of the hearing about the wasted costs, have been estimated at over &#163;100,000, although the bills have not yet been assessed by a costs judge. The wife was also ordered on a joint and several basis to pay the costs thrown away by the adjournment, but as a legally aided litigant, those costs were not to be enforced save by a further order of the court. </p>

My uncle was also finishing his custodial sentence and was not released from prison until 16 August 1999. I believe that I was made a shareholder and. a director of [the Company] due to the convictions of my uncle.

H stated that &#8220;I have never regarded myself as the beneficial owner of the shares. I believe that the shares were transferred to more accurately reflect the beneficial ownership. The shares were transferred on 2 June 2008&#8221;. In the affidavit H identified the beneficial owners as his uncle AH &#8220;and/or&#8221; his uncle&#8217;s brothers. The use of &#8220;and/or&#8221; is a masterpiece of ambiguity. In her affidavit R2 stated &#8220;I do not know why the shares were transferred to me. I believe the shares were transferred to me on 2 June 2008&#8221;. She did not assert that she had any beneficial ownership of the shares.</p>

Given that this was not a business day it is to be treated as being served on Monday 23 May 2011, the first day of the hearing. That document did not state that R2 asserted a beneficial interest in the shares of the Company. To my clear recollection of the submissions made to me on the hearing of the appeal such an assertion was not made until much later, in or about October 2011, pursuant to a further order of District Judge Bassett-Cross<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> I have been informed since this judgment was distributed in draft that a document containing a representation to this effect was provided on 11 July 2011.</p>
	      </authorialNote>. The language of the skeleton was uncompromising. It described the steps taken by W&#8217;s solicitors as &#8220;astonishingly inept and inappropriate&#8221;. It asserted that it was &#8220;incumbent on W to join the beneficiaries&#8221;, relying on a number of authorities including a decision of my own: <span style="font-style:italic">TL v ML</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] 1 FLR 1263" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] 1 FLR 1263</ref>. It asserted that &#8220;W cannot ask this court to make any findings/rulings concerning the beneficial interest(s) in the 334 shares. This is because her solicitors have failed to join the appropriate beneficiaries into the action&#8221;. Interestingly, in relation to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s37</ref> application against R2 (which was of course the only relevant application with which she was concerned) it was stated &#8220;whether the Court does or does not [set the transfer aside] is largely a matter of indifference to R2, given that only the bare legal title was vested in H&#8221;. It concluded by suggesting that the application against R2 &#8220;such as it is&#8221; should be dismissed with indemnity costs against W, coupled with a wasted costs order against her solicitors FM. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;MR BENNETT: This was supposed to be the final hearing of two applications by my client, who is the wife. Firstly, to set aside a transfer of shares in the [Company], which was transferred by the husband to his aunt, P H, the second respondent in these proceedings, at some point in 2008 or 2009, and then the final hearing of her application against him for ancillary relief. &#8230; I say &#8220;supposed to be the final hearing&#8221; because in the days leading to this trial we were provided with 125 pages of additional information, and a clarified position within Mr Jones&#8217;s skeleton argument, which means that I have to accept that this hearing ought to be adjourned. Why do I say that? It is because Mr Jones&#8217;s point is that, even if you were to agree with our application, to set aside the transaction and transfer these shares back from PH to the husband, that would not affect the beneficial ownership of that shareholding, because it is held for persons who are yet to be specified.&#8221;</p>

She had stated that she had no idea why they had been transferred to her. The explanation for the transfer given by H in his affidavit of 27 October 2009 was hardly consistent with his affidavit of 27 April 2011. In relation to the actual application which R2 was facing (a reversal of the transfer of the shares to her by H in either 2008 or 2009) she was &#8220;indifferent&#8221; (as Mr Jones QC put it).

It is therefore hard to see on the available evidence that any order could or should have been made other than to grant the application. For the purposes of my analysis of the law and the facts which follows it must be right that I should regard the shares as having been standing in H&#8217;s name at all relevant times.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">It was submitted, in our view correctly, that the jurisdiction to make a wasted costs order is dependent at two stages on the discretion of the court. The first is at the stage of initial application, when the court is invited to give the legal representative an opportunity to show cause. This is not something to be done automatically or without careful appraisal of the relevant circumstances. The costs of the inquiry as compared with the costs claimed will always be one relevant consideration. This is a discretion, like any other, to be exercised judicially, but judges may not infrequently decide that further proceedings are not likely to be justified. The second discretion arises at the final stage. Even if the court is satisfied that a legal representative has acted improperly, unreasonably or negligently and that such conduct has caused the other side to incur an identifiable sum of wasted costs, it is not bound to make an order, but in that situation it would of course have to give sustainable reasons for exercising its discretion against making an order.&#8221;</p>

This reflects the old rule, applicable in civil and criminal proceedings alike, that a party should not be condemned without an adequate opportunity to be heard. Even if the court were able properly to be sure that the practitioner could have no answer to the substantive complaint, it could not fairly make an order unless satisfied that nothing could be said to influence the exercise of its discretion. Only exceptionally could these exacting conditions be satisfied. Where a wasted costs order is sought against a practitioner precluded by legal professional privilege from giving his full answer to the application, the court should not make an order unless, proceeding with extreme care, it is (a) satisfied that there is nothing the practitioner could say, if unconstrained, to resist the order and (b) that it is in all the circumstances fair to make the order.&#8221; </p>

He says that were I to find otherwise I would be violating centuries of learning in the Chancery Division where the position is as here, when the trustee (in this case H) agrees with the putative beneficiaries (in this case at that time incompletely and ambiguously identified) that the beneficial ownership lies with them.

To like effect Garrow B stated: &#8220;a man purchasing stock may have reasons for its not standing in his own name, but where he transfers stock already in his name into that of another person, it is quite a different thing, and generally proceeds from an intention to benefit the person into whose name it is transferred&#8221;. </p>

In the second class of case referred to by me at para 42 above (i.e. where the asset in dispute is held in the sole name of the respondent to the claim) it is my opinion that the duty to bring the claim of the non-legal-owner third party before the court lies primarily and equally on the respondent to the application and on the non-legal-owner, and not on the claimant. </p>

Say that there are assets worth &#163;500,000 in the names of the parties about which there is no dispute that they are beneficially owned by the parties (Pool A), and a further &#163;500,000 of assets in the name of the respondent but which he says is owned by his uncle (Pool B). The claimant might take the view that she is not going to go to the expense of joining the uncle, but will rather argue, in reliance on the starting point or prima facie position, in a trial between her and the respondent alone, that Pool B beneficially belongs to the respondent. Assume further that the uncle does not exercise his undoubted right to apply to intervene. The court is obliged to decide in the exercise of its statutory inquisitorial function under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s25(2)</ref>(a) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> which assets belong to the respondent. It decides on the evidence, giving due weight to the starting point, that Pool B belongs to him alone and awards all of Pool A to the claimant on the application of the equal sharing principle. Certainly, the finding that Pool B belongs to the respondent does not bind the uncle, but it certainly binds the respondent. The claimant can collect her full award from Pool A without any difficulties involving the uncle.</p>

She may well face in enforcement proceedings a claim by the uncle that he owns beneficially Pool B, although in those proceedings the uncle would have to answer the hard question why he never sought to intervene in the original proceedings to defend his asset. In this scenario the claimant may very well decide that it would be wise to apply to join the uncle into the original proceedings in order to ensure effective enforcement or at least in order to avoid mess and chaos in later enforcement proceedings.

In that case the assets lay in the bracket of &#163;7m - &#163;12m. Of these assets the husband always contended in the ancillary relief proceedings that the money in Swiss bank accounts and the equity in two English properties (the majority of the assets) were held by him on behalf of his extended family under the arrangement which is known as the Hindu&#160;Undivided&#160;Family ("HUF"), which is a form of co-ownership or a form of trust. In October&#160;2009 proceedings were begun in Calcutta, brought by the husband&#8217;s Indian brother against both the husband and the wife. In them, the brother claimed that substantially all the assets which were apparently in the name of the husband were in fact held in the HUF not only for the brother and his immediate family alone, but also for a number of other family members. An invitation to the brother to intervene in the ancillary relief proceedings was made and declined, or at any rate not taken up.

She made the strategic decision to proceed with her claim without joinder, and, so far as I am aware, that duly happened. The gravamen of the judgments both at first instance and on appeal was that inasmuch as there was a duty to bring the brother&#8217;s claims before the court, it lay on the husband and the brother, and not on the wife. </p>

Whilst the wife still contends that this husband and/or the second respondent has a legal and beneficial interest in these shares, the fact of the matter is that the proper procedure with regard to bringing those other parties who have a beneficial interest before the court has not been proceeded with. I do not disagree at all with Mr Jones&#8217;s submissions on behalf of the second respondent in respect of this matter.</p>

No application was made to this court for directions in respect of that, and the joining of the beneficiaries, or indeed for the husband to disclose those beneficiaries. As Mr Jones has pointed out, an application could have been made in the Chancery Division for a representation order, as indeed it could be, I understand from Mr Jones, in this Division. None of that was done until some four weeks ago when a letter was written, both to the company itself, for reasons that escape me, and also to one of the known beneficiaries. I say &#8216;known because that is in the evidence, it is quite clear, and it is in the wife&#8217;s evidence that the company was run by this gentleman. She knew right from day one. </p>

Obviously consequential directions will need to be given to ensure that this matter is better prepared before it comes back before the court. That must be on the basis that the wife must pay the costs thrown away by the first and second respondent by reason of the adjournment. She being in receipt of public funding, those costs obviously will have been to be the subject of a detailed assessment, and cannot be enforced without further leave of the court.</p>

They also have a duty to the court to be able to put forward and ensure that the proceedings proceed in an orderly and proper fashion to enable the court to adjudicate upon the matters they have invoked the jurisdiction of the court. It seems to me that it is an unhelpful argument to suggest -- because this is a matrimonial suit -- that each party is the Applicant and is seeking orders from the court and that by reason of the overriding objective, as I have already indicated, that the parties should provide evidence to support the other party&#8217;s case. There is a very simple tried and tested method in this Division of discovery -- which I personally disagree with -- but that is by way of questionnaires, because the questionnaires are usually lengthy, do not assist the court in large part, but the fundamental question must be asked and that question, as I have said before, has not been asked, and if it were asked and not answered, the court has other powers whereby an application could be made for the alleged beneficiaries to attend on a production appointment, and professionals can be also equally ordered and, of course, there is the method of an oral examination of third parties and things like that. None of that was done in this case.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">It should be recorded that with effect from 6 April 2011 the rules position will change with the introduction of the new Family Procedure Rules 2010 in place of the existing Family Proceedings Rules 1991. The 2010 rules remove the default application to family proceedings of the RSC. They are plainly modelled generally on the CPR, and include a re-statement (in slightly different terms) of the overriding objective, but the CPR continue not to apply directly to family proceedings. After 6 April 2011, the provisions of RSC O11 and O15 r 6 will therefore not be applicable to a case such as the present, and nor will CPR 19.2 or 6.36 and its associated Practice Direction. It appears that the new 2010 Rules contemplate that the joinder of parties be accomplished according to the broad discretionary case management powers contained in the overriding objective, viz: 1.4(2) (b)(ii) which makes clear that that objective includes the duty to decide an early stage who should be a party to the proceedings; see also 4.1(3)(o) and Part 18. Since the 2010 rules say nothing about the principles on which joinder of third parties (onshore or offshore) should be exercised, it may be that courts will have recourse by analogy to the principles contained in CPR 19.2 and 6.36 with its Practice Direction 6B. The final resolution of that issue must however await a decision on the point. </p>
