	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ellie (not her real name) was born on 25 February 2023. On 27 February 2023, before Ellie and her mother were discharged from hospital, Lincolnshire County Council (&#8220;the LA&#8221;) commenced care proceedings and applied for an urgent interim care order (&#8220;ICO&#8221;). The stated purpose of the LA&#8217;s application was to remove Ellie immediately from the care of her parents. The application came before District Judge Veits on the same day. He granted the application at a summary hearing. He was satisfied that Ellie&#8217;s safety demanded her immediate separation from her parents. Ellie was taken by social workers and placed in the care of the mother&#8217;s own sister (supported by their mother). </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parents wished to challenge this order. Although the draft of the order made by District Judge Veits states that it will last until the conclusion of the proceedings it was arranged that the matter would be reconsidered by me at a reasonably full hearing in Lincoln on 2 March 2023. At that hearing the matter proceeded as if the LA were making its application <span style="font-style:italic">ab initio</span>. No reliance was placed on the reasoning of District Judge Veits (which had not been transcribed). The application was therefore heard de novo, the LA accepting that it had to prove its case from scratch.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is well-established that &#8220;likely&#8221; does not mean more likely than not, but rather that there is a &#8220;real possibility&#8221; of the happening of significant harm.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Re H &amp; Ors (minors)</span> [1995] UKHL 16 at [68]  - [69] Lord Nicholls stated:</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;What is in issue is the prospect, or risk, of the child suffering&#160;<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">significant</span>&#160;harm. When exposed to this risk a child may need protection just as much when the risk is considered to be less than fifty-fifty as when the risk is of a higher order. Conversely, so far as the parents are concerned, there is no particular magic in a threshold test based on a probability of significant harm as distinct from a real possibility. It is otherwise if there is no real possibility. It is eminently understandable that Parliament should provide that where there is no real possibility of significant harm, parental responsibility should remain solely with the parents. That makes sense as a threshold in the interests of the parents and the child in a way that a higher threshold, based on probability, would not.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">In my view, therefore, the context shows that in section 31(2)(a) likely is being used in the sense of a real possibility, a possibility that cannot sensibly be ignored having regard to the nature and gravity of the feared harm in the particular case.&#8221;&#160;(original emphasis)</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Where the threshold is based on the risk of future harm (as it usually is) the exercise is thus predictive. The court has to make an assessment of the likelihood of future significant harm. It does not have to be as much as 50%, but has to be of a degree that reflects the idea of a &#8220;real possibility&#8221;. The probability or degree of likelihood is not fixed at, say, 40% but will vary in step with the seriousness of the significant harm. Thus in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S-B </span>(Children) [2009] UKSC 17 at [9] Baroness Hale stated:</p>
	      <block name="embeddedStructure">
                <embeddedStructure>
		  <level>
		    <content>
		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Thus the law has drawn a clear distinction between probability as it applies to past facts and probability as it applies to future predictions. Past facts must be proved to have happened on the balance of probabilities, that is, that it is more likely than not that they did happen. Predictions about future facts need only be based upon a degree of likelihood that they will happen which is sufficient to justify preventive action. This will depend upon the nature and gravity of the harm: a lesser degree of likelihood that the child will be killed will justify immediate preventive action than the degree of likelihood that the child will not be sent to school.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In order to make the prediction the court will invariably have to rely on past facts, as it is a truism the best prophet of the future is the past. The past facts will either be admitted or the court will have to make findings about them on the balance of probabilities.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, on an application for an ICO the court does not have to make findings about past facts because the law requires only that it should have &#8220;reasonable grounds for believing&#8221; that the predictive exercise would take the court across the threshold.  A belief is the subjective requirement for knowledge. It is, <span style="font-style:italic">ex hypothesi</span> a partial, personal judgment. However, s.38(2) requires the belief of the court to be well-supported by &#8220;reasonable grounds&#8221;.  What this means is that the court must be satisfied that the LA&#8217;s case on the threshold is a strong one. And, save in exceptional circumstances, it will form that judgment on the written evidence alone &#8211; see FPR 22.7(1), which provides that:</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Therefore the threshold requirement for an ICO is that the court must be satisfied that the LA has a strong case for proving that, unless there is an intervention, there is a real possibility that the child will suffer significant harm at the hands of his or her parent(s). In determining whether the LA&#8217;s case is strong the court will be careful not to make findings of fact on controversial issues. The object is to hold the ring, neutrally and impartially, pending a final hearing. It is important that nobody takes away from an ICO decision any kind of perceived sense of victory or of tactical advantage for the final hearing.</p>

I would allow the appeal on Ground 2 only. I would set aside the order and record that the LA does not now seek to separate mother and child. The matter will be restored for an early hearing before the Designated Family Judge at which the necessary orders to underpin the placement and identify its purpose can be made. Finally, the mother must understand that nothing that has been said on this appeal should encourage her to believe that she and Andy will not be separated in future if the circumstances should indeed justify it.&#8221;</p>

While a care order is in force the terms of the statute stipulate that the court has no further role, other than to make orders for contact. However, under s 31A the LA is obliged to prepare a care plan, and the court will have that plan at the forefront of its mind when it considers what order it might make, if any, once the threshold has been proved. If the court makes a care order on the basis of proposals in the care plan, and it later transpires that those proposals have not been implemented, then it would be open to an aggrieved parent to invoke the ultimate nuclear power vested in the court of discharge under section 39;  and it might be thought that such an application would have a reasonable prospect of success in such circumstances. </p>

However, amendments made to the 1989 Act by the Family Law Act 1986 introduced ss. 38A and B, which allow the court to exclude a person who poses a danger to a child from a dwelling in which the child lives. These provisions plainly presuppose that the interim order will have been made on the specific basis that the child will live in a certain place and be cared for by a certain person.</p>
