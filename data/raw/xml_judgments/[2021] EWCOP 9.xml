It is everyone&#8217;s ardent wish that further such proceedings can be avoided. The purpose of this judgment is therefore to determine the issue, for as long as AEL&#8217;s current care arrangements subsist.   </p>

In the following paragraph Mostyn J noted that the social worker &#8220;accepted under cross-examination that such an act of humanity could not amount to a deprivation of liberty, and I emphatically agree.&#8221; It may be that JSL is particularly focussed on this vignette. </p>

The &#8220;act of humanity&#8221; vignette in the context of the wider arrangements for Ben is clearly  different to &#8220;the principle&#8221; which JSL says underlies AEL&#8217;s care. The supervision and control of the activities which AEL is permitted to choose is more generalised than a response to immediate danger, as is seen clearly in JSL&#8217;s account of the difficulties which the covid pandemic have brought for AEL. Again, there is no factual basis for contending that the <span style="font-style:italic">Bournemouth BC v PS &amp; DS</span> conclusions should also be drawn in respect of AEL. </p>

In my view they do here. In reaching that conclusion I have drawn upon the policy set out by Baroness Hale, and that has, I should acknowledge, been a critical factor in my conclusion. However much these arrangements may be to the benefit of AB, and undoubtedly they are, one has to reflect on how they would be observed by an ordinary member of the public who, I strongly suspect, would regard them as a real deprivation of liberty. The policy that everyone should be treated the same leads me to the conclusion that I have set out.&#8221; </p>

The particular circumstances of the covid-19 pandemic bring additional pressures to be coped with, perhaps more so for this family than for most, but it is common ground that current arrangements are in AEL&#8217;s best interests and should continue. To date JSL has amply demonstrated a fierce devotion to his daughter&#8217;s wellbeing, and I have no doubt that he will continue to do so. However, it is not his good intentions and achievements which determine the issue now before the Court. </p>

In the proceedings before me, I have seen no grounds at all for making such accusations. Fortunately, it is not JSL&#8217;s opinion of those who seek to give effect to legal requirements, or indeed his view of the law itself, which determines the issue either.      </p>

The reality of her disabilities is that AEL&#8217;s safety is permanently at risk unless she has support. Therefore, she has 24-hour support and she is thereby under continuous control in the sense that her freedom may be interfered with at any moment. The intention may be benevolent; the arrangements may indeed ensure that she has a much happier, healthier and longer life than she would otherwise have; but &#8220;a gilded cage is still a cage.&#8221; The &#8216;acid test&#8217; of deprivation of liberty is made out. </p>
