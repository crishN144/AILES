	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In 2004 the parties acquired a 30% interest in DB, a company which provides outsourcing services to a wide range of organisations across various sectors. The parties&#8217; family and friends purchased another 25%. This approach was adopted to enable the parties to benefit from the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) whereby gains in business assets can be received free of tax (and any losses limited) provided that the shareholding acquired does not exceed 30% and the shares are held for a sufficient period of time (three years).  In 2007, after the requisite three-year period under the EIS scheme had elapsed, DB bought back the shares owned by the family and friends who had come in with the parties in 2004.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties resolved to market DB for sale in 2008 but were unsuccessful in the light of the adverse business climate then prevailing. They instead restructured the business with a view to future growth. Following the re-structuring, H repurchased W&#8217;s shares in the business due to US tax implications. In return, W was given the right to call for half of H&#8217;s shareholding to be transferred to her with no associated cost and H was precluded from selling or transferring more than 3% of the shares in his name without W&#8217;s written authorisation. </p>

In 2019, upon W&#8217;s proposal, DB launched a fund within DB to channel profits into &#8216;green&#8217; ventures.  </p>

With regard to DB, H explained that the value ascribed to the shares for the purpose of a number of recent share buybacks had varied but that the most recent buyback was at a &#8220;generous&#8221; figure calculated on the forecast budget which was unlikely to be met.  As to MT, H explained that the valuation had been calculated based upon &#8220;the net asset value of the business. It is not a trading company and therefore that is the most accurate way to value it&#8221;.

It is necessary to have black and white rules of this kind if agreements are otherwise to be binding. There is no need for them, however, in the current state of the law. The safeguards in the consultation document are likely to be highly relevant, but we consider that the Court of Appeal was correct in principle to ask whether there was any material lack of disclosure, information or advice. Sound legal advice is obviously desirable, for this will ensure that a party understands the implications of the agreement, <span style="font-weight:bold">and full disclosure of any assets owned by the other party may be necessary to ensure this. But if it is clear that a party is fully aware of the implications of an ante-nuptial agreement and indifferent to detailed particulars of the other party&#8217;s assets, there is no need to accord the agreement reduced weight because he or she is unaware of those particulars. What is important is that each party should have all the information that is material to his or her decision,</span> and that each party should intend that the agreement should govern the financial consequences of the marriage coming to an end.&#8221; </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">W has a number of specific objections to H&#8217;s disclosure in respect of this company.  The first is that H did not disclose that approximately &#163;20-&#163;25m of DB funds had been invested in MT, which had risen to &#163;26m at the date of the PNA.  There is no suggestion that this loan of funds was not properly accounted for in the accounts of each company, respectively as an asset or a liability.  W&#8217;s objection was that she had understood that MT had been funded with only a relatively modest input from DB, with the balance by way of bank borrowing.</p>

Should W have wished to, she could have asked questions about the asset/liability. She chose not to do so.  There was nothing in the disclosure in this respect that was misleading, in the sense of affecting value.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second area of enquiry was the multiple applied to the EBITDA so as to produce the valuation of approx. &#163;70m of DB.  The multiple used was 5.5 and, says W, whilst she did not challenge the figure in the disclosure exercise, she was unaware that this was a multiple that had been agreed with WW as long ago as 2011, albeit used in a recent buyback of his shares.  W says that if she had known that fact she would have challenged it and sought a higher multiple.  She reminds me that each 1x increase in the multiple increases the value of DB by a little over &#163;18m.</p>

It is what he had agreed. Furthermore, in 2017 the accountants MHA had advised that an appropriate multiple was in the bracket of 4-7, and 5.5 is right in the middle of that bracket.  </p>

This was the entity which both H and W regarded as H&#8217;s venture and in which she had minimal involvement.  In his initial disclosure in August 2019 he had put the value of his interest at &#163;3.5m and he explained in his solicitor&#8217;s letter of 15 October 2019 that he had aggregated shares held in the names of his parents which were to be treated as if his so as to produce &#8220;an estimated value of &#163;3.5m.&#8221; In fact this was a wrong calculation as it assumed that he and his parents held 85% between them when in fact those interests totalled only 82.2%, resulting in the figure that he had given for value being slightly overcalculated.  It is W&#8217;s case that in fact H badly undervalued MT in his disclosure.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before I turn to H&#8217;s valuation of MT, I deal briefly with W&#8217;s allegation that H, by claiming that he controlled 82.2% (as corrected) of the shares in MT, failed to disclose the extent of his control/potential ownership of MT. This allegation relies on a letter to NatWest dated 23 April 2019 which explained that MT had the right to repurchase shareholders&#8217; shares at a pre-determined price. H contends that he was not able to buy back shares at a pre-determined price, but at fair value. In any event, I accept H&#8217;s evidence that the NatWest letter was simply an attempt by H to raise funds, for which he needed to represent that he had control of MT. The letter does not demonstrate, as W alleges, that H owned 100% of MT. I accept that H should be treated as controlling 82.2% of shares in MT.</p>

I do not accept that H genuinely believed the total current value of his 740,000 shares to have been &#163;3.5m when he knew that MT had by 8 April 2020 paid out far higher figures to buy back shares. Of course the transaction on 2 April 2020 was after the terms of the PNA had been agreed albeit before it was signed, but there must have been a period of negotiation before then which established the transaction price.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I accept that the &#163;75 per share transaction took place after H had given his disclosure.  He was not asked about when the commercial institutions were first approached about a purchase of shares at &#163;75 each, but H was under a duty of continuing disclosure.  True it was that in his Form E dated 15 October 2019 he made it clear that he was valuing his shares in the company at acquisition cost but under the heading &#8220;Total current value of your interest&#8221; he gave the same figure.  He never corrected or updated the figures.  This is a clear example of non-disclosure.</p>

The duty is on H to update, not for W to investigate to see if he is telling the truth and/or his representations still hold good.</p>

This is not like the matrimonial home or the joint bank account in Moor J&#8217;s examples quoted at paragraph 54 of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">KG v LG</span>.  The trading values and matters relevant to the value of this and the other investments to which I have drawn attention were matters known to H and to which W was not privy.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This investment appears in H&#8217;s Form E at &#163;500k.  Stripped to its basics, W&#8217;s argument is that as it sold in 2021-2022 for nearly &#163;10m (approx. &#163;45m for the whole company), it must be that H undervalued his 20% interest in the business.  W says that there is no explanation given for the radical improvement in performance and that the only possible explanation is that H under declared its value.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">H denies this and refers to the hugely variable performance of the company.  The email provided by the CEO of the company in August 2019 refers to the challenges the company was facing and also the possibilities open to the company.  It certainly cannot be said to be a clear indicator of a substantial upside.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am not prepared to find that simply because the value of an investment in a speculative venture goes up it follows that H must have knowingly undervalued it.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">H admits to omitting a number of small investments which he should have included in his disclosure.  Some of them, such as a beneficial interest in a property owned by his parents, were probably known to W whilst others may not have been.  They were not the subject of any significant investigation in the hearing and indeed most were not touched on at all.  H rightly points out that his failure to disclose his pension with Aviva was matched by W also failing to disclose her pension in a similar sum.  </p>

Whether or not he has been taking improper advantage of EIS relief is not something which was helpful to investigate.  Nor, am I prepared to accept that I should view his evidence &#8220;through the lens of general dishonest behaviour&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">H asks the legitimate question of how much disclosure should really be expected of him in circumstances where he has so many investments.  He claims that he cannot be expected to provide updated information on every one of his investments that he sets out in his schedule of assets.  This is not a difficult question to answer.  Insofar as he has given information as to the value of an asset, he is under an obligation to update it if there is a material change in value prior to agreement being completed.  I accept that in respect of a quoted investment of which W is aware that H holds, W is in a position to make her own enquiry.  But, if W is unaware of the investment or if H holds information about it which is not available to W, he is obliged to inform her of any material change.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Nor am I impressed by his complaint that whilst W has picked on those aspects of his disclosure which she says are deficient because of his failure to provide an accurate market value, no credit is given by her in respect of those of his assets which since disclosure have reduced in value.  The short answer to this point is that if there has been a significant decline in value of an asset then it is up to H to provide such information.  He cannot complain subsequent of the event that there has been such a decline which he had not disclosed.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am similarly unimpressed by his reliance on the financial background and knowhow which both H and W share.  There is no doubt that each is educated to the highest level and has great experience and knowledge of business and investment.  They are both highly articulate and numerate.  Of the two of them, H is far more attuned to the advantage of tax breaks and as both agree he is much the more inclined to enter into what might be thought as risky ventures than W.  But, their abilities and qualifications do not mitigate the disclosure obligations.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Against that background it is not surprising that the majority of the allegations of non-disclosure relate to MT and HL.  MT was the medium through which H&#8217;s more risky ventures were routed.  It was also a business which both regarded as being H&#8217;s baby.  HL was a similar venture.  It was clear and accepted that in the future they were to be his to deal with as he wanted.  But, none of that negates H&#8217;s responsibility to give accurate information of value right up to such time as agreement is concluded.  Only by doing so could the equal sharing of the family assets which both sought to achieve be properly calculated.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In sum, I find that there was material non-disclosure in relation to the value of H&#8217;s interest in HL (and in particular of the share transactions at &#163;30 a share and &#163;75 a share), the value of his shareholding in MT, and the value of MT&#8217;s investment in PD via PL. For the avoidance of doubt, I do not find that W&#8217;s other allegations of non-disclosure are substantiated.</p>
