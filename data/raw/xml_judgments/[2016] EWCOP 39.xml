The judgment had previously been sent to the parties in draft on 6 August 2016. As I recorded (para 71), I then received various emails from Mr Fitzgerald, who acts in person, raising a number of matters. As I went on to make clear, except in relation to one point, which I was careful to identify, none of his observations called for any correction to the judgment or any additions to the text. For the sake of completeness, however, I set out each of his observations, with my response, in a footnote to the relevant part of the judgment.</p>

The complete absence of any merit in Mr Fitzgerald&#8217;s contention is, in fact, patent on the face of his email dated 12 August 2016: the email chain attached to it includes the email dated 24 March 2016, showing an email address for me which (a) is <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>the address asserted by Mr Fitzgerald and (b) was, at the time, my correct email address.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, Mr Fitzgerald is wrong to assert that I am under the duty to him which he asserts. He is, in my judgment, wrong for two reasons: (1) it is the obligation of someone who chooses to act as a litigant in person to acquaint himself with and to comply with the procedure and any relevant rules; and (2) it is not the function of a judge to give advice to a litigant, whether or not acting in person.</p>

It was dealt with in my previous judgment. There is nothing in Mr Fitzgerald&#8217;s complaint that he was not aware of the email exchanges on and following 24 March 2016 (see para 68, footnote 12). Nor is there anything in his assertion that one of the orders I made on 24 March 2016 precluded me making further orders following the handing down of judgment (see para 28, footnote 8, para 70).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Application for permission</span>: Mr Fitzgerald has still not, so far as I am aware, made any application in proper form for permission in accordance with the civil restraint order I made on 22 March 2016 (see my earlier judgment, para 29, footnote 9). Mr Fitzgerald has continued to set out, in an email to me dated 16 August 2016 (11:32) and in an email to the Court of Appeal and copied to me dated 17 August 2016 (11:33), reasons why, he asserts, I should reconsider my judgment and &#8220;rescind [it] in its entirety.&#8221; At this stage, I propose only to say this: (1) there is, as yet, so far as I am aware, no application in proper form before the court; and (2) nothing Mr Fitzgerald has put forward in any of his emails shows even the beginnings of any basis for either reconsidering, let alone rescinding, any part of my judgment. </p>
