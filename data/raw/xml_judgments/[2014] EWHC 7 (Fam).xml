A decree nisi on the wife&#8217;s petition was granted early in 2013. In June 2013 the parties signed IFLA&#8217;s Form ARB1, agreeing to arbitration in accordance with the Rules by Mr Smith in relation to their claims for ancillary relief and thereby binding themselves to accept his award. The arbitrator&#8217;s Final Award is dated 7 November 2013. On 9 December 2013 the parties applied to the Guildford County Court seeking approval of the consent order. In addition to the draft consent order they lodged the Form ARB1, the Final Award, a Joint Statement of Information in Form D81 and, marked for dismissal purposes only, their Forms A.</p>

I said that Thorpe J&#8217;s references to &#8220;the most exceptional circumstances&#8221; and &#8220;overwhelmingly strong considerations&#8221; seemed to me, with respect, to put the matter perhaps a little too high. With the benefit of hindsight I was too questioning of what Thorpe J had said.

The same year, writing extra-judicially in &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">Statutory Arbitration and Ancillary Relief&#8217;</span>, [2008] Fam Law 26, Thorpe LJ ventured the view that &#8220;to extend the Arbitration Acts to reach all financial issues created by the breakdown on relationships is surely safe territory.&#8221; Indeed, there is nothing in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23" uk:canonical="1996 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Arbitration Act 1996</ref> which on the face of it would preclude arbitration as a permissible process for the resolution of disputes rooted in family life or relationship breakdown. The Family Procedure Rules 2010 now encourage resort to alternative dispute resolution procedures in this as in other areas of family law: see FPR rule 1.4(e) and FPR Part 3.

Such an approach respects the court&#8217;s jurisdiction, but gives full force and effect to party autonomy by treating the parties&#8217; agreement to be bound by the award as the magnetic factor which should lead to a reflective order. Thus an arbitral award founded on the parties&#8217; clear agreement in their Form ARB1 to be bound by the award should be treated as a lodestone (more then than just a yardstick) pointing the path to court approval&#8221;.</p>

Different considerations may apply where an arbitral process is based on a different system of law or, in particular, where there is reason to believe that, whatever system of law is purportedly being applied, there may have been gender-based discrimination.

But alongside these innovations the need for procedural adaptation is becoming increasingly pressing. Whether such topics are most appropriately dealt with by rule changes (for example to the Family Procedure Rules 2010 and/or the Civil Procedure Rules 1998) or by the issue of Practice Directions or Practice Guidance is a matter for consideration. Initially, however, I would invite the Family Procedure Rules Committee to consider this as a matter of urgency.</p>
