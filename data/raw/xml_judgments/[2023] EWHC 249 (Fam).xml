MK&#8217;s parents GK and MAK are the second and third respondents in the court of protection proceedings and the first and second respondents to the FMPO proceedings. To minimise the scope for confusion in the light of the extent to which there is an overlap of the issues falling to be considered in each set of proceedings I will in this judgment refer to the respondents by initial.</p>

Until 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> May 2019 he lived with his parents who provided him with care, supported and looked after him. On 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> May 2019, he moved to live in supported accommodation. He has remained there ever since. At the accommodation he receives a care package of 1:1 support, and sleep-in night support, provided by a care agency. He is deprived of his liberty at the placement. The funding of MK&#8217;s care package is divided approximately two-thirds to one-third between the local authority and Coventry &amp; Warwickshire Clinical Commissioning Group, respectively.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application for a Forced Marriage Protection Order arose out of the discovery that there had been an arranged putative wedding between MK and a woman in Pakistan. GK and MAK accept that this took place over Whatsapp. MK attended the ceremony from the UK, with the bride (A)  being present in Pakistan. MK&#8217;s grandfather was said to be present in Pakistan as his purported proxy.&#160;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The focus at this hearing has been on the status of that putative marriage, and in the light of the decision I make as to that, what if any remedy is to be afforded to the parties. Depending on the outcome, this may include whether it is in MK&#8217;s best interests for an application to be made on his behalf for a decree of nullity, and/or whether, on public policy grounds, a declaration of non-recognition of the marriage in England and Wales should be made. The woman in Pakistan, A has been notified of the proceedings and does not wish to be involved or play any part in them. She has indicated that it is her wish to remain &#8216;married&#8217; to MK.  She will have to be notified of the outcome of these proceedings insofar as it relates to the marriage which she understands herself to have entered into. As appears from the expert evidence, there is likely to be significant cultural impact on her of a marriage which she had been understood by her family and community to have contracted. It requires of course no expert advice to realise the likely distress in simple human terms she will experience on any finding that her marriage is not valid and the life which she had expected to flow from it, including a move to the United Kingdom to join her purported husband will now be different. I bear both of those effects in mind as I make decisions on the applications before me.</p>

Furthermore, there is no dispute that MK lacked capacity to marry at the relevant time.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Both Mr Bradshaw and Mr Squire have made detailed submissions on the issue of the putative marriage, Mr Radcliffe on behalf of GK and MAK expressed himself in his written submissions as &#8216;neutral&#8217; on the issue of the validity of the marriage save that he conceded explicitly that MK lacked capacity to marry. He indicated that he did not wish to make any oral submissions on the question of the marriage or the relevant and applicable law. So it follows that to the extent that I express, within the context of an examination of the relevant law, it as being agreed by counsel, I mean agreed by Mr Squire and Mr Bradshaw but with no dissent (when given the opportunity) by Mr Radcliffe on behalf of GK and MAK.</p>

More than 60 years ago it was decided that recognition of a marriage by proxy in a foreign country was not contrary to English public policy: Apt v Apt <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1948] P 83" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1948">[1948] P 83</ref> (CA). But these courts have not had to consider a marriage by telephone with one spouse in country A and the other in country B. It is for English law to determine where is the place of celebration. It may be in country A, or in country B. Some foreign authors suggest, in the case of proxy marriages, that it should be regarded as celebrated in both countries, thus requiring compliance with the formalities of each: Rabel, Conflict of Laws, 2</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span><span style="font-style:italic"> ed 1958, vol 1, pp 243-244</span></p>

Mrs Justice Roberts had made provision in her order of 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2022 for his attendance unless it was agreed by all parties that there was no need for it. In the face of what appeared to be a request that was not agreed by all parties, I did not see good reason to interfere with the arrangements made by Roberts J and to dispense with his attendance. Strongly urged on me also by Mr Radcliffe was a submission that I should set aside or otherwise interfere with the way in which Judges case managing the matter at earlier hearings had provided for the costs of the expert to be met.

There was discussion between counsel about whether I should hear evidence from the social worker for MK about the discovery of the purchase of those tickets. In circumstances where the updated information is that MAK has been interviewed by the police and bailed to  1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March next year and the question of any breach of the FMPO is being dealt with by the criminal justice system it was agreed that I need not hear from the social worker.  I have also &#8211; beyond seeking Mr Radcliffe&#8217;s assurance on direct instructions from his clients, that all expired as well as existing passports, whether issued by the Pakistan or United Kingdom authorities for MK , have been handed over to the police &#8211; not considered at this hearing any issue as to a breach which will take its course in the police investigation. It was therefore unnecessary for me to hear evidence on updating matters from the social worker whose written evidence I have within the trial bundles </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Professor Rehman in his 3 helpful reports had considered carefully the requirements and formalities for Islamic and Pakistani marriages. A Muslim marriage is essentially a contract of civil law between a man and a woman. Under Muslim personal law, the marriage (Nikah) is perceived as a contract of civil law between two consenting persons of sound mind, who have attained puberty. The contract can be oral or in writing. The Nikah is effected simply by an offer and an acceptance. The declarations of offer and acceptance are pronounced by the parties, or by their vakil (lawyer/representative) or wali (guardian) acting on their behalf. The requirement is that the marriage must be conducted in the presence of free witnesses: two men or one man and two women. </p>

The marriage contract is the only valid requirement in concluding a marriage under Islamic law; requirements such as privacy between the husband and wife or the consummation of marriage are not essential to the conclusion to valid marriage (although these factors might be legally relevant for the dissolution of the marriage) and requirements for valid marriage. However, there are some variations and differences in practice (for example, in relation to the role and authority of the marriage guardian).</p>

There were however as professor Rehman was clear in his oral evidence two further difficulties &#8211; first though not his particular area of expertise he saw there were likely issues in relation to the capacity of MK to make such a power of attorney; second there could not be a retrospective legitimising of the vakil for the ceremony which had already taken place and accordingly it would require a new ceremony to be undertaken.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within his written opinion Professor Rehman indicated that in the context of an invalid marriage, the cultural implications for MK are likely to be significant whether the court grants a decree of nullity on the basis that the marriage is void, or if it makes a declaration of non-recognition on the basis that the marriage is a non-marriage/non-qualifying ceremony. There would be considerable embarrassment within his immediate family and his community stemming from his inability to have the woman understood by that community to be his &#8216;bride&#8217; travel from Pakistan to join him. Further embarrassment would flow from the fact that he would not be able to have what would be perceived as a normal married life which would be the expectation for young males within the community. When the question of the cultural implications for MK if the marriage was not valid was revisited in oral evidence professor Rehman was more diffident in respect of MK. He did not regard there as being much in the way of direct cultural implication (as distinct from personal disappointment) for MK himself though the Professor maintained his view as to the likely community and cultural embarrassment for his family. Specifically, when asked by Mr Bradshaw it was not the professors view that there was any likely impediment to MK participating, to the extent that he already does, in community events or being included as a member of the community because of any decision taken (by whatever route) by this court about his invalid marriage </p>

Many members of her community and wider family would not be aware or understanding of the circumstances and reasons behind the English court&#8217;s decision and she is likely to be consistently tormented for bringing her community or family into disrepute through this &#8216;marriage&#8217;.</p>

In his substantive report he indicated that there are those equivalent concepts in the law of Pakistan. He had not by his third report explained where the distinction would fall in that jurisdiction. In the course of his oral evidence whilst Professor Rehman spoke of degrees of invalidity, he did not give a firm view so as to assist with the delineation between those two. He declined to be drawn into a wider review of all circumstances which might arise but his unequivocal view was that this case the failings of formalities were fundamental to the validity of the marriage. All of the deficiencies were troubling but the absence of a Nakil was seemingly fatal as far as he was concerned </p>

In his oral evidence, whilst maintaining that Pakistan law had those separate concepts, he was hesitant to say with certainty when asked, whether his view was that this situation fell into one or the other of those two situations.

If nullity were the appropriate course, a best interests decision would be required as to whether the Official Solicitor should petition for such a decree.

He has a good relationship with his parents and so far as contact with them is concerned will continue to see his mother. His contact with MAK will now be affected by the imposition of bail conditions following the arrest of MAK for breach of the FMPO. The plans for his care and support needs are amended so as to provide for a programme of educative work. MK&#8217;s social worker has exhibited an updated care and support plan and a risk assessment from the care provider in relation to his social media and internet use and access to pornography. It is the local authority&#8217;s intention to review these restrictions once MK has completed his educative work around sex and relationships, discussed below.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The restriction on access to the internet and in particular restricting his access to pornography is one that caused me some disquiet given his age and situation. I had been troubled by the way in which the local authority appeared to couch the need for it in terms of the convenience and comfort of younger female staff in terms of managing MK&#8217;s behaviour (which was less challenging when access to the internet was restricted) rather than it arising out of the focus on his needs. I have however heard submissions from the Local Authority, which are strongly supported by the Official solicitor, first that the restrictions in that regard are intended to be limited in time to the period during which educative work (as to which more below) is provided to MK and second that whilst the reference to the convenience and comfort of younger female staff is a matter of concern arising as it does from MK&#8217;s uninhibited behaviour, it is the knock on effect of that and the potential for it to de-stablise his care and otherwise settled placement which is the real driver for the restrictions. </p>

The trust is in the process of assessing MK&#8217;s level of attention so as to plan the structure and timescale for the course. It is recognised that MK&#8217;s capacity and also the need for restrictions on his access to the internet including to pornography will need to be revisited once the work has completed and the timescale for the work is likely to dictate the timing of such a review. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Radcliffe on behalf of GK and MAK takes a different position to that which the Local Authority and the Official solicitor adopt. He does not disagree with the imposition of the restrictions proposed but does take issue with the timing and to an extent the reasoning behind any restriction, in the sense that GK and MAK submit there are additional reasons of a religious and/or moral character.  He has submitted to me that MK is a member of a family whose members are strictly observant of the Islamic Faith; it is not in keeping with MK&#8217;s faith to be having access to pornography Amongst the tenets which he would be expected to follow (and submits Mr Radcliffe, had he capacity would choose himself to follow) is that he would not engage in masturbation. The practice of masturbation, submits Mr Radcliffe, is something which the Islamic Faith and Abrahamic faiths more generally deprecate. For the purposes of this hearing I am prepared to take that submission at face value. The use of pornography by MK and his access to it submits Mr Radcliffe encourages his interest in masturbation and so on behalf of GK and MAK he invites me at this hearing to authorise the restrictions on MK&#8217;s internet access permanently. I am not prepared to sanction or to consider sanctioning so significant a restriction on the liberty of a young man in his 20s on the evidence before me. On a best interests basis I will authorise it in the terms which the Local Authority and the Official solicitor invite me to. I will approve the care plan, which has been made available to me as a working document in its finalised form </p>

These have been most helpfully set out in detail in writing by Mr Radcliffe and were amplified orally.  Whilst it is conceded that the FMPO order of 8th August 2022 specifies that the GK and MAK shall bear, collectively, one half of the cost of Professor Rehman&#8217;s attendance, Mr Radcliffe submits that I should vary that order for the  following reasons (which I paraphrase from the detail of the oral and written submissions). </p>

There may be other circumstances in which the analogy to the appellate situation is apposite, but this is not it. The instruction of the expert was necessary and sanctioned as such by the court pursuant to part 25. The detailed case management by Roberts J on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2022 provided a mechanism whereby in the event that the parties were able to agree that attendance was not necessary he need not attend (and thus the cost of his attendance avoided). The parties were not agreed. His evidence was required. I do not accept the submission that the outcome as to how the Court is to treat the invalid marriage and the remedy consequent upon that decision is properly to be regarded as academic. Were it so it would not have required determination. Nor do I accept the submission that the fact that GK and MAK, the respondents to the application for a FMPO which has been continued at this hearing, did not seek to cross examine or challenge his findings provides a reason to vary the order of Roberts J and I decline to do so. </p>
