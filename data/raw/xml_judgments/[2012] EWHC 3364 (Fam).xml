Mr and Mrs E now have a 12 year old child of their own.  Ms J gave birth to A in England in 2005, when she was aged just 16.  In 2006, when A was aged one, Ms J went back to the United States, leaving A with the grandparents. Ms J did not return and she and A did not meet for the next six years.  A was brought up by the grandparents, the mother&#8217;s only involvement being through video contact in more recent times.</span></p>

However, Mr B, the applicant in these proceedings, claimed paternity and DNA tests, carried out in February 2006, established that he is A&#8217;s biological father.  From that point on, he undertook a significant role in her life.  He has had regular contact, including staying contact, though interspersed with several periods of imprisonment.  A has also had significant contact with her paternal grandmother.  Since about early 2011, she would be picked up from school by the father or his mother on most Fridays and returned to the grandparents on Sunday afternoon.  Although the grandparents comment unfavourably about some aspects of the father&#8217;s contact, it nonetheless took place as described. </span></p>

The first point is that the expression &#8216;habitually resident&#8217;, as used in Art. 3 of the Convention, is nowhere defined. It follows, I think, that the expression is not to be treated as a term of art with some special meaning, but is rather to be understood according to the ordinary and natural meaning of the two words which it contains. The second point is that </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:11pt">the question whether a person is or is not habitually resident in a specified country is a question of fact to be decided by reference to all the circumstances of any particular case</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:11pt">. The third point is that there is a significant difference between a person ceasing to be habitually resident in country A, and his subsequently becoming habitually resident in country B. </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:11pt">A person may cease to be habitually resident in country A in a single day if he or she leaves it with a settled intention not to return to it but to take up long-term residence in country B instead.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:11pt"> Such a person cannot, however, become habitually resident in country B in a single day. An appreciable period of time and a settled intention will be necessary to enable him or her to become so. During that appreciable period of time the person will have ceased to be habitually resident in country A but not yet have become habitually resident in country B. The fourth point is that, </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:11pt">where a child of J&#8217;s age is in the sole lawful custody of the mother, his situation with regard to habitual residence will necessarily be the same as hers.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:11pt"> (emphasis supplied)</span></p>

I do not read his words as intending to suggest that the habitual residence of a child is necessarily the same as that of the parent who alone has parental responsibility, notwithstanding that the child may have been living apart from that parent for a period which may have lasted for several years. That would be inconsistent with his second point that habitual residence is a question of fact. All he was saying was that where a young child is in the physical care of a mother who alone has parental responsibility for the child, then normally the child&#8217;s habitual residence will be the same as hers, since it is her will that determines the element of volition involved in the concept of habitual residence.</span></p>

In cases involving a wrongful removal from one Member State to another, Art. 10 BIIR provides that habitual residence in the first state is not lost until it is acquired in the second, along with other conditions including residence in the second state for at least a year.

The assessment must survey facts of all kinds.  Some will consist of events, some will arise from less tangible things such as feelings, relationships and intentions, and others will concern legal rights and wrongs.  As to the last, whether something is legal or not is a fact.  But unless there is a specific mandate for doing so, the overall assessment does not give automatic precedence to one kind of fact over another.  In particular, there may be circumstances in which habitual residence can be lost following an unlawful removal (for example, with the passage of time), and circumstances in which it will not be lost following a removal that is technically lawful (for example, removal by a parent with sole parental responsibility who has no actual relationship with the child).</span></p>

At other times, it will be less formal, and may require what is written to be read in the light of other information.  As an extreme example, one parent may telephone the other, explain at length what is proposed, and ask for consent.  In that situation, a text message in reply (</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">&#8216;I agree&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">) would theoretically suffice, even if something more elaborate might be wiser.</span></p>

This is credible in the light of an email from A&#8217;s school to the grandmother in May referring to the fact that the grandparents had told the school that they intended to emigrate to America, and asking whether A would be returning after June half term.  However, in response the grandmother told them that </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">&#8216;right now that won&#8217;t be going through&#8217;.</span></p>
