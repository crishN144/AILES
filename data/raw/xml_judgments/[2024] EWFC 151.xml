Tragically, the mother was involved in a car accident in Poland as a child that resulted in the death of her father and in her sustaining serious head injuries.  The mother now labours under an acquired brain injury that impacts her cognitive functioning and, the local authority asserts, her parenting capacity.  The mother moved to England with her own mother in in 1994 or 1995.</p>

The father arrived in this jurisdiction in 2010 as an unaccompanied asylum seeking child and spent time in foster care.  The father&#8217;s cognitive functioning is in the very low to borderline category. It is possible that the father also suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.  The father has indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom.  He does not appear on T&#8217;s birth certificate. However, a declaration of parentage in his favour was made on 14 September 2023 and he was granted parental responsibility for T on that date.</p>

On 7 March 2022, a referral was made to the local authority by a neonatal nurse following concerns regarding the parents&#8217; ability to care for T.  An Initial Child Protection Case Conference was convened on 30 March 2022 and T was made the subject of a Child Protection Plan.  Thereafter, T resided with his parents at the home of his maternal grandmother.  In November 2022 the father left the family home.  This resulted in the local authority issuing care proceedings on 24 November 2022.  At the first hearing on 19 December 2022 the court granted an interim supervision order, with T remaining in the care of his mother at the home of the maternal grandmother.  That order remains in place.</p>

In addition, an expert psychological assessment was undertaken with respect to the father.  The outcome of these assessments was negative and in October 2023 the mother was informed that the local authority was engaged in parallel planning with a view to seeking a final care order and an order authorising T&#8217;s placement for adoption.  On 17 November 2023, the local authority issued a C2 application seeking further directions in the context of the parents having refused to consent to an adoption medical for T.</p>

The mother did not inform the father, the local authority or the Children&#8217;s Guardian that she was intending to leave the jurisdiction.  The mother has remained in Poland with T since that date.  No party disputes that T was habitually resident in the jurisdiction of England and Wales for the purposes of Art 5 of the 1996 Hague Convention at the time he was removed from this jurisdiction by the mother.</p>

On 26 February 2024, the mother contacted her solicitors in this jurisdiction and informed them that she would like to return to England with T but that she would only do so if the local authority assured her that T would remain in her care in both the short and long term.

The welfare visit was commissioned by the District Court in &#321;om&#380;a and was completed by the Specialist Curator from the District Court.  The report consequent upon that visit, dated 4 March 2024, notes that T is cared for by his mother in Poland with the assistance of the maternal grandmother.  The report further records the mother as stating that she had left England as the authorities wished to remove T from her care.  She informed the Polish assessor that she wished to remain in Poland and renounce her British citizenship.  The maternal grandmother said she intended to return to England.  The report noted that T presented as well cared for in terms of clothing and hygiene and was well behaved. The report concluded that, on the basis of a one-off visit, the Specialist Curator did not form any negative impressions of T&#8217;s care.   During the course of April 2024, the social worker has seen T in video calls with the mother.  T has presented as happy, well and appropriately dressed.  No immediate safeguarding concerns have been noted.</p>

However, in circumstances where one of the issues in this case is whether the court has to date acquiesced to the removal of T from the jurisdiction for the purposes of Art 7(1)(a) of the 1996 Hague Convention, it is necessary to consider briefly the orders that have been made by the court since the mother removed T from the jurisdiction on 26 November 2023.</p>

The directions given by the learned judge included the provision of a final statement from the mother, together with a response to the final threshold document relied on by the local authority.  HHJ McKinnell also gave directions with respect to any application issued by the local authority for a placement order in respect of T.  At the IRH on 29 February 2024,  HHJ Jones gave directions to facilitate the provision by the local authority of a plan for a further parenting assessment of the mother in Poland and the disclosure of key documents to the Polish authorities via ICACU.  HHJ Jones listed the care proceedings for a further hearing on 12 March 2024 for consideration of the local authority&#8217;s plan for a further parenting assessment and the question of whether a request should be made for Poland to assume jurisdiction.  At the hearing on 12 March 2024, HHJ Jones refused an application by the Children&#8217;s Guardian for an independent social work assessment of the mother in Poland and directed the local authority to liaise with the Polish authorities with a view to seeking a further assessment of the mother by those authorities.  That assessment is now being undertaken and is awaited.  HHJ Jones thereafter reallocated the matter to this court.  On 14 March 2024, the mother applied to transfer jurisdiction to Poland pursuant to Art 8 of the 1996 Hague Convention.</p>

With respect to the question of whether rights of custody were also vested in the court at the time of the removal, Mr Setright and Ms Moore submit that the court is entitled to question whether the fact of being seised of proceedings under Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> vests such rights in the court.

Whilst accepting during his oral submissions that, as a matter of structure, Art 7(1) posits the question of habitual residence before Art 7(1)(a) posits the question of acquiescence, Mr Jarman submitted that where it is plain that that the court has not acquiesced to the removal of T for the purposes of Art 7(1)(a) and accordingly, in circumstances where the court had jurisdiction for the purposes of Art 5 of the 1996 Hague Convention at the date of removal, the court must retain that jurisdiction by operation of Art 7, it is not necessary in a case of alleged abduction to revisit the question of habitual residence as the basis for the court&#8217;s jurisdiction before concluding that the court retains jurisdiction in respect of T.  If the court is not with Mr Jarman and Ms George&#8217;s submission that habitual residence does not fall for consideration first, they submit that on the evidence before the court T remains habitually resident in the jurisdiction of England and Wales and therefore there has been no change of habitual residence for the purposes of Art 7(1).</p>

Mr Jarman and Ms George submit that, on the evidence before the court, a declaration of acquiescence would be entirely antithetic to T&#8217;s best interests.  During his oral submissions, Mr Jarman also contended that such a declaration would be contrary to public policy in that it would endorse the mother&#8217;s wrongful removal, would send entirely the wrong signal to other parents involved in public law proceedings and, in the circumstances, would fail to discourage respondents to public law proceedings from taking the same wrongful action.   Mr Jarman contended that, by acquiescing to the removal the court would, in effect, be endorsing a blatant child abduction designed to avoid child protection proceedings.  </p>

Art 8(2) provides an exhaustive list of the factors capable of demonstrating such a connection. Second, the transfer must be in the child's best interests. Third, both Contracting States must agree to the transfer of jurisdiction. With respect to the best interests criteria, the Practical Handbook further observes as follows:</p>

The import of Mr Jarman&#8217;s submission is that, in a case where Art 7 is potentially engaged, the court should first consider the question of acquiesence and, if satisfied that the relevant person, institution or any other body holding rights of custody has acquiesced to the relevant removal, the question of habitual residence is thereby rendered irrelevant.   However, the structure of Art 7 makes clear that the <span style="font-style:italic">first</span> question to be answered in determining whether jurisdiction has been retained by operation of Art 7 in a case of wrongful removal is whether &#8220;the child has acquired habitual residence in another State&#8221; for the purposes of Art 7(1).  If not, then the question of acquiesence under Art 7(1)(a) is never reached.   In <span style="font-style:italic">Hackney v P &amp; Ors (Jurisdiction: 1996 Hague Child Protection Convention)</span> at [94], Moylan LJ confirmed that in every case with a potentially rival foreign jurisdiction, the starting point is an enquiry into or consideration of where the child is habitually resident, as the connecting factor establishing jurisdiction.  In these circumstances, when determining whether Art 7 is engaged I am satisfied that the court should adhere to the analytical structure provided by that Article.  To leave out consideration of habitual residence in this case would be to fail to examine the condition precedent to the operation of Art 7.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">T has resided in Poland for a period of seven months since November 2023.  Given his age, this constitutes a significant proportion of his life.  Since his removal from this jurisdiction, T has been living in Poland within a household comprised of the same carers he had when living in England, i.e. his mother and the maternal grandmother. In the circumstances, the family environment in which he was integrated when in England has been replicated without interruption in Poland with respect to his primary and secondary carers. The mother and the maternal grandmother are both Polish citizens born in that jurisdiction and who speak Polish.  In the circumstances, those caring for T since birth are themselves well integrated into a family and social environment in Poland.   In terms of accommodation, T resides in a property in &#321;om&#380;a under indefinite tenancy.  The evidence demonstrates that the accommodation is well-equipped with toys and books for T. The welfare visit conducted by the Polish Curator noted, within the limitations inherent in a single visit, that T was happy and well in that environment.  T has started nursery school in &#321;om&#380;a and has been enrolled since 4 March 2024 from Mondays to Fridays from 8am to 2pm.  He is reported to have made friends at nursery.  Two close family members live a short distance from the home. The mother has made an application for child benefit for T in Poland and T has been registered with a doctor in that jurisdiction.</p>

I further acknowledge that T was born in England in February 2022 and resided in this jurisdiction until the point of his removal. Whilst the mother contends that she intended to return to Poland with T permanently, there is some evidence that she sought a return to the jurisdiction of England and Wales subject to guarantees from the local authority that they would not seek to remove T from her care.  However, each of these matters must be set against the matters summarised in the foregoing paragraph which would, I am satisfied, have resulted in T becoming integrated in a social and family environment in Poland relatively quickly following his removal to that jurisdiction, notwithstanding he had resided in this jurisdiction prior to that point. It is not necessary for T to be fully integrated in a social and family environment in Poland before becoming habitually resident in that jurisdiction and there is no requirement that he should have been resident in the country in question for a particular period of time before such a position is reached.  The evidence points to his situation in Poland over the period in which he has been there as having been stable and all of the central members in T&#8217;s life in England have moved with him to Poland.  </p>

Nonetheless, and having expressed herself to be &#8220;greatly attracted to the proposition that, where the court is actively seised of proceedings to determine rights of custody, removal of the child from the jurisdiction without leave of the court while those proceedings remain pending is a breach of the rights of custody attributable to the court&#8221;, Hale J concluded that rights of custody vested in the court for the purposes of the 1980 Hague Convention based on the pendency of the proceedings alone.

As already seen, the purpose of the Hague Convention of 1980 is to secure that children are returned so that the merits of decisions concerning their custody can be determined in the courts of the country where they are habitually resident. There is something particularly repugnant about a litigant seeking to frustrate the processes of the law in this way. This emboldens me to conclude that the removal of the W. children was wrongful within the meaning of the Convention because it was in breach of rights of custody attributable to the court.&#8221;</p>

The House of Lords held that, giving the 1980 Hague Convention a purposive construction and construing the term &#8220;rights&#8221; widely, a court could be an &#8220;other body&#8221; for the purposes of Art 8 of the 1980 Hague Convention.  As I have noted, the term &#8220;other body&#8221; is also used in Art 7 of the 1996 Hague Convention.  Having conducted an extensive review of the domestic and international case law, including <span style="font-style:italic">B v B</span>, their Lordships further held that the court acquires rights of custody for the purposes of Art 5 of the 1980 Hague Convention if its jurisdiction has been invoked in respect of matters of custody within the meaning of that Convention.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;There are two aspects to this matter. First of all the application to the court must raise matters of custody within the meaning of the Convention and that will require in every case a consideration of the terms of the application. Secondly, a question arises as to the time at which the court acquires such right. It is clear that the interpretation which has been accepted of the Convention which allows the possibility of a court having rights of custody does not contemplate that happening unless there is an application to the court in a particular case raising the issue of the custody of one or more children. The date at which such application confers these rights is a matter which has not been the subject of detailed consideration in relation to the Convention.

It is true that interim orders may be made before service and special cases may arise but generally speaking I would think it a reasonable rule that at the latest when the proceedings have been served the jurisdiction has been invoked and unless the proceedings are stayed or some equivalent action has been taken I would treat the court's jurisdiction as being continuously invoked thereafter until the application is disposed of.&#8221;</p>

Holding, following the decision of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (Abduction: Rights of Custody)</span>, that upon the court being seized of an application that involves the court's discretion and jurisdiction to determine the child's place of residence it is seized of rights of custody in respect of the child or children to which the application related, Macur J further held that the application under Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> &#8220;raised matters of custody&#8221; and that service of the proceedings on parents granted the court rights of custody which would endure until the proceedings were stayed or some equivalent action taken.

But, on the other hand, the wrongful removal, if it persists, is a fact that cannot be ignored to such a point as to deprive the authorities of the new State, which has become that of the new habitual residence of the child, of this jurisdiction over protection. The difficulty consists therefore in determining the temporal threshold from which jurisdiction would pass from the authorities of the State from which the child has been wrongfully removed, to those of the country to which he or she has been taken or in which he or she has been retained.&#8221;</p>

In the circumstances, I am satisfied in this case that the care proceedings issued by the local authority on 24 November 2022, which have been served on the parents and in which the court has made orders and case management directions, operate to attribute rights of custody to the English court for the purposes of Art 7 of the 1996 Hague Convention.</p>

In order for the removal to be wrongful for the purposes of Art 7 of the 1996 Hague Convention, the removal must have been in breach of the rights of custody that I am satisfied were vested in the court, and the court must have been exercising those rights of custody at the time the removal took place, or would have exercised the rights of custody but for the removal.   I am satisfied that each of these requirements are met in this case.  The removal of T from the jurisdiction was a unilateral action by the mother without reference to, and was not sanctioned by, the court in which rights of custody in respect of T were vested.  This, I am satisfied, amounted to a breach of the court&#8217;s rights of custody.  I am also satisfied that the court was exercising rights of custody at the time the removal took place.  On 26 November 2023, the proceedings were continuing and the court was continuing to pro-actively case manage those proceedings, the local authority having issued on 17 November 2023 a C2 application seeking further directions in the context of the parents having refused to consent to an adoption medical for T.   That this ongoing court process amounts to the court exercising its rights of custody is, in my judgment, the logical extension of the analysis set out above regarding the manner by which those rights of custody vested in the court. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In cases such as this, where the question of acquiescence concerns the position of the court rather than the position of a parent, I consider that an objective test based on actions taken or not taken by the court is more attractive than a requirement to search, in the alternative or in addition, for the subjective intention of the court.  This is particularly so where it is unlikely that a court would take an action suggesting one outcome whilst intending a different outcome, where the action taken by the court, and often the reasons for taking that action, are formally recorded in a contemporaneous order and where a case may have come before more than one judge, meaning that a number of judicial minds have been brought to bear on the case.  This is not to exclude the possibility of cases in which it is more difficult to divine the position from actions taken or not taken by the court, for example where there have been no further hearings at the point at which the question of acquiescence falls for determination or where the aim of decisions taken by the court is ambiguous. In such cases, it might be necessary to seek to divine what was in the mind of the court.  However, ordinarily, it should be possible to decide whether or not a court in which rights of custody vest has acquiesced for the purposes of Art 7(1)(a) by examining, on their face, the actions taken or not taken by that court subsequent to, and in some cases prior to, the removal.  This is one such case.  Applying the foregoing principles, I am satisfied that the court has not to date acquiesced to the removal of T.  </p>

The content of those orders indicates that the court continued to make decisions towards the determination of the application before it, including directing on 6 December 2023 further questions to the ISW, the provision of final evidence, care plans, final threshold document and report from the Children&#8217;s Guardian and listing an IRH.

The mother and the Children&#8217;s Guardian invite the court to determine the application under Art 8, although they seek different outcomes.  In the circumstances of this case however, the local authority and the father advocate a third course, namely that the court should simply declare that it now acquiesces to the mother&#8217;s wrongful removal of T during the course of these care proceedings and communicate that decision to the jurisdiction of Poland via the Central Authority.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The 1996 Hague Convention expressly provides, in the form of Arts 8 and 9 of the Convention, a mechanism by which jurisdiction can be transferred from one Contracting State to another where one Contracting State has or retains substantive jurisdiction but it may be appropriate for another Contracting State to exercise that substantive jurisdiction.  Both Art 8 and Art 9 set out a clear test by reference to which the authority of the Contracting State having jurisdiction can decide whether or not to make a request for transfer.  With respect to Art 8, this test centres on the extent to which the Contracting State to whom the request is to be made is better placed to assess the child&#8217;s best interests and the nature and extent of the links between the child and that State.  Importantly, a requirement of Art 8 is that both Contracting States must agree to the transfer of jurisdiction before a transfer can take place.  Art 8 is not only provides a mechanism by which a request is to be made, but also an opportunity for the requested State to make a considered decision as to whether to accept jurisdiction.  In this jurisdiction, Chapter 6, Section 2 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 provides a clear procedural regime governing requests under Art 8 and Art 9.  In this jurisdiction, there is also a body of case law which provides guidance on the manner in which the domestic court should deal with the question of transfer of jurisdiction under Arts 8 and 9 of the 1996 Hague Convention (see for example <span style="font-style:italic">JA v TH (1996 Hague Convention: Request to Exercise Jurisdiction) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2017] 2 FLR 250" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] 2 FLR 250</ref> and AM and <span style="font-style:italic">GM v KL and VL</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2023] 2 FLR 1131" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2023">[2023] 2 FLR 1131</ref>).</p>

This provides an opportunity for the requested Contracting State to consider whether or not to accept the transfer of the jurisdiction held or retained by the requesting Contracting State.

In particular, Poland would not formally be on notice that the jurisdiction of England and Wales sought to transfer its retained jurisdiction to Poland, would not be on notice of the reasons why the jurisdiction of England and Wales considered this the proper course and would have no say on whether that course of action was acceptable to it.  A transfer of jurisdiction would be effected, but it would be effected peremptorily, rather than in the considered and co-operative manner envisaged by the transfer provisions expressly included in the 1996 Hague Convention.

As set out above, the aim of Art 7 is to ensure that a person who wrongfully removes a child from the Contracting State having jurisdiction should not be able to take advantage of that act in order to modify, for his or her own benefit, the jurisdiction of the authorities called upon to take measures of protection for the child.  It would in my judgement be undesirable for a court to choose to acquiescence to the wrongful removal of a child from the jurisdiction during the course of care proceedings with which it is seised without any principled consideration, by reference to the terms of the Convention, of whether the jurisdiction the court retains should be transferred.  Such a course would be tantamount to stating that a parent can, without more, successfully effect the transfer of jurisdiction from one Contracting State to another by wrongfully removing the child during proceedings.  In cases where the court has retained jurisdiction by operation of Art 7 this is a further, and to my mind powerful, reason for considering the question of transfer of jurisdiction under the process and criteria expressly laid out by Art 8, rather than by way of the court choosing to acquiesce to the wrongful removal of the child pursuant to Art 7(1)(a).</p>

As this court further noted in <span style="font-style:italic">AM and GM v KL and VL</span>, the reason for this is self-evident in circumstances where the authorities in the country of the children's habitual residence are closer to, and will ordinarily have a greater understanding of, the children and their social and family environment and are therefore, ordinarily, better able to assess fully the children's situation and welfare needs when reaching decisions about the children's best interests.  In these circumstances, whilst the fact that T&#8217;s habitual residence has moved to the jurisdiction of Poland will not be determinative of the mother&#8217;s application under Art 8, I accept Mr Setright and Ms Moore&#8217;s submission that T&#8217;s changed habitual residence is a factor strongly supportive of a conclusion that the jurisdiction of Poland is now better placed to assess the best interests of T.</p>

At the present time the Polish authorities are undertaking a further assessment of the mother and T.

Whilst the Children&#8217;s Guardian strongly opposes the transfer of jurisdiction to Poland and instead argues that the court should make an interim care order and seek the return of T to this jurisdiction, as I have noted, Mr Jarman conceded that that this course of action would require the court to impose on the local authority an order that it no longer seeks and would rely on the mother now co-operating with the orders of the English court.  In the circumstances, whilst the court does not endorse and indeed strongly deprecates the actions of the mother in wrongfully removing T from the jurisdiction of England and Wales, the fact of the mother&#8217;s co-operation in Poland, as against her refusal to return to the jurisdiction of England and Wales, is another factor that supports a conclusion that the jurisdiction of Poland, in which T is now habitually resident and in which the authorities have engaged with the mother, is better placed to assess the best interests of T.</p>

In permitting the local authority to withdraw its application Gwynneth Knowles J emphasised the positive obligations on the public authorities in this jurisdiction and in the other Contracting State to extend cooperation set out in Chapter V of the 1996 Hague Convention.</p>
