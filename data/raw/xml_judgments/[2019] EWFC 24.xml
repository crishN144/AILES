She says her petition of that date is well founded.  The Respondent, Jurgen Pierburg, says there was no jurisdiction at that date and the petition should be dismissed.  I propose to refer to them throughout this judgment as &#8220;the Wife&#8221; and &#8220;the Husband&#8221; to avoid confusion.  I mean no disrespect to either by so doing. </p>

Just prior to the marriage, on 9 September 1985, they entered a marriage contract before Notary Kolkmann in Neuss.  The contract states that the marital property regime is that of separation of property.  It also waives any claim for maintenance even in the event of hardship, provided it is legally possible.  The Wife says that this gives her no financial entitlement following the breakdown of the marriage.  She also says she had no legal advice and there was no financial disclosure, but I have not heard the Husband&#8217;s case on this and have not investigated the matter.   </p>

They visited together a property that was for sale near Zurich in November 2017 and the Wife attended the staff Christmas Party at the Chateau in December 2017.  She says that the Husband then told her that she must return to the Chateau by 15 January 2018 or he would commence divorce proceedings in Germany relying on nationality.  The Husband alleges that this forced the Wife&#8217;s hand such that she issued her divorce petition here on 12 January 2018.  In her petition, the Wife claimed to be domiciled and habitually resident in England and Wales, having resided here for at least six months immediately prior to the presentation of the petition. The petition itself is based on <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(2)</ref>(b) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>, namely that the Respondent has behaved in such a way that she cannot reasonably be expected to live with him.   </p>

The jurisdiction pleaded is that both spouses are German citizens.  The ground for divorce is that the marriage has broken down, the spouses having lived apart for more than one year.  The document does contain claims that are now in issue such as that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">according to her statement, the Wife has lived in England since the separation</span>&#8221; and that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">according to her statement, she has no longer had her normal place of residence in Switzerland for over one year</span>&#8221;.

He says that the Wife is passionate about England and that it was obvious from very early on that she would much prefer to live in England than Switzerland.  He says that, when he discovered the marriage had broken down, he knew immediately that the Wife would want to get away from Switzerland.  She has immersed herself completely in life in London. </p>

He contends that his Wife has not abandoned her German domicile of origin and did not satisfy the necessary residence requirements here on 12 January 2018.  He contends that the focus of the couple&#8217;s lives, particularly that of the Wife, remained very much in Germany even after the move to Switzerland.  He alleges that the only change was the physical place where they slept.  He says that she never expressed any wish to him to live in London.  She was only in England for 33 nights from the beginning of 2017 to mid-August 2017.  It is only since then that her time here has dramatically increased. </p>

She says she poured herself into that new life.  They largely used English and French suppliers.  Her day to day bank accounts were in Switzerland from 2000 although they are now in London.  She has not used her German mobile for years.  She did go to Dusseldorf on average once per month for one or two nights to see her mother and siblings, staying in the Steigenberger Hotel.

In the alternative, she was habitually resident here on 12 January 2018 and had been resident here for at least twelve months before then (indent 5).

If he is wrong about that, he says the Wife was not resident here throughout those periods.  He argues that her presence here before 15 August 2017 was intermittent, transient and decidedly temporary. To reside here, you must live here.  He says she lived in Switzerland not England.

I therefore do so although I do not consider that this is one of those cases where the matter is central to my decision.  First, I must decide whether or not either spouse has deliberately told lies either to me or in their written statements.  If I find that they did, I have to ask myself why they lied.  The mere fact that a witness tells a lie is not in itself evidence that the issues in the case should be decided against that witness.  A witness may lie for many reasons.  They may possibly be &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">innocent</span>&#8221; ones in the sense that they are not relevant to the issues in this case.   For example, they may be lies to bolster a true case; or to conceal some other conduct not related to the matters with which I am dealing; or out of panic, distress or confusion. It follows that, if I find that a witness has lied, I must assess whether there is an &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">innocent</span>&#8221; explanation for those lies.  However, if I am satisfied that there is no such explanation, I can take the lies into account in my assessment of the issues in the case.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">There is no dispute that, for these purposes, you can only have one habitual residence.  Habitual residence is defined as the place where the person has established, on a fixed basis, his or her permanent or habitual centre of interests.  All relevant facts will be taken into account in determining that.  There is no specific timeframe for having established habitual residence. In some cases, it can be done very quickly.  In others, it will take longer.  If there is a planned, purposeful and permanent relocation to another country, habitual residence can be acquired contemporaneously (or virtually contemporaneously) with the loss of a previous habitual residence.  For example, in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Z v Z</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2009/2626" uk:canonical="[2009] EWHC 2626 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] EWHC 2626 (Fam)</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] 1 FLR 694" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] 1 FLR 694</ref>, Ryder J found that a wife had established habitual residence in England &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">at or shortly after</span>&#8221; the family moved to London. </p>

The example given by Munby J in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Marinos</span> is that of a wife who lost her habitual residence in Greece as the aircraft on which she and the children were travelling to London took off.

Unlike with habitual residence, a person can be resident in two countries at the same time (see <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Marinos</span> at Paragraph [48] and <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">V v V</span> at Paragraphs [50] and [51]).  The obvious example would be the wife in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Marinos</span> who had homes in Greece (where her husband and children lived) and in England (where she worked and lived with her parents).  In that case, she divided her time roughly equally between the two, but I accept Mr Howard&#8217;s submission that it does not have to be equal.  He postulated the case of a barrister who lives and works in London from Monday to Friday and goes home to his/her family in Dorset (per Mr Howard) or France every weekend.  </p>

It has to be somewhere where you reside as opposed to where you visit.  The most obvious example would be a holiday home which would not amount to residence, but another example might be the super-rich who own numerous homes all around the world.  They visit these homes.  They do not reside in each and every one of them.    </p>

He was particularly influenced by the fact that the wording did not say something like &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">is habitually resident and has been habitually resident for at least [the request period]</span>&#8221;.

In my view, they show clearly that my provisional interpretation is correct.  Mr Leech reminds me that the regulation is not an English statute promulgated solely in English.  It is an EU regulation existing in 24 different languages, each of which is of equal standing.  Moreover, there was an Explanatory Report prepared by Dr Alegria Borras (&#8220;The Borras Report&#8221;).  Munby J had quoted from the English version of the report (in particular section 32) in his judgment in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Marinos</span>.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Leech argues that these variations are not sloppy work on the part of the EU&#8217;s legal translators.  Rather, he says, they come from the fact that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">habitual residence&#8221;</span> and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">residence&#8221;</span> are interchangeable in this context, the latter being shorthand for the former.  He adds that the German version of indent 2 itself includes the words &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">gewohnlichen Aufenthalt</span>&#8221; (&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">habitual residence</span>&#8221;) twice whereas our version only refers to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">resides</span>&#8221; the second time, but he accepts that the other indents are in the same terms as in English.  Mr Howard makes the fair point that it is inconceivable that this would have happened if Mr Leech was correct.  Although I have found the foreign translations of Paragraph 32 to support my interpretation, I agree with Mr Howard that the German version of the main text does not assist me.   </p>

She told me that she launched her divorce petition on 12 January 2018 because she had been told the Husband intended to issue proceedings in Germany if she did not return to him by 15 January 2018.  It follows that the date of the petition was not a date chosen on the basis that she had, at that point, established jurisdiction here but rather because she could not afford to be second in time given the way in which the Council Regulation works.  This does not mean there was not jurisdiction on 12 January 2018, but it does give rise to the need for close scrutiny of the position at that date.  In fact, the Husband could not have issued divorce proceedings in Germany until they had been separated for a year, but it is clear that the Wife did not realise this. She would have had to have issued by the end of January 2018 in any event.   </p>

She said she had decided to move here full-time in February 2017 although that begs the question as to why she did not do so at that point.  She explained her return to the Chateau on 18 July 2017 as being to pack her belongings, telling me that she still had a lot of clothes in Switzerland.  This does not, of course, explain why it took her a week to do so.  </p>

He was particularly scathing of Paragraph 30 of her first statement in which she made comments relating to contact with Germany after they moved to Germany such as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I was told our contact with Germany had to be extremely limited&#8221;</span>; &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">we ceased to spend any time in Dusseldorf&#8221;; </span>and<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;Jurgen said that we must have a total cut from our life in Germany&#8221;</span>.  She agreed that these sentences were inaccurate. She said she should have said that they did not spend time there as a family.  It is right that she did mention, later in the statement, that she continued to visit her mother in Germany, but the schedules showed that she went to Dusseldorf at least monthly, staying in a hotel there.  All her doctors and her dentist were there.  Her hairdresser and her beautician were there.   She got flowers from Germany and she remained on the German Voting List for the 2017 Bundestag election.  She told me that it mattered to her what was going on in Germany.  Mr Marks pointed out that the application form was dated 13 June 2017 and gave the Chateau in Switzerland as her address not Kinnerton Street.  I accept entirely that she has the right to vote and has done nothing wrong by doing so, although this may be an important consideration in relation to domicile.  Overall, I accept Mr Marks&#8217; submission that her statements in Paragraph 30 were inaccurate and were misleading. </p>

She accepted she did not live in London for many years.  She said it was a second home and she visited London regularly.  She added that it would not have been correct to give the London address for the electoral register.  She explained her retention of her gynaecologist in Germany on the basis that she had known him for thirty years and he had been her obstetrician for Valentin&#8217;s birth.  She trusted him but, she said, she has now started a completely new life here and therefore obtained new doctors here.  Mr Marks suggested that it was as easy to get to Dusseldorf from London as it was from Geneva, but she said it was logical to use Germany when in Switzerland as the family office was in Dusseldorf.  I do not accept this explanation.  I find that her change was, at least in part, motivated by another factor, namely the need to establish jurisdiction here.</p>

She was asked why she returned to Switzerland on 18 July 2017 for a week and had spent 21 nights in Switzerland, as against only 12 nights here, between 12 July 2017 and 15 August 2017.  She reiterated that she started a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">completely new life here</span>&#8221; on 12 July 2017.  She did not know if she had a return ticket on 12 July 2017 but accepted she may have done, as she normally travelled on return tickets.  I find, on the balance of probabilities, that she did travel here with a return ticket on 12 July 2017.  She said she returned to Switzerland for a week as she had not brought with her all her most important things on 12 July 2017. She had only brought two suitcases.  She packed a further two which she brought on 24 July 2017.  She said it took time as she had to do it surreptitiously to avoid the staff knowing what she was doing.  I cannot accept </p>

She then said that she would not have loved to go back to Germany during their time in Switzerland, but I cannot accept this.  It may be that she did not have many friends there and those she did have were mostly friends of her Husband, but I cannot accept she did not have any friends of her own there.  Her family, including her mother, was there.  Her doctors were there. Her hairdresser and beautician were there.  It is agreed that she did not throw herself into life in Switzerland and that she was isolated there.

His statement was also misleading in that he had said that Switzerland was merely &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the physical place where we slept</span>&#8221;.  Mr Marks was constrained to accept this was hyperbole, but it was as inaccurate as the Wife&#8217;s Paragraph 30.  He also said to me that his Wife&#8217;s sole link to Switzerland was the Chateau.  I cannot accept this, given that their son, Valentin, was living in Zurich but I accept that the Wife was not even close to being fully integrated in Switzerland.  He said that she was socially isolated there and did not have any friends there.  I accept this evidence.  It paints a very sad and unhappy picture.  He accepted that she had to go somewhere after the breakdown of the marriage but told me that she was in Switzerland regularly until August 2017 and he was of the view that she did not move to London until then.  He rightly accepted that she was habitually resident here by the date of her petition in January 2018 as England was her &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">centre of interests</span>&#8221; by then.  He repeated that she was only living in England from midAugust 2017.  She still has clothes in the Chateau to this day. </p>

I accept that it is possible to move your habitual residence in one day.  The most obvious example is a family who emigrate.  I accept she came to this country on 12 July 2017 and stayed here for a longer period (six nights) than she had previously stayed here during the previous two and a half years (two to three nights) but she then returned to Switzerland.  Unlike the position after 15 August 2017, she did not return for only two or three nights.  She returned for seven nights.  This was far longer than she needed to pack a couple of suitcases.  Even then, she only came back here for three nights before spending a further eleven nights out of this country (ten of those nights being in Switzerland and one in Germany).  She then had three further nights here before spending four nights in Switzerland.  I find that it follows that she did not emigrate here on 12 July 2017.  From then to the 15 August 2017, she spent 12 nights in the UK but 22 nights away, 21 of which were in Switzerland.  Whist I recognise that it is not just a night count, there is insufficient evidence to find that the situation changed so dramatically on 12 July 2017.   </p>

Indeed, she was here for all but 16 nights until the end of the year.  Of those sixteen nights, she spent ten in Switzerland and six in Germany.  She had separated from her Husband and it cannot be said she was habitually resident in Switzerland.  I have already found that she was not habitually resident here on 12 July 2017.  I am clear that she remained habitually resident in Switzerland until 15 August 2017 on which day she became habitually resident in this country.  This finding is not sufficient to give jurisdiction pursuant to indent six on my interpretation of that indent as it does not amount to the requisite six months of habitual residence.   </p>

She came here for the opera, for the ballet, to visit Dumfries House and to see friends such as Lady Chichester, but she did not live here.  Her decision in St Moritz in February 2017 that she would reside here in the future was not sufficient until she did move here.  I accept she told Lady Chichester that she &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">would love</span>&#8221; to live here but that again is a declaration for the future.  She said the same to Mr Fawcett, namely that she &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">would want to be in London</span>&#8221;.  Could it be said that she resided here from 12 July 2017 given that she spent six nights here at that point, which was more than she had spent before?  Whilst it might be a possible interpretation, I am unclear what she did whilst she was here during that period.  I have rejected her case that this was the permanent move to this country.  On the balance of probabilities, I find that she was not residing here until 15 August 2017 by which time she had brought her most important personal belongings here from Switzerland.  I remind myself that her evidence was that she returned to Switzerland on 18 July 2017 as she had not brought with her &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">all her most important things</span>&#8221;.

I reject, without question, the contention that she established a domicile of choice in Switzerland.  It is accepted that she was not happy there.  She felt socially isolated.  She had no real friends.  Indeed, she left Switzerland once the marriage had broken down.  Throughout her time there, she maintained many links with Germany.  She was in Switzerland because she loved her Husband and he told her they had to reside there for tax reasons.  I reject her evidence that she would not have gone back to Germany if he had said they could.  She remained domiciled in Germany. </p>

There are many factors that have to be weighed in the balance, one of which is that she has been attempting to establish jurisdiction in this court.  This court deals with a very significant number of divorces involving the very wealthy, who have moved to this country.  Almost always, they have told the authorities here that they are not domiciled in this country.  They do this for legitimate tax reasons.  Indeed, if the Pierburgs had bought a house in Petworth and moved here together, I am sure that they would have claimed non-domicile status.    </p>

It would be as easy to continue to use these people from London as it was from Switzerland.  It is difficult to see why she would not want to do so, other than that she needed to establish jurisdiction here.  Mr Marks reminds me of dicta in a case called <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Drevon v Drevon</span> (1864) 34 LJ Ch 129 at 133 where the court refers to the importance of trivial acts which may be of more weight to determining domicile than acts of more importance.  He relies on the voting form.  Of course, it is her right to vote in Germany, but it does show an active interest and involvement in the politics of that country that could be said to be inconsistent with a change of domicile to this country. </p>

There is no point speculating as to the figure, but I will assume, for these purposes, that it would be sufficient for her to have more than one home. I further assume that she is advised that there is no legitimate tax reason why she cannot purchase accommodation in Germany.  I am clear that she would consider doing so very seriously.  Indeed, on the balance of probabilities, I find she would do so.  This does not mean she would not retain her home here.  She would be able to see her friends here and to enjoy the culture of London.  She might well remain habitually resident here but why would she not want a home in Germany as well?  She could use it to visit her family; her long standing doctors and dentist; her beautician; and some friends that she must have there.

Once the divorce is over, that will be the time for her to take an informed decision on domicile.  Time will tell.  In ten years, if she is still here and has no home in Germany, she may well have established domicile here.
