	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I start with the analogous question in relation to welfare proceedings about children, beginning with wardship. It is quite clear, in my judgment, that there is not, and never has been, any requirement that the ward be a party to the wardship proceedings. That was the position in the days before 1971 when wardship was still in chancery: see <span style="font-style:italic">Daniell&#8217;s Chancery Practice</span>, ed 8, 1914, Vol 1, p 976 and, in particular, <span style="font-style:italic">In re an Infant</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1950] Ch 629" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1950">[1950] Ch 629</ref>, 632, where Roxburgh J said:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;At first sight, it might seem strange to make an order about a person who is not a party to the proceedings. On the other hand, the infant is generally very young, and the appointment of a guardian ad litem and service on him or her involves expense which generally results in no corresponding benefit. The court would, of course, not make the order if in doubt whether it was for the infant&#8217;s benefit, and it has indisputable jurisdiction to order the infant to be made a respondent if it desires to do so. For example, the infant might be approaching full age; or the parties might be so much wrapped up in matrimonial disputes that they cared nothing for the infant. The court has an unfettered discretion. But I propose to express the view, after consultation with my brethren of the Chancery Division, that an infant should not be made a respondent to an originating summons under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2007/29" uk:canonical="2007 c. 29" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> unless the master or a judge so directs&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That remained the position thereafter, following the transfer of wardship to the Family Division. As <span style="font-style:italic">Lowe &amp; White</span>, Wards of Court, ed 2, 1986, para 9-7, put it, &#8220;There is no requirement that a ward be made a party to wardship proceedings.&#8221; Indeed, a Practice Direction made in December 1981, following comments made by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">In re F (A Minor) (Adoption: Parental Consent)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1982] 1 WLR 102" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1982">[1982] 1 WLR 102</ref>, spelt out that &#8220;only in special circumstances should the child be joined&#8221;: <span style="font-style:italic">Practice Direction (Child: Joinder As Party)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1982] 1 WLR 118" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1982">[1982] 1 WLR 118</ref>. That Practice Direction is no longer in force, but rule 12.37(1) of the Family Procedure Rules 2010, carrying forward in somewhat different language provisions previously in rule 5.1(3) of the Family Proceedings Rules 1991, provides that, &#8220;A child who is the subject of wardship proceedings must not be made a respondent to those proceedings unless the court gives permission.&#8221; </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The case of wards of Court and lunatics stands on a different footing. There the judge who is administering their affairs, in the exercise of what has been called a paternal jurisdiction delegated to him from the Crown through the Lord Chancellor, is not sitting merely to decide a contested question. His position as an administrator as well as judge may require the application of another and overriding principle to regulate his procedure in the interest of those whose affairs are in his charge &#8230; In the two cases of wards of Court and of lunatics the Court is really sitting primarily to guard the interests of the ward or the lunatic. Its jurisdiction is in this respect parental and administrative, and the disposal of controverted questions is an incident only in the jurisdiction.&#8221;</p>

In other words, the ambit of the litigation is determined, not by the parties, but by the court, because the function of the court is not to determine in a disinterested way a dispute brought to it by the parties, but rather, to engage in a process of assessing whether an adult is lacking in capacity, and if so, making decisions about his welfare that are in his best interests.&#8221;</p>

I cannot accept either limb of the argument.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is not for me in this judgment to advise the Committee how to proceed. There is, however, one aspect of the matter to which the Committee will, I suggest, need to give careful consideration. It is essential that where the issue concerns P&#8217;s deprivation of liberty the Court of Protection&#8217;s processes are rigorous, so that the circumstances of the individual case are subjected, as they must be, to the strict scrutiny demanded by the Convention. Both our domestic law and the Convention impose demanding standards. But the need to meet this challenge must not be allowed to lead to a system of technical requirements which may, in the real world, operate to deny P the speedy access to a judicial determination which is the very essence of what is required. To speak plainly, the Committee will have to consider how best to craft a process which, while it meets the demanding requirement of the law, also has regard to the realities consequent upon (a) the legal aid regime and (b) the exposure of a litigation friend to a costs risk. There is no point in a system which requires there to be a litigation friend, let alone which requires the litigation friend to instruct lawyers, if the reality is that there is, because of an absence of legal aid and possible exposure to an adverse costs order, no-one willing and able to accept appointment as litigation friend. Indeed, such a system would be self-defeating. And in this connection it needs to be remembered that the Official Solicitor can never be compelled to accept appointment. Moreover, as I understand it, he is not funded to act as a litigation friend in deprivation of liberty cases, so he is dependent on external funding which in many cases will not be available in the absence of legal aid. </p>
