It began when H laid a trap for W by issuing but not serving a petition for divorce in England on 21 September 2020, obtaining a without notice freezing order on 2 October 2020, and then serving his divorce petition and order late that night, a few days after W&#8217;s return to London from Russia.  </p>

The total costs of their litigation about jurisdiction, children and money are now approaching &#163;9m.  Every penny of this has been funded by W.  There are a series of cost orders made against H to which I will refer later which present particular difficulties in this case.  </p>

Since then in the money proceedings alone, I have conducted a 7 day preliminary issue hearing as to the ownership of a London flat and this hearing was listed for 13 days, although it took less long.  There have been 13 directions hearings before me according to the bundle provided.  If I were to add in the children proceedings before me, I must have seen these parties in court on some 40-50 different days.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">H had been hospitalised in Greece for one month between mid-October &#8211; mid-November suffering from severe depression.  A reporting English consultant psychiatrist has described his severe depression as lasting from the date of his admission to the end of 2022.  He does not venture an opinion as to whether and for how long H did not have capacity.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">After his discharge from hospital I next saw H on 19 January 2023 when he appeared before me in person.  He was lucid and coherent and appeared very much to be the same person that I had seen so many times before.  The reporting psychiatrist described him as not then having the capacity to appear as a litigant in person on that date.  As he did not see H until the last days of February, I am not sure what this conclusion could have been based upon other than H&#8217;s self-reporting, nor is it clear whether the psychiatrist was drawing a distinction between having capacity to litigate and capacity to be a litigant in person, which of course he then soon ceased to be.  In any event, the report concludes that H did have capacity by the start of February when he instructed his last firm of solicitors.</p>

That situation will not be likely to change.  If adjourned, the court might very well find itself in exactly the same position at any time in the future.</p>

The parties are unlikely to have intended that their ante-nuptial agreement should result, in the event of the marriage breaking up, in one partner being left in a predicament of real need, while the other enjoys a sufficiency or more, and such a result is likely to render it unfair to hold the parties to their agreement. Equally if the devotion of one partner to looking after the family and the home has left the other free to accumulate wealth, it is likely to be unfair to hold the parties to an agreement that entitles the latter to retain all that he or she has earned.</span></p>

The offers were sensibly judged by W, no doubt anticipating the horrendous haemorrhage of costs that has followed.  H has never made a single offer.  Both parties filed their Forms E in December 2021.  He should then, at the latest, have made an offer in reply.</p>

I do not think it likely that either W or the children will need the monies that will be released in due course and I am not confident of H&#8217;s ability to build up sufficient funds to be able to rehouse himself in 12 years&#8217; time.</p>

However, I am driven to say that his costs shall likewise not be enforced without permission of the court, but in his case as he is not before me I must grant him liberty to apply.</p>
