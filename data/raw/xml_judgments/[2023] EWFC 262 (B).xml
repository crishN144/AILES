Following the separation, K made an application for a declaration of parental responsibility and for a Child Arrangements Order. The parties reached an agreement, which is recorded in a consent order made of 2014. The order included a declaration that K has parental responsibility for Z, and provided for Z to live with both parents, spending each fifth and sixth weekend and every Monday and Thursday overnight with K, as well as half of all school holidays. It appears this arrangement broadly worked well, with the parties able to agree additional days and nights for Z to stay with K on a regular basis. </span></p>

There are many things which they ought to do that children may not want to do or even refuse to do: going to the dentist, going to visit some 'boring' elderly relative, going to school, doing homework or sitting an examination, the list is endless. The parent's job, exercising all their parental skills, techniques and stratagems &#8211; which may include use of both the carrot and the stick and, in the case of the older child, reason and argument &#8211;, is to get the child to do what it does not want to do. That the child's refusal cannot as such be a justification for parental failure is clear: after all, children whose education or health is prejudiced by parental shortcomings may be taken away from their parents and put into public care.&#8221;</span></p>

SW was troubled by some aspects of what Z had said to her. SW explained that Z has a wholly negative view of Y and finds it difficult to say anything positive about her. SW acknowledged that the events of July 2021 and other incidents that Z says occurred when she lived with Y have had a significant impact on Z. These incidents include Z alleging that Y used derogatory and abusive language towards her; Y being angry a lot of the time and the atmosphere in the home being &#8220;heavy&#8221;.  SW acknowledged that the text messages between Z and her friend, and between Z and W in July 2021 reflected that Z was scared by what had happened and felt she had been &#8216;kicked out&#8217; of her home by Y. SW accepted that the cumulative impact of these incidents could explain Z&#8217;s view of Y. SW, nevertheless, felt that Z&#8217;s view of Y is disproportionately negative and was concerned that despite Z painting a very negative picture of what life was like when she lived with Y, she struggled to provide details and timeframes, and continually referred back to the events of July 2021. SW was concerned that Z seemed to be aware of K&#8217;s application to the Court in July 2021 and it was, of course, the service of those Court papers upon Y that appears to have led to the incident on 20 July 2021. </span></p>

Since contact was ordered in August 2022, Z has cooperated with that order and has stayed overnight with Y despite this not specifically being ordered. It was suggested that if Z was being alienated from Y, she would never have agreed to this level of contact. SW, however, pointed out that Z only saw Y twice between July 2021 and May 2022, which SW felt was still an extremely low level of contact. </span></p>

SW feels that, even now, contact is still taking place at a minimal level. SW was also concerned that at the hearing in August 2022, K&#8217;s position seemed to be informed entirely by Z&#8217;s wishes. SW agreed that this reliance on Z&#8217;s wishes as being determinative was a concern and she was concerned that K&#8217;s repeated view that she could not &#8220;force&#8221; Z to do things and in always allowing Z to take the lead, created a &#8216;good cop/bad cop&#8217; scenario and was not a positive way of promoting Z&#8217;s relationship with Y. SW agreed that an example of this could be the e-mail that Y sent to Z in March 2022 about going to the ballet. K accepts that she showed Z the e-mail, but Z said she did not want to go and did not do so. SW agreed that K&#8217;s response that she could not &#8220;force&#8221; Z was possibly an easy answer, and that part of parenting is encouraging and sometimes ensuring that children do things that they might not want to do. SW agreed that going to the ballet was likely to have been something positive for Z and Y to do together at a time when they had not seen each other since the end of December 2021. </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:11pt">On the issue of the schooling, SW felt that Z must have been confused about being shown around schools in Location 1 and Location 2. SW was concerned that K may have allowed Z to believe that the choice of secondary school was entirely her own decision rather than a decision to be taken by her parents. SW was concerned that there may be a pattern of K allowing Z to feel that she is control of all decisions that impact her welfare, which in turn supports a narrative that Y does not listen to Z. SW was concerned about the incident on the day before Z was due to start secondary school in September 2020 when K travelled to Location 2 to collect her. SW felt this would have been confusing for Z and would have made her feel &#8216;caught in the middle&#8217;, which then undermined Y who had, of course, by then made it clear to Z that she was going to school in Location 2. SW accepted the letter written by Z to Y in July 2020 does reflect K&#8217;s view of the situation, although it is written by Z. This letter makes it clear that Z does not want to go to school in Location 2 and goes on to make comments about how much K does for Y, how Z is &#8220;tired&#8221; of Y and how she feels her home is in Location 1 with K &#8211; this letter was, of course, written a few months before Z was due to start secondary school. </span></p>

SW was concerned that upon Z&#8217;s return from the holiday, she did not return to the care of Y and was instead withdrawn from school and became home-schooled for a period of time by K.

SW said that Z talks about Y as if she is a &#8220;stranger&#8221;, despite having always lived with her until July 2021, and furthermore, SW felt that Z&#8217;s decision to cut all communication with Y&#8217; wider family was a rather extreme reaction, even if she did not feel particularly close to those family members. SW was asked about why Z does not appear to be as angry towards W as she is towards Y given that it was reportedly W who gave her a suitcase in July 2021 and took her to the service station to meet K.

SW was however concerned that without an order stipulating when Z should spend time with Y, Z may simply refuse to see her at all because it is only since an order has been place that contact has taken place consistently. SW maintained her view that any final order should be a shared &#8216;lives with&#8217; order so that Z understands that she continues to have two homes and an equal relationship with both of her parents. </span></p>

Furthermore, it was unclear how such an order would operate in practice.

K is right when she says that Z&#8217;s wishes have to be respected but I did have concerns about K&#8217;s steadfast determination to follow Z&#8217;s wishes at all times, even when those wishes might contradict, to some extent, with what might be in the wider interests of Z&#8217;s welfare. It seems to me that Z&#8217;s wishes and feelings have become K&#8217;s default response to everything, and there was limited evidence of K really appreciating the emotional benefit to Z of her relationship with Y and her wider family. It seemed to me that K&#8217;s approach is simply to establish what Z thinks and then to follow that, without really questioning whether that is what is best for Z. As the case law sets out, part of parenting is sometimes having to take decisions that children might not necessarily like or agree with because those decisions are, ultimately, in the best interests of the child&#8217;s welfare. </span></p>

The issue was crying out for some dialogue between the parties but instead, it seems to me that they each pushed ahead with their own agenda, which culminated in the bizarre situation where Z had two school places in September 2020. This would have been confusing for Z and would likely have left her feeling &#8216;torn&#8217; between her parents. </span></p>

Z was exposed to the disagreement that unfolded and it seems to me that she then became aware and, to some extent, caught up in the conflict between her parents.

It is impossible to know precisely what was said on that day but what is clear is that Z and Y had a significant disagreement, Y raised her voice and Z left with W to be dropped off to K at a service station car park. It seems to me that this was an important event in Z&#8217;s life and caused Z to feel upset and distress. The WhatsApp messages to W, which took place very shortly following the incident, indicate how upset Z was and how she felt that Y had thrown her out of her home. The messages were sent very shortly after the incident and there is no evidence that anyone other than Z sent those messages. Y, it seems to me, acknowledges that she could have handled the situation a lot better but, in my judgment, struggles to recognise the true likely impact of it on Z. In her evidence, I found that Y minimised the incident as just a &#8216;falling out&#8217;. While disagreements between children and parents do of course occur, it was not, in my judgment, right for Z to leave the home in the way that she did, seemingly under the impression that she had been &#8216;thrown out&#8217;. While I accept that more could and should have been done to rectify what happened afterwards (see below), this should not detract from the significance of this incident for Z. I am concerned that Y then left ten days following this incident before attempting to contact K to see Z. While I accept that Z may have wanted some space, it seems to me that ten days was too long to leave it and that probably contributed to Z&#8217;s feelings towards Y at that time. </span></p>

Alienation is not something that can be diagnosed and, as the case law sets out, it is the behaviour and actions of a parent that need to be considered in the context of a particular case, rather than simply focusing on a label. The issue is whether K has engaged in conduct that has undermined and damaged Z&#8217;s relationship with Y. The allegation, in my judgment, must be considered in the context of what happened in September 2020 and then July 2021. By the time Z moved to the care of K, she was undoubtedly aware of the conflict between her parents. In my judgment, it is too simplistic to say that K is entirely to blame for the current situation and the damage that has been done to Z&#8217;s relationship with Y. As set out above, Y has to take some responsibility for her conduct too. </span></p>

Instead, Z was withdrawn from school and home-schooled. K says this was done on the advice of the Local Authority and that may have been the case, but I struggle to see why more was not done to arrange for Z to at least see Y. Z was only 12 years old at the time and while I have no doubt that she was probably very vocal in her views, she needed someone to listen to her but also reassure her that things would be okay and that she should see Y. Instead, it seems to me that K simply accepted Z&#8217;s views. Z then started her new school in October 2021 and had still not seen Y. </span></p>

It is overly simplistic to say that she could not &#8220;force&#8221; Z to see Y. No-one is suggesting that Z should have been physically forced by K, but in my view, further and consistent efforts at positive encouragement and reassurance should have been made. The invitation from Y to take Z to the ballet in March 2022 would have been an excellent opportunity but once Z said she did not want to go, it seems that K again just accepted this. I did not gain the impression from K&#8217;s evidence that she had tried very hard to encourage Z to see Y prior to August 2022. Instead, she simply allowed Z to make the decision herself. </span></p>

Given Z&#8217;s age and level of understanding, it is important for me to give serious consideration to her wishes and feelings. Indeed, it is those wishes and feelings that led SW to recommend that Z should remain primarily in the care of K and should remain at School C. In my judgment, it is important that Z feels that she has been listened to and knows that appropriate weight has been given to her views. I know that Z wishes to remain with K; I know that she wishes to remain at her current school; and I know that she would prefer not to be subject to an order specifying how much time she should spend with Y. For the avoidance of doubt, I do attach a significant amount of weight to those views.</span></p>

I am concerned that if no order is made setting out the time that Z must spend with Y, Z will simply not see Y any more. Prior to the August 2022 hearing, Z had only seen Y four times in twelve and a half months. Since the order for interim contact was made in August 2022, Z has seen Y every month, including at least one overnight stay, with additional overnight stays at Christmas time and Easter time. It was only in August 2023 that contact did not include an overnight stay because Z had made other arrangements. I am therefore concerned that without an order for her to see Y, Z will simply decide not to do so, and the situation will revert to something similar to what it was prior to August 2022. Given Z&#8217;s age, I am very concerned that if contact does not continue to take place now, it will be very difficult to ever get it re-established. </span></p>

I am sure that Z can meet a lot of her own basic care needs but she still requires her parents to provide her with a safe and secure environment where she feels happy and loved. Z requires carers who can support her with her education so that she can reach her potential, and so that she can make the right choices when it comes to her further education. By the time Z moves on to sixth form, she will be 16 and so will clearly have a significant say about what happens then.

Having a close relationship with both parents does, in my judgment, enable Z to feel safe and secure. It promotes her sense of identity and her background. It enables her to feel an integral part of both sides of her family. As Z gets older and enters adulthood, these relationships will be important for her and are likely to support her in achieving her full potential that, based on what I have heard and read, is enormous. In my judgment, it is therefore crucial that everything is done to try to ensure that Z does have those relationships with both of her parents. </span></p>

SW was clear that, in her view, Z should remain where she is with K and at School C and that any move would likely be emotionally harmful for Z. I accept the view of SW on this. Z could not have been any clearer regarding her wishes and feelings, and I am deeply concerned that if an attempt was made to move Z back to the care of Y and to a new school, Z will suffer emotional harm. It is impossible to know precisely how she would react but it is very likely that she would be upset, angry and would feel that her views have been completely ignored. I am further concerned that she would blame Y for this and that this would, in fact, cause more damage to their relationship. In truth, it is very difficult to see how a move to the care of Y and a new school could realistically be achieved without causing huge upset and distress to Z, and I accept the analysis of SW regarding this issue. </span></p>

Since August 2022, Z has been seeing Y consistently and it seems to me that the primary reason for that is because there is an interim order in place. If that order was to be removed, I am concerned that there will be a return to the pre-August 2022 situation where Z was seeing Y sporadically on her own terms. I do not consider that a return to such an arrangement would be best for Z.

The precise time with each parent had changed over the years but all of the evidence suggests that arrangement was broadly working well and meeting Z&#8217;s needs. In short, the parents were effectively co-parenting. That has all changed since July 2021.

While I again appreciate that Z&#8217;s wishes on this issue are important, it is, in my judgment, important that Z continues to know that both of her parents are equally important in her life; not just now, but in the future too. It is important for Z to know that she still has two homes, like she always has, even though she spends more time at one than the other. To make a &#8216;live with&#8217; order to K would, in my judgment, send a message to Z, who clearly has a very good level of understanding, that Y is somehow a secondary parent, which is not the case at all. While I accept that relationship has become strained, that does not diminish the importance of it for Z&#8217;s emotional wellbeing and in my judgment, it is important that everyone, especially Z, continues to receive that message. I will therefore order that Z shall continue to live with both of her parents on the following basis:</span></p>

The precise dates to be agreed at least 28 days in advance of the commencement of the school holidays. I appreciate that Z will inevitably want to spend time with her friends during the school holidays, who will mostly live in and around the Location 1 area, and she will still want to go on her annual holiday to Europe with K. I believe the above provisions allow for this and there is, of course, nothing to stop Z still seeing her school friends when she is staying with Y.</span></p>

She very clearly wishes to remain at School C and so any attempt to move her is likely to cause Z significant upset and distress. Furthermore, I consider that such a move is likely to be highly disruptive to her education given that she has already commenced her GCSEs and is more than midway through the first term of them. I am concerned that both academically and socially, Z is likely to suffer if any attempt is made to make her change school again. In those circumstances, Z needs to remain at her current school. Z&#8217;s further education will largely be a matter for Z to decide, although I hope that both parents will be able to support her with this. </span></p>

Z and K have been travelling to Europe for an annual summer holiday for the past seven years. K has never attempted to keep Z there and there is no evidence at all of K making any plans at all to relocate there. Y&#8217; application for a prohibited steps order is therefore dismissed. </span></p>

If either parent is taking Z abroad, as they are both entitled to do, they should inform the other parent at least 28 days in advance and if the parent taking Z abroad does not already hold the passport, the other parent should hand it over at least 14 days before the trip. When notice is given of any trip abroad, this must include details of flights, accommodation, and travel dates. </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span class="legds" style="font-size:11pt">These proceedings will now end and so the parties must find a way to communicate with one another without relying on solicitors. Part of co-parenting means having to communicate with the other parent, irrespective of any personal views that the parents may have of one another. There is no safeguarding or risk issues in this case as to why the parents cannot communicate with one another. I certainly do not consider that Z should be responsible for facilitating any communication between the parents &#8211; that is not her responsibility, and it is not right to place that pressure on her. Neither should she be responsible for making the practical arrangements for which parent she is staying with at any particular time. It seems to me that the breakdown in communication between the parents, that probably started in October 2019 and worsened from September 2020, is one of the reasons that this case ended up before the Court. In my view, the parents must agree on an acceptable form of communication and accept that they will need to communicate with each other on some level. I expect that one of the parenting Apps that are now commonplace would be a sensible starting point. </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span class="legds" style="font-size:11pt">The final issue is the invitation by Y for the Court to make a Family Assistance Order. This was raised in evidence with SW who had not been asked or commented about it before. On balance, I do not consider that such an order would add anything for Z and so do not consider it to be in the best interests of her welfare, or necessary and proportionate to make such an order. While I could direct the Local Authority to befriend and support Z, it is entirely unclear what that would mean in reality and what the Local Authority would actually do; they have never been asked to give a view until SW gave her evidence. It is also unclear whether Z would welcome such input or would engage with it. It seems to me that involving yet another professional for Z and yet more intrusion into her life would not be in her best interests. I have made a clear order relating to Z&#8217;s living arrangements and it seems to me that, for Z, the parties need to focus on those arrangements and putting them into practice. I do not consider that another professional will add anything further. Z needs a conclusion to these proceedings and to be able to get on with her life without the further involvement of the Court or professionals. </span></p>

I do consider that family therapy might help to repair relationships but that is something for the parties and Z to think about. I wish to make it clear that in the coming months and years, Z will become more independent, and she will, to some extent, start to make her own decisions. The order I have made is designed to provide a structure and a foundation to ensure that Z has a close, positive and consistent relationship with both parents. Both parents will, however, have to accept that there will be times when flexibility will be required and some adjustments will need to be made, but the spirit of the order should always be considered and had regard to. </span></p>
