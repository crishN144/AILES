The principal individual involved across the multitude of allegations is J. The allegations date from when J was a child. The first set of allegations relate to the sexual abuse of Q. The second set of allegations relate to the sexual abuse of R, the younger sister of J&#8217;s childhood friend, S.  Moving into adulthood, it is alleged that he has perpetrated domestic abuse within his intimate partner relationships, specifically G.  There are three separate sets of allegations against him from T; from a young woman and good friend to G, U; and from another close friend of G, V.  Consequently, much of this judgment is about whether facts have been proved which would underpin the risk of significant harm to any of the relevant children.  This exercise has not been straight forward.</span></p>

By the start of the final hearing, it was clear that there was a measure of agreement over many of the allegations tending to suggest the continuance of such a relationship.  Nonetheless, there remained issues in dispute. G sought a finding that she experienced domestic abuse, controlling or coercive behaviour within her relationship with J. It was therefore necessary to determine whether the evidence did support such a finding.</span></p>

If the issue for the tribunal to decide is whether to believe A or B on the central issue/s, and the evidence is clearly one way then there will be no need to address credibility in general. However, if the tribunal looks to find support for their view, it must caution itself against treating what it finds to be an established propensity to dishonesty as determinative of guilt for the reasons the Recorder gave in [40]. Conversely, an established propensity to honesty will not always equate with the witness&#8217;s reliability of recall on a particular issue. </span></p>

He was persistently challenged over events which he denied had happened at all.  What was striking about my overall assessment of him is the complete lack of any empathy towards others and his obsession with himself.  I was struck by how often when considering questions about the impact of his actions on others he inserted himself into those answers. He admitted a significant deterioration in his conduct after the allegations emerged from Q in March 2016 but I did not gain any sense that he had developed any insight into his behaviour and he continued to talk about the impact upon him and frequently to answer questions tangentially focusing upon the account he wanted to give rather than the import of the question. This was evident in his oral evidence when he was asked about the impact of his behaviour on G by Mr Stonor QC and within his Police Interviews (for example at G209 E-H when discussing an allegation of rape).  He was not a witness who impressed me with his candour but affirmed the impression I gained of him that from the age of a young teenager he demonstrated coercive, often sexually orientated, conduct towards females which demonstrated a complete absence of empathy or understanding. He has demonstrated an arrogance and impetuosity about this conduct which is revealed in the repetition of abuse and the circumstances in which it continued. The fa&#231;ade he adopts of a professional person, an Army reservist, who works hard to support his family and possesses qualifications in youth work is inextricably bound up with a self-aggrandising and abusive individual.</span></p>

He described still being affected by the suicide of his father in 2013. He did not adjust to the remarriage of his mother to his Paternal Uncle.  Around the age of 10 or 11 years old, towards the end of his time in primary school, he moved to live with his Mother, Uncle.  He described a very confrontational relationship with his Mother which involved mutual recrimination and swearing. He had previously lived locally with his brother W and his grandmother. He said that he continued to suffer from nocturnal enuresis for the period that he stayed with his mother until about 15 years old.  He described desperately wanting to return to live with his grandmother and for periods of time he did so.  By January 2007, he had been excluded from college.  He was referred for anger management but did not attend and was discharged on 12 December 2007 [C28].</span></p>

He described resenting his mother&#8217;s purchase of cheaper branded goods for the children whereas better branded goods were purchased for her and his uncle. He resented being asked to babysit the children and not being paid for it. That stands in contrast to the fact that Q appears to have been paid for the babysitting she was doing. Thus, ironically, it was J who perhaps had more reason to be resentful of Q than she of him at the time. I offer this snapshot merely to indicate that the behaviours which are alleged against J must be assessed within the context of familial dysfunction or even undocumented harm which he has suffered within his childhood.</span></p>

What is described is a hostile, antagonistic and controlling pattern of behaviour which is outside expected or acceptable behaviour.  His bombardment of social workers with texts or missed calls and aggressive tone indicate his underlying personality.  I do not suggest that the Local Authority have been a paragon of efficiency and excellence but it is the extent of his reaction which is noteworthy.  The extent of his behaviour is revealed in Facebook posts which have been placed before the court. He described Sue Capper and Leanne Thorpe as a &#8220;vile creature[s]&#8221; whilst reposting a profile picture and personal details [L418].  He described in another post putting &#8220;another one&#8221;, &#8220;on here for the vile cretin she is too&#8221; [L416].

It was a difficult period involving the police investigation into the allegations of Q and the criminal trial in relation to the allegations of R. It is perfectly plausible to suggest that the Local Authority did not, at times, act or communicate efficiently.  I accept that there were, at times, significant pressures on J and issues, such as taking photographs of the children in contact, which were emotive.  However, I reject the submission that his actions were directed at &#8220;social work practice&#8221;.

People are different and react differently to sexual trauma. A late complaint does not necessarily equate to a false complaint. Embarrassment, shame and confusion particularly when the sexual trauma is experienced at a young age are all factors which may be relevant. The focus is upon assessing the evidence on its intrinsic merits and avoiding bringing stereotypical assumptions about response or demeanour into that critical evaluation (Miller <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/crim/2010/15780" uk:canonical="[2010] EWCA Crim 15780" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWCA Crim 15780</ref>).</span></p>

Ultimately, the Court must assess the evidence and apply the relevant burden and standard of proof to determine whether the allegation is true.  In avoiding unwarranted presumptions, experience within the criminal jurisdiction has shown &#8220;that inconsistencies in accounts can happen whether a person is telling the truth or not. This is because if someone has an experience of the kind alleged in this case, their memory may be affected in different ways. It may affect that person&#8217;s ability to take in, register and recall the experience. Also, some people may go over and over an event afterwards in their minds and their memory may be clearer or can develop over time. But other people may try to avoid thinking about an event at all, and they may have difficulty in recalling the event accurately&#8221; (Example 4, Crown Court Compendium).  Equally, a consistent account does not necessarily mean that the account is true.</span></p>

(The very description 'flashbulb' memory is in fact misleading, reflecting as it does the misconception that memory operates like a camera or other device that makes a fixed record of an experience.) External information can intrude into a witness's memory, as can his or her own thoughts and beliefs, and both can cause dramatic changes in recollection. Events can come to be recalled as memories which did not happen at all or which happened to someone else (referred to in the literature as a failure of source memory).&#8221;</span></p>

The evidence serves as a caution to the fact-finding tribunal to avoid making subjective and potentially unwarranted assumptions about the reliability of evidence given by a person who was intoxicated. The Court will need to consider that evidence with care and assess the quality and consistency of it as with any witness. It may be that in future there will be an opportunity to use a methodology to inform the assessment of the quality of such evidence but this is not the occasion to venture into such matters.  This approach was agreed by the parties&#8217; advocates.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The allegations of Q and R are historical in the sense that the passage of time and the repetition of the events may have had an effect upon recollection.  One area which appeared very difficult for many of the witnesses was the concept of time.  There was obvious difficulties in estimating ages at the time of events even as adults.  Evaluating that type of inconsistency requires circumspection when one may be considering how traumatic events as a child are being recalled as an adult.  When evaluating inconsistency, it is important to think about the context.  The evidence of Q, R and J all relate to a time when they were at varying stages of physical, cognitive and emotional development but they were all children.  I have borne that in mind when considering criticisms of the consistency or quality of their evidence (Achieving Best Evidence in Criminal proceedings Guidance at paragraph 3.74).</span></p>

In fact, her oral evidence demonstrated a witness who appeared overwhelmed and at times unable to process the questions beyond answers which were short and often monosyllabic. She was however more animated when denying the suggestion that she had not been raped and sexually assaulted by J, over a substantial period. She said that she did recall that abuse. She was, at times, pitiable as she sought to latch onto that one essential truth with almost no confidence that she would be believed.</span></p>

The perpetrators of sexual abuse are inadequate individuals who control weaker people, often children, for their own gratification.  Their behaviour is always an abuse of power and usually a breach of trust.  They destroy families and blight childhoods.  They create dread in their victims by convincing them that the consequences of speaking out will be worse than the consequences of silence.  They create guilt in their victims by persuading them that they have somehow willingly participated in their own abuse.  They burden their victims with secrets.  They poison normal relationships, trade on feelings of affection, drive a wedge between their victims and others, and make family and friends take sides.  They count on the failure or inability of responsible adults, both relatives and professionals, to protect and support the victims.  Faced with exposure, they commonly turn on their victims, try to assassinate their characters, and get others to do the same.  Most often, their selfishness is so deep-rooted that they ignore other people's feelings and are only capable of feeling pity for themselves. </span></p>

The effects of sexual abuse on the victim can be lifelong, but because of the way perpetrators operate, most abuse goes undetected.  It takes courage to ask for help.  Victims are beset by feelings of shame, guilt and fear.  They should be able to have confidence that their accounts will be adequately investigated and that they will be appropriately supported.  Instead, experience shows that the abuse is often compounded by sceptical or inadequate reactions within the family and beyond.  It is not always possible to establish where the truth lies, but where it is possible to investigate, there must be a good reason not to do so.  The position of a complainant whose allegation is described as 'unsubstantiated' is extraordinarily difficult, but sometimes 'unsubstantiated' is no more than a euphemism for 'uninvestigated'.</span></p>

They are entirely consistent with what one would expect from children who have been chronically abused. The accounts cover a very large number of highly-charged occasions over a very long period. As B said at one point, things get blurred. Young people cannot be expected to give a photographic replay of sequences of similar but varying events and get all the distasteful details right. Assessment of such evidence cannot only focus on the level of precision with which children give descriptions, but calls for a much broader survey of all the relevant features.&#8221;</span></p>

The sexual abuse started after this&#8221; [C355 paragraph 6]. This is not the pattern of grooming suggested in her Police Interview.  The short point is that this is an inconsistency in the evidence of Q seeking to complete a statement about the abuse she allegedly suffered as a child.  Why is there such an inconsistency?  Is she dishonest and cannot keep her story straight? Was she mistaken and confused when giving an account to the Local Authority in that statement?  Having assessed her oral evidence, against her written evidence and reflected on the context in which she has given her accounts of a traumatic period of her life, I believed her evidence.  I accept that her accounts do not always tally (for example the first time the alleged abuse happened, when the alleged abuse ended, the circumstances, the sleeping arrangements within the home).  These inconsistencies are meticulously described for each witness in the three sets of written submissions prepared by Ms Grief QC and Miss Anslow on behalf of J.  However, I do not find that Q had any malign motive to make any allegations in 2006.  I do not think she hatched a plan to resurrect and exaggerate allegations in 2016.  I accept she has been inconsistent and has probably not been truthful about how her relationship with J has featured in her life.  I find that she is a vulnerable woman, worn down by her history, who gave her evidence with palpable weary and anxiety but stoically told the truth about the horror that punctuated a substantial period of her young life. She appeared, at times, resigned that she would not be believed but she maintained that the abuse happened to her and that the person responsible was J. Giving evidence appeared to be a considerable undertaking and one which she undertook without enthusiasm but a determination to ensure that the events of her childhood were not repeated in relation to other children in the care of J.</span></p>

The identity of the perpetrator was revealed during a drunken evening with gg and another friend or neighbour. Having considered her evidence in the round, in my judgment, she is very clear as to the identity of her abuser. I do not regard it as likely that she picked J as the person in order to hide the identity of the actual perpetrator.  Firstly, why maintain such a lie in the first place?  Secondly, she did not tell her family initially and the way the name emerged when she was in drink does not suggest planning or calculation.  Thirdly, my assessment of her is that she is more likely to have said nothing about the identity of the perpetrator than wrongly to accuse a friend of the family, J.  That is the reason she gave for not giving his name at least into adulthood when the abuse appears to have impacted her mental health having entered into an intimate sexual relationship.  In the event that she sought to hide the true identity of the person responsible then why not simply say that he was a stranger to her?  Why pick J?  I did not detect a witness seeking revenge or punishment but a witness who had reluctantly been required to give her evidence.  Her evidence remained clear, thoughtful and she answered the questions put to her.  In other words, I found her an impressive witness.</span></p>

It took place by a tree situate within the back field. In her oral evidence she described it being on a slope.  As noted earlier, there is no issue that R, her younger brother ee, S, J, W and other friends used this area periodically.  It is likely that they used it less as they got older but it is likely that there would have been occasions when S and some of his friends, including J, would be around at the family home when S had been asked to look after his younger siblings .  S recalled a time when he was about 16 years old and playing in the back field in camouflage with J and ee and Q before getting a lift to Army cadets.  ff said that S would sometimes look after the younger children with his friends in attendance.  By this time, S, J and their friends were probably spending most of their time playing football or walking around the streets or visiting each other&#8217;s homes to play video games.  It is likely that they did occasionally play games with the younger children but in any event, it would not have been unusual or noticeable if J had followed R into the back field on an isolated occasion.  There would likely have been a risk of discovery which, if the allegation is true, would suggest an impetuous or arrogant approach to the risk of discovery.  The allegation is that on an occasion R found herself alone in the back field with J. He raped her and warned her not to say anything.  She did not say anything.  Her account is plausible, detailed and appears unrehearsed. The inconsistencies do not undermine the core allegation. I find it implausible that such an account, nuanced and graphic is an invention.  By the close of her oral evidence, R remained clear that she had been raped by J.</span></p>

The only logical explanation was that either it was no-one or someone else that she felt she could not reveal. Her mother was expressly putting to her if it was J &#8211; again &#8211; it makes no sense to maintain false denials in those circumstances and her explanation is therefore simply not credible.&#8221; I have quoted this because I do not accept the logic described.  Her answer is entirely consistent with measuring the impact on J of confirming the identity of the perpetrator.  The suffering of her family was principally the fact that she had been raped which would remain whether or not the perpetrator was identified.  Her choice was to retain the information, tell the truth or to provide a false narrative.  The evidence, in my judgment, is consistent with all three: (a) not giving J&#8217;s name; (b) giving misleading characteristics about the perpetrator (age, location and Facebook presence); (c) consistently identifying that person as J.

There are clearly inconsistencies, such as the time gap between the incidents, but that is explicable given the context and must fall into the balance.  There is a clear explanation for why she initially gave a misleading account as to the characteristics of the person who had raped her. It is clear that she was concerned, as an adult, with the implications of making such a charge against a close family friend who had his own relationships and children. To make this allegation was not easy for her.  The emergence of the issue appears to have been prompted by her growing anxiety and the resurfacing of feelings and emotions linked to her experience of traumatic events after she had formed an intimate sexual relationship. She was described as a person who shied away from attention.  She did not call the Police and felt embarrassed to learn that this had arisen whilst she was on holiday and she had not been told until after her birthday on 31 July 2016.  There is no real basis, in my judgment, to suggest that she was pushed into nominating J  as the perpetrator. I do not regard the evidence as establishing that she was pressured to name him or any perpetrator. In my judgment, the family approach was more sensitive than that. Furthermore, my assessment of her is that she would have withstood attempts to pressurise her into giving a name. Further, if she had chosen to give in to such pressure then it would have been much easier for her to name a stranger.</span></p>

A safeguarding report was filed by CAFCASS on the 24 January 2017 [J19] In her interview with the officer, Ms Leadbetter, Y said that J &#8220;displayed inappropriate sexual behaviour: exposing himself to T and making inappropriate sexual comments about young girls&#8221; [J21].

She wanted to forget about it and have nothing further to do with G and J.  She was reluctant to become involved in these proceedings [L60].  I note that she is likely to have had some knowledge of S and ee given that they were part of the group celebrating the birthday of J.  The evidence does not, however, bear the weight of the submission that her failure to clarify the name &#8216;R&#8217; in questions on behalf of the Children&#8217;s Guardian having stated that she did not know her name is significant. The risk of misinterpretation in seeking to establish what was said, by whom and when is admittedly large.

Essentially, she tended to deny some of the particulars and/or to having any recollection of them.  She did say that she saw J push her out of the house.  When it was put to her that that her statement [C366] refers to U, storming out of her house, she said that she did not think she remembered it when she made her earlier statement.  Another option is that she was simply aligning her evidence to J&#8217;s written case.  When asked about this in April 2020 by Alison James, former Children&#8217;s Guardian, she retorted: &#8220;J and U were only &#8216;play fighting&#8217; and &#8216;there was nothing in it&#8217;&#8221; [C417 paragraph 22].</span></p>

I have taken that inconsistency into account given the vehemence with which V rejected the existence of a delay of that length in her oral evidence. V was a friend of J and G.

Firstly, he appeared in a persistent way to suggest that he was the father of her son. Again, the clear impression I formed from her evidence was that these assertions became increasingly wearing and caused some difficulty in her personal life in that she agreed to undertake DNA testing to establish paternity with the putative father after the Child Support Agency had become involved following comments made to him by J that she had already had a DNA test. This carried over into comments that suggested they had slept together, had sexual intercourse and dated.  It was clear from her evidence that at first she laughed it off and it became more problematic as it &#8220;was all the time, all the time&#8221;.</span></p>

However, in my judgment, what is significant is that his arm was around the back of the chair in which G was seated. That is, in my judgement, consistent with them being in a relationship in which J felt sufficiently comfortable to place his arm around the chair that G was sitting in.

They have essentially placed their own relationship beyond the interests of the children.  They have frequently stretched credulity by their denials when the truth has been plain to see.  For example, G left her address and spent considerable time during the day visiting the address to &#8220;collect belongings&#8221; in 2020 [C165] but she never ended her tenancy or removed any items (she says she boxed up some personal possessions). Even by August 2020, professional observation highlighted the contradiction in her position: the supposed glimmers of insight into the risks posed by Jwere almost extinguished [C683e paragraphs 13 - 14].</span></p>

That abuse took a number of forms such as expecting a G to respond to his numerous messages or calls straightaway and bombarding her until she did. It took the form of him talking about their sexual life in a way which made G feel uncomfortable. It took the form of pestering G for sexual relations and sulking, being nasty or similar until she relented.  It took the form of emotional manipulation (for example, implying she is all he has left) where his needs and the effect upon him were paramount in the mind of his partner. It takes the form of exploiting weaknesses in G (for example, by arguing in front of the children or using the risk of removal of them as a threat).
