Anecdotally, it would appear that very few such applications are made by the standard COP1 application to regional hub courts. In contrast, a fairly steady stream of approximately 4 &#8211; 5 applications per week is now made using the streamlined procedure (to the central registry but from all across England and Wales.) In addition and frequently, applications in matters which began as proceedings under the inherent jurisdiction are transferred to &#8211; or directions are made that, when a 16</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> birthday is reached, review shall be by &#8211; the Court of Protection. </span></p>

KL was not eligible for public funding so, but for the Applicant&#8217;s agreement to meet his costs of representation up to and including the hearing, he would have had to pay for representation from his own funds.

I would like to record the Court&#8217;s thanks for the manner in which her Office has coped with the pressure to date. Those persons for whom she has acted have benefited greatly from the expertise which her Office brings to bear, and the Court has been greatly assisted in managing this new stream of cases.  </span></p>

Accordingly, there is now have in place an arrangement whereby three other Tier 2 judges (Judges Marin, Harris and Burrows) will be sitting at First Avenue House in rotation, for one week each, for one week per month. By this means, it is intended that apparently uncontentious applications made under the streamlined procedure in respect of 16/17 year old may continue to be judicially considered at the central registry and with judicial continuity in each case. Where an attended hearing is required, the judge will consider &#8211; as is usual &#8211; whether the matter should be transferred for such hearing to take place before a Tier 2 judge at a regional hearing centre. </span></p>
