	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an application, brought by the NHS Foundation Trust and the M Care Commissioning Group, seeking injunctive relief surrounding the care plan of G. G is a 27-year-old woman who has been a patient at the Trust&#8217;s Hospital since May 2008. In December 2021, I delivered a judgment setting out why it is in G&#8217;s best interests to be transferred to a specialist care home as a &#8216;step down&#8217; measure to moving to her parent&#8217;s care. I was entirely persuaded that the care home provided the most appropriate environment for G and that given that she had spent most of her adolescence and the entirety of her adulthood to date in a children&#8217;s hospital, an immediate move home would from both a &#8216;medical and safety point of view&#8217; be inappropriate. That was the advice given by Dr Andrew Bentley, Consultant in Respiratory and Intensive Care Medicine, and Alison Smith, independent expert Nurse, which reflected the consensus of professional opinion. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The December judgment, <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2021/69" uk:canonical="[2021] EWCOP 69" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] EWCOP 69</ref></span> requires to be read in conjunction with this one. G suffers from a rare and profound degenerative neurological condition which affects the entirety of her central nervous system. The condition is progressive and is neither receptive to treatment nor amenable to cure. She has significantly outlived her life expectancy. There are two clear reasons for this. Firstly, she has been continuously cared for by expert teams at the Hospital since she was 13 years of age. Secondly, she has had devoted round the clock support and care from her parents. 13 years ago, G&#8217;s parents, in effect, gave up their lives and moved to live in hospital accommodation in order to support their daughter. They continue to live there, and their daughter remains in hospital. All agree that a hospital environment, particularly a children&#8217;s hospital, is entirely inappropriate for G. I would go further because it needs to be signalled entirely unambiguously that G&#8217;s continuing placement in this hospital fails to afford to her the respect for her dignity as an adult that she, like everybody else, is entitled to. Dr B, the Lead Consultant, has told me, once again, at this hearing that it is now more than 8 years since G was deemed fit for discharge. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the face of coherent and compelling medical evidence, the father (LF) who, I am satisfied is the driving force in this couple, objected, at the December hearing, to the removal of G&#8217;s central venous line. The father&#8217;s language is suffused with medical terminology, reflecting that he has spent very many hours every day in the hospital for a period of 13 years. The maintenance of the line, in the opinion of two consultants specialising in Paediatric Respiratory Medicine and Long-term ventilation, was potentially dangerous and providing no benefit. It had already been in for far too long and ultimately, I had to authorise its removal in the face of LF&#8217;s opposition. I do not doubt that LF&#8217;s resistance to this necessary intervention was driven by his love and concern for his daughter but, it was not a sustainable position and could not be reconciled with her interests. It is also a marker that, for a complexity of reasons, his decision making is not always reliable. Further, until the December hearing, he had been opposing the professional consensus that there should be no further attempt at CPR. </p>

	    <num>4.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At paragraph 63 of the December judgment, I set out how it was that LF&#8217;s difficult relationship with the treating clinical team had led to confusion surrounding this important facet of her care. The wider medical picture set out in the earlier judgment, particularly G&#8217;s extremely fragile bones, will immediately indicate why the medical view was both correct and essential. That it had been left uncertain for so long had seriously compromised G&#8217;s welfare. I find it necessary to say that which I stated more sensitively in the earlier judgment, these dangers had been created entirely by the father. I said then, and I reiterate now, that the tragedy of LF&#8217;s behaviour is that it is generated by his love of his daughter. His decision making has become distorted by what strikes me as a visceral panic at any significant change in her circumstances and particularly, his apprehension that his own day to day involvement in his daughter&#8217;s life may be diminished. It is this that has led to this appalling delay in moving G on from the hospital. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By December, it was already clear that the relationship between the hospital and LF was under great strain. However, there appeared to be some very tentative signs of convergence in mutual understanding. In particular, I had been left with the clear impression that both parents had recognised the fact that G is in the later stage of her life. I was told that a &#8216;ceiling of care plan&#8217; could be constructed and in place within weeks of the hearing. Certainly, I was not anticipating a time scale beyond 8 weeks. I also took care to emphasise why the step-down arrangements, via the nursing home, were not only desirable but in my analysis, integral to her parents&#8217; wishes to care for her at home. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Sadly, any apparent resetting of the father/hospital relationship has proved to be entirely illusory. On the contrary, the relationship has now corroded to the point where it has become entirely dysfunctional. It has foundered to such a degree that it, in and of itself, compromises G&#8217;s welfare. It is now characterised by both mutual distrust and poor, indeed entirely inadequate, communication. This generates fertile ground for confusion and error which jeopardises G&#8217;s safety and wellbeing. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr McKendrick QC, acting on behalf of LF, raises preliminary points of law, challenging the jurisdictional basis for the injunctive relief that is sought. Ms Kohn, on behalf of M, supports his submissions. Mr McKendrick also advances arguments relating to the admissibility of hearsay evidence. With respect to his seductive and erudite submissions, I can address the points that have been raised relatively briefly. Firstly, it is contended that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/16/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 16(5)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> (the MCA) has been erroneously applied in the case law.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The thrust of Mr McKendrick&#8217;s argument, again supported by Ms Kohn, centres upon the interpretation to be given to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/16/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 16(5)</ref>. Whilst he acknowledges that this section enables the court to make such orders as it thinks &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">necessary or expedient&#8217;</span>, in giving effect to its orders, Mr McKendrick submits that this applies only in the context of the appointment of deputies. I do not consider this proposition to be sustainable. Firstly, the section expresses two clear and distinct objectives, in its heading: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Powers to make decisions</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">and</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Appoint deputies&#8221;</span> (my emphasis. <span style="font-style:italic"/>Secondly, it would be entirely illogical to confer wide powers to facilitate the enforcement of orders in the context of the appointment of deputies and not upon the court more generally. Thirdly, when bearing in mind the identified twin objectives, it is plain that the phrase <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;and confer on a deputy such powers&#8230;&#8221; </span>must be read as complementing the powers given to the Court generally, as captured by the opening phrase <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;the court may make such further orders&#8230;&#8221;</span>. Fourthly, the provision can only be read with logical integrity if the phrase <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;and confer on a deputy&#8230;&#8221; </span>is read as a subordinate clause, which is precisely how it is drafted grammatically. </p>

Mr McKendrick contends that I should afford <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;little or no weight&#8221;</span> to this evidence. Moreover, he submits there is no good basis for anonymity.

G has languished in a hospital environment which I have denounced as contrary to her interests, for a further 6 months. The applicant Trust and the CCG assert that this is, once again, attributable to LF&#8217;s intransigence. They seek injunctive orders both to implement and secure the placement at the identified nursing home. Ms Powell QC, on behalf of the applicants, submits that LF, his partner, (M) and his mother, (N) have remained fundamentally opposed to the move and have conducted a campaign of resistance to it. It requires to be stated that notwithstanding a great deal of equivocation in the witness box, LF eventually agreed that he was fundamentally opposed to the placement and not merely seeking <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;answers to reasonable questions&#8221;</span>, as he had initially maintained.</p>

LF&#8217;s concession was only made when the compelling evidence of his opposition to the placement made his continuing denials of it risible. Thus, the abandoned move to the care home, planned to have taken place on the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2022, can only be attributed to LF&#8217;s tactical strategy designed to sabotage it. The strategy was very nearly successful. The senior management wavered in their commitment to offer G a place. They became concerned as to how LF&#8217;s behaviour might undermine their own ability to care for G and the wider impact on other residents. </p>

Nurse T is a Registered Paediatric Specialist who has worked for over 15 years in Critical Care in the High Dependency Unit (HDU) at the Hospital. She is a clinical nurse manager and acting ward manager (since October 2021). She told me in evidence that many staff had reported feeling undermined and intimidated by LF. So numerous were the complaints that the lead consultant, Dr B, asked Nurse T to investigate the matter. Nurse T had arranged for the Critical Care Psychology team to provide support sessions for anybody who had felt intimidated or vulnerable as a consequence of LF&#8217;s behaviour. 30 nurses took the offer up. LF appears genuinely to struggle to understand this. He asserts that with one or two exceptions, he gets on very well with the nursing staff. </p>

She has been met with minimal to no acknowledgment when speaking to him and she has perceived a hostile demeanour towards her. She has been reluctant to be the team leader in the pod G is in due to the worry of being met with this hostility. She worries that staff could be named and that her own job and that of others could be compromised. Nurse B stated that she regularly thinks about the situation at work when she is off which is impacting on her personal life.

She recalls [LF] raising his disgust with <span style="font-style:italic">the lies </span>told during the hearing. He explained that they had found a company willing to provide a care package to get G home but two days before the hearing began, it was conveniently pulled and stated that the hospital and the commissioners were in it together. He stated that the hospital <span style="font-style:italic">has form </span>in doing underhand things and referred to the organ scandal. He told her how every single person on HDU had let G down, looking at Nurse C as though to include her. She felt this was unfair and made the atmosphere awkward. Nurse C responded by saying to him that she was unaware of things that have gone on behind the scenes for a long time and cannot comment on what other people may or may not have said. Nurse C said she refrained from giving any personal opinion throughout the conversation. [LF] made remarks about Dr B and questioned why a consultant only has one patient under her care. He also made remarks about the previous LTV consultant and how it was ok when they were getting large sums of money to start these children on long term ventilation but then they get to a certain age and then discontinue care. [LF] told Nurse C he had been in contact with many families who feel the same. He referred to the Care Home as an asylum. He stated there are old men wandering the corridors screaming and wailing and how that isn&#8217;t an appropriate setting for G. He stated that she won&#8217;t last three months there and the only way she will leave that place is in a box. He insinuated to Nurse C that the reason the Trust are sending her there is to die. As team leader on that shift, Nurse C felt it her duty to listen to him as G&#8217;s father, however she said she felt very uneasy as it went on for some time and she was not willing to respond to any of the above points.</p>

Nurse D noted that this was very unusual for G as her tracheostomy dressing is always immaculate and secure. Nurse D stated that she was aware that there had recently been a few incidents where unusual things had been happening for example, disconnection from the ventilator, profile settings on monitor changing, humidifier turned off, and got a sense of unease about the situation. Nurse D recalled an event on 15 March where it had been reported to the bedside nurse by G&#8217;s grandmother that the 02 connected to her vent had been turned off very tightly. This was switched back on by her grandmother and the bedside nurse has insisted that she had not altered the 02 at all. Nurse D felt that these incidents are leaving staff feeling very vulnerable and most staff feel like they are being tested constantly. Safety checks are always performed at the start of every shift.</p>

Nurse D stated that communication is very limited and body language from [LF] in particular is very intimidating. In her senior role Nurse D has supported several members of staff who have gone on to need support from the psychology team due to the way they have been spoken to or made to feel by [LF] and G&#8217;s grandmother. Nurse D reported that the atmosphere on the HDU unit is completely different when [LF] is present. Nurse D stated that the situation the HDU nursing team find themselves in with G at the moment is all-consuming, the nursing staff are talking about the situation all the time, on breaks, when they leave to go home and this even spills into their home life. She feels very uneasy about the situation and is fearful for her job and that of her colleagues. Nurse D said she did not believe that the nursing team on HDU can deliver a high standard of care when they are working under these extremely stressful conditions, being constantly assessed and questioned.</p>

During one of Nurse E&#8217;s first shifts looking after G, the rate on her feeds had been changed and was not correct. Nurse E recalls that certain things have been changed on numerous occasions which led her to perceive that she was being tested. She said this can make her over cautious and she is worried it could lead to mistakes. On one occasion when looking after G, Nurse E recalled that she was at the nursing station making a phone call to pharmacy, G became disconnected from the ventilator, G alarmed, and her heart rate and oxygen saturations had dropped. Nurse E immediately attended to her, increased oxygen, gave suction and G&#8217;s observations soon resolved. When [LF] returned Nurse E informed him of the event before going on her break, she felt extremely intimidated in this moment as he was questioning her nursing ability. When on her break [LF] had been looking on both the nursing station monitor and bed space monitor regarding the event. When arriving back from her break [LF] did not engage in conversation with Nurse E he drew the curtains round and spoke to numerous professionals about the event, Nurse E overheard the word <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;murderers'. </span>He had accused Nurse E of not responding to G for a minute, but Nurse E recalls it was within seconds. Nurse E felt extremely uncomfortable in this situation and felt very uneasy. Following this, Nurse E reported she has felt anxious and worried about coming into work. She had not looked after G since. Nurse E has walked past [LF] and been looking after patients in the same pod and has felt very uncomfortable when making any contact with him.</p>

She feels very anxious and on edge when [LF] arrives on the ward as she often expects him to say something that will make her feel uncomfortable or she is fearful something could happen on her shift. Nurse F has noticed recently when she has been caring for G and when [LF] has left the ward that: her tracheostomy cuff has less water in than it should; her amount of oxygen has been turned up from her usual amount; the feed pump volume has changed; the monitor settings being changed from adult to child 2-7 years; the ventilator has not been properly secured onto her tracheostomy; and times where her emergency tracheostomy tray has been without duoderm as [LF] has not let her know he has used it all and it needed replenishing. Finding these things when [LF] has left and knowing this has not been done by Nurse F makes her feel as though he is trying to catch her out, she fears that these could cause harm to G and she is responsible for noticing these things quickly and amending them before anything bad happens.</p>

Nurse G felt he is frequently rude to nursing and medical staff including herself, either by ignoring them completely or by making sarcastic comments either to G or the staff directly. She finds him to be very passive aggressive and intimidating and has found herself avoiding having any contact with him whenever possible. Nurse G stated that she and other members of staff sometimes dread coming into work knowing they have to deal with him and several members of staff have left because of his unreasonable behaviour and the effect it has had on their mental health. Nurse G feared that if there was ever any incident involving G that his behaviour would escalate, as it has done in the past, and she would have to be the person to deal with him. Nurse G reported that he has a history of not abiding to restrictions which were put in place as a result of his actions, and this makes her nervous as coordinator of a busy HDU which cares for many sick children and their families. Nurse G recalled an incident where [LF] was banned from the unit due to an incident of poor behaviour which put G at risk, and he still secretly gained entry to the unit and security and senior management needed to be called to deal with the situation. Nurse G said many of the junior staff have similar concerns and have frequently expressed these concerns to her and other senior members of staff.</p>

Since transition planning started [LF] has ignored the majority of HDU staff. [LF] has recently decided to no longer wear a PPE mask as per hospital guidance as he&#8217;s now exempt, his facial expression and eye contact is intimidating and aggressive, he visibly snarls and has a tense jaw, this is seen when walking towards [LF] and makes me feel very intimidated.</span></p>

In February 2022 G&#8217;s ventilator tubing became disconnected from her tracheostomy and G became bradycardic and required oxygen to correct her drop in saturations. As Acting Ward Manager, I investigated this incident following an incident form being submitted and presented the findings as a Rapid Review to the governance team at The Hospital. The findings were also given to [LF] verbally alongside a copy of the written report. During the meeting I had with [LF] regarding the incident [LF] called me back to the bedside and said &#8220;You know how you said G can&#8217;t communicate or express her feelings, well look at her now&#8221; at which point he smirked and turned round to G. The comment made by [LF] was in relation to my statement given as part of die court hearing in December. I did not feel it appropriate to respond to [LF] so I left the bed space.</span></p>

In the following 2 weeks after the disconnection in February 2022 there were 2 further episodes of the ventilator tubing becoming disconnected and an incident where the dressing used to secure the tracheostomy was loose (seen and rectified quickly by a senior nurse), the dressing has never become loose prior to this at any point in G&#8217;s admission on HDU. In view of this and the reaction of [LF] towards staff, stating it was &#8220;suspicious that these incidents have happened since a DG order had been placed&#8221; (said to me during the initial discussion relating to the incident) I became increasingly concerned for the HDU nursing team and their professional vulnerability because of the increased episodes of disconnections from the ventilator. I authorised Health Care Assistants (HCA&#8217;s) to be ordered via NHSP to work alongside the registered nurse caring for G 24 hours a day. Since the HCA&#8217;s being in place at the bedside there have been no further disconnection episodes witnessed by staff.</span></p>

The Behavioural Framework will aid the transition in the best interests for G by implementing delivery of care that is adapted to adult services. The Behavioural Framework will also give the Nursing and Medical team on HDU clear guidance on the interventions to be undertaken by G&#8217;s family and in line with adult services and will be more appropriate to Gs privacy and dignity. The Behavioural Framework will restore a safe and conducive clinical environment that is needed for G and all patients on HDU and The care home by reducing the vulnerability and intimidation felt by staff.

Dr B gave wide ranging evidence before me. She emphasised that the planned move on the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2022, had been very well advanced, including to the point of arranging a private ambulance company to affect the transfer. LF&#8217;s direct approach to the CEO of the nursing home led to a decision on their part to place arrangements on pause. Dr B was very clear that following the December hearing, there was a distinct change in LF&#8217;s manner towards her. In February 2022, LF made an application to remove the reporting restrictions. I declined the application which was entirely without foundation. The anonymity afforded to G is to achieve peace and privacy for this crucial stage in her life.</p>

As I understand LF&#8217;s evidence, he does not dispute this response but contends that Dr B has put a deliberately negative gloss on it. In that same conversation, Dr B told me that LF had said that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;she is a very poor doctor&#8221;</span>. Though Dr B is experienced and resilient, it struck me that as she related the conversation, in the witness box, it caused her distress.

He contends that he told Dr B that she had <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;behaved dishonestly&#8221;</span> but he denied saying she is a poor doctor. Where LF&#8217;s evidence conflicts with Dr B&#8217;s, I have no difficulty in preferring Dr B&#8217;s account as more reliable. Again, I think it is important to emphasise that LF strikes me as a man under very great strain whose perspective on day-to-day events has become distorted by his own anxiety. I consider it likely that there have been times when even these dedicated nurses tending to seriously ill children, for whom compassion to parents is both profound and instinctive, have lost sympathy with him. The atmosphere surrounding G&#8217;s care has plainly been febrile over the course of the last 6 months. Both the nurses and LF consider that this has been kept from or concealed from G, I am bound to say that I am less sanguine. The relationship between G and her father is intensely close and intimate. It would be unusual if she did not intuitively pick up on his anxiety, distress, and, as I find, anger. If G has the greater levels of awareness that LF and the family describe, then this is even more likely to be the case. Conflict is ultimately irreconcilable either with good care or good parenting. It is also important that I record in this judgment that three of the nurses on the HDU have left the Trust. In their reasoning, each of them cited LF&#8217;s behaviour as contributing significantly to their decision. All this, I regret to say, leads to the inevitable conclusion that LF has been creating an atmosphere of stress, general unhappiness and deep mistrust on the HDU. </p>

In her submissions, she described him as evasive and dogmatic in his responses. He presented, in my assessment, as a man who was making an intense effort to retain his composure. Though he managed to retain it, it was plainly fragile. Ms Powell suggests that his responses to the complaints of the nursing staff and to Dr B were entirely lacking in credibility. I agree. Ms Powell is not as benign in her analysis of LF&#8217;s behaviour as I have been. She contends:</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These are significant concessions. LF&#8217;s actions are a deliberate attempt to sabotage the placement and to undermine the confidence of the staff. The evidence, in its totality, permits of no other sensible inference. I should also add that the correspondence sent by LF to the care home and the company group responsible for it, is not a simple request for information but a sustained attempt to intimidate and undermine, in a way which mirrored his behaviour in the HDU. In particular, it focused on what he regards as the inadequate training of the staff. I do not propose to copy LF&#8217;s correspondence into this judgment, but it is a cascade of criticisms and unfounded allegations and far from the genuine enquiry as to the contemplated care provisions that LF asserts it to be. I agree with Ms Powell when she analyses that this is not a lack of insight into his behaviour, but the deliberate and determined execution of an objective that he has now, in the witness box, accepted i.e., to stop the placement going ahead. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The correspondence, the direct evidence of Nurse T and Dr B, the admissions made by LF in the witness box, all provide the evidential framework for consideration of the anonymous evidence of the nurses. It is to be noted that the allegations that each of the nurses make identifies a pattern of behaviour which is, as I have demonstrated above, replicated with others. The allegations are internally consistent and extensive. Moreover, there is no rational or coherent reason as to why so many nurses should malevolently exaggerate or fabricate false evidence in the way that LF is driven to suggest.  Accordingly, it would be entirely wrong to regard this evidence as having little or no weight as Mr McKendrick suggested. This evidence is, properly analysed, an intrinsic facet of a wider forensic canvas which reveals a consistent pattern of behaviour. Further, having regard to the atmosphere that has been created on the ward and the importance of achieving G&#8217;s smooth and safe transition to the care home, I consider the continuing anonymity of the nurses to be essential. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">All of the above establishes a compelling basis for the injunctive relief sought in respect of the father. However, relief is also sought against M and N. I should record that I found M to be a troubling witness. She was unable to engage with the paperwork in the court room because she had travelled to London without her reading glasses. I recall that she had made the same mistake in the December hearing. I do not consider that this was entirely accidental. I have formed the clear impression that she simply does not want to engage with the evidence. Her support for LF is complete, blind, and unquestioning. She told me, and in this she is supported by LF and N, that she is not very interested in computers. She does not send or receive emails. Though her name is included on the correspondence to the care home, none of the authorial content is hers. LF suggested, at one point, that he had read the whole of the emails out loud to M, but he later relented and suggested that she had appreciated the general thrust of the email content. I consider that the latter is probably correct. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">M takes no part in social media; she has no interest in it. She receives very few calls on her mobile phone. I was told that she makes virtually no outgoing calls. At the December hearing, she told me that she often went to the gym in the afternoons and that LF would collect her. This routine, she told me, has now fallen away. In response to my own enquiry, she revealed that in the 14 years that G has been in hospital, she has never been out on her own to meet a friend for a coffee or a glass of wine. M very rarely goes into the hospital. She feels that her decision not to, attracts censure and disapproval from the nurses. She prefers her afternoons out with G and her partner. I should record that G is dressed strikingly and with great care. Her hair is the focus of much attention. M chooses the clothes and sends them over to the hospital with LF who gets her dressed and ready. I had assumed that it was M who attended to G&#8217;s hair, but I have been told that this is also usually done by LF. N, who is temperamentally similar to her son, told me that she rarely, if ever, communicates with M by telephone, text, or any of the electronic alternatives. I am struck by what I regard as M&#8217;s social isolation. She is largely impervious to the outside world. Her environment consists almost entirely of her partner and her daughter. I do not intend that any of this should be interpreted as a criticism. It is not. It is, however, an illustration of the tight parameters of the world that this couple has been living in for so long. There is no issue, arising in this case, upon which M and LF are not in total agreement. There is no light and shade, M gives her partner 100% support on everything. Her hostility to the care home is every bit as strong as his. In August 2020, she navigated her partner back on to the ward knowing that he had been excluded for failing to comply with the Covid regulations in place because of an outbreak in the hospital. Not only is she supportive of LF&#8217;s position, but she has also revealed herself to be facilitative of the disruption that he causes.</p>

N is adept with technology and social media. She is equally determined that her granddaughter should not go to the care home. I have heard evidence that if this placement were to be lost, it would take a very considerable time to identify another and it is unlikely that it would be in the locality. Thus, it would mean that this young woman would have to stay for many more months in a place that everybody agrees is entirely unsuitable and potentially move to a care home which risks limiting her contact with her parents. None of the family has confronted this dichotomy. Their minds, in my judgement, have simply been closed to the possibility of the care home from the outset. </p>

It is for this reason that I have come to the conclusion that the injunctive relief sought in respect of them both is entirely necessary. The scope and ambit of the relief is to put in place clear boundaries to manage the family&#8217;s behaviour. It is both justified and proportionate here to regulate N&#8217;s personal and nursing care, permitting the staff to operate effectively in the provision of G&#8217;s personal care, medication, nutrition, tracheostomy care and more generally, to establish her dignity as an adult. This last point requires particular emphasis. Incapacitated adults are not children. I do not think that either LF or M has, for reasons which are no doubt entirely understandable, absorbed this fundamental distinction and how integral it is to understanding G&#8217;s needs. If it were possible to harness LF&#8217;s strengths to make the placement work, this would be to G&#8217;s very considerable benefit. I regret to say that I see no evidence of him being prepared to support the placement. On the contrary, he continues expressly to disavow it. </p>
