The guardian has been able to complete direct work with Z and Y regarding this. Y considers England to be her home and although she likes to visit Romania, as her grandmother lives there, she does prefer England. She attends school here and has plenty of friends.

Or does it mean that the other court is more suitable, that is to say better adapted, for reasons wider than mere geography, to hear the case? It is interesting that the French translation of article 15 uses the same ambiguous phrase: &#8220;mieux plac&#233;e&#8221;.

They say that a move of these children from the stability of their present placements, in direct contradiction to the wishes and feelings of the older two children, to an unknown placement with complete strangers unable to speak the language in which they now habitually communicate, is obviously detrimental to their situation. I agree. These children are especially vulnerable and under the support of CAMHS. Z is additionally vulnerable due to her partial sightedness. She is learning to use braille and is doing well in school. All the children overwhelmingly need stability and continuity of care. By care I mean not only from their primary carers but also from therapeutic caring professionals. The notion that the two elder girls should re-learn their birth language and that the two youngest girls should learn essentially a new language, in what I presume is a timescale to be measured in months, is unrealistic. I will not place this burden on them. That is not to say that cultural and linguistic identity is not important. It is and it should be promoted. However, this consideration cannot dominate to the exclusion of others. For the time being the parents all remain in this jurisdiction. It has not been suggested that their departure is imminent. Speculation about this is not sufficient to uproot the children. These children have fortunately had the benefit of consistent foster care since the beginning of these proceedings and have settled well. I would expect that if the children were to be moved again that such a move would be their final permanent move. I cannot countenance the removal of the children from their foster placement here to another temporary placement in Romania. How many moves will there be for them after that? Will they, or some of them, then get to live with their parents or alternative carers? Or will they then be moved to another foster carer once the Romanian proceedings are concluded? I just do not know. It is well accepted that unnecessary moves should be avoided. If the English court finds at the final hearing that it is in the best interests of the children to move to Romania and into the care of their parents or other relatives, then it will make that order. However, I cannot pre-empt that decision today.  </p>
