She has a rare chromosomal abnormality syndrome, known as &#8220;chromosome 17q12 microdeletion&#8221;, as a consequence of which she suffers from cognitive impairment and a bicornate (or heart-shaped) uterus.   </p>

Of her four children, one sadly died when only 6 days old and her other three children have been taken into care.  Z developed complications in all her previous pregnancies and this pregnancy is considered to be medically high risk.  Due to her bicornate uterus, Z is at risk of preterm birth and fetal malpresentation.  Given these risk factors, Z has been booked to deliver her baby by caesarean section on 3 April 2020. </p>

Their co-operation in the conduct of the hearing and in their focussed submissions made my judicial task a great deal easier. Given the late stage of Z&#8217;s pregnancy and the agreement between the parties, I give a short ex tempore judgment and, at the invitation of the parties, I revised that judgment so that it might be publicly available. By a transparency order dated 20 March 2020, I provided that neither Z nor those directly involved in her treatment or care should be identified and this judgment has been written accordingly. </p>

It was not possible for KB to meet with Z as, being heavily pregnant, Z was self-isolating in response to the threat of Covid-19.

She told me that she would be helped by her nurse to go to the regular appointments which would be necessary to maintain her injectable contraceptive. She was unable to articulate why a long-lasting contraceptive injection was her preferred method of contraception other than by saying &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">it&#8217;s my body</span>&#8221;. After hearing submissions and before giving my judgment, I told Z that I had decided it was in her best interests for her to have an intrauterine contraceptive device fitted at the time of her caesarean. Z rang off after hearing me say this. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.03in">Dr Camden-Smith reviewed Z&#8217;s psychiatric history, noting that Z was reported in 2015 to have an IQ of 61 which placed her in the mild Learning Disability range. In 2017 Z&#8216;s diagnosis of mild learning disability was confirmed by the Community Learning Disability team after Z had participated in an assessment using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV). Z achieved particularly low scores on the Verbal Comprehension index, the Working Memory index, and the Processing Speed index which indicated that she had substantial comprehension and language difficulties. Additionally, Z&#8217;s records contained various reports that Z&#8217;s relatively good social and adaptive functioning, combined with her apparent verbal fluency, had resulted in her abilities being substantially over-estimated. Thus, Z had not always received the care and support she needed since it was evident that her receptive language skills and understanding were significantly below that of her expressed verbal skills. Z&#8217;s local Learning Disability team had accepted that she has a learning disability with associated mental health needs which cannot be met by mental health services.  </p>

She did not understand why the court might be involved with respect to her decision about contraception; why Drs A and B might be worried about her understanding of that issue; or why Drs A and B had spent significant amounts of time exploring her decision in respect of contraception with her. Furthermore Z did not understand that she had a solicitor to advocate on her behalf and, though Dr Camden-Smith tried to draw parallels with Z&#8217;s experience of Family Court proceedings, Z did not understand the role of a solicitor despite having had one previously in Family Court proceedings. Dr Camden-Smith concluded that Z lacked the capacity to conduct these proceedings due to an inability to understand the relevant information. She did not understand the court process or the kinds of decisions she might be called upon to make in court. Put simply, Z did not understand that her learning disability might affect her ability to make decisions.  </p>

Nevertheless, Bodey J recognised that the much wider test being proposed by the applicants in that case, involving understanding the consequences of rearing a child, &#8220;would create a real risk of blurring the line between capacity and best interests. If part of the test were to involve whether the woman concerned understood enough about the practical realities of parenthood, then one would inevitably be in the realms od a degree of subjectivity, into which a paternalistic approach could easily creep&#8221; [para. 61). </p>

Her obstetric history was one of yearly pregnancies with an obvious inability to control fertility since yearly pregnancies were suggestive of a failure to use contraception. He observed that her pregnancies were getting more complicated with each one, with increasing problems relating to gestational diabetes resulting in large babies which made delivery more dangerous. After the next delivery, Z would have had two caesarean section deliveries which increased the risk in future pregnancies of uterine rupture, haemorrhage, the need for hysterectomy and the possibility of the baby dying. Pregnancy within two years of a caesarean section made these risks even higher. Z had an increased risk of premature labour thus increasing the risk of rupture. After two caesarean sections, the risk that the placenta was inserted over the old scar (placenta percreta) increased which could lead to severe maternal haemorrhage, hysterectomy and maternal death. Any future pregnancy would require a fully compliant, understanding mother so as to maximise the mother&#8217;s safety and that of her baby. His stark conclusion was that Z was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">an extremely highrisk individual where any future pregnancy would carry with it a significant risk to her and her baby&#8217;s health</span>&#8221;.   </p>

The ability to understand and weigh up the nature and degree of the physical risks to her consequent on another pregnancy was fundamental to Z&#8217;s ability to make a decision about contraception. The capacity assessments of Dr A, Dr B and Dr Camden Smith demonstrated that Z did not have a sufficient understanding of her own health status to enable her to relate the generic risks and benefits of contraception to her individual circumstances. Z&#8217;s interview with Dr Camden-Smith illustrated her lack of understanding of the risks to her health arising from future pregnancies. When asked to explain why she had decided a contraceptive injection was best, Z was unable to do so, saying &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I just have. I&#8217;m having the injection</span>&#8221;. She lacked any understanding that her compliance might be in issue, saying &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I will have the injection</span>&#8221;, when Dr Camden-Smith pointed out to her that she was not complying with her other medication for diabetes, anaemia and nutritional deficiencies. Z was unable to remember any factors, other than that she might die, which those involved in her care might be concerned about and appeared to be dismissive or unable to remember when Dr Camden-Smith suggested people might be worried about her losing blood, developing diabetes, the death of her baby or the need for life-altering surgery such as a hysterectomy. </p>

Miss Watson submitted that each subsequent pregnancy would carry cumulative risks to Z&#8217;s health. These risks included the risk of developing long-term cardiovascular and renal disease due to poorly controlled diabetes; the risk of worsening nutritional deficiencies predisposing Z to infection and poor bone health; and the risk of pregnancy-related complications such as stillbirth, life-threatening haemorrhage, uterine or pelvic infection and venous thromboembolic events.  </p>

Z&#8217;s poor compliance with not only past injectable contraceptives but with medical treatment in this pregnancy militated against me endorsing Z&#8217;s wish to have an injectable contraceptive. </p>
