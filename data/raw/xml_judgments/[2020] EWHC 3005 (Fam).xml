That order was continued at the inter partes hearing on 23 July 2020, and, on that date, I made an order requiring Temur to deliver up and provide access to his electronic devices and cloud storage accounts, and for these to be forensically examined by an independent IT expert, Aon [&#8220;the forensic examination order&#8221;]. </p>

All his electronic devices, including the only desktop computer which he admitted to owning, were said by him to have been lost in transit from France to London when he was seeking to comply with the forensic examination order. An investigation has been launched by the courier company, DHL, and a police investigation is ongoing in France. Temur also failed to provide access to his cloud accounts in defiance of the forensic examination order.  The only data delivered by Temur or on his behalf to the IT expert, Aon, was a mobile phone image which was held by the third party company that had originally produced the image. </p>

These had not been disclosed by him or delivered up in accordance with the forensic examination order.  Those circumstances gave rise to serious concerns on behalf of those who represent the wife that these devices contained critical evidence on the key issues in the proceedings, disclosure of which is necessary for their just resolution. </p>

I am satisfied I have the jurisdiction to make such an order pursuant to FPR 20.2(1)(h).  The core requirements for the making of such an order are as follows: firstly, there must be an extremely strong prima facie case; secondly, that the damage, potential or actual, must be very serious for the applicant; thirdly, there must be clear evidence that the respondent has in his possession incriminating documents or things and that there is a real possibility that the respondent might destroy such material before any inter partes application could be made; and, fourthly, the harm likely to be caused by the execution of the order to Temur and his business affairs must not be excessive or out of proportion to the legitimate object of the order. </p>

I have read those paragraphs of the Court of Appeal's judgment which are of particular relevance in setting out the legal framework for these orders, and the principles were summarised by Mr Penny in paragraph 15 of his skeleton argument.

I accepted at a without notice hearing for the worldwide freezing order on 17 July 2020 that the wife had a good arguable case in respect of her claims against Temur.

There is now, as there was not then, expert evidence that Temur did in fact become the legal owner of the Moscow property in June 2018.  That evidence appears on the face of it to undermine his defence that he never became the beneficial owner of that property. </p>

The disclosure process has resulted in Temur failing to disclose a single contemporaneous document since 1 March 2016. He has disclosed no document from his own records save for two discrete emails that he believes to be helpful to his case.  He has also destroyed critical documents going to key issues in the proceedings, and he makes specific admissions in respect to the following categories of documents. </p>

Those matters are set out by Mr Penny in the skeleton argument.  For example, Temur has failed to provide a list of all the electronic platforms used by him since 1 January 2013 and failed to provide the information required to access these.  I give but one example of this apparent failure. </p>

The report from the independent experts Aon indicated that when Aon first sought access to this account on 7 August 2020, they were provided with an incorrect password when doing so.  However, when performing the account recovery process with Temur on 14 August 2020 they were met with a message stating: <span style="font-style:italic">"This account was recently deleted and may be recoverable.  Click next to attempt to restore this account".</span> Temur appears to have been unable to give them any further information about this at the time. Aon's conclusion was that the account was deleted at some time between 7 August 2020 and 14 August 2020. </p>

Recent developments, however, have made the application before me today a matter of some urgency. There appears to have been active concealment by Temur of electronic devices in his flat.  The valuation report of that flat prepared for the purpose of a loan facility which Temur aimed to make use of, shows in photographs appended thereto a number of electronic devices in Temur&#8217;s study.  Those pictures were taken during the inspection of the property on 27 August 2020.  I have seen the relevant photograph.  It shows one or possibly more than one desktop tower computer, three computer screens, three keyboards and a printer.  There also appears to be a laptop which is being charged on a shelf behind the desk. </p>

The photographs were of course taken on 27 August 2020.  That was in fact a full month after Temur ought to have delivered up his electronic devices and a full month after his only disclosed personal computer and other electronic devices were allegedly shipped from France but lost in transit. </p>

Such an extensive office setup is unlikely to be used by Temur's former partner, who is unemployed, or by their young daughter, who is only 4 years old. It is the wife's evidence that she has seen this office setup on a number of occasions, most recently in March 2020, which is before Temur's former partner started residing at the flat.   </p>

It arises from Temur's apparent failure to comply with this court's orders.  Her case is that she is a victim of a series of dishonest and elaborate schemes which were intended to prevent her obtaining the sums which this court had ordered in December 2016.  The claim against Temur is a critical aspect of her attempt to obtain relief, notwithstanding those schemes.  His continuing apparent failure to disclose relevant documents which are likely to be of vital importance to key issues in the proceedings; his admitted deliberate destruction of relevant documents; his apparent concealment of electronic devices; and his repeated failure to comply with the terms of this court's orders are all likely to cause serious damage to the wife in prejudicing her ability to pursue the proceedings and obtain the judgment to which she claims to be entitled. </p>

Thus Temur's actions affect her claims against the other respondents in these proceedings, and it also means that this court is being deprived of important evidence to establish the purpose of the transfers of the monetary assets to the Liechtenstein trusts and to Borderedge.   </p>

First of all the process of conducting the search will be done in a manner which minimises any threat to health in light of the current Covid pandemic. In recognition of the fact that the premises are believed to be currently occupied by Temur&#8217;s former partner and his daughter, at least two members of the search party will be female.  The search is limited to electronic devices which he should have delivered up to Aon in any event.  It is thus a search which is likely to be executed quickly and will be significantly less intrusive that the execution of a more extensive search.  He would only be deprived of his devices for a short period of time and these would be returned to him.  The data collection processes would be non-destructive, and all information and data obtained by Aon would be kept confidential.  User generated material would be sent to his solicitors and to the supervising solicitor to be held pending the court's further order.  This material could not be accessed by the wife's legal representatives. </p>

Those matters are set out at paragraphs 85.2 and 85.3.  I do not propose to rehearse what is set out therein, although I have considered it very carefully indeed.  Ultimately that issue will be for me to resolve on the evidence at trial at the end of November 2020.

I intend that those provisions should minimise confusion and, I hope, any distress.
