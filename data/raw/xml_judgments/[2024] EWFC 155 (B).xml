It is the third time that it has been listed for final hearing. It should have been ready to proceed but, as will become clear from this judgment, the working day before the hearing it became apparent to the court that significant legal argument was being raised in a dispute primarily between the local authority and the guardian. That argument ought to have been grappled with at a much earlier stage in proceedings. It has caused the court, the working day before the final hearing, to have to reallocate the matter to circuit judge level and find time in the diary to accommodate this. I have had to hear legal argument on Tuesday 21 May 2024, giving an indication of my decision that afternoon and write these fuller reasons amidst my other matters the next day. The reasons were sent in draft to the advocates on the afternoon of Wednesday 22 May 2024 and formally handed down the next day Thursday 23 May 2024. I have been acutely conscious of the previous delay in this case and the need to have a decision quickly and progress made.</span></p>

A has two older half-sisters, B and C. They are subject to care orders granted in 2020 and reside with foster carers under the enhanced parental responsibility of the local authority. Originally that included placement orders, but such were later revoked following a change of care plan. Their foster carers are enhanced foster carers working hard to provide a loving home to them.</span></p>

The local authority had concluded that adoption ought to be the care plan and made an application for a placement order. That came to be considered by the learned district judge in February 2024. There was argument presented, again at the door of the court mirroring today&#8217;s position, that the matter had to adjourn because the foster carers for the older children had now put themselves forward such that the court could not undertake the required analysis of all of the competing options deriving from </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Re B-S [2013] EWCA Civ 1146</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. It is not fully clear to me the extent of the enquiries that had taken place prior to this. When considering a placement order, the court must conduct a thorough analysis with the child&#8217;s welfare throughout their life being the court&#8217;s paramount consideration and with reference to the &#8216;enhanced&#8217; welfare checklist in </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">s.1(4)</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> of the </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Adoption and Children Act 2002</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">.</span></p>

On 10 May 2024, all parties attended and argument was heard by the learned district judge. The foster carers were joined as intervenors. I should note that all parties (other than the foster carers) were properly legally represented on this occasion and could have placed the arguments that now arise before the court so that they could have been resolved. It is suggested to me that no party raised the appropriate test for joinder under the Children Act 1989 with the court nor provided the court with caselaw as to the propriety of foster carers intervening in care proceedings.</span></p>

He refers me to </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Re T [2018] EWCA Civ 650</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">, which I observe is the culmination of a chain of authorities encompassing those such as </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">W v Neath Port Talbot [2013] EWCA Civ 1227</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> cited within it. He argues that it was right that information was provided by the authority from the February order, and potentially that further questions could be asked, but he resists as being on the wrong side of the impermissible line the local authority&#8217;s evidence being tested in that regard. He accepts that we are in the very difficult territory described by the former President in </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Re H [2018] EWFC 61</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> as to where one draws the line between explanation and justification when looking at 3</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">rd</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> party decision-making and the Family Court&#8217;s powers but also responsibilities. Ultimately, he seeks to persuade the court that because a care order has been made for B and C and the case closed to the Family Court, that the care planning of the local authority is not only sovereign to them but cannot be the subject of probing within these proceedings beyond having the authority potentially consider some further questions.</span></p>

She urges me to follow the route in </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Re T</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">, to make those enquiries and to examine and probe the evidence. She accepts that there are two distinct roles: care planning is the domain of the authority and the Family Court cannot force a local authority to change its care plan and ought not to. However, it may make a request and to do so after appropriate consideration of the issues. She argues that the court must focus on the proper welfare decisions for A and such includes an evaluation of the risk, or otherwise, of placement with these foster carers. She comments that it is highly unfortunate that the local authority do not appear open in any way to even considering, within their sovereign care planning, any alternative view to which the Family Court may come.</span></p>

However, I must record that it is highly unfortunate that the question has come before the court in this manner and with this urgency, requiring the court to assimilate the complex arguments quickly and give a decision. It required the change of list between a circuit and district judge the day before a final hearing was to commence, with the result that clear days were not available nor the amount of days originally envisaged. That is following the insistence by the authority in its position statement for a written judgment on the preliminary issues and time to consider were they not to fall in their favour. It is inappropriate to put before the court a reason for the late notification is that counsel was only just instructed. In the context of these long-running public law proceedings that argument must carry little weight and fall back on the shoulders of the party themselves. I note that all parties have been represented throughout this long-running litigation and each has a duty to the court in furthering the overriding objective. Arguments concerning joinder and how the case should be put ought really to have been made on 10 May at the hearing listed for such a purpose. However, arguments about the legitimacy of the court to undertake the exercise it directed in February ought to have been brought to the court at that time. I do not accept Mr Brown&#8217;s submission that the authority were content with the evidence directed in February because the order goes further than that directing a final hearing where it was envisaged that evidence would be called which he now asserts cannot be subject to challenge. Therefore, I have to deprecate the manner in which the authority has approached this part of the litigation and such has unnecessarily extended the timetable for this little girl.</span></p>

The Family Court is responsible for an evaluation of risk and welfare, making orders to underpin those. The local authority is responsible for care planning. However, there is an interplay between those roles which requires a mutual respect and cooperation. It is what we ought to expect from two arms of the state entrusted with the safeguarding and welfare of children. This argument is about that interplay.</span></p>

They have made clear to me that their mind is made up. Mr Brown asserts that this court cannot directly or indirectly interfere with that decision-making and that such trespasses into the impermissible territory in </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Re H</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> of requiring a 3</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">rd</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> party decision-maker to both justify its decision-making and argue its case. I am concerned as to how that folds into the mutual respect and cooperation that has to exist between our two roles, or the task that we must all undertake within these proceedings for this subject child and with due deference to her and her family&#8217;s article 8 rights. The authority argue that the remedy for the foster carers is judicial review and a short adjournment could allow that to occur. Following case law, and as a last resort, they may be correct about that, although none of us are aware of an instance where it has ever come to that option of last resort due to the mutual respect and cooperation path highlighted above. However, the submissions of the authority appear to cut off the ability of this court to examine the reasoning, probe appropriately and to have the authority at least reflect upon and consider that position prior to that option of last resort being invoked. It also involves a range of decision-makers, including those for the older children but also the IRO and ADM for the subject child.</span></p>

This involves a care order that has already been made and the court appreciates that difference. Of course, here the foster carers are not completely unconnected with the family, but the long-term carers of the two older children who are half-siblings to a little girl for whom the authority&#8217;s plan is adoption. There exists a hybrid situation for which we have been unable to find an exact parallel in caselaw. I have considered whether it would, for hypothetical example only and noting the limits of such, prevent a grandmother who was looking after an older sibling as a foster carer seeking further assessment for a newborn sibling were the authority to take the view that she ought not due to the care plan for the older child. I am unpersuaded as to that being appropriate. However, as I have said above, I note the limits of hypothetical examples.</span></p>

I have to comment that is despite all parties, other than the foster carers, being represented at the hearing. The decision was not challenged, presumably because those arguments were not advanced at the time. Reconsideration has effectively been invited by the back door. When hearings are listed and parties are represented that should be the final word on the matter absent proper appeal. It follows that they must give the court the assistance it requires in determining the matter.</span></p>

They have been in court during those arguments and heard us talk about them. I have no doubt how difficult it has been for them to do that. The guardian at present is advancing the position appropriately and robustly. Having heard from everyone and considering the case law, I do not consider that the time has come as yet (and may not) for the foster carers to be intervened in proceedings. I discharge them. That may be reconsidered at the appropriate time.</span></p>
