But for the technical point with which I must deal in due course it would be the plainest possible case for an adoption order. The local authority has produced a Schedule 2 report which is not merely supportive of Ms H&#8217;s application but &#8220;strongly recommend[s]&#8221; that an adoption order be made. An experienced guardian is equally supportive, giving it as her &#8220;firm view&#8221; that adoption is in SL&#8217;s best interests and having &#8220;no hesitation in recommending and lending my support to this adoption application&#8221;. </p>

It was a privilege, but also a very humbling experience, to be able to meet her. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.07in">SL was born on or about 25 June 1994. We do not know where or when he was born or who his parents were, because he was found on 4 June 1996, seemingly abandoned, on a football field in Hong Kong. One suspects that this was not unconnected with the fact that he is a child with multiple and profound difficulties. Efforts by the Hong Kong authorities to trace his parents were unsuccessful and on 18 July 1996 an order was made by the relevant court in Hong Kong appointing the Director of Social Welfare of Hong Kong (&#8220;the Director&#8221;) as his legal guardian. In March 1997 he was placed in a residential home for children with special needs.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.07in">It was there that Ms H, an English expatriate working as a volunteer care assistant, first met him in June 1997. She became for much of the time his key worker and became very attached to him. Towards the end of 1998 she decided to adopt him. The guardian refers to her as having single-handedly fought to become SL&#8217;s parent against all the odds and as having shown resilience and foresight in her aim of adopting him. I need not go into the details. Ms H has at all times worked in full and frank cooperation with all the relevant authorities both in Hong Kong and in this country. None of them opposes the making of an adoption order or seeks to take any part in the proceedings.   </p>

SL had in fact already been placed with Ms H on 24 August 2001. </p>

Sheldon J found that the applicants had never had a &#8220;home&#8221; in England or Wales at any material time, so they were unable to meet the judge&#8217;s requirement at (a). In that sense <span style="font-style:italic">Re Y </span>turned on what are now <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/22/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 22(1)</ref> and 13(3)(b) rather than on <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/13/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 13(2)</ref>. In the present case, in contrast, that requirement presents no difficulty.

On the facts, therefore, the present case is, as Ms Angell submits, quite different. In the present case the difficulty arises out of Sheldon J&#8217;s observations at (b). Those observations were not strictly speaking necessary for his decision and can therefore properly be considered mere <span style="font-style:italic">obiter dicta</span>. But, of course, as Sir Robert Megarry once remarked, there are dicta and dicta, and I cannot ignore the fact that the passage I have just quoted appears to have been a precisely formulated statement of principle set out in a reserved judgment which had, it would seem, been carefully prepared for publication. </p>

That being so, there is nothing anywhere in the legislation to indicate that the &#8220;home&#8221; referred to in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/13/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 13(2)</ref> has to be within the jurisdiction, let alone in any particular place. </p>

As Mr Sherwin correctly pointed out, a purposive approach to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/13" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 13</ref> leads readily to the identification of two separate statutory purposes which <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/13" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 13</ref> is designed to achieve, within the wider statutory objective of ensuring that an adoption order is only made if the adoption of the particular child by the particular applicant is in the best interests of the child: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.07in">Each of these purposes can be achieved whether or not the &#8220;home&#8221; relied on as satisfying the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/13/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 13(2)</ref> requirement is the same as the &#8220;home&#8221; (or &#8220;home environment&#8221;) relied on as satisfying the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/13/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 13(3)</ref>(b) requirement. That being so, I ask rhetorically, What further statutory purpose would be served by requiring the two &#8220;homes&#8221; to be the same? I can think of none. On the contrary, to read into the statute that further requirement would actually &#8211; as the facts of the present case so plainly illustrate &#8211; compel the court on occasions to deny an adoption even when the requirements of both <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/13/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 13(2)</ref> and 13(3)(b) have seemingly been met and even though, as in the present case, adoption is so very obviously in the best interests of the child. As <span style="font-style:italic">Re Y </span>shows, there will be occasions when the plain words of the statute prevent a judge doing that which is in the best interests of the child. So be it. But that is no reason for construing <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36" uk:canonical="1976 c. 36" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1976 Act</ref> narrowly, or reading words into it which are not there, if the consequence is to be the denial to a child of an adoption which is plainly in his best interests. This is legislation which requires to be given a sensible and purposive construction. As I remarked during the course of argument, it would be almost absurd to suggest that the requirements of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/13/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 13(2)</ref> are not met if the applicant relocates north of the border just a day or two before the final adoption hearing takes place &#8211; perhaps because a hearing originally fixed for an earlier date has had to be re-fixed to meet the court&#8217;s convenience. And if that is so, it cannot make a difference that the applicant in fact re-located rather earlier.    </p>

The author of the Schedule 2 report describes how, with the love and devotion Ms H has shown him, SL has become a secure, happy child who is now thriving. The guardian comments that Ms H has offered him a remarkable opportunity to achieve emotional security within a loving family. The Director consented to my making an adoption order (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/16/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(1)</ref>(b)(i) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36" uk:canonical="1976 c. 36" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1976 Act</ref>) and I had no hesitation in dispensing with the agreement of the parents on the ground that they cannot be found (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/16/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(2)</ref>(a)).
