Whilst required by law to make my decision having undertaken a careful assessment of those welfare needs and by applying the lodestar that is the paramount nature of G&#8217;s best interests, the reality is that I am again today reduced to little more than a rubber stamp in circumstances where, as Mr Jones submits, the continuing lack of options before the court essentially obviates the courts ability to apply the welfare test. </p>

Following the breakdown of her long term foster care placement in January 2020 G had twenty admissions to hospital due to self-harming behaviour and suicidal ideation.  By August 2020 G had written nine letters in which she stated a desire to kill herself.  The course of this extremely concerning period is set out in more detail in my first judgment in this matter (see <span style="font-style:italic">Lancashire CC v G (Unavailability of Secure Accommodation)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2020/2828" uk:canonical="[2020] EWHC 2828 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] EWHC 2828 (Fam)</ref>). </p>

Dr Ahmad, a Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist with ELCAS assessed G as showing clear indications that she will develop a personality disorder and will remain vulnerable to acting out and deliberate self-harm in the future.  Dr Beck, also with ELCAS, has had limited success in engaging G, limiting the ability to gain a full picture of her emotional health.  Whilst placed at the [placement] in May 2020, G was seen by a Clinical psychologist, Dr Nokling, who described G as being incredibly complex, avoidant and very difficult to engage. Dr Nokling considered that G required inpatient treatment or, if that could not be accessed, placement in a secure unit or, at the very least, a solo bed therapeutic provision.

Within that context, Dr Oppenheim recommended either a secure placement with intensive CAMHS provision or a tier 4 mental health bed with low secure services, which could only be achieved through an adult mental health referral pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>, the criteria for which Dr Oppenheim believed were established. She considered that either type of placement would meet G&#8217;s needs, given the urgency of her situation, and that the duration would likely need to be at least six months, accompanied by careful step- down planning.  Dr Oppenheim also recommended that G be the subject of a speech and language assessment, a repeat cognitive assessment by an Educational Psychologist and a sensory assessment by an Occupational Therapist when in placement.  </p>

Private life is a broad term not susceptible to exhaustive definition. The court has already held that elements such as gender identification, name and sexual orientation and sexual life are important elements of the personal sphere protected by Art 8. Mental health must also be regarded as a crucial part of private life associated with the aspect of moral integrity.

Once again, whilst required to make my decision having undertaken a careful assessment of G&#8217;s global welfare needs and having applied the lodestar that is the paramount nature of G&#8217;s best interests, the fact that there is only one placement option before the court means that the test applied by the court comes far closer to being one of necessity than it does to being one of best interests, the continuing unavailability of the regulated provision that G requires meaning that the court can only rely on the barest considerations of safety in making its decision, rather than the global welfare assessment it should be conducting in order properly to inform its decision as to best interests.   </p>

However, as in previous judgments, in the foregoing circumstances I am again left asking myself whether, where there remains, six months after the commencement of proceedings, only one sub-optimal, unregulated placement option open to the court, the court is really exercising its welfare jurisdiction by reference to G&#8217;s best interests if it chooses that one option, or if the court simply being forced by necessity to make an order irrespective of welfare considerations.  If the latter, then it is difficult to see how the decision I have made can be lawful by reference to the current law governing the use of the inherent jurisdiction to authorise the deprivation of a child&#8217;s liberty. </p>

The professionals are increasingly concerned with respect to G&#8217;s regular attempts to harm herself and for the continued viability of what is already an unsuitable placement for G.  G continues to swallow dangerous objects and to tie ligatures around her neck.  Within this context, whilst my judgments to date are comprised of the mournful accounts of the self-harming behaviour by which G expresses her acute and enduring emotional pain, I am increasingly worried that, absent a suitable placement being found, it will be the sad responsibility of this court to deliver a judgment that records with respect to G a greater tragedy still. </p>

Likewise, the judicial role is not that of the polemicist.  I have however, taken the judicial oath.  In doing so (and as recalled by Sir James Munby P in a similar case in <span style="font-style:italic">Re X (A Child)(No 3)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2017/2036" uk:canonical="[2017] EWHC 2036 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWHC 2036 (Fam)</ref>) I promised to do right by all manner of people according to the laws and usages of this realm.  It is very hard, if not impossible, to do right by G, to keep her safe and to work to relieve her enduring and acute emotional pain, when the tools required to achieve that end are simply unavailable to this court.  As I have commented in my previous judgments, this places the court in the invidious position of being required by the law of this realm to make decisions that hold G&#8217;s best interests as the court&#8217;s paramount consideration but being effectively disabled from doing so by an ongoing and acute lack of appropriate welfare provision for a constituency of the country&#8217;s most needy, most vulnerable children. </p>
