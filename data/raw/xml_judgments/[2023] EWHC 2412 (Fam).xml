The purpose of the Convention is to ensure that the courts of the country which is the habitual residence of a child determine all disputed questions of welfare. Accordingly, where a child has been removed from or retained outside his country of habitual residence, the Convention provides for summary return so that long term decisions about his care can be heard and determined before the courts of that country.</p>

She also had the benefit of an interpreter who was present in court throughout the hearing although she made minimal use of his services, and her English is excellent. She resists the application on the basis that this Court has no jurisdiction to make any order under the 1980 Hague Convention because the Children were habitually resident in England and Wales at the date of the alleged wrongful retention. In the alternative, she argues that returning the Children to Kazakhstan would expose them to a grave risk of physical or psychological harm or would otherwise place them in an intolerable situation for the purposes of Art 13(b) and that M and A object to a return. It was confirmed at the outset of the hearing that the issue of consent as an exception to a summary return order was no longer being pursued by the mother.</p>

He viewed her actions as raising an issue of trust. He states that &#8216;in order to reassure him&#8217; about various concerns he had regarding the children coming to the UK, (including in his words the risk of dying in a car accident or joining a dangerous sect), ML and OZ signed on 25 October 2020 a &#8216;temporary relocation agreement&#8217;. OZ&#8217;s case is that this agreement was &#8216;conditional approval&#8217; by him on the basis that ML gave him her &#8216;unconditional consent&#8217; to return the children as soon as he ever asked her to.</p>

For my own part, I have considerable doubts that this agreement was signed in October 2020, not least because its terms are strikingly prescient: they appear to predict with surprising precision and foresight the exact issues which in due course would cause OZ concern, for example that after school clubs would cause friction regarding the timing of contact videocalls.</p>

It requires ML to provide an exhaustive list of phone numbers, instant messaging accounts, e-mail addresses, mobile phones, and laptops, as well as the login and passwords to the above devices and accounts and to provide details to OZ of any changes within 24 hours of them being made. ML promises that her studies will &#8216;not be an excuse for refusing to fulfil the obligations as a wife and mother.&#8217; Another material term provides that the Children will live in the UK, but only for as long as ML &#8216;has financial means&#8217; to do so. ML promises to &#8216;ensure&#8217; that the Children communicate with OZ &#8216;every day for at least 1 hour&#8217; and that she personally will respond to all calls and messages within 3 hours.</p>

ML describes how she brought mostly clothes and books and intended to buy household items on arrival. The Children were registered with a GP and dentist locally in December 2020 and an optician in July 2021. It is common ground that OZ helped organise the move and find school places for the children and paid for the rental of a 5/6 bedroomed house for the first 12 months assured shorthold tenancy. The Children attended remote schooling from November 2020 at a local primary school, and from March 2021, they attended in person.</p>

ML was cross-examined on the basis that it was callous and heartless of her to seek to arrange a foreign holiday and showed a lack of sympathy for OZ&#8217;s health and wellbeing. Mr Lue was clearly acting on instructions in this regard.  This is an example of how OZ puts concerns about himself ahead of the Children and that his expectations of ML are to prioritise his wishes and feeling above those of the Children.

M was concerned about speaking to the guardian in case it made OZ angry about her views. I was particularly struck by the guardian&#8217;s oral evidence when he expressed how difficult M had found it to express any criticism of OZ and how muted her language was. He concluded that she has a high degree of emotional intelligence and considers the implications of her decisions, notably in relation to her father which is evidence of maturity in his view which makes it appropriate to take account of her views.</p>

A made a joke of the fact that ML would sometimes shout upstairs for the Children to make less noise if it was disturbing her work. A described his contact time with OZ and stated that it was spent playing games and watching cartoons via videocall. In his oral evidence, he expanded on this point, stating that there was no evidence that OZ ever showed any interest in the Children&#8217;s emotional wellbeing or the other aspects of their lives. He felt that OZ placed considerable value on the quantity of contact time at the price of the quality of the contact.</p>

Apart from the fact that in broad terms the views expressed by the Children appear to be the same as the ones they expressed to the guardian, it is difficult to draw many conclusions from this report. It is a translated document and has been produced subject to instructions which I have not seen and in the circumstances of the very different procedural context and questions which the Astana juvenile court was asking itself. I do take note, however, of the factual observation of the psychologist when she notes that following the interviews, OZ collected the Children and was not in any way interested in their emotional response or their wellbeing, but solely whether they had said the things he wanted them to say.</p>

It relied on the fact that ML had applied for refugee status in the UK and that the grant of asylum would prevent the Children from returning to Kazakhstan on the basis that they were fleeing that State. In the Court&#8217;s reasoning, such an outcome would be contrary to the Children&#8217;s best interests because it would preclude their return. On this basis, the Court refused to attach any weight to the views of M (the eldest child) because it concluded that she was of insufficient maturity to appreciate the long-term consequences of refugee status and its impact on her ability to return to Kazakhstan or loss of cultural heritage.</p>

It can be seen from the reasons that OZ maintained a case for return of the Children to Kazakhstan based on the agreement dated 25 October 2020 and no consideration appears to have been given to whether the Children&#8217;s residence in England was habitual at any point.

Any objection to returning to a particular parent may be inextricably linked to return to a particular country in which case, both factors must be considered. This can arise where, for example, the only place where the child would be able to live on returning to the foreign country would be with that parent.</p>

The court is entitled to take into account the various aspects of the Convention policy, alongside the circumstances which gave the court a discretion in the first place and the wider considerations of the child's rights and welfare. I would, therefore, respectfully agree with Thorpe LJ in the passage quoted in para [32] above, save for the word 'overriding' if it suggests that the Convention objectives should always be given more weight than the other considerations. Sometimes they should and sometimes they should not.</p>

As is clear from the earlier discussion, the Convention was the product of prolonged discussions in which some careful balances were struck and fine distinctions drawn. The underlying purpose is to protect the interests of children by securing the swift return of those who have been wrongfully removed or retained. The Convention itself has defined when a child must be returned and when she need not be. Thereafter the weight to be given to Convention considerations and to the interests of the child will vary enormously. The extent to which it will be appropriate to investigate those welfare considerations will also vary. But the further away one gets from the speedy return envisaged by the Convention, the less weighty those general Convention considerations must be.&#8221;</p>

In that WhatsApp exchange, ML indicated to OZ that she would not be willing for him to stay in the same house as her and the Children and from her oral evidence I am satisfied that was because she was fearful of him. She was to my mind put in fear for her personal safety as a result of OZ&#8217;s oppressive demands of control, but also physically following the incident during his visit in February and March 2022 when he had broken through the bathroom door whilst she was in the shower and forced himself upon her. This prompted an outpouring of expletive and abusive language in the message exchanges from OZ and his anger and determination to seek retribution are palpable.</p>

They were missing their mother and were away from their toys, books, friends, school, and classmates. I also accept the evidence of the guardian that the Children notably were unable to say anything positive about the schooling which they received in Kazakhstan, in stark contrast to their response to school in England. I find that they were struggling to come to terms with the abrupt change of their plans and had no knowledge of how long the situation was going to last.</p>

For one thing, there appears to have been no reassurance as to when they would see their mother again. I find that in fact the Children were completely reliant on their mother&#8217;s nightly calls for their only emotional support. It was a chaotic and unsupported existence framed by the uncertainty of knowing when it would end. The evidence shows that contact with the maternal family during that summer was practically non-existent and that OZ did not create any stability in their lives. Whatever ties the Children established in Kazakhstan were not strong and quickly subsided in September 2022 when they came back to England.</p>

It was apparent during his evidence that OZ anticipated that ML would come and live with him and the Children on a return to Kazakhstan. It was only when he later realised that it was potentially helpful to his case, that he suggested for the first time that he would agree to a divorce and finance a separate place for ML to live. I do not believe him. I consider that his intention is to get the Children, and then ML back to live with him as before as he expressed to the guardian in his interview with him and earlier in his oral evidence to me.</p>

The unusual feature of this case is that OZ is well positioned in commercial and political circles in Kazakhstan and has the power and influence at his disposal to enforce her compliance with his wishes. ML&#8217;s view is that he will use that influence either as punishment for what he perceives as her &#8216;betrayal of his trust&#8217; (his words) or as way of protecting his public reputation (about which he has shown considerable concern in these proceedings and which features expressly as a concern in the 16 August 2022 agreement) as having a dutiful wife and family. I share that concern, not least because he repeatedly threatens her in the message communications &#8216;to take this to the end.&#8217; The episode concerning the arrest and detention in custody of ML&#8217;s father demonstrates a willingness on the part of OZ to utilise state institutions as a vehicle for his campaign to get ML to comply with his vision of a good wife and mother.</p>

Save for the incident of rape in February 2022, there is no allegation of physical violence against ML or the Children. There is clear evidence of harm which the controlling and coercive behaviours have had on the Children. They are aware that their mother is under pressure to comply with their father&#8217;s demands and have lived with the experience of his controlling and surveillance behaviours through the devices. They have been subjected to his financial blackmail - when for example he has promised A an electric ride-on car toy and new clothes and shoes if he comes back to Kazakhstan and they feel the anxiety he creates if they try to express a view which would be unwelcome to him. They are fearful of displeasing him and are careful not to say things he would not like.</p>

I am concerned that the Kazakh proceedings to date have had no regard to the coercive control of the father of the mother, its impact on the Children and have expressly departed from the views of the expert psychologist in respect of the Children&#8217;s objections. The validity of the agreements has been upheld without any consideration of the domestic violence or wider allegations concerning the maternal grandfather&#8217;s arrest and detention on blackmail charges. It is notable in my view that the judgments of the courts in Astana demonstrate distaste at the mother&#8217;s application for protective measures and her temerity to speak out appears to have weighed very heavily against her with the courts there.</p>

The evidence shows a lack of genuine scrutiny of the agreements, and I consider that given OZ&#8217;s relative influence and means, it will provide wholly insufficient protection to ML as the much weaker party. There is no reasonable prospect that ML would be able to secure any agreement with OZ which protected the Children, and they would be wholly exposed to his controlling and coercive behaviour.</p>

As I said before, this was the first suggestion of any negotiation or concession by OZ and I discount it as being a stratagem to suggest to me that he would in future behave reasonably with regards to ML and the Children.

I consider this very likely to happen, because OZ&#8217;s stated objective remains to secure the return of ML to Kazakhstan to live with him. Indeed, I consider it likely that he will continue to use the Children as tools to create additional psychological pain in his efforts to force the mother to return. That is intolerable.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">ML has shared her position about staying in the UK with the Children. She came in for some criticism from Mr Lue on behalf of OZ for having done so, but I accept her evidence that she was left with little choice after OZ told the Children that if they came to Kazakhstan, their mother would follow them. ML&#8217;s evidence is supported by her account of her treatment in Kazakhstan at the hands of the paternal family and OZ himself, in particular the incident in which he destroyed the Children&#8217;s travel documents and removed hers. A and M each share the view that their mother&#8217;s settled intention is to remain in the UK, even if they must return.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I accept ML&#8217;s evidence that at times she has been left with little option but to discuss some of the wider family problems with them, especially the older Children, for example in relation to money, because OZ has withdrawn support and ML&#8217;s scholarship funding was withdrawn. She tells me, and I do not believe this to be disputed by OZ, that he has not made any payment to the maintenance of the Children, save for paying &#163;16 for A&#8217;s hair to be cut, since December 2022. The Children have needs which cost money and she has had to explain that without their father&#8217;s financial support, they will sometimes have to do without. By contrast, OZ told A when he asked him directly for money for new shoes for school, that he could have them when he came back to Kazakhstan. It is OZ in my judgement who constantly seeks to draw the Children into the dispute over their futures, with a mixture of threats of withdrawal of love and attachment, financial pressure, and frequent and unpredictable outbursts of aggression. The evidence shows that OZ deploys all these tactics directly on the Children to get them to say what he wants them to say about where they want to live.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Another example is in relation to the comment made by A to the guardian that his father told him to tell the guardian that he wanted to live in Kazakhstan. Mr Lue does not challenge that statement, but nevertheless invites me to find that it was ML was influencing the Children because A had been made aware that the Court in Astana had made a finding &#8216;which was a mistake&#8217;. That criticism seemed to me to be illogical: A obviously knew about the Astana proceedings because he had been interviewed for them. He would clearly be interested in the outcome and was frankly entitled to be told. The opinion that the decision to return him to Kazakhstan &#8216;was a mistake&#8217; was, in my judgement, his own and there is no evidence to support the suggestion that he was influenced in reaching it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am also entirely persuaded that A and M are both of an age and maturity that account should be taken of their views in relation to a possible return to Kazakhstan. I completely accept the written assessment of the guardian with respect to M which he expanded upon in his oral evidence. She is in my view well of an age and maturity to understand both the short and long-term implications of a choice about where to live and the impact that would have on her relationships with people, places, and the culture of each.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As for A, it seems to me that he is an intelligent boy, capable of rationalising based on experience. I consider that his ability to contemplate the possible risk to his mother of confiscation of her travel documents, based on what his father did in May 2022, and the fact that would influence her choice whether to travel to Kazakhstan to visit, demonstrates, contrary to what OZ submitted, that he does have clear recall of events and is able to weigh up what he does and extrapolate as to what may in future occur. This requires maturity and analysis not only in line with, but potentially beyond his chronological age. His expression of his views took account not only of his immediate concerns but included long-term ambitions to build a life and find a career in England.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am satisfied that both M and A have each raised an objection to return to Kazakhstan of which I ought to take account. A expresses his objection in clear terms and not in the form of a hope, wish or preference. I note that he is worried about the prospect of being returned against this view. M expresses a clear unwillingness to return which on the evidence as whole goes beyond a preference to stay but amounts to an objection.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The question therefore arises how much weight I should give to these objections, bearing in mind that the Convention only works if generally speaking children who have been wrongfully retained away from their country of habitual residence. I also bear in mind that comity between Convention states and deterrent effect for potential abductors are proper and real concerns to ensure the effectiveness of the Convention generally.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The objections of A and M are, for the reasons I have set out above in respect of the intolerability and harm exception, entirely consistent with their immediate and longer-term welfare needs. ML has been their primary carer for their entire lives and a move to Kazakhstan would place them outside their mother&#8217;s care and into a situation where they would be inadequately emotionally supported and at risk of further harm as the father seeks to control the actions of the mother and force her return to Kazakhstan. In circumstances where the objections are strong and an expression of the Children&#8217;s own will against a background of living in England for nearly 3 years, I do not see any risk of undermining the philosophy of the Convention in refusing a return order in these circumstances and I do not consider a refusal to return to be in anyway inconsistent with the spirit or the terms of the Convention. Nothing I have concluded in this case on its rather particular facts casts any wider shadow in respect of other cases concerning Kazakhstan or its institutions or processes. I am satisfied that a return order ought in all the wider circumstances to be refused.</p>

This finding is uncontroversial because both parties accept that this tight knit sibling group cannot be broken up and it would clearly be inconceivable to do that.</p>
