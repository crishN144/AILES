Following the hearing, both the husband and, through her solicitors, the wife attempted to submit documents via email not directed by the court and not accompanied by an application to admit further evidence.  The court has been required on a number of occasions to remind the parties that the court does not conduct proceedings by correspondence and that any application to admit further evidence should be made by way of application in accordance with the requirements of the Family Procedure Rules 2010.</p>

The wife started her career at Citibank, before joining Lehman Brothers where she remained until 2004.  The husband was a trader at Goldman Sachs before being made redundant in 1996.  He then worked at Deutsche Bank in New York before leaving Deutsche Bank to join Barclays Capital in 2004, where he remained until 2014.  Following his departure from Barclays, the husband was employed in a series of roles in the financial industry.  The husband is not employed at present but during the course of his submissions stated that he has a role with a publicly listed entity, which reimburses his expenses.  Commencing in 2014, the husband began investing in cryptocurrency, to which investments I shall return.</p>

The stated value of the investment in the Form E was $75,000.   </p>

At the FDA the court dismissed the wife&#8217;s application to instruct an expert to examine the extent of the husband&#8217;s cryptocurrency holdings, it appearing on the face of the order that the court was not satisfied at that stage that there were legitimate grounds for the wife&#8217;s suspicions regarding the nature and extent of those holdings.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A private Financial Dispute Resolution Appointment (FDR) was held on 20 July 2021, which did not result in the resolution of the financial remedy proceedings.  Ahead of the private FDR, the Topanga investment referred to above received no treatment in the husband&#8217;s Replies to Questionnaire on 24 June 2021.  However, in July 2021 and just prior to the FDR, the husband disclosed that Topanga was a vehicle for holding shares in Coinbase, a cryptocurrency platform, and that as the result of the public listing of Coinbase 7 days after the FDA held on 7 April 2021, the Topanga investment had increased in value to circa $7M, the value standing at circa $5.28M at the time of the private FDR.  The husband has continued to state that the wife was aware of the investment in Coinbase (relying on mention of Topanga in a US tax return in 2016 and further mentions in documents from 2017 to 2019), an assertion the wife denies. For present purposes, I simply record that it is clear that as a result of this incident of alleged non-disclosure, and later alleged incidents I shall come to, there is now no trust on the part of the wife that the husband has been frank in disclosing assets held as cryptocurrency and that she has continued and continues to entertain concern that there may be other deficiencies in this regard.  A significant number of the applications made by the wife following the FDR held on 20 July 2021 have concerned the Coinbase investment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A further application for an expert report on the husband&#8217;s cryptocurrency holdings was made by the wife but dismissed by the court on 19 August 2021 on the grounds that there was insufficient information on the nature, scope and cost of such an expert instruction.  On 19 August 2021, the court also dismissed an application by the wife for a LSPO, without prejudice to any further application the wife may make in the future.  The wife renewed her application for an expert report on the husband&#8217;s private equity and cryptocurrency holdings on 18 February 2022, including on whether the husband&#8217;s disclosure accurately reflected the extent of his declared holdings and dealings in such assets and the definability, certainty exclusivity, control and assignability of those assets.   HHJ Cope acceded to that application, permitting the instruction of a firm called &#8216;Another Day&#8217; to prepare a summary of all the husband&#8217;s holdings and dealings, to include mining activities, including the return on such activities, and decentralised finance activities, including staking, lending, and liquidity providing, in crypto-assets since 1 January 2019.  The wife contends that following the instruction of the expert, the husband revealed further cryptocurrency assets (in the form of electronic wallets and accounts) not previously disclosed by him.  This is disputed by the husband.  Following delays in the provision of information to the jointly instructed expert, on 31 May 2022 HHJ Cope adjourned the final hearing and directed that the expert be provided with the primary documentation with respect to the husband&#8217;s holdings, rather than the spreadsheet prepared by the husband, together with updating disclosure. On 1 August 2022 the matter was re-allocated to a judge of High Court level.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I have noted, at the FDA on 7 April 2021,  both parties gave undertakings to refrain from taking steps to diminish the balance of the funds held in all the parties&#8217; accounts with the US bank, save for the purposes of meeting mortgage payments in respect of the mortgages secured over the two Wyoming properties and meeting necessary costs referable to the maintenance, upkeep and administration of those properties.  On 15 September 2022, the US bank wrote to the parties stating that the parties&#8217; &#8220;financial condition, which was relied upon as a basis for the approval of the existing loan guarantee with the US bank, has materially deteriorated&#8221; and requested that the loan amount secured on Wyoming properties &#8220;be reduced by at least $1,720,000, to bring the balance owing to an amount no greater than $4,000,000.&#8221;  On the same day, and without reference to the wife, the husband made two transfers in the amount of $450,000 and $225,000 from the parties&#8217; US bank account to pay down the parties&#8217; mortgage with that bank.  On 14 October 2022, the husband wrote to the wife&#8217;s then solicitors to inform them that he had further reduced the mortgage liability to &#163;1.77M &#8220;through the liquidation of all the Coinbase shares and all the Crypto in Coinbase and Coinbase Pro, as well as the liquidity available in the UBS account and the ETrade account&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The matter first came before me on 17 November 2022 on the wife&#8217;s application for a freezing order.  On that date, an application by the wife for a freezing order was resolved by way of agreement between the parties.  That agreement prevented each party disposing of, dealing with or diminishing the value of (including by way of borrowing against the security of) the Wyoming properties, properties in New York and a number of US registered companies.  The order further required the parties to ensure that rental payments from the Wyoming and New York properties were paid into specified bank accounts and prohibited each party from disposing of, dealing with or diminishing the value of those accounts save to meet the mortgage payments and expenses on the properties.  On 17 November 2022, and again by consent, I further directed a report from a single joint expert on the question of the potential tax consequences of disposing of matrimonial assets to be completed by 14 February 2023. I timetabled the matter to a final hearing with a time estimate of 10 days.  The final hearing was initially timetabled to a date in the Summer term 2023.  However, due to judicial availability, it subsequently became necessary to list the final hearing as commencing on 30 October 2023.  That listing remains in place.</p>

There are at least three versions of the expert&#8217;s report in the bundle, dated 30 June 2022, 8 July 2022 and 16 September 2022, prepared as further information regarding the husband&#8217;s holdings has become available.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 17 November 2022, I made further directions with a view to bringing the jointly instructed expert report to a conclusion, directing <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span> that the jointly instructed expert reply to the husband&#8217;s questions and clarifications by 24 November 2022, that, in response to the wife&#8217;s contention that further disclosure was required, the expert indicate whether he was in a position to supply a comprehensive list of any further disclosure required to complete the report and, if so, to provide details of the further disclosure required.  On 6 December 2022, and in response to the order of the court dated 17 November 2022, the expert suggested that each cryptocurrency exchange/service be approached to provide a list of all wallets associated with the husband and the transaction history.  The expert has now produced a draft final report but indicated it would remain in draft until he had had an opportunity to speak to the parties.   On 12 December 2022 the wife confirmed that she would attend a meeting subject to some additional questions being answered by the expert and to yet further third party disclosure orders being agreed by the husband.  The husband accused the wife of seeking to interfere with the work of the single joint expert.  The proposed meeting did not take place. In foregoing context the husband, who was now acting in person, filed an application on the 13 December 2022 for an order requiring the wife to comply with the outstanding case management directions made by the court on 17 November 2022.  </p>

The Forms H provided ahead of this hearing detail a total expenditure on costs by the parties to date of some &#163;2M.   The wife has incurred by far the majority of those costs, her expenditure to date amounting to &#163;1.35M.  Part of the wife&#8217;s costs have been funded with a litigation loan from Detach in the sum of circa &#163;800,000 at an interest rate of 11.98% p.a. That loan remains to be repaid.   In addition, the wife also owes &#163;189,975 to her current solicitors, Burgess Mee, and &#163;98,000 to her former solicitors, Withers.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 5 December 2022, the wife wrote to the husband indicating the requirements that Detach Lending sought to attach to any extension of her litigation loan facility.  Namely, that the wife pledge her shares of the holding company for one of the Wyoming properties and her ownership interest in the four residential units in New York as security.  The wife is unable to comply with these conditions without being released from the undertakings given to the court on 17 November 2022.   On 6 January 2022 the wife applied to be released from her undertaking in order to secure a further extension to her litigation loan and to stay the directions made on 17 November 2022 pending the determination of that application.  On 10 February 2023 the wife wrote to the husband to seek his agreement to the reversal of the $675,000 the husband had transferred from the account at the US bank to pay down the Wyoming mortgages in September 2022 as detailed above. The wife suggested that those funds could, in their entirety, be used to meet her outstanding and ongoing legal fees. </p>

The wife stated she was also seeking orders to resume the review of the a laptop that had been the subject of examination earlier in the proceedings under the Imerman principles and an Ubuntu computer said to be used for crypto mining and trading.</p>

The wife alleges that the husband&#8217;s statement discloses further unilateral liquidations of assets, contrary to the undertakings given by the husband earlier during the proceedings.   In the statement the husband contends that whilst he thought his Xapo cryptocurrency wallet was &#8220;zeroed out&#8221;, the wallet in fact held 16.05 Bitcoin, which he &#8220;cashed&#8221; out for &#8364;420,720.  The wife contends that this is simply another example of the husband failing to disclose assets until he has dealt with them unilaterally.  The husband contends he is simply rendering liquid risky investments in the context of the highly volatile cryptocurrency market.</p>

Within this context, the wife contends that she is not able to secure legal representation unless an LSPO is made by the court.  She submits that, unless she is released from her undertakings in respect of property held in the United States, she cannot extend her litigation loan from Detach and, further, that because Detach are the first creditor in line in respect of monies recovered by the wife in the proceedings, and again because there is no onshore security, she is not able to secure a legal funding loan from any other litigation lender.   She further contends that she has no other resources from which to fund her legal fees and, relying on the principles in <span style="font-style:italic">Rubin v Rubin</span>, that she should not be required to further deplete her modest fund of savings to that end.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband resists both applications.  With respect to the application for an LSPO, he points out that HHJ Cope dismissed an application by the wife for an LSPO in August 2021.  The husband contends that given the sums spent by the wife already on litigation, amounting to some &#163;1.3M, in the context of what he submits is some thirty months of litigation, including ten directions hearings in three vacated final hearings, two cost orders against the wife and continuing non-compliance with case management orders, it would be irresponsible to channel further matrimonial assets into legal funding for the wife.  The husband points to the fact that the proceedings having been ongoing since 23 January 2021, have resulted in the expenditure of circa &#163;2M in costs and the incurring by the wife of a debt at a very high rate of interest.  The husband further submits that the expenditure of that level of costs has still failed to result in a statement of case setting out in clear terms the wife&#8217;s allegations concerning non-disclosure and hidden assets, leaving the question of the evaluation and division of the matrimonial assets in this case a relatively straightforward exercise.  In the circumstances and where, when acting for the wife, Withers estimated the costs to final hearing to be circa &#163;366,666, a further amount of &#163;536,000 sought by the wife on top of the &#163;1.3M she has already spent on legal costs cannot be justified.</p>

The husband submits that this will provide the wife with assets that she can choose to use for spending on legal costs if she chooses and that it is irresponsible of the wife to ignore what he contends are pragmatic proposals, while incurring further legal costs and interest on the debt without a logical plan for resolution.  The wife rejects this course of action as exposing her to significant transfer tax liabilities in the United States.  During his oral submissions, the husband&#8217;s opposition to an LSPO order at times appeared to become less firm, particularly were the deployment of the funds sought by the wife to result in a resumption of forward momentum in the case and if it were to be paid in instalments.</p>

The husband in particular points to the wife&#8217;s intention to occupy one of the Wyoming properties during the height of the rental season, further depleting the families investment income and the ability to fund the interim maintenance sought.  With respect to the sum sought by the wife for rent, the husband contends that the wife&#8217;s wish to move back to London can be achieved by renting a cheaper property in an similarly central location for circa &#163;4,400 per month as opposed to nearly &#163;10,000 per month. </p>

Further, the solicitor may feel constrained in taking what may be important steps in relation, for instance, to discovery, or in relation to exploring parallel non-court dispute resolution. The debt may materially influence the client&#8217;s stance on possible settlement, and the solicitor&#8217;s advice in relation to the same: a client - without independent resources - is in a vulnerable position, and may be more inclined to accept a settlement that is less than fair simply because of the concerns about litigation debt. This would not be in the interests of this, or any, child in Schedule 1 proceedings. A level playing field may not be achieved where, on the one side, the solicitor and client are &#8220;beholden&#8221; to each other by significant debt, whereas on the other there is an abundance of litigation funding. Though there is an increasingly familiar and commendable practice of lawyers acting pro bono in cases before the family courts, particularly where public funding provision previously available has been withdrawn, legal service providers, including solicitors and barristers, are not charities, nor are they credit-agents. It is neither fair nor reasonable to expect solicitors and the Bar to o&#8250;er unsecured interest-free credit in order to undertake their work; there is indeed a solid reason for lawyers not to have a financial interest in the outcome of family law litigation.&#8221;</p>

If a partner of Payne Hicks Beach had made a clear and unequivocal witness statement, to be publicly relied upon, to the effect that they would now, to quote Mostyn J.

Within this context, in <span style="font-style:italic">Collardeau-Fuchs v Fuchs</span> [2022] EWFC 6, Mostyn J recognised that whilst a claim for maintenance pending suit should be subjected to the same degree of careful scrutiny as any other interlocutory claim, and the court should &#8220;try to paint its decision with a fine sable rather than a broad brush&#8221; where it has the ability to do so, in most cases it will not have the time or the material to conduct an exhaustive investigation and therefore &#8220;the exercise will perforce be rough and ready&#8221;.

In such a situation the court should err in favour of the payee.  Where the paying party has historically been supported through the bounty of an outsider but asserts that the bounty has been curtailed but the position of the outsider is ambiguous or unclear, the court is justified in assuming that the third party will continue to supply the bounty, at least until the final hearing.</p>

Without being released from her current undertakings in respect of the properties in the United States, and in the absence of assets in this jurisdiction against which a loan could be secured, the wife is not in a position to advance security for an extension to the Detach litigation loan, or indeed for a loan from an alternative provider. For the reasons I gave at the hearing on 1 March 2023, it would not in my judgment be appropriate to release the wife from those undertakings to enable further litigation borrowing to be secured against those assets at a punitive rate of interest.  I likewise do not consider that the husband&#8217;s proposal for funding the wife&#8217;s legal costs by transfer of the New York properties is one the court could endorse absent independent evidence of the tax consequences of that step being taken.  I am satisfied that the wife is not able to obtain legal services by granting a charge over the assets that she might recover in the proceedings.  I do not consider it would be reasonable to expect the wife to now exhaust the modest amounts remaining in her bank accounts and investments to fund her legal costs.</p>

However, on the unagreed Asset Schedule prepared by the husband, it is clear on his own case that the husband has financial resources, in sufficiently liquid form, to fund an LSPO in favour of the wife, the balance of his bank accounts being &#163;719,743, with savings and investments of &#163;514,443.  The liquid assets in this case are, in the vast majority, currently in the husband&#8217;s name.  Within this context, and cognisant as I am that the husband will be required also to fund an order for MPS I intend to grant, I am satisfied that the LSPO I intend to make will not cause undue hardship to the husband or prevent him from himself obtaining legal services for the purposes of the proceedings should he choose to do so moving forward.  Pursuant to s.22ZA(9), for the purposes of the assessment of costs in the proceedings, the wife&#8217;s costs will be reduced by the amount paid to her by the husband under the LSPO.</p>

These are complex matrimonial proceedings, made more complex by the issues centring on the matrimonial assets that have been held in cryptocurrency.  In the circumstances, it is reasonable for the wife to look to instruct specialist matrimonial solicitors with expertise comparative to those engaged historically by the husband.  However, the court cannot but be concerned by the fact that the wife has to date already incurred some &#163;1.3M in legal costs, including a substantial debt at a punitive rate of interest, as compared to the circa &#163;600,000 costs incurred by the husband.  Whilst this is not the occasion to make findings in relation to the wife&#8217;s litigation conduct, and I make clear I do not do so, it would appear that a significant part of those costs have been incurred in the wife&#8217;s desire to prove her contention that the husband is hiding assets, including holdings in cryptocurrency.  Notwithstanding this, and whilst some of the husbands actions will have fed into the wife&#8217;s concerns, the wife has to date failed to itemise with particularity any deficiencies in disclosure, even though directed to do so by the court.</p>

Against this, the wife would not reasonably be able to obtain appropriate legal services without funding and, as recognised by the husband, there is an urgent need to get these proceedings back on track, which I am satisfied will be assisted by the wife having specialist legal representation.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the court&#8217;s concerns regarding the wife&#8217;s expenditure on legal costs to date are best dealt with by carefully proscribing the manner in which the funds made available under the LSPO are to be deployed and by staging those payments.  As I have noted above, where a litigant can demonstrate that without an LSPO they would not reasonablely be able to obtain appropriate legal services, but in the view of the court that litigant has, prior to the application for an LSPO, spent profligately on legal services to little effect, the power of the court to control the deployment of amounts awarded under an LSPO will be of particular importance.</p>

As I have noted, after some 30 months of litigation the wife has not provided a schedule of alleged non-disclosure of assets notwithstanding the extensive costs expended by her.  In such circumstances, I am satisfied that it would not be appropriate to authorise any further costs to be expended on that question, save those required to facilitate the meetings required to finalise the current joint expert report, to take legal advice in respect of the conclusions of that report (as already provided for in the estimate of costs) and to give instruction on it. </p>

By the time of the PTR the vast majority of the work required to ready the matter for final hearing will have been completed.  In such circumstances, it is not reasonable to provide for a figure for the work to between PTR and final hearing that is almost equivalent to that applying to the work ahead of the PTR.  Further, elements of the cost estimate are plainly unsustainable.  By way of example, the total given for the preparation of the bundle is &#163;4,230, notwithstanding that the task at that point will be simply to update the existing bundle.  I consider a more realistic figure for solicitors costs to be &#163;65,000 excluding VAT plus counsel&#8217;s fees, bringing the figure between PTR and final hearing down to &#163;151,000 excluding VAT.</p>

I accept, of course, that the existence of outstanding debt to a solicitor informs the question of whether the party would reasonably be able to obtain appropriate legal services for the purposes of s.22ZA(3).  In such circumstances, and absent a loan or a charge over assets to be recovered, the applicant indebted to their solicitor and without funds may not be able to obtain further legal services where their solicitor refuses to act without the debt being paid.  However, whilst that may well be the entirely understandable position of the solicitor in the absence of an LSPO, it is difficult to see why it should <span style="font-style:italic">inevitably</span> be the position of the solicitor <span style="font-style:italic">after</span> an LSPO has been granted.

However, in the circumstances set out above, and where the reality is that some firms are willing to carry credit and some firms are not, and thus that some firms will &#8220;down tools&#8221; and some will be willing to carry on, I consider that the approach of Holman J, to require specific sworn evidence of an intention by the solicitor in the particular case to refuse to act unless the historic costs are paid notwithstanding the grant of an LSPO, is to be preferred to reliance on a general principle that firms and members of the bar should not carry credit in circumstances where they are not charities or credit agents.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within the foregoing context, I am not satisfied that it would be appropriate for the LSPO to encompass the historic costs owed by the wife to her former solicitors, Withers.  In his Skeleton Argument, Mr Ewins concedes that the inclusion in an LSPO of costs owed to a former solicitor would be unusual.  I would go further, and hold that the inclusion of such historic costs in an LSPO would be unprecedented.  None of the authorities cited above has approved such a course and in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Z (A Child)(Schedule 1: Legal Costs Funding Order; Interim Financial Provision)</span> Cobb J expressly declined to do so (I also noted that in <span style="font-style:italic">R v R</span> [2021] EWHC 195 (Fam) the submission that the LSPO should encompass costs owed to a former solicitor was withdrawn).  There is obviously no risk in this case that Withers will refuse to act for the wife if the costs owed to them are not included in the LSPO as they are no longer on the record.  Whilst the wife seeks to rely on the terms of the undertaking given by Burgess Mee to Withers in the terms set out above to demonstrate that the former will not act for her unless all historic costs are paid, it is difficult to see the terms of that undertaking as anything other than a rather transparent artifice to try to bring the wife&#8217;s former solicitors within the circumstances that are understood by matrimonial lawyers to justify the inclusion of historic costs in an LSPO.  In any event, if the court has power under s.22ZA to make an order that includes payment of historic costs owed by the applicant to their solicitors (and I assume for the purposes of this case that it does) then for the reasons I have given it is a power that falls be exercised sparingly and only on proper evidence.  Within this context, there is no sworn statement of evidence before the court deposing to the fact that, notwithstanding the making of an LSPO, Burgess Mee will refuse to act for the wife unless that LSPO encompasses the costs owed to Withers, nor indeed a statement from Withers indicating it will sue Burgess Mee for breach of the undertaking if Burgess Mee acts for the wife by way of funds secured through an LSPO without having recovered the costs owed by the wife to Withers.

However,  I am also not prepared to encompass the historic costs owed to Burgess Mee within he LSPO.   Once again, any power that exists to make an LSPO that encompasses historic costs falls to be exercised sparingly and on proper evidence.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In circumstances where the family previously lived in London, and where one daughter will now commence tertiary education in the United States and the other will commence boarding, it is not in my judgment unreasonable for the wife to seek to return to London, where the parties resided for a considerable period during the marriage.  Pending the determination of proceedings, the husband must make reasonable provision for the wife&#8217;s rent, absent which provision I am satisfied she would not be able to secure reasonable accommodation.  However, I am not satisfied that it is reasonable to thereby <span style="font-style:italic">double</span> her expenditure on rent from &#163;66,000 per annum to &#163;119,340 per annum.  The particulars provided by the husband demonstrate that it is possible for the wife to obtain a rented property in central London for a rent that does not require the budget to be doubled.  In my assessment, in light of the wife&#8217;s reasonable wish to move back to London, and in the context of the limited information before the court, I consider that a reasonable budget for rent to be &#163;7,000 per month, amounting to annual rent of &#163;84,000. With respect to the deposit, removal and storage costs, it is reasonable in my judgment for the deposit and <span style="font-style:italic">reasonable</span> costs of removal and storage be paid by the husband in the circumstances I have set out, to enable the wife to move to the new property.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">With respect to the wife&#8217;s MPS budget in addition to rental costs, I also consider that it contains a number of very obvious examples of forensic exaggeration.  That this is so is demonstrated by the fact that notwithstanding the draft order for MPS provided with the wife&#8217;s application for the hearing on 17 November 2022 provided for MPS excluding rent in the sum of &#163;104,000 per annum, the wife now seeks, some seven months later, an annual sum of &#163;251,364, excluding rent and the cost of the children&#8217;s summer academic programmes and M&#8217;s university fees.  In particular, the following matters appear to me to constitute incidences of forensic exaggeration, duplication or expenditure which cannot withstand critical examination:</p>

The medical expenses figure of &#163;750 per annum in Schedule 7 appears to be a duplication.

In the circumstances, I am not prepared to ascribe the figure of &#163;34,064 claimed for healthcare above and beyond the health insurance policy and will substitute a figure of &#163;6,000.  The position with respect to the health insurance policy, costing &#163;18,000 per annum, is dealt with in more detail below.</p>

I consider that it is reasonable for the husband to fund the health insurance policy that provides health cover for the wife and the children.  Whilst the parties dispute the extent to which the children have specified health needs, it is reasonable for health insurance to be in place.  I likewise consider however, that in circumstances where the husband shares parental responsibility for the children, that he should be named on the policy.</p>

The figure excludes the separate costs of the children&#8217;s education, which the husband is committed to meeting.  This amounts to total maintenance pending suit of &#163;18,762 per month.

However, whilst the husband asserts before this court that he does not have high earning employment at present, during the course of proceedings he intimated he is undertaking work for a publicly listed entity.  More significantly, on his own Schedule of Assets the husband also has very significant liquidity.  For the purposes of the wife&#8217;s application for maintenance pending suit, I am satisfied that the husband can afford to pay the figure for maintenance that I have arrived at whilst also funding the LSPO that I have made in the total sum of &#163;372,654 excluding VAT in circumstances where that sum is to be paid in monthly instalments and subject to review at the PTR.</p>

Despite this, the parties are no closer to reaching an agreement on the issues between them and, at the same time, have failed to advance the proceedings to final hearing in the manner directed by the court. Unless the parties now concentrate on, preferably, negotiating a settlement of these proceedings or, in any event, preparing this matter for trial, they risk the further dilapidation of the assets they have carefully assembled during the course of this long marriage, to the ultimate detriment of both themselves and, most importantly, to the detriment of their children.</p>
