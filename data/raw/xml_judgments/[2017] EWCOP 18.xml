In this case MSA is subject to a particularly high degree of restrictions on his physical liberty.  There is no independent scrutiny and monitoring of the use of restraint and restrictive measures, for example by the CQC as it would be in a regulated setting or where external carers were involved.  For this reason it is particularly important that an independent view is taken as to whether or not the restrictions in the care plan remain the least restrictive option and thus as to the degree of scrutiny required by the court at annual reviews.  It is therefore submitted that it is in MSA&#8217;s interests and required to protect his Article 5 rights that he be represented independently in these proceedings.  </span></p>

This will involve you weighing the pros and cons of that package of care and support, comparing it with other available options and (if appropriate) proposing changes to the applicant authority.  For example, if you consider that some of the restrictions it puts in place are unnecessary or inappropriate and should be changed, you should raise this with the applicant authority and, if they do not agree with what you propose, the court&#8221;.</span></p>

Hands-on involvement (in this particular case by JA) does not render her unable to fulfil the role and if anything, potentially enhances the quality of the information provided to the court.  </span></p>

Their role may have continued over the life of P, or may have started when P became less capable of looking after his or her affairs and continued after P lost relevant capacity.  In my view, the fact such persons have performed that role, and in doing so have formed firm views, as to where P&#8217;s best interests lie, and to voice those views, does not mean that they cannot meet the criteria in Rule 140(1) or that they are disqualified from acting as P&#8217;s litigation friend&#8221;.</span></p>

Indeed, in performing their supporting and caring role over the years many such family and friends will have been doing just that by, for example, investigating, negotiating, obtaining and reviewing care and support from public authorities to promote P&#8217;s best interests at home and in the community.  The performance of that role will often mean that they have fought P&#8217;s corner over a long time to promote his or her best interests and that they are, and will be the best or an appropriate litigation friend because they know P best and will be best placed to ensure the promotion of P&#8217;s best interests ... </span></p>
