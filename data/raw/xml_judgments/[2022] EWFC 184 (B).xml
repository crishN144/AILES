The ordinary process of reasoning will draw the judge to consider a number of other matters, such as the consistency of the account with known facts, with previous accounts given by the witness, with other evidence, and with the overall probabilities. However, in a case where the facts are not likely to be primarily found in contemporaneous documents the assessment of credibility can quite properly include the impression made upon the court by the witness, with due allowance being made for the pressures that may arise from the process of giving evidence. Indeed, in family cases, where the question is not only 'what happened in the past?' but also 'what may happen in the future?', a witness's demeanour may offer important information to the court about what sort of a person the witness truly is, and consequently whether an account of past events or future intentions is likely to be reliable.</span></p>

However, the correct legal approach is to survey the evidence as a whole as it relates to each individual in order to arrive at a conclusion about whether the allegation has been made out in relation to one or other on a balance of probability. Evidentially, this will involve considering the individuals separately and together, and no doubt comparing the probabilities in respect of each of them. However, in the end the court must still ask itself the right question, which is not "who is the more likely?" but "does the evidence establish that this individual probably caused this injury?" In a case where there are more than two possible perpetrators, there are clear dangers in identifying an individual simply because they are the likeliest candidate, as this could lead to an identification on evidence that fell short of a probability. Although the danger does not arise in this form where there are only two possible perpetrators, the correct question is the same, if only to avoid the risk of an incorrect identification being made by a linear process of exclusion. </span></p>

That substantive report was supplemented by two addendums; dated 07.06.2022 and 25.08.2022. Without setting out the minutiae of his written evidence, the following is taken from his executive summary:</span></p>

I have discussed the nature of this bruising below. It is my opinion that the bruising to the left and right ears is likely to have been caused by a pinch to each ear. It is my opinion that it is unlikely that a child of P&#8217;s age could have caused this type of bruising by pinching her own ears. It is also my opinion that the bruising to the buttocks is likely to have been caused by pressure applied with the fingers or the thumb although it may be difficult to exclude the possibility that a fall onto hard object may have also cause this bruising.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">I have been impressed with Dr Morrell&#8217;s reporting. His reports are concise, clear and ultimately very helpful. His substantive report produces photographs upon which he places reliance when formulating his opinion, so as to assist the reader in understanding his rationale. Whilst providing the information required to assist the Court in its ultimate determination, his substantive report also stands at 23 pages; well within the 40-page limit set out PD27A para 5.2A.1 and even within the 25 pages suggested by the President in his &#8220;Make every hearing count&#8221; Guidance, dated 09.03.2022. It is my view that if all expert reports were produced in a similar fashion, not only would there be a saving to the public purse, but the judicial task of understanding the medical evidence and ultimately weighing it as part of the wide canvass of evidence, would be made easier.</span></p>

However, my impression was that this was not evasiveness or an unrealistic view of parenthood, but rather a desire to protect and defend P from any criticism. Mr Trory was at pains in his questioning to make it clear that he was not criticising P in any way, but I find the M&#8217;s defensiveness to be a natural response in difficult circumstances.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">I pause to consider some areas that were lacking in clarity from the M. One significant issue is the discussion that took place between the M and the MGM in the car on 01.03.2022, having dropped P off at nursery. I was surprised by the M&#8217;s evidence that, having been told by MGM that she had forgotten to tell nursery about the bruising to the ears, that she did not ask anything further. On the M&#8217;s account, there was simply no further conversation about the bruising. My surprise arises from the fact that the M tells me that she was not aware of the bruising until raised by MGM. For a M who seems to be interested in any issues arising in respect of her children, and I mean no criticism in that observation, I find it difficult to understand why she would not have enquired further. The M tells me that she didn&#8217;t ask any further questions because she had not been surprised; it is a feature of his case that there is a lot of evidence about P&#8217;s tendency to pull, push, fold and play with her ears. But this was the first time that bruising to ears had ever been raised. Even in November 2021, when P was taken to an audiology appointment with marks to her ears, the M accepted that the marks were not bruises. The local authority has not challenged the family&#8217;s account that P has been seen previously with marks to her ears.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">There have been moments in this case where language has had to be clarified. In particular, the use of the word &#8220;bruise&#8221; has sometimes been used to describe a &#8220;mark&#8221;, which, when clarified has meant reddening. There is an important distinction to be made. As Dr Morrell made clear in his evidence, a bruise is caused by pressure being applied sufficient to cause the bursting of blood vessels. I have not formed the view that the interchanging of the words &#8220;mark&#8221; and &#8220;bruising&#8221; has been done purposefully or with the intention to deceive. They are words which have been used by the family over time so that their descriptive accuracy has been eroded.</span></p>

If she had, I believe that the M would have enquired further, as it would mean an escalation in self-injury to that which she, as a protective M, was used to.  Instead, I have concluded that the confusion around terminology, evident in the oral evidence of both the M and MGM, has resulted in the MGM telling the M that she should have told nursery about &#8220;marks&#8221; to P&#8217;s ears. In the MGM&#8217;s mind she was talking about the bruises she says she saw. In the M&#8217;s mind, she is aware that P has sustained marks to her ears before as a result of self-harm. On that basis she did not feel the need to ask any further questions.</span></p>

It seemed to me that it was likely that issue would be taken with the contents of that phone call on 01.03.2022 and that, in any event, I might be assisted by evidence in respect of any propensity for P to push, pull, fold or play with her ears. I was told that no evidence had been obtained from the nursery and that the 01.03.2022 was actually P&#8217;s second day, meaning there was a limitation on any observations of P&#8217;s usual behaviour by the nursery.</span></p>

He told me that he could not think of any incident or unusual presentation during that time that might account for the bruising to P. During that time he was caring for all 3 siblings. He was questioned about his ability to care for P, given her potential for difficult presentation. He told me that it did not cause him any difficulty at all. He said that he had cared for all 3 children by himself previously, with no issue. He accepted that P can be difficult to deal with at times. He recognised the description of P&#8217;s behaviours set out in the letters attached to the M&#8217;s statement but added that such presentation was rare. In terms of her usual everyday presentation, he described her wriggling around when changing nappies and being full of energy. He said:</span></p>

He was clear that it had been a bruise and not a &#8220;mark&#8221;. He told me that it had happened in November/December 2021. That evidence caused me some concern. Given his intervenor status at the time of Dr Morrell&#8217;s substantive report, which questions whether P would have the strength to cause bruising to herself, I was surprised that the first time he had raised this incident was from the witness box. There is no mention of that incident within the papers, including his own witness statement and police interview. He told me that he had read Dr Morrell&#8217;s report as relating to P&#8217;s ability to bruise herself, rather than someone else. Given the clear issue in this case, I remained concerned as to why that incident had not been raised before. I deal with my analysis of that part of his evidence below.</span></p>

Despite undressing P for her bath, bathing her naked, drying her off after the bath and getting her ready for bed (involving putting a nappy on her), he told me that he had not seen any bruising. He told me that he had not been looking for any bruising and he must simply not have noticed it. He confirmed to me that the first time that he became aware of bruising to P&#8217;s buttock/thigh was when he was shown it by MGM at bath time on 26.02.22. That explanation sits uncomfortably with the extent of the bruising I have seen within the Court bundle and the MGM&#8217;s evidence that the bruising was there since 24.02.22.</span></p>

I am also reminded that Dr Morrell&#8217;s view was that the most likely explanation for the bruising to the buttock/thigh was as a result of a hard object, such as fingers, squeezing the buttock. Dr Morrell thought a fall onto a toy/s, including the &#8220;bead toy&#8221;, was an unlikely mechanism to have caused the bruising seen.</span></p>

I have no doubt that Dr Morrell has attempted, from a medical perspective, to assist me as best he can. He is clear, from a medical perspective, that the bruising to the buttocks/thigh and the bruising to the ears, is more likely to be inflicted. His concern in respect of the buttocks/thigh bruising is primarily the force that would need to be generated to cause the bruising and the mechanism required to cause the individual bruising. He does not discount the suggestion that it could have been caused by a fall on to a toy/s, but he finds it unlikely. His concern in respect of the bruising to the ears is primarily based on P&#8217;s ability to create the necessary force with her fingers to cause the bruising. Again, he does not rule out the possibility that she might have caused the bruising herself or that she may have caused it by banging her head in the way observed by Dr T during the child protection medical. But again, he finds that explanation unlikely.</span></p>

I have heard no evidence of a particularly stressful event that occurred over the relevant timeframe. I have heard no evidence which would lead me to the view that P&#8217;s behaviours were any more challenging than normal. In addition, whilst it is clear that P has the potential to display some very challenging behaviour, evidenced within the letters attached to the M&#8217;s statement and from Dr T&#8217;s observations, all of the evidence points towards that behaviour being situation specific. All of the family members generally describe managing P on a daily basis to require an element of extra vigilance. However, P being exposed to a loud, bright busy party or the confinements of a medical examination room with several individuals present, is clearly different to being at home or at the MGP&#8217;s house with which she is extremely familiar.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="color:#000000">I have given considerable thought to the evidence that MGM did not mention the bruising to P&#8217;s ears, either to the M or the nursery. I accept her evidence, corroborated by the M, that there was an incident involving L that may have distracted her from informing the nursery. What is more surprising, is why she did not tell the M about the bruising to the ears at the same time as she told her about the bruising to the buttocks/thigh. At first blush it seems odd that she did not. Given she was trained in safeguarding, the bruising to the ears should have ordinarily raised alarm bells. But as Ms Wordsworth submits, the exercise should not end there. I must stand back and consider her reaction in the context of what she knows about P. All of the family members have described P as having an underlying preoccupation, for whatever reason, with her ears. I have been told about marks that have been caused previously by P either by pulling, pushing, folding her ears or by impact with a bed board. The concerns around P&#8217;s ability to injure herself are real and have resulted in family members taking action, such as padding the bed, to stop an accidental injury.</span></p>

Where there was a less obvious cause to the bruising to the buttocks/thigh, which required explanation, explanation was given on 01.03.2022. Where there was a known history of P manipulating her ears so as to cause marks, the need to give an explanation was lessened.</span></p>

I do not understand how, considering his knowledge of the contents of Dr Morrell&#8217;s report, he did not think it relevant to inform anyone that P had bruised him previously. He had not raised that incident in his written evidence, nor had he raised it in his police interview. I do not accept the suggestion made by Ms Shames that he did not think it was relevant because it is bruising to a different part of the body. P&#8217;s ability to produce enough force generally to cause bruising was clearly an issue within the medical evidence.</span></p>

In general terms I have considered MSGF to be an honest and open witness, attempting to assist me in determining the cause of P&#8217;s bruising. However, on this point I have formed the view that MSGF was embellishing an incident that probably did occur in December 2021. I accept MSGF&#8217;s evidence that P did pinch him in December 2021, but in light of the issues of which he was aware, and his silence on the incident until evidence from the witness box, I do not accept on balance that it caused a bruise. I then have to consider how that embellishment affects both his credibility and my overall analysis of how the bruising was caused.</span></p>

Having heard from MSGF on this issue, I have formed the view that he has embellished the incident, not because of a desire to mislead the Court as to how the bruising to P had been caused or misdirect attention away from any wrongdoing on his part, but rather to bolster his genuinely held belief that P has caused the bruising herself.</span></p>

As a result, I have taken a closer look at his account of not observing the bruising to P whilst bathing her on 25.02.2022, given it was identified by MGM on 24.02.2022. However, if I accept the MGM&#8217;s account of seeing the bruising, as I do, then it simply makes it more likely that MSGF simply did not notice it on 25.02.2022.</span></p>

Whilst no criticism is made as to the LA&#8217;s exploration of that decision, having heard the family&#8217;s responses to that decision making, I have formed the view that it had nothing to do with any underlying concern as to the father&#8217;s ability to properly care for the children during that time. Instead, I find on balance that it was a decision made to try and reduce the impact upon the children of the M&#8217;s hospitalisation. Far from being suspicious, it was a child centred and focussed decision made by the adults surrounding the children.</span></p>

I accept her evidence that she had not seen any bruising or other marks prior to that fall. I accept her evidence that she then saw the bruising for the first time whilst bathing P that night. I find that the bruising to the buttocks/thigh was probably caused by P falling accidentally onto a hard object/objects on 24.02.2022. In order for the bruising to have been caused, it is likely that P&#8217;s nappy had ridden up in the way the MGM had previously observed. I am unable to say whether it was one fall causing all of the bruising or multiple falls causing some of the bruising.</span></p>
