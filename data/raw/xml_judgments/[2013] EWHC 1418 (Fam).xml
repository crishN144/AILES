On 4 March 2009, CD posted another message to a different correspondent; in that message, she gave reasons for why the couple had waited for the third round of treatment &#8211; because work had been busy, because she wanted to have the right positive mental attitude, and finally to take advantage of the new law.  She told me that this third point was only added as an afterthought as a mark of solidarity for the same-sex contributors to the blog (&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">a supportive gesture to the lesbian group</span>&#8221;).  </p>

I am satisfied that the failed treatments in November 2008 and January 2009 had taken a significant emotional toll on CD (she told me that she had been &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">devastated</span>&#8221; when the first round of treatment failed, and yet more so after the failed second round), and that this was the predominant reason why the couple delayed the third round of treatment so that she could develop that more &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">positive mental attitude</span>&#8221; to the treatment. CD told me that she had become &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">obsessive</span>&#8221; about the third round being successful &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">it was all I thought and talked about</span>&#8221; and told me that she was concentrating on &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">getting my health and attitude tip-top</span>&#8221; for that purpose.

She was, however, clear that she had not seen the forms before that date.  AB told me that the couple returned to the clinic with the forms on the following day, and that she signed the form at the clinic but could not remember specifically where she was when she did so, or at what stage of the events on that day.

This would have been to ignore the requirement for the forms to be completed before treatment.  Further, the requirements were clear for the forms to be offered, and the counselling/information provided, on a day before the treatment not on the treatment day itself. The specialist nurse would surely have realised the confusion to the legal status that this would produce. </p>
