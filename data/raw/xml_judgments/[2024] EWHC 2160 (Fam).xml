His mother is BJ, a British national born in the Philippines who moved to the UK in 2009.  N is a dual British and American national.

In July 2023 they went there on a short holiday.  Although the mother had reservations about a full-scale move, she ultimately agreed to go, and the family surrendered their London tenancy, which they vacated on 27 September 2023.  They then lived in hotels and Air B&amp;Bs pending their departure.  In October 2023 there was a series of arguments between the parents, including some in which the mother threatened to abduct N to the Philippines.  The police were involved.  There were further arguments in December 2023, including one at the airport which resulted in the mother and N not boarding their originally intended flight to Dubai on 09 December 2023.  </span></p>

The parties spent Christmas together, then the mother took N to visit her family in Manila for two weeks in January 2024.  The family then returned to London for a week on 27 January 2024 so that the father could complete some business and the mother attend S&#8217; birthday party.  On 05 February 2024 they returned to Dubai.  On 15 February 2024 the mother arranged for all her UK mail to be forwarded to Dubai.  On 20 February 2024 the mother liaised with an agency to confirm her UAE visa requirements.  Her and N&#8217;s initial visitors&#8217; visas were successfully extended until 05 April 2024.</span></p>

Amongst the mother&#8217;s allegations is an assertion that on 17 March 2024 the father assaulted her, causing her to drop N.  The father exhibits numerous photographs of injuries to his face and body caused by the mother&#8217;s alleged assaults.  I have, at the mother&#8217;s counsel&#8217;s request, listened to 4 audio or video extracts covertly recorded by her, selected from a USB stick containing a far greater number of recordings.  The father had not considered it necessary for the court to listen to any of this material but in response suggested two of his own.  I concur with Ms Baker that these show highly disturbing domestic incidents between the parties with extreme verbal aggression and some degree of physical altercation.  The relationship was highly dysfunctional and both parties have exposed their son to an appalling level of conflict.  Care must be taken when viewing covert recordings. One can tell from some of these that the parent undertaking the recording is conducting themselves in full knowledge that their contribution is being recorded, and tailoring their speech accordingly, whereas the other parent is unaware.</span></p>

She agreed that the engagement of a nanny to facilitate contact handover would reduce the risks, and that a parenting app would ensure communication was kept at an appropriate and child-focused level.

She accepted that there were no practical or legal bars to the mother being able to remain in the UAE, certainly until the courts there made long-term welfare decisions. N&#8217;s very early years were important to his overall development.  His father had an important part to play, yet N was missing out on his parenting input.  Contact had only been very limited since his return to England.  If N remained living in England, the likelihood of restoring his relationship with his father would reduce, yet it was in his interests for them to have a direct relationship.

The father accepts that N was exposed to a reprehensible level of domestic conflict, for which he takes his share of responsibility, and the mother has not sought to advocate that she is blameless.  As I state later in this judgment, I agree with Ms Baker that the parties&#8217; separation will substantially reduce the risk to N of further emotional harm from exposure to the relationship.  I am also able to evaluate whether the protective measures proposed by the father, and the available legal remedies in the UAE, are sufficient to guard against that risk.  These factors combine to mean that, having considered PD12J FPR 2010, I do not think that a fact-finding hearing is necessary in order to determine this case fairly.  Neither party urges one upon me.  The court will however make findings about habitual residence, amongst other matters, and has the material to do so;</span></p>

They had been living in London since the start of their relationship in December 2019.  N spent the first year of his life there and was plainly habitually resident in England over that period.  The strength of his connection to England was however somewhat diluted by (a) the parties&#8217; joint discussions about a permanent move to Dubai and (b) the mother&#8217;s frequent references to taking him to the Philippines.  Ultimately the question is whether his habitual residence in England changed at the point of relocation to Dubai.  On the evidence before me, the parties both intended their move there in December 2023 to be permanent.  In her statement the mother accepts that &#8220;The plan and the agreement was that me and the applicant relocate in UAE and start a new life leaving the past behind and start over (i.e forget about what all the domestic abuse happened in the UK, get a better quality life, cheaper rent, less tax, to be able to afford a nanny, we discussed on many occasions a deal which was if any fighting won&#8217;t happen in a span of 3-6 months we will get married as we both agreed&#8221;.</span></p>

They had brought substantial amounts of luggage.  They had surrendered their English tenancy in September 2023 and had since been living in hotel and Air B&amp;B accommodation.  The mother arranged for all her mail to be redirected and she liaised with an agency in the UAE about her visa arrangements.  Although she and N remained on visitors&#8217; visas up to the point of his abduction, I do not find that this undermined their essential integration, because I accept that the father was in the process of obtaining more permanent residence visas through his employment. For his part the father was undertaking full-time employment in Dubai.  They both investigated a nursery place for N.  Their short return trip to London on 27 January 2024 did nothing to disrupt their intentions or the practical plans they had made for stable, long-term residence in Dubai.</span></p>

Dependent as he was on his parents, N&#8217;s practical ties with England had also been cut at the point of departure, save that S remained there, and thereafter N acquired, I find, a certain stability in his living arrangements in Dubai and in the care he received from both his parents, the two most central people in his life. </span></p>

This however had been a permanent feature of the parents&#8217; relationship and was not peculiar to Dubai, albeit the relationship finally ended there.  If their abusive relationship destabilised their son, it did so in England as much as it did in Dubai.  In any event, as I have found above, at their point of arrival in Dubai in December 2023 they both acquired a new habitual residence there.  Their arguments and fights, in Dubai, did not serve to re-establish habitual residence in England. </span></p>

Aside, however, from the parties&#8217; decision to relocate to Dubai, I consider that the mother is unlikely to remain in the UK in the long term.  Her original plan upon arrival here in April 2024 was to relocate immediately and without the father&#8217;s permission, to the Philippines.  In her statement she maintains that she has no choice but to relocate there.  The recital to Moor J.&#8217;s May 2023 order records that she was &#8220;unclear about her ultimate intentions of where she wishes to reside&#8221;.  Although, in resisting the father&#8217;s application for summary return, she effectively proposes that the English court is the forum in which N&#8217;s child arrangements should be litigated, she does not assert any intention to stay here with him in the long-term.

This, alongside the likely temporary nature of her residence in England, militates against her assertion that a refusal of the summary return application offers N the greatest chance of stability.  This is not a case in which the mother argues that England is his &#8216;home country&#8217; where his long-term future lies.  In fact, unlike the father&#8217;s settled intention to remain long-term in Dubai, the mother&#8217;s plans are inchoate.</span></p>

This is an important part of the analysis of his emotional needs under the welfare checklist.  The father works full-time in Dubai and cannot move to the UK in the interim.  The mother is not, in the same way, tied to the UK.  There are therefore obvious welfare advantages to N if I were to order his return to the UAE where he could, subject to any orders made by the courts there, spend time with both parents.  </span></p>

For a child of N&#8217;s age this is woefully inadequate.  He is developing very fast and reaching new milestones with each passing month.  At present he is doing this with virtually no input or influence from his father.  I have no confidence that the mother will co-operate with a more generous contact regime if N remains in the UK and the father in Dubai.  Her stance in relation to contact reflects the strong views she expressed about the father&#8217;s parenting rights at the point of the removal &#8211; see for example her message on 26 April 2024 stating &#8220;you have no rights whatsoever to withheld me or [N]&#8221; and &#8220;[N] will be never ever go in your hand that we will make sure&#8230;we will make sure you are just a stranger&#8230;you don&#8217;t deserve the boys in any shape or form&#8221;.

I am not, of course, making any long term welfare decisions and another court will in due course decide where N will live, unless the parents can agree.  I am satisfied that both parties will be able to put their cases before a tribunal there, as they would here in the UK.  The UAE Civil Personal Status Code 2022 establishes that joint custody is the starting point in custody cases, with an emphasis on equal rights and responsibilities.  This dispels any notion that the mother might encounter a patriarchal litigation disadvantage in the UAE courts.

All parental communications could be managed through a parenting app.  I agree with Ms Baker that these measures would significantly reduce the risks to N.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I also accept, in any event, that the UAE has a well-developed domestic violence jurisdiction and that either parent would have access to the courts there to seek further protective measures, as they would in England &#8211; see for example Federal Law No. 3 of 1987 which establishes the legal basis for a restraining order.  There are several organisations, such as the Dubai Foundation for Women and Children, that provide protection, shelter, counselling, advice and legal support to the victims of domestic abuse.  I do not therefore consider that N&#8217;s return to the UAE would expose him to the levels of parental dispute and aggression apparent pre-separation.</span></p>

Aside from their serious failures in exposing him to their mutual domestic abuse, I see no reason why both parents could not meet in principle his physical, emotional and educational needs during the period between now and a substantive welfare decision.  He would be housed, fed, nurtured and emotionally stimulated in either country.  Nothing I say in this judgment is intended to supersede the welfare evaluation of any future court as to the parties&#8217; abilities to meet N&#8217;s long-term needs.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Having evaluated each of the factors above, with a particular focus on the welfare checklist, I conclude that N&#8217;s welfare, my paramount concern, requires a summary return to UAE.  He should be returned within 14 days or at such other time as the parties may agree in writing.  The protective measures proposed by the father should be set out clearly in the body of an order, which I now invite counsel to agree and draft.  The UAE courts will, in the absence of agreement, make substantive decisions about N&#8217;s long-term welfare, the arrangements for his care and the country in which he spends his childhood.  I grant permission for the case papers to be disclosed to any UAE child safeguarding agency and to the UAE courts and direct that a copy of this judgment and today&#8217;s order be translated into Arabic at the parties&#8217; joint expense.</span></p>
