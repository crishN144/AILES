The first to be determined (in the Court of Protection) relates to a best interests decision in respect of D, who lacks capacity in a wide sphere of decision-taking in consequence of a severe acquired brain injury. The injury which occurred in 2006, resulted in significant physical and cognitive impairment. The second application (in the Family Court), which as will become clear below, is contingent upon the decision in the first, is an application for a decree nisi of divorce. </span></p>

There is very little in the papers, either in the family proceedings or the Court of Protection statements, which concerns their family life. They have two children, now young adults, P, born in June 2001 and T, born in November 2005. By contrast, there is a great deal concerning the family&#8217;s financial affairs. D and S became shareholders in a pharmacy company along with D&#8217;s brother. By June 2006, I am satisfied that there were considerable strains, both within the business and in the marriage. D, whom I am satisfied was living separate and apart from his wife at the time, took an overdose which resulted in the very significant brain injury, which I have referred to above. In October 2007, S petitioned for Divorce on the grounds of adultery. It is important that I record that I have seen no coherent evidence in support of this alleged ground. In 2008 the Court of Protection appointed Mr Niall Baker, a solicitor, as D&#8217;s Deputy for property and affairs.</span></p>

That security for costs was not provided. Accordingly, the invitation was declined. </span></p>

Notwithstanding her earlier Petition, S responded by contesting that the marriage had irretrievably broken down and challenging D&#8217;s capacity to pursue the divorce. Having heard S give evidence, I am satisfied that her change of position was entirely motivated to secure what she perceived to be her best financial advantage and that of her children. I have not seen any evidence or heard argument as to why it was thought that such a strategy might be advantageous and have seen no suggestion that it has been effective. Indeed, such evidence as is available suggests it has been disadvantageous both to S and the children. </span></p>

F has also given evidence before me. It is important that I record my impression of him. He struck me as an essentially decent man. I found him to be thoughtful, reflective, self-critical and genuinely striving to be objective. I noted that he listened very carefully to the entirety of the evidence. He was the only person who was able to bring D&#8217;s character and personality into the court room. D&#8217;s son, (P), listened respectfully to what he had to say. He was 5 years of age when his father suffered a brain injury and his sister only 12 months. I formed the impression that F held a real affection for his friend. I sensed that he also, as a young man, had great admiration for him too. </span></p>

He played regularly and he was manifestly competitive. D and F played together on many occasions. When D was on vacation from university, the two would manage to play three or four times a week. F told me that he could not ever remember winning a match. F sought to mitigate his defeats by explaining that his primary sport was squash! F described D as a handsome man who was charismatic, charming and popular with both men and women. F also told me that he had not visited D since his accident to the extent that he thought he should have. He obviously felt guilty. Though I may be entirely mistaken, I sensed that F found it very hard to see his friend in the diminished state that he has now found himself. Having known D for decades, F told me he felt particularly sorry for D&#8217;s parents, who have carried the burden and would certainly say the privilege of caring for him. He also said that before D&#8217;s brain haemorrhage, which is the way the family refers to what has happened to D, he was aware that D and S had become estranged and that neither seemed interested in repairing their relationship. I found that evidence entirely convincing. Even as he told me this, it was clear that F struggled to understand why this obviously attractive, successful young couple, with a beautiful son and a young baby, seemingly made no effort to retrieve their marriage. F&#8217;s perception may or may not be accurate, nobody truly knows what goes on in a marriage, but I am entirely satisfied that his assessment was genuine. </span></p>

With respect to all involved, I was struck by the absence of any real attempt, or at least any success, in garnering material that cast meaningful light on the identified issue. As I have said, very little of D&#8217;s character and personality emerged from the papers. Until I heard from F, I had no sense of D&#8217;s dynamism, competitiveness and energy. I did, however, have some sense of his deep and unconditional love for his children. Whilst this evidence has brought D&#8217;s personality into the court room, for I suspect the first time in all these years of expensive, unproductive and dispiriting litigation, it has also added poignancy to D&#8217;s reality. D&#8217;s life has become the very opposite of everything he was and wanted for himself and his children. I observe, and I emphasise that I do so without making any moral judgment or insinuating any censure, that D has had very few visitors for over a decade. He has not seen his children, his wife or his friends. This charismatic man lives in a world that is diminished. It is salvaged by the dedication and love of his mother and siblings, who visit him regularly and in circumstances that have latterly been very challenging. F was quite right to focus his sympathy and respect towards them. </span></p>

First, that the mental capacity required by the law is capacity in relation to the transaction which is to be effected. Second, that what is required is the capacity to understand the nature of that transaction when it is explained. Those two propositions find expression in the passage from the judgment of Mr Martin Nourse QC in In re Beaney, decd <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1978] 1 WLR 770" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1978">[1978] 1 WLR 770</ref>, 774 E-F to which Lord Justice Kennedy has referred. But they can be traced from much earlier authority. In Ball v Mallin (1829) 3 Bligh N.<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">S. 1</ref>, 12, 22, the House of Lords upheld a direction to the jury that what was required was that a person "should be capable of understanding what he did by executing the deed in question when its general import was fully explained to him". In Harwood v Baker (1840) 3 Moore 282, 290, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council explained that "in order to constitute a sound disposing mind, a Testator must not only be able to understand that he is by his Will giving the whole of his property to one object of his regard; but that he must also have capacity to comprehend the extent of his property, and the nature of the claims of others, whom by his Will, he is excluding from all participation in that property". In Manches v Trimborn (1946) 115 L.J.K.B. 305, Mr Justice Hallett pointed out that the answer to the question whether the mental capacity necessary to render the consent of the party concerned a real consent was present in any particular case would depend on the nature of the transaction. The cases were reviewed by the High Court of Australia in Gibbons v Wright (1954) 91 CLR 423. Sir Owen Dixon, in a passage at page 438, to which Mr Nourse QC referred in In re Beaney, decd, (ibid, at page 774D), stated the principle in these terms:</span></p>

I am not going to venture into the question whether the Court of Protection could give a valid consent for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/7-8/72/section/2/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2 (1)</ref> (d).

Suffice to say that my attention has been drawn to a passage in Heywood &amp; Massey, Court of Protection Practice, 9th ed. (1971), p. 235, where it is said: "Presumably, consent on behalf of a respondent under mental disability for the purpose of paragraph (d), the two-year period, would be given by the guardian ad litem."</span></p>

I do not think that the Official Solicitor as guardian ad litem can give a consent for a patient. After all a consent is merely an expression of a state of mind, and I do not think that it is appropriate, of possible, for the Official Solicitor to express the state of a patient's mind to the court for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/7-8/72/section/2/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2 (1)</ref> (d) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/7-8/72" uk:canonical="1959 (7 &amp; 8 Eliz. 2) c. 72" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> of 1969. I reach that conclusion on the simple basis that there is nothing that I know of, no statutory provision, no rule of practice, or anything else, which would enable the Official Solicitor so to act.

It is plainly right that whilst the Official Solicitor or litigation friend may help in determining the question of &#8216;consent&#8217;, as it is termed above, neither is able to give consent on behalf of the protected party. Today, in a legal landscape, which is unrecognisable from that facing Sir George Baker, we formulate the question differently. We evaluate those features of the evidence, where available, that cast light on what the protected party would have wanted and assess it in the wider framework of Section 4 of the Mental Capacity Act. Though this provision is widely known and referred to, I set it out here in order that the stages of the process can be fully understood. </span></p>

It is important that I highlight that it is her children&#8217;s financial welfare that she emphasises. Her contention is that D&#8217;s brothers V and U, co-directors in the business, have been misappropriating funds and acted in breach of their duties as directors. She, as I understand her case, believes that D&#8217;s lack of capacity provides an opportunity to manipulate control of the company, enabling changes of articles of association and potentially, winding up of the company. She believes, in a way that she has not been able clearly to articulate, that preservation of the marriage provides a defence against this financial misconduct, as she asserts it. However, such information as is available, which comes chiefly from D&#8217;s son P, suggests that the preservation of the marriage has not prevented D&#8217;s brothers circumventing his rights. P is concerned that they have already endeavoured to </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;lock D out of his shareholding&#8221;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> When confronted with this apparent dichotomy, S was not able to resolve it. The challenges of the last 17 years and the stress of this grotesquely protracted litigation strike me as having taken its hold on her and, if she will forgive me for saying so, has impacted adversely on her ability to evaluate the present situation. The identification of D&#8217;s share, its valuation and whether the co-directors have acted to defeat his interests will fall into focus in the course of the financial remedy dispute. It may even be that it is to S&#8217;s financial advantage for the divorce proceedings to proceed. </span></p>

As I have commented above (at para. 7), F was perplexed that neither seemed interested in nor prepared to save the marriage. I emphasise again that I found that evidence both genuine and entirely convincing. S told me in evidence that this was not, in truth, an estrangement, but a separation provoked by her convalescence with an injury to her foot. I did not, I regret to say, find that convincing. In any event, S has not visited or attempted to communicate with her husband for many years. Indeed, there has been little, if any, contact for well over a decade.  The core features of what constitutes a marriage have inevitably evaporated. </span></p>

There is something inevitably corrosive of the status and importance of that institution in preserving a legal framework which, for the parties, has become, in reality, an empty husk. If, for whatever reason, that is the choice of the parties then that decision requires to be respected. However, where one party has lost the capacity to consent either to the continuation or termination of the marriage, that provokes a more complex predicament. Here, the prevailing evidence indicates that D regarded the marriage as irretrievably broken down, at a time when he clearly had capacity to evaluate his life. S&#8217;s conduct of her own life and affairs, in the intervening years establishes, at very least, that at some point, she too has come to regard the marriage as at an end. It is not necessary for me to conclude precisely when she came to that decision, beyond reiterating what I have said earlier concerning F&#8217;s perception of the couple. In the early years, following the brain haemorrhage, D&#8217;s general functioning, though significantly impaired was, as Dr Walton has told me, far less compromised then, than is presently the case.

The fact that there may be doubt as to whether D was capacitous at the time they were expressed, would not necessarily diminish the weight to be afforded to them. However, in this case the intensity of the family feud, causes me to draw back from a too easy assumption that they represent D&#8217;s own genuinely held views. Here, there is fertile ground for his being influenced either knowingly or inadvertently. Nonetheless, the statements entirely accord with what is recorded of D&#8217;s pre-brain injury views. The likely accuracy of these views is, to my mind, also enhanced by the fact D&#8217;s statements concerning his children are manifestly authentic and corroborated extensively throughout the entirety of the evidence. I am ultimately confident that they reflect D&#8217;s views.</span></p>

It is important to note that in this sadly dysfunctional family, what has plainly united this couple has been their love for and commitment to their children. Both parents would want to promote their children&#8217;s future welfare in every conceivable way. At the very end of the hearing, which lasted only a few hours, S indicated that she would no longer oppose the decree nisi. </span></p>

It is, in many ways, an impressive document. He told me in his oral evidence that it took him three days to put it together and I do not doubt that. To a degree which I suspect he may not be entirely aware of, the statement reveals a young man who is struggling to cope with a life and childhood that has been characterised by conflict. His statement covers, in almost equal measure, his concerns regarding his personal and mental health and his anger with what he believes to have been a deliberate dissipation or misappropriation of his father&#8217;s funds and his own inheritance. He believes that his father would have wanted him and his sister to inherit the financial assets which are the fruits of his labour and talent. I agree. The conflict surrounding the divorce adds, in my judgement, to this young man&#8217;s burden unnecessarily. The granting of the decree nisi moves this unhappy family at least one step forward towards ending the conflict. This necessary step has been avoided for far too long. Having regard to everything that I have been told about D and set out above, I am clear that this is what he would want. Evaluated in these terms, within the aegis of Section 4, I come to the very clear conclusion that the granting of decree nisi is, for all of the above reasons, in D&#8217;s best interests. </span></p>

It had not been. Ms Spruce, Counsel for D, has asked me to consider wider guidance when circumstances of this kind arise. Historically, situations such as that presented here, have been rare, at least within the case law. Though our understanding of the rights of the incapacitous has grown very considerably, particularly in the last decade and though I anticipate such issues are more likely to arise in the future, I am, with respect to Ms Spruce, not inclined to give wider guidance. The Court of Protection is a highly fact and issue specific jurisdiction in which prescriptive guidance runs the distinct risk of being actively unhelpful. That said, the case provides a useful opportunity to highlight the scope and ambit of the King&#8217;s Proctor. The scope of the King&#8217;s Proctor&#8217;s intervention derives from <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 8</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>. </span></p>
