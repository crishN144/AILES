	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in">This judgment concerns two cases involving babies born to mothers from Eastern Europe but relinquished at birth for adoption. I am told that there are a number of other similar cases pending across the country. The case of AO came to my attention at an early stage on the Western Circuit. The case of JL was transferred to me, with the approval of the President, so that common issues could be considered together.</p>

His mother, now aged 23, was brought up in Southern Estonia, but in December 2012 moved to work in Finland. In 2014, she returned to Estonia with plans to work in the UK, but while in Estonia that year met the putative father and became pregnant. In November 2014, the mother arrived in the UK and started working for a catering company in London, supplementing her income by part time agency working at weekends. She received no antenatal care and concealed her pregnancy from her employers, taking two weeks leave at the time of JL&#8217;s birth. Her first contact with the medical services concerning the pregnancy was when she presented at St. George&#8217;s hospital, Tooting after her waters had broken on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> March 2015. JL was born later that day. </p>

On 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March, JL was voluntarily accommodated by the local authority, a London Borough Council, and placed in foster care. The mother expressed a clear wish that he should not be placed with a family member but, rather, should be adopted in this country. On 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April, the mother registered the birth, giving an address in London as her &#8220;usual address&#8221;. No father was named on the birth certificate. On 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May, a meeting of the local authority permanency panel identified three parallel plans: (a) returning JL to his mother&#8217;s care; (b) that JL be cared for by family members or (c) adoption. Following a further meeting of the panel, JL&#8217;s contact with his mother was reduced to five times a week.</p>

On 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> June, the social worker spoke by telephone to the putative father who indicated that he was not prepared to undergo DNA testing and did not want to care for the baby and, also, that neither he nor any other member of his family could provide a home. He agreed to JL&#8217;s adoption in this country. It had been proposed that a family group conference be convened by telephone but, in the event, the social worker spoke to and emailed JL&#8217;s maternal aunt, who initially confirmed that the maternal family were unable to offer the baby a home and that they supported his adoption in this country.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At a further meeting on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July, the social worker with JL&#8217;s mother discussed how to obtain the views of the baby&#8217;s maternal grandparents. The mother indicated that she did not want the social worker to contact the grandparents direct but said she would inform them via her sister, JL&#8217;s aunt. She agreed that the social worker could email the aunt to confirm this arrangement. On 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July, the aunt sent an email to the social worker putting herself forward as a possible carer for JL. The local authority thereupon contacted the Estonian Consulate to obtain information concerning children&#8217;s services in Estonia in the event that a family assessment was required. The mother reiterated that she did not want any family member caring for the baby, nor did she agree to the Estonian children&#8217;s services becoming involved with her family. The social worker warned her of the risks that, if JL was placed for adoption without notice to members of the birth family, they might subsequently challenge the placement. She therefore agreed to contact her family in Estonia. On 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August, the social worker received an email from the maternal grandmother stating that the family was not able to care for JL and supported his adoption. The following day, the local authority received a further email from the maternal aunt withdrawing her previous tentative proposal to care for JL, stating that she would not go against the mother&#8217;s wishes, but providing information for JL&#8217;s life story book. </p>

Neither parent has plans to return to Hungary in the foreseeable future. As set out below, however, the Hungarian authorities assert that they only left Hungary shortly before the birth of the baby. They first came to the attention of the social services on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> June 2015 when a referral was made by a midwife whom the mother had consulted because she was pregnant.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The original intention of the local authority by starting proceedings under the inherent jurisdiction was simply to seek the court&#8217;s determination as to the baby&#8217;s habitual residence. The purpose of the proceedings now, however, is to facilitate the adoption of the child, either in this jurisdiction or in Hungary. On behalf of the local authority, Mr. Fuller concedes that the proceedings fall outside Council Regulation (EC) 2201/2003 (&#8220;Brussels IIA&#8221;) so that the power to transfer proceedings under Article 15 of that regulation is not available. He states, however, that the local authority can see no legal (as opposed to welfare) impediment to the court, in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction, sanctioning arrangements for AO to be taken to Hungary in accordance with the suggestion of the Hungarian authorities. He says that the issue can be starkly put &#8211; AO will be adopted either in this country or in Hungary. She will be brought up in England either as an English or possibly Anglo-Hungarian child, or in Hungary as a Hungarian child. The local authority has come to the conclusion that the right course having regard to the child&#8217;s welfare is to place her with the Hungarian authorities. If she is adopted in this country, it is inevitable that she will at the appropriate time learn of her Hungarian origins and may at that time find it difficult to understand why, by being adopted in England, she has grown up outside her inherited culture. Furthermore, were she in due course to attempt to trace birth family members in Hungary, she is highly unlikely to have the necessary language or cultural background to enable her to form any kind of relationship with them. In short, for the local authority, the child&#8217;s national, cultural, linguistic, ethnic and religious background outweighs the parents&#8217; wishes and tips the balance in favour of a Hungarian future for her. Mr Fuller submits that, if the court orders that AO be placed in the care of the appropriate Hungarian authorities, it will be a matter for them whether attempts are made to trace extended family members. The local authority foresees difficulty if AO remains in this country, and the local authority and the court embark upon a process of investigating the option of placement with a family member in Hungary. Mr. Fuller contends that the Hungarian authorities would not look kindly upon such a course when their domestic law allows placement with anonymous adopters if that is what the parents wish to happen. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parents&#8217; position is very different. They are not married and moved to England in order to obtain better paid work and hoping for a better life. They wish the same for their daughter. They both wish her to be placed with prospective adopters in this country without delay. They do not want their respective family members being notified of her birth, nor for any of them to care for the child in the long term. They say that all family members are facing financial difficulties and would therefore be unable to care for the baby. It is also argued on their behalf that there is a significant risk that A will suffer psychological harm if placed within the extended family in circumstances where she is likely to know that her parents wanted her to be adopted and where she is likely to continue to come into direct contact with them in the long term. There is also the further risk of damage to the parents&#8217; relationships with their extended family and potential harm which the parents may suffer as a result of the child being placed within the family in circumstances where they want her adopted. It is therefore submitted by Mr. Feehan QC and his juniors on behalf of the parents that it cannot be said that this would be in the best interests of either the child or the parents. </p>

Although the parents want the child to be adopted there are no adoption or placement applications currently before the court. Contrary to the interpretation favoured by the local authority, it is contended on behalf of the parents that the current proceedings fall within the ambit of Brussels IIA and could therefore be transferred under Article 15 of that regulation, were the court to find that the provisions of that article are satisfied. The parents submit, however, that the provisions of Article 15 are not satisfied, that AO does not have a particular connection with Hungary and, furthermore, that Hungary is not better placed to hear the case because any transfer is likely to lead to a delay in a final decision as to her future. Furthermore, applying the legal principles concerning forum non conveniens, it is submitted that the balance of convenience firmly lies in this court retaining jurisdiction. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of the guardian, Mr Roberts also proceeds on the basis that these proceedings do fall within the Brussels IIA regulation. He submits that the local authority is neither seeking a placement order nor taking any steps preparatory to an adoption placement which would take the proceedings outside the regulation. The guardian, however, advances a different case on the application of Article 15 from that advanced on behalf of the parents. He submits that AO, as a Hungarian national, plainly has a &#8220;particular connection&#8221; with that country and submits that the child&#8217;s cultural heritage is vitally important. She does not yet have any sufficient connection with the UK to weigh in the balance. She has no close ties with this country so there are no gravitational factors to tend to favour her remaining here (for example, the presence of siblings or extended family or the establishment of other ties to social, educational or cultural life). The guardian is satisfied with the responses from the Hungarian authorities as to the arrangements which will be put in place to ensure her future care and welfare. The guardian therefore concludes that she is a Hungarian child whose future should lie in Hungary and in all the circumstances supports an invitation to the appropriate Hungarian court to assume jurisdiction. He further supports the local authority&#8217;s case that the court should order that AO be taken to Hungary.</p>

In the case of JL, the further issues are: (1) Does the court have jurisdiction to make a placement order? (2)  What order, if any, should be made in this case? In the case of AO, the further issues are: (1) Is it open to the court to transfer jurisdiction to Hungary? (2) Is it open to the court to make an order permitting the local authority to send AO to Hungary?

Article 8 provides the general jurisdiction rule that the courts of a member state shall have jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility over a child who is habitually resident there at the time the court is seised. Article 12 (3) provides for the prorogation of jurisdiction if certain conditions are satisfied. Article 13 provides that, where a child&#8217;s habitual residence cannot be established and jurisdiction cannot be determined on the basis of Article 12, the courts of the member state where the child is present shall have jurisdiction. Article 14 provides that, where no court of a member state has jurisdiction pursuant to Articles 8 to 13, jurisdiction shall be determined, in each member state, by the laws of that state (in the case of England and Wales, in Part I of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref>).

In AO&#8217;s case, the Hungarian authorities assert in the correspondence quoted above that the Hungarian court has jurisdiction under Hungarian national law by reason of AO&#8217;s nationality. It is not, however, a principle of English domestic law that a court in this country has no jurisdiction over the child, or must automatically cede jurisdiction to the courts of the child&#8217;s nationality.<span style="font-style:italic"/>The fact of a child&#8217;s nationality is, of course, likely to be a matter of relevance &#8211; and, in some cases, of considerable importance &#8211; when considering an application for a transfer of jurisdiction under Article 15 of Brussels IIA (if applicable) or, if the court in this country retains jurisdiction, when carrying out the welfare analysis, including determining any application for an order authorising the placement of the child abroad. Similarly, when exercising its statutory jurisdiction under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref>, the court applies English law, as opposed to foreign law (see the President&#8217;s analysis in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re N</span> at paras 87 et seq), although the foreign law may be relevant &#8211; and, in some cases, of considerable importance &#8211; when carrying out the welfare analysis, particularly if there is a danger that the adoption will not be recognised in the country of nationality, creating a so-called &#8220;limping adoption&#8221;.

Non-consensual adoption was comparatively rare. A combination of dramatic changes in the 1960s &#8211; the ready availability of the contraceptive pill, the legalization of abortion, the relaxation of the divorce laws and a sea-change in society&#8217;s attitude to illegitimacy &#8211; led to dramatic reduction in the number of adoptions of the traditional type. The result of various changes in the system of public childcare, culminating in the implementation in October 1991 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>, has led in recent decades to a correspondingly dramatic increase in the number of non-consensual adoption.

Such cases, although comparatively rare, may still arise in certain circumstances, including where the time period in which a lawful termination of the pregnancy can be sought has passed, or where the pregnancy is concealed from the wider family or employers, and in either case the parents do not wish to keep the baby. It is notable that both cases involve mothers from other countries. I understand from other judges that there have been other examples of babies born to mothers from other countries being relinquished for adoption although there is no information as to the numbers of such cases. Adoptions of the &#8220;traditional type&#8221; almost always proceed by consent with no contested hearing or judgment. Thus there has been no recent judicial consideration of the legal principles or procedure to be applied. </p>

Anyone who has read the accounts of persons who have given up a baby in those circumstances will soon come to see that it is usually a decision taken only after a great deal of thought and anguish, by parents who realise that they cannot look after the baby and wish to give the baby the best opportunity to grow up in a loving home. Where a child has been relinquished for adoption, the wishes and feelings of the parents are therefore likely to be an important consideration, although they must be considered in the context of the other factors in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1(4)</ref> and the child&#8217;s welfare generally. </p>

But high among them has been, historically, the desire or need of some mothers to be able to conceal from their own family and friends, the fact of the pregnancy and birth. So far as I know, it has not previously been suggested, nor judicially determined, that that confidentiality of the mother cannot be respected and maintained. If it is now to be eroded, there is, in my judgment, a real risk that more pregnant women would seek abortions or give birth secretly, to the risk of both themselves and their babies &#8230;. There is, in my judgment, a strong social need, if it is lawful, to continue to enable some mothers, such as this mother, to make discreet, dignified and humane arrangements for the birth and subsequent adoption of their babies, without their families knowing anything about it, if the mother, for good reason, so wishes.</p>

In that case, a teenage mother who became pregnant after a one-night stand gave up her baby for adoption, refused to identify the father, and indicated that she did not believe that her family could care for the child. At first instance, the judge, on the grounds that the local authority needed to discover as much as possible about the child&#8217;s background, directed the authority to disclose the fact of the birth to the maternal family and the guardian to take steps to identify the father. The mother appealed and, although the maternal family had meanwhile  discovered what had happened, the Court of Appeal reversed the directions to the guardian in order to prevent her taking further steps to identify the father.

In some cases, the birth tie will be very important, especially where the child is of an age to understand what is happening or where there are ethnic or cultural or religious reasons for keeping the child in the birth family. Where a child has never lived with her birth family, and is too young to understand what is going on, that argument must be weaker. In my judgment, in a case such as this, it is (absent any application by any member of the family, which succeeds) overtaken by the need to find the child a permanent home as soon as that can be done.&#8221;</p>

There is a qualitative difference between these two options in terms of the degree to which the outcome will interfere with the ECHR, Art 8 rights to family life of the child and his parents; adoption by strangers being at the extreme end of the spectrum of interference and adoption by a family member being at a less extreme point on the scale.

Where parents have relinquished their baby and expressed a wish that he or she be adopted outside the natural family, the degree of interference with family life rights is less than where the parent-child relationship is severed against the parents&#8217; wishes. The fact that the parents have taken this decision is an important consideration when determining whether the interference is necessary and proportionate. It follows, therefore, that approval of adoption in such cases does not depend on the local authority or court reaching the conclusion that nothing else will do.

As Black LJ emphasised in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re N</span> at para 176 in the passage cited above, &#8220;adoption in this country is governed by statute, now the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref>, and adoption and placement orders can only be granted under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">that Act</ref>.&#8221; A placement order is simply a creature of that statute.

(2) Is it open to the court to make an order permitting the local authority to send AO to Hungary?

The local authority says that the court cannot transfer the proceedings but, exercising its power under the inherent jurisdiction, can and should order that the child be sent to Hungary.  The parents say that the court has the power to transfer the proceedings but should not do so in the circumstances of this case. They further say that the court has no power under the inherent jurisdiction to send the child to Hungary. The guardian says that the court has the power to transfer the proceedings and further has the power under the inherent jurisdiction to send the child to Hungary and should exercise both powers in respect of AO. </p>

But AO was removed from her mother immediately after birth, so she never had chance to establish a degree of integration with her in a family environment. The position is complicated still further by the fact that the proceedings under the inherent jurisdiction were started before AO was born, so at the point the court was seised she was still <span style="font-style:italic">en ventre sa mere</span>. For these reasons, there may be difficulties in establishing jurisdiction under Article 8. Further debate on these niceties is, however, unnecessary because, on any view, this court would have jurisdiction under Article 13. Plainly AO has never been resident anywhere else, so if she was not in law habitually resident here at the start of the proceedings this court is able, by reason of her presence in England and Wales, to exercise its inherent jurisdiction to make orders in respect of her care and welfare. Crucially, however, that jurisdiction does not extend to those matters excluded by Article 1(3), including decisions on adoption or take measures preparatory to adoption.</p>

As the Court of Appeal has recently confirmed, however, the power to transfer proceedings under Article 15 only arises where the court has jurisdiction under that regulation and, as a result, does not extend to decisions on adoption or measures preparatory to adoption: <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re CB</span>, supra, and<span style="font-style:italic"/><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re N</span>, supra.

The powers of the court under the inherent jurisdiction in respect of a ward are in theory far reaching and extend to making whatever orders it deems appropriate in the interests of the child&#8217;s welfare. Insofar as this encompasses the exercise of parental responsibility, such proceedings come within the scope of Brussels IIA. The specific issue in the present proceedings, however, is whether, as her parents wish, the child should be adopted in this country, or alternatively, as proposed by the local authority, guardian and Hungarian authorities, returned to Hungary so that she can be placed for adoption there. As Mr. Fuller put it in his skeleton argument, &#8220;no party is suggesting that the outcome for A should be anything other than adoption &#8230; A will be adopted either in England or Hungary.&#8221; In my view, the court&#8217;s decision on that issue is a measure preparatory to adoption and therefore falls outside Brussels IIA. For that reason, these proceedings cannot be transferred under Article 15 of that regulation.</p>

Further, he argues that, although no party is suggesting any outcome other than adoption, her future will be a matter for the Hungarian authorities who will follow their own procedures. He characterises the move as being for the purpose of enabling her to be brought up in the country of which she is a citizen and from which she derives her culture and heritage, rather than for the purpose of adoption. On behalf of the guardian, Mr Roberts submits that, while the plan is adoption, there are a number of steps which will have to be taken by the Hungarian authorities before the adoption order is made so there are a number of junctures at which the plan may change. He argues that the question whether AO will be adopted &#8220;remains comparatively open&#8221;. On behalf of the parents, however, Mr. Feehan submits that the indications of the Hungarian authorities are clear &#8211; family members will not be contacted and no other option will be considered except adoption.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I wish to emphasise that nothing I have said so far goes to the merits of the proposal that AO be placed in Hungary. In stating the legal principles and procedures to be followed in cases involving relinquished babies, I have deliberately refrained from expressing a view as to what is the right outcome for AO. That issue must be argued on another occasion before a court exercising the proper jurisdiction. I would therefore propose that, if the local authority elects to proceed with an application for a care order and an order under schedule 2 para 19, the proceedings should be started and transferred to me as soon as possible.  I would hope that space in my list could be found to determine the application within the next three months. I will list the matter for further directions on a date to be fixed by my clerk in consultation with the parties&#8217; representatives.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">The jurisdictional rules in Council Regulation (EC) 2201/2003 (Brussels IIA) do not apply to decisions on adoption or measures preparatory to adoption. The jurisdiction to make orders for the placement for adoption and the adoption of children in England and Wales is derived wholly from statute. The statutory scheme is set out in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref>, but also includes Schedule 2 paragraph 19 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. There is no other jurisdiction to make such orders, either under statute or under the inherent jurisdiction. Although the inherent jurisdiction may be invoked to supplement the statute, it cannot be used to make orders that cut across or conflict with the statutory scheme.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">The decision of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2013/33" uk:canonical="[2013] UKSC 33" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] UKSC 33</ref> concerned non-consensual adoptions. Where parents have relinquished their baby and expressed a wish that he or she be adopted outside the natural family, the degree of interference with family life rights is less than where the parent-child relationship is severed against the parents&#8217; wishes. The fact that the parents have taken this decision is an important consideration when determining whether the interference is necessary and proportionate. It follows, therefore, that approval of adoption in such cases does not depend on the local authority or court reaching the conclusion that nothing else will do.  But the parents&#8217; wishes, although important, are not decisive. They must be evaluated along with all the other factors in the welfare checklist in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1(4)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref>. In all adoption cases &#8211; non-consensual and consensual &#8211; the local authority is under an obligation to carry out a thorough analysis of the realistic options for the child, as highlighted in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B-S</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/1146" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 1146" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 1146</ref>.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">In AO&#8217;s case, where the issue is whether the baby should be adopted here or in Hungary, the proceedings fall outside Brussels IIA and cannot therefore be transferred to Hungary under Article 15 of that regulation. The court cannot use the inherent jurisdiction in a way which cuts across or conflicts with the statutory scheme, by facilitating a placement abroad in circumstances where the parents do not consent and without consideration of whether they are acting unreasonably in withholding their consent, or by sending the child abroad for the purposes of adoption in circumstances which are unlawful under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/85" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.85</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref>. I therefore decline to make an order (as sought by AO&#8217;s guardian) transferring the proceedings to Hungary or make an order (as sought by the local authority and the guardian) under the inherent jurisdiction authorising the placement of AO in that country. </p>
