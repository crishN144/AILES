	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The application concerns a young woman who turned 18 in March 2021. I shall refer to her as DY. DY has been diagnosed with two chromosomal duplicities, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, and a moderate learning disability. Additionally, an independent expert report prepared during these proceedings by Dr Camden Smith concluded that DY had developmental trauma disorder or complex post-traumatic stress disorder, both of which are disorders of the mind or brain. DY is represented in the proceedings by the Official Solicitor as her litigation friend. The applicant is the local authority (&#8220;the local authority&#8221;) which had responsibility for her as a looked after child since 2012 and now has ongoing responsibility for her adult care services. Both her parents are respondents to the proceedings but neither has taken part nor been represented. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">These proceedings commenced as an application dated 17 July 2020 by the local authority for authorisation to deprive DY of her liberty under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court. The proceedings were transferred to the Court of Protection on 23 July 2020 and eventually allocated to me because DY&#8217;s capacity to consent to sexual relations was in issue. In September 2020 I made a variety of interim declarations and approved a proposal made by the Official Solicitor that Dr Camden Smith should carry out an assessment of DY&#8217;s capacity in various domains. A roundtable meeting took place on 12 January 2021 and, given that the Official Solicitor accepted some but not all the conclusions of Dr Camden Smith&#8217;s report, it was agreed that the matter should be listed for hearing before me to determine the disputed matters. </p>

Dr Camden Smith&#8217;s conclusions that DY lacked the capacity to conduct the proceedings and to make decisions about care, contact, social media use and her finances were not challenged. Additionally, there was no challenge to Dr Camden Smith&#8217;s conclusion that DY had the capacity to decide between residence options which were capable of meeting her assessed needs. The matter in dispute related to DY&#8217;s capacity to decide to engage in sexual relations. </p>

The Official Solicitor submitted that DY had the capacity to decide to engage in sexual relations contrary to the report of Dr Camden Smith. It was submitted that Dr Camden Smith may have set the bar too high in her analysis of DY&#8217;s understanding of the distinction between consenting to sexual relations within and outside a relationship. </p>

At the conclusion of the evidence on 3 February 2021, there was some confusion about the local authority&#8217;s position in that it sought a declaration that DY lacked the capacity to make decisions as to sexual relations in circumstances when she was unsettled or distressed or, alternatively and without notice to the Official Solicitor of the same, a declaration in identical or similar terms pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction. I adjourned the hearing and required the local authority to set out in clear and unambiguous terms its written submissions as to capacity on this important issue with provision for the Official </p>

In September 2011, DY moved to foster carers following the making of an interim care order and, in May 2012, a final care order was made to the local authority. Shortly after being placed in local authority foster care, DY made an allegation of rape which allegedly occurred while she was in the care of her parents. She also made other allegations about their care and about sexual abuse by those with whom the parents associated. A police investigation ensued, and an individual was charged. </p>

The police were informed and a child sexual exploitation risk assessment was completed. Once more in 2018, DY was reported to be sending messages of a sexual nature at school. It is fair to say that the local authority has had concerns about DY&#8217;s sexually inappropriate behaviour both at school and in her foster home since about 2016. </p>

That placement appears to have been responsible for settling her behaviour and she began attending college. She also formed a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship with a young man called AB. By April 2021 DY had moved to a supported living placement with the aim of working on independence skills and making safe new friendships and social relationships. I record that DY has been compliant with her care plan and cooperative with professionals working with her on her transition from children&#8217;s services to adult services. </p>

A person must be assumed to have capacity unless it is established that s/he lacks capacity: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(2)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>. The burden of proof therefore lies on the party asserting that a person does not have capacity. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2(4)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>. I have also reminded myself against imposing too high a test of capacity, as to do so would run the risk of discriminating against persons suffering from mental disability and thereby deprive them of autonomy. </p>

I have reflected long and carefully on this given Miss Jenni Richards QC&#8217;s challenge to formulate and articulate a workable test. In relation to the moral aspect, I do not think it can be done. Of itself that does not alarm me for two reasons: first, I think the standard for capacity would be very modest, not really going beyond an awareness of &#8220;right&#8221; and &#8220;wrong&#8221; behaviour as factors in making a choice; and secondly, the truly amoral human is a rarity and other issues would then come into play. Accordingly, although in my judgment it is an important component in sexual relations, it can have no specific role in a test of capacity. </span></p>

It remains in my view an important, some might argue the most important, component; certainly, it is the source of the greatest damage when sexual relations are abused. The act of intercourse is often understood as having an element of self-giving qualitatively different from any other human contact. Nevertheless, the challenge remains: can it be articulated into a workable test? Again I have thought long and hard about this and acknowledge the difficulty inherent in the task. In my judgment one can do no more than this: does the person whose capacity is in question understand that they do have a choice and that they can refuse? That seems to me an important aspect of capacity and is as far as it is really possible to go over and above an understanding of the physical component.&#8221; </span></p>

But the fact that a person either does or does not consent to sexual activity with a particular person at a fixed point in time, or does or does not have capacity to give such consent, does not mean that it is impossible, or legally impermissible, for a court assessing capacity to make a general evaluation which is not tied down to a particular partner, time and place. </span></heading>

It is crucial that [DY] receives therapy in developing a sense of self and assertiveness that would then enable her to make decisions to keep herself safe. This is a long piece of work and is unlikely to lead to [DY] gaining capacity within a practicable timescale for the current hearing. I would hope that [DY] would be able to gain capacity in this area and would recommend a reassessment of capacity following work on assertiveness and keeping herself safe. I would envisage this taking approximately a year or two, however this depends on the availability of a therapist experienced in trauma with people with an LD, the skill of therapist and [DY&#8217;s] engagement. DY could easily learn to say that she could say no outside of a relationship, however I do not believe she would easily be able to use this information after she had learned it. Any further assessment of capacity will therefore need to be carried out by an experienced assessor with a knowledge of trauma and disrupted attachment.&#8221; </span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In her oral evidence, Dr Camden Smith conceded that she may have set the bar too high in terms of her analysis of DY&#8217;s understanding of the distinction between consenting to sexual relations within and outside a relationship. Whilst she accepted that DY had capacity to consent to sex, her concern was how DY would make that decision outside of a relationship. It was difficult to say what her capacity would be if her relationship with her present boyfriend were to end. When unsettled, DY may be unable to make a clear and rational decision. DY did not think the sex act was very special and had a pragmatic unemotional view of sex that could be something quite transactional rather than something particularly intimate because of her experiences growing up. Dr Camden Smith accepted that her view that DY thought sex was not special had not been specifically explored with DY but was based upon DY&#8217;s presentation. She confirmed that DY understood the mechanics of the sexual act, the risk of pregnancy, and the risk of a sexually transmitted disease. DY had told her that she had said no to sex within the context of her relationship with her boyfriend and that she had had penetrative vaginal intercourse with her boyfriend. The main confusion arose because DY could not conceive of not being in a relationship with her present boyfriend and the nature of DY&#8217;s cognitive deficit meant that it was much harder for her to analyse things in abstract terms. It would be possible to support her if she expressed a wish in future to have a relationship with someone else. There were times when, unsupported, DY would lose capacity but if she were provided with support then her capacity would not fluctuate. </p>

However, YZ confirmed that, within her present relationship, DY had capacity to consent to sexual relations. Given her lack of capacity with respect to contact, YZ did not demur from the proposition advanced by the Official Solicitor that, in circumstances where there would be controls over who DY had contact with, DY would be able to be supported to make decisions about the act of sex. </p>

Whilst the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> and the case law warns me against losing sight of the fundamental principle that the obligation to protect the incapacitous must be tempered by respect for the autonomy of those with mental disabilities/disorders, my personal experience of meeting DY served to highlight her vulnerability. She was eager to please and found it hard to identify any risks she might face either generally or in relation to the issue of consent to sexual relations. When coupled with an awareness of her difficult personal history, I found myself concerned about her vulnerability in general and acutely conscious of how easy it would be to exploit and harm her. My experience of DY is, I believe, shared by those who have daily contact with her and those who are responsible for her care. Their anxieties about DY shaped the local authority&#8217;s position in these proceedings and, whilst it was unfortunate that this was not initially as clearly articulated as it might have been, I do not criticise the local authority for taking the stance it did.  </p>

Within that protective context, DY should be able to decide for herself who she wishes to have sexual relationships with and the local authority should put in place care arrangements to support her to make those choices safely. </p>

The local authority sought a prospective declaration to that effect or, alternatively, a declaration in identical or similar terms pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction. The Official Solicitor submitted that the local authority&#8217;s approach was wrong in principle and wrong on the facts because (a) the court was required to assess capacity on a general and non-specific basis; (b) the evidence before the court could not rebut the statutory assumption that DY had capacity on that basis; and (c) any concerns about her vulnerability or ability to assess risk could and should be addressed through provision of support and best interest decisions on care and contact. </p>

Whilst all those particular words might describe DY&#8217;s mood at any given time, they did not adequately describe the point at which she might cease to have capacity to engage in sexual relations. As I understand the local authority&#8217;s case, that would seem to be a matter of degree. The difficulty with Mr Foster&#8217;s submission was that, on each occasion that DY appeared to be unsettled or distressed and was proposing or had the potential to engage in sexual relations, the prospective declaration sought would require an assessment of whether DY was sufficiently distressed or unsettled so as to have lost capacity to engage in sexual relations. That would give wide discretion to individual professionals without any check to ensure that DY&#8217;s autonomy was respected, and that decisions were not being driven by the desire to protect her. </p>

Neither of those conditions applied in this case.

Those factors were, in my opinion, more directed to an assessment of DY&#8217;s capacity to make decisions about those with whom she had contact. None of them supported a conclusion that DY lacked capacity to make decisions about engaging in sexual relations generally or when she was distressed or unsettled.  </p>

I had asked the parties to address the court&#8217;s use of the word <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;may&#8221;</span> in the phrase <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;the information relevant to the decision may include the following&#8221;</span>. Both parties accepted that it would be inappropriate for me to add to the list of relevant information, and I accept the Official Solicitor&#8217;s submission that the use of the term <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;may&#8221;</span> left open the possibility that some of the factors identified may not be relevant in some cases. I have accordingly tempered any enthusiasm to add to the list of relevant criteria set out in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re JB</span>.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The local authority suggested that the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;nature and character of the act&#8221; </span>included: (1) the qualitative difference between the act from the perspective of a man in the act from the perspective of a woman, including the risk of immediate pain and injury and the consequences in terms of pregnancy and the health risks associated with pregnancy; (2) an appreciation that sex was uniquely physically and emotionally intimate; and (3) an awareness that the act placed a person participating in a position of unique vulnerability. The difficulty with the local authority&#8217;s submission is that the long-established case law requires only a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;rudimentary&#8221;</span> knowledge of what the act comprises and an awareness that it is an act of a sexual nature (see Munby J (as he then was) in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">X City Council v MB</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2006/168" uk:canonical="[2006] EWHC 168 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWHC 168 (Fam)</ref> at paragraph 74). Applying that test, it was clear that DY understood the nature and character of the sexual act on a rudimentary level. Dr Camden Smith gave clear evidence that DY understood the mechanics of the act and there was no suggestion that she thought the act was anything other than an act of sexual connection. Though DY had an unemotional view of sex and did not think it was very special, that could not, in my view, form part of a workable test since there are a wide range of views about sexual relations ranging from the purely transactional to an act imbued with deep emotional and religious significance.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">There was no evidence before the court that DY had any difficulty in understanding that the other person must consent to the sexual activity before and throughout. Likewise, there was no dispute that DY understood she was able to say no in the context of her relationship with AB. Whilst she may have been unable to grasp the abstract concept of sexual relations with another person when she was in an established relationship with her boyfriend and did not want a sexual relationship with anyone else, it was difficult to conclude that she would be incapable if and when a decision arose with respect to another person. The evidence was also clear that DY understood the risk of pregnancy and of sexually transmitted disease. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Standing back and considering the issue in the round, I am satisfied that, at the time she was assessed, DY understood and was able to weigh all relevant information and had the capacity to decide to engage in sexual relations on a general non-specific basis. There was no dispute that she had the capacity to make decisions about sexual relations with her boyfriend, the only person with whom there was any current prospect of having sexual relations. The evidence of both Dr Camden Smith and YZ, DY&#8217;s social worker, as to how she might respond in other circumstances was uncertain and speculative. She should not be assessed as lacking capacity unless all practicable steps have been taken to support her to make the decision without success, that included putting in place a package of support to limit and/or mitigate the effect of any periods of distress or unsettledness. The local authority&#8217;s concerns about the risk of abuse and exploitation could be addressed through an appropriate package of care and contact arrangements, decided in DY&#8217;s best interests. The prospective declaration proposed by the local authority was unworkable and imprecise. </p>

Whilst I understand the instincts which prompted that submission, DY&#8217;s care would be supported within the framework of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> as it is agreed by the parties, and I accept, that DY lacks capacity to make decisions about her care and contact with others. In those circumstances, the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> provides an appropriate legal framework for a care package which protects DY from abuse and exploitation. I see no justification for invoking the inherent jurisdiction since it affords no greater scope for making a declaration of incapacity on grounds of a disturbance of the functioning of the mind than exists under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>. </p>
