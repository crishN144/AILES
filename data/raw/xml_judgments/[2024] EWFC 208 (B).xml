He has problems with his bowels and has to take Laxido twice daily, which was prescribed by his GP.  There was an occasion when the Respondent was away from the Applicant and Enitan for one night, and when she returned, Enitan was very unwell and the Applicant informed the Respondent that he had forgotten to give him his medication.  This resulted in Enitan being in extreme pain because of an excruciating tummy ache.  On another occasion in November 2022, the respondent was away having surgery and the applicant failed to take Enitan to nursery on two days, being 28th November and 30th November 2022.  There has also been an occasion when the Applicant has travelled Enitan in the car without a seatbelt on.</p>

Enitan would run off and the Applicant would pull him out and hit him again.  He told the Respondent that this was allowed in his culture, and it was known as &#8220;flogging&#8221;.  On 5th November 2020, the Applicant pulled the Respondent&#8217;s hair and hit her head off a door frame, which was witnessed by the Respondent&#8217;s 15- year-old daughter.  The Applicant was issued with a DVPN.</p>

The Respondent had refused sex and the Applicant laughed at her and said that he would rape her. The Respondent had sexual intercourse with the Applicant through fear of him carrying out this threat and she cried throughout.  The Applicant showed no affection during sexual intercourse and when the respondent would ask him to stop because she was bleeding or it was dry and she was finding it painful, he would simply tell her that she needed to spit on it.</p>

He threatened the Respondent and said that if she wouldn&#8217;t get Enitan circumcised, he would end the relationship.  When the parties were together, the Applicant tried to get the Respondent to do a statement saying that the Applicant had full custody of Enitan and that she only saw him every other weekend, because if she did that, it would send his Visa application down a different route and he wouldn&#8217;t have to reapply every 2&#189; years.  The Respondent refused to do this and the Applicant fell out with her because of that and stated that she was costing him money.  The Respondent sees this as emotional blackmail.  The applicant isolated the respondent from her family and friends and made her feel like she couldn&#8217;t leave the house.  If she did leave the house, he would message her immediately saying that he needed something from the shop urgently and made her take it back to him.  If there were ever any family events, birthdays, days out etc, the Applicant would always cause an argument beforehand about something small, so as to ruin the day for the Respondent.  If the Applicant and Respondent went to see the Respondent&#8217;s family, he would remain in the car.  On some occasions, they were there for the full day and the Applicant stayed in his vehicle the whole time as he did not want to spend time with the Respondent&#8217;s family.  If the Respondent said something that the Applicant did not like, he would give her the silent treatment and ignore her for days.  He would even leave the property for days and weeks at a time and wouldn&#8217;t answer calls from the Respondent.  The Respondent felt like she was constantly on eggshells as she didn&#8217;t want to upset him and didn&#8217;t know what mood he was in.  If the Respondent was tired, the Applicant would not let her sleep if he was awake.  If she fell asleep, he would take pictures of her and send them to her for her to see when she woke up, even when she had asked him not to do this and he would consistently wake her from her sleep.</p>

He would move things around the house and then tell the Respondent that she was the one that moved it.  He would make her feel like she was going crazy to the point that she questioned her own sanity.  The Applicant would tell the Respondent that she needed to be clean and tidy around her genitals, but he would only do the same if he was going out clubbing with friends, which made the Respondent believe that the Applicant was cheating on her.  The Applicant would call the Respondent &#8220;disgusting&#8221; and a &#8220;dirty bitch&#8221; if she did not have a shower and this would result in her sometimes having showers at 1am just to avoid being called that.  The Applicant would insult the Respondent about her appearance, saying that she has got thin hair, spots and a moustache.  The Applicant would message other women in the Respondent&#8217;s eyesight, and when she questioned him, he would say that she is going crazy, was paranoid and jealous.</p>

When the parties separated, it was agreed that the Applicant would pay the Respondent &#163;150 PCM which was &#163;100 for Enitan&#8217;s care and &#163;50 to pay for the tablet.  The Applicant only paid the Respondent &#163;150 once and then when he was arrested, he stopped paying which the respondent believes is as revenge.  The Respondent has received a message, which she believes to be from the Applicant, harassing her for these payments to be made as well as other communications in this regard, which she believes the Applicant instructed to be sent.</p>

The mother must provide the fact alleged on balance of probabilities.  English family law determines facts in a binary manner.  If a fact is proven on balance of probabilities, it is treated as having occurred.  If a fact is not proven on balance of probabilities it is treated as not having happened.  In determining the facts, I must, however, take a holistic view of all the evidence before me.</p>

On father&#8217;s part, I heard Harriett, who had been best friends with the mother for some nineteen years until the events which gave rise to the current proceedings arose, and Joseph, who was Harriett&#8217;s life partner during much of the period with which we are concerned.</p>

The two clearly had a very close relationship and had always been often in each other&#8217;s company.  She said that mother&#8217;s mental health was badly affected during her time living with father and said that her daughter had been diagnosed with unstable personality disorder.  There was no medical evidence to support this and Frances conceded that the diagnosis might be wrong.  Frances was also involved in an astonishing incident around midnight of 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>/19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2020.  The father had walked out on mother following an argument.  Mother decided to cut up some of father&#8217;s clothing in revenge.  Frances assisted and can be seen in a photograph timed at 5 minutes past midnight holding up a cut-up shirt.  She showed an aversion to father whilst in the witness box.  Overall I view her evidence with caution.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Gillian was eighteen when she gave evidence.  She had already left home to live with her partner.  To some extent she was an independent witness.  Father had been a step-father figure to her from the age of thirteen and in my view she showed no ill-will to him.  She was not a perfect witness.  For example, when she was thirteen she had taken money from father.  In cross-examination it took the showing of some contemporaneous text messages to persuade her to admit this behaviour.  Nonetheless, in my judgment she was a witness of truth.</p>

The father is of above average height and is of muscular build.  He is  a regular gym attendee.  The mother is of average height and is now of average weight.  Thus, currently father is the more physically dominating person.  However, this was not the position during most of the relationship.  When they met, mother weighed between 24 and 25 stones.  It is common ground that mother underwent gastric surgery.  This led to an enormous weight loss, such that she had to undergo further surgery to tighten her skin.  Mother said the two surgical operations were performed in February and November 2022.  (Father, when giving evidence thought that it was somewhat earlier, but mother&#8217;s and Frances&#8217;s evidence on this was not challenged when they were cross-examined by Ms Popley, so I accept the 2022 dates.)  There is evidence, which I shall consider, that the mother on at least some occasions could be extremely aggressive.  I do, however, find as a fact that mother was not physically intimidated by father.  I should add that it was also common ground the operations were paid for, half by father, half by the maternal grandmother.</p>

It was not suggested at the hearing before me that Frances consented to it, or even knew about it prior to its taking place, nor was there any evidence of the mother&#8217;s father consenting.  The power of attorney (or equivalent) which the mother presumably signed at the adviser&#8217;s offices in England so that someone could act as her proxy at the marriage ceremony has not been produced.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The background to the proxy marriage appears to have been the visa difficulties faced by the father.  Neither side sought to establish what the true position as to father&#8217;s immigration status was from time to time between father and the Home Office.  He seems to have had work visas for at least some of the time, but at other times he did not.  The mother goes so far as to suggest that father wanted a child with her solely in order to assist in his visa applications.  There is certainly a suspicion that the proxy marriage was intended to provide support to father&#8217;s visa applications.  As is well-known, in order to clamp down on sham marriages, there are restrictions on the ability of those from outside the United Kingdom or Ireland marrying: see www.gov.uk/marriages-civil-partnerships/from-outside-the-uk-or-ireland (accessed 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2024).

It seems to me that the relevance of the proxy marriage is to the parties&#8217; knowledge of it.  If mother did not know of the marriage, or consent to it, then that very badly damaged father&#8217;s credibility, in that he was faking the whole business.  On the other hand, if the mother did know of the marriage in advance and knowingly signed the documents necessary to give effect to it, then that affected her credibility, because it was she who was lying when she gave evidence that she knew nothing of the marriage.</p>

We were absolutely shocked beyond belief that these papers existed as the respondent has never mentioned marriage.&#8221;  However, in cross-examination by Ms Popley, Frances accepted that her daughter had bought a wedding ring to celebrate the marriage and that from time to time she referred to father as her husband.  This implies that mother was happy to have the proxy marriage.  It also tends to support father&#8217;s case that the proxy marriage was agreed.  Certainly it would be surprising if the immigration advisers had not discussed the matter with mother, since it was they presumably who had to prepare the documentation for signing in connection with the proxy marriage.</p>

Mr Porter argued that the question of criminal liability was not determinative of the issue for me.  In a case under Children Act 1989, the welfare of the child is always paramount.  It was only where a parent was able to show some particular cultural norm permitting corporal punishment that the Court should consider physical chastisement to be in the best interests of the child.  Here, he argued, father did not attempt to justify his hitting his son on the basis that this was in accordance with the Nigerian norms.  (The father denied that physical punishment of children was normal and acceptable in Nigeria, but I do not necessarily accept his evidence on this.)  Accordingly, Mr Porter argued, the Court should find that father had not acted in Enitan&#8217;s best interests when he smacked him with the slider.  Alternatively, this was a matter which CAFCASS should be asked to consider.</p>

It may well be that, if the Court had to determine whether Enitan should live with his mother or his father, the fact that he might be the subject of physical chastisement in the latter environment was a matter which would stand to be taken into account, possibly in a decisive way.  However, the fact which I have to determine is whether father inflicted physical abuse on Enitan or not.  If the chastisement was lawful, as I have found it to be, in my judgment it does not &#8212; and cannot &#8212; amount to physical abuse.  Parliament has, as recently as 2004, decided that the infliction of reasonable physical chastisement on a child falls within the wide bounds of acceptable parental practice.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The finding of fact sought in relation to physical abuse of mother involves one incident on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2020.  It is, however, important to see this incident in context.  Both Frances and Gillian say that mother suffered from unstable personality disorder.  There is no doubt that mother did periodically become extremely angry with father.  The cause of this was frequently mother&#8217;s perception that father was receiving messages from other women.  Whether this was or was not the case, and whether her suspicions of his faithfulness were justified or not, were not matters explored in evidence.  On one occasion, her jealousy resulted in her taking Enitan and Frances in her car in the early hours of the morning with the intention of waiting outside a nightclub some two hours&#8217; drive away to see whether father left with a woman or not.  (In fact, after driving a significant distance she turned around and did not carry out the plan.)  </p>

She saw that he had received a message from a friend of Harriett, called [redacted].  Father came into the room.  Mother admitted in cross-examination that she had slammed her wineglass down, so that it smashed.  Father says that she then held the broken glass to his throat.  Larry, whose bedroom was opposite, reported this at school the following day.  (The school noted this as being a broken bottle which mother held to father&#8217;s neck, but nothing in my judgment turns on this.)  The school reported the matter to social services, who investigated but did not take the matter further.  Mother denied having held the glass to him, but I do not accept her denial.  (She also says that father was going to hit her after she had broken the glass, but instead by accident hit Kevin who had come into the room, as father was moving his fist back to punch her.  There is no evidence other than hers of this and I do not accept this improbable account of Kevin being struck either.)</p>

There is a substantial degree of common ground.  Father told mother he was going to Peterborough.  This was in the middle of the national Covid lockdown.  Mother was unhappy with his doing this.  She initially tried to prevent him entering the house in order to collect his money, but he forced his way in.  When he was upstairs, mother locked the front door so he could not leave.  Father telephoned the police.  He then went downstairs.  The father denied that he had assaulted mother.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;During lockdown, the Applicant said he had to go out to see some people.  The Respondent explained that he couldn&#8217;t go out due to the dangers it could cause to Enitan and Larry&#8217;s health conditions however he said he was going anyway.  The Applicant walked out of the front door so the Respondent told him he can stay in Peterborough because he is not putting the children in danger and so she shut the door.  Seconds later the Applicant pushed down on the door handle very hard and slammed the door open and went upstairs to get his money.  The Respondent told him he was not leaving.  The Applicant called the police on the Respondent saying she won&#8217;t let him out, so they dispatched a unit.  The Applicant tried to get out the front door; however the Respondent locked the door and told him that he can stay and wait for the police and tell them why he rang, which made him very angry.  He pushed the Respondent near the door way of the living room door and at this point he was in the living room and the Respondent was stood in the doorway.  I took the keys out of the door so he could not get out as I knew the police were coming.  The Applicant grabbed the Respondent&#8217;s hair and hit her head off of the door to get past her.  I screamed at the Applicant and told him not to touch the Respondent; he went and sat on the stairs.  The Police arrived and one of them took the Respondent into the living room and another stood at the bottom of the stairs whilst the Applicant was sat on them.  After hearing both sides to the story, the police asked the Applicant to leave the property and he said he was not leaving unless the Respondent got arrested.  The police explained she would not be getting arrested so he refused to move.  The police arrested the Applicant and escorted him out of the building.  As he stood up from the stairs, he punched the banister, making it shake.&#8221;</p>

However, it is important to note that mother hitting her head on the door (or door-frame: the police report at E6 suggests it was a cupboard) does not appear to be deliberate.  The account mother gave to Harriett later was that father was trying to move her out of the way albeit roughly by grabbing her hair, which was how her head hit the side of the door-frame.  There was no mark on her head.  The hitting of her head occurred as he was trying to get out of the house.  The mother had no business preventing him from leaving.</p>

One of these myths is the erroneous view that a rape victim will shout and scream whilst being raped: see the Crown Court Compendium (June 2023) Part I section 20-01 (Sexual offences &#8212; the dangers of assumptions).  Mr Porter submitted that this was relevant in accessing mother&#8217;s evidence that (whereas she had not previously) she now understood that she had been raped.  However, in my judgment this rape myth would not cause a rape victim herself not to believe she had been raped because she did not shout and scream.
