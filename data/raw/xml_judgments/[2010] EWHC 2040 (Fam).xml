	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in">Two children, with their mother, relocated permanently to Canada with the father&#8217;s consent in January 2009. In the order which records the father&#8217;s consent to relocation, the parties agreed that issues of contact should  continue to be dealt with in the English courts, and there were other provisions arguably relevant to the question of jurisdiction.  Difficulties have now arisen in relation to contact; the mother has unilaterally and ex parte obtained an order in Canada varying the contact arrangement in the English court order; and the father now not only wishes the original contact order to be reinstated and/or enforced in the English courts, but wishes to seek a residence order and an order for the children&#8217;s return to this jurisdiction. The mother concedes that the English court has jurisdiction in relation to contact, but says that it should not exercise it, and that the proceedings in this jurisdiction should be stayed. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in">The jurisdictional issues came before me in the context of a directions hearing only but in the light of the issues involved and my limited sitting on circuit I decided, on invitation by the parties&#8217; representatives, that I should deal with the issue of jurisdiction of the Courts, and, if I concluded that this Court did have jurisdiction in relation to any of the issues, should proceed to give directions for an early hearing of the matter.  I originally reserved judgment from Tuesday to Friday in order to consider my decision and my reasons, and to fix the case for the convenience of Counsel.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in">In the meantime I took the opportunity of speaking to the Liaison Judge for the court where the mother had obtained her order in Canada. As a result of my discussions with Justice Moen, and because I had concluded that I needed further help with the interrelationship between the Council Regulation and our domestic law, I decided in the event that I would not give judgment on the day originally set but would reserve further in order for further communications to take place with Canada, and to receive further submissions from counsel. Those submissions were then delayed and as a result it was not possible for me to deliver judgment until three weeks after the original hearing, after I had left circuit.. In the meantime I had, with the parties&#8217; agreement, reserved a two day hearing slot before the local Cicuit Judge in August 2010, at a time when the mother and the children are due to be in England. </p>

The parents separated and divorced some time before 2005 and the children remained making their permanent home with their mother although there was no residence order.  An order for contact was made by a Circuit Judge on 6 October 2005, which provided for overnight staying contact with the father.  There were a number of stipulations in that order, indicating that there was perceived conflict between the parents as to how the children should be managed and a degree of anxiety on the part of the mother.  N has health problems and this may be the backdrop to the mother&#8217;s anxiety.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in">By 2008 the mother had decided to marry Mr D and they wished to make a new life for themselves in Canada.  Father says that his understanding was that the proposals were for a temporary move only, but that is not how I read the mother&#8217;s position.  The mother applied for an order permitting her to relocate. The father was extremely concerned about what this would mean for the children.  Mother said that her fianc&#233; had obtained employment as a Senior Project Manager in Alberta and that she was not intending to work and would be a full time mother.  The father in his statements was concerned about the mother&#8217;s true commitment to contact and the extent to which the mother&#8217;s proposals for a move to Canada were properly thought out and would provide a stable background.   He set out a number of stipulations as pre-conditions to any potential removal.  He wanted there to be a minimum of three two- week returns to this jurisdiction, no attempts to change the children&#8217;s names, full contact details of schools and treating physicians, uninterrupted &#8220;ring fenced webcam contact&#8221;, the immediate return of the children if mother was seriously ill or died, a return to the UK if there was any long term deterioration of N&#8217;s medical condition and confirmation from the mother and her fianc&#233; that there were no relevant criminal or civil proceedings in relation to him in Canada.  He stipulated that if there was evidence that the children no longer wished to remain in Canada at any stage, he would bring proceedings for residence within this jurisdiction.</p>

She said that the length of the children&#8217;s Easter holidays did not permit a trip to England.  She agreed to fund all three contacts.  There was also to be weekly web cam contact.</p>

It was directed that mother was to provide for the cost of the children&#8217;s flights for contact outside Canada and for the father&#8217;s flights to Canada.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in">To put it as neutrally as possible, this order has never settled down.  The parties give different accounts as to why and blame one another.  There are usually two sides to every story and I should not, and in any event am unable at this stage, to resolve any of the differences particularly since question marks arise on both sides as a result of their filed evidence.  The father&#8217;s case is that mother has been obstructive and the mother&#8217;s case is that father has not taken up all the contact.  The children went to Canada with their mother and her fianc&#233; in January 2009.  The first Easter holiday did not take place.  Father says that the flight tickets which were booked by mother in advance allowed him only four hours in Canada.  The mother accepts that the dates were wrong on the first ticket but says that she eventually put it right.  Father says she did not do so.  I do not know who is right about this. The children came to England in the summer of 2009 but father says that the mother said that the children needed to settle down before the visit and there were other things she wanted to do with them so the visit in fact was only 10 days rather than a fortnight. In the light of mother's subsequent statement, I think he is likely to be right about this.  Mother says that the father cut off the maintenance and I am not entirely clear what father&#8217;s response is.  Father says that mother was obstructive with telephone calls and web cam contact; mother says he did not take this up.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in">On 4 September 2009 the mother made an application to the Court in Canada, which she says that she had been contemplating since June 2009, although she had not told the father about either her intention or her application.  She sought to reduce the frequency of contact. She swore an affidavit on 4 September 2009 in which she said she sought a &#8220;single&#8221; return each year, removing the Christmas contact. She said that she could not afford two return visits, and that the children needed to spend time with other family members in the UK and to recover from jet lag before visiting their father for 14 days, and that this did not leave sufficient annual leave for her. She said that the children were too young to travel unattended and that the arrangements did not leave over any vacation time in Canada, or to provide care during school holidays or if the children were ill. She said that there were no objections to the father visiting the children at Christmas in Canada at his own cost. She said that the father had stopped paying child maintenance and that this contributed to her need to return to work. She agreed to continue funding the father&#8217;s Easter visit, but since he had not taken up an earlier visit she wanted the order changed so that he would purchase the ticket and she would reimburse him. The statement asked for an order for &#8220;substitutional service&#8221; on the father since she could not serve him personally.</p>

At the hearing before me the mother&#8217;s counsel told me that the hearing on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2009 was simply for an order for substituted service.  However, the transcript of the hearing does not support that contention.  The mother was represented by Mr Tkachuk, the duty counsel. Mr Tkachuk told the Judge that there was an order in the UK,  that father had stopped paying maintenance, that mother now had a job only giving her 2 &#8211; 3 weeks&#8217; holiday a year, and that she could not afford to pay for flights.  Mother told the Judge that father had failed to come to Canada for Easter 2009.  Mr Tkachuk told the Judge &#8220;the problem is there is a term in the order &#8211;" and then showed Justice Manderscheid the District Judge&#8217;s order.  The Judge said &#8220;well, with all due respect, paragraph number one literally just takes the Hague convention and throws it out the window, and I question whether or not this particular Judge or Justice, the District Judge is aware of exactly what he has done&#8230;.. I mean if that is the case, he has overruled international law. &#8230;..now if I am incorrect, then I would take it then, unfortunately, the applicant will have to take the matter up then with the UK court.  But in the interval, I am going to assume that this court has jurisdiction and I will grant the order.  And if the other party wants to dispute it and not be - not abide by it, well, then they can take the matter up in the UK, unfortunately, but in the meantime, I will grant that order, and hopefully&#8230;...&#8221;. Mr Tkachuk then went on to outline what it was that the mother was proposing and the Judge acceded to the mother&#8217;s application and an order was made in the following terms:-</p>

In Box 3, detailing why he was making the application, the father referred to the orders of 2008 and asserted that the mother had failed to comply with the Court order and had made a further application in Canada.  He continued &#8220;the change of circumstances to be reviewed plus if the Court deems necessary make further rulings&#8221;. The matter came before the District Judge on 11 May 2010, who transferred the matter to be heard by Mrs Justice Eleanor King on 18 May 2010. At that hearing Eleanor King J declared that &#8220;that in accordance with the agreements and terms recorded in the consent order made in the Altringham County Court on 10 October 2008, the High Court of England and Wales shall retain jurisdiction in relation to the said children pending the determination of any application to this Court by the respondent mother that Canada is the proper jurisdiction in relation to any applications in relation to the welfare of the said children or further order&#8221;. She adjourned the application by the father to order the return of the children to the jurisdiction of England and Wales (it by then being apparent that that was what he was seeking) and enforcement of the 10 October 2008 for further directions to be heard before me on 22 June 2010; ordered that the father file a statement by 1 June 2010 and the mother reply by 11 June 2010; provided that service by e.mail should be adequate service on the mother, and provided for a Court bundle.  The father was at that stage acting in person. The mother then made e-mail representations to me asking me to adjourn the hearing on 22 June until August 2010 when she was due to be in England with the children.  She then instructed solicitors, who told me that they were in the process of drafting a statement, and did not seek an adjournment but sought an extension of time to file her affidavit.  I gave a short extension, directed mother to attend the hearing, and for the avoidance of doubt refused to adjourn it.</p>

She told me that she had reviewed the order of Justice Manderscheid and the letter from Queen&#8217;s Bench legal counsel dated 22 September 2009. Justice Manderscheid was away and she had not managed to speak to him. She hoped to do so the following week. She had not seen the transcript of the hearing of 4 September 2009. She told me that the application had come into the morning family chambers list. She assumed that the mother must by then have been in person since duty counsel spoke for her. Justice Moen&#8217;s initial impression was that this had been an ex parte order, and, if so, legal counsel was wrong in stating that the only remedy was appeal. She confirmed (that as in this jurisdiction), the remedy of a party aggrieved by an ex parte order is to apply to the court of first instance rather than to appeal. The father might be able to apply for the order to be set aside. She would investigate and get back to me. She also told me that the Canadian court offers the facility for judges to communicate by video conference. Furthermore the father could participate in Canadian proceedings by video link. There is no equivalent of Cafcass or other court support at superior level. In some cases a psychologist can be instructed. This would be likely to cost between C$18,000 and $30,000. She offered to continue to communicate with me and I gratefully accepted. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1.29in"><span style="font-family:GillSansMT-Italic">&#8220;In my judgment the fundamental approach to this should be objective; what inference should be drawn from the mother's litigation conduct? The answer to that is clear: complete acceptance. Then one should ask whether a failure to address the question of challenge vitiates what otherwise appears to be an unequivocal acceptance. I do not think it does. This case demonstrates a clear acceptance of the Northampton County Court's jurisdiction at least until late July 2006 by which time on any basis the court must be seised of the matter. Accordingly it is then too late to object. In my judgment the evidence demonstrates an unequivocal participation in the proceedings and thus an acceptance of the jurisdiction. I do not think that the absence (as I am prepared to accept it was) of advice on her right to object should vitiate the unequivocal acceptance otherwise established. I am glad to reach that view in this case as questions of jurisdiction should be resolved at the outset of a case and not on the eve of a final hearing. That point of policy also fortifies my view that the court should be looking at what the parties have actually done rather than the reasons (or lack of them) for doing it, absent, of course, fraud or misrepresentation.&#8221;</span></p>

First, it is clear that it does not refer to acceptance of the jurisdiction in relation to matrimonial proceedings alone. It must refer to jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility. Second, the emphasis is on the acceptance of jurisdiction "expressly" or "in an unequivocal manner." This must mean that acceptance of jurisdiction of a court other than that of the child's habitual residence is not lightly to be inferred, and that the paradigm case will be actual agreement by the parents at the time the matrimonial proceedings are instituted.&#8221;</p>

The father&#8217;s application at that point was primarily for enforcement of the order for contact of 20 November 2008. I do not accept that it is the effective application in respect of which the mother must unequivocally signify acceptance. But in fact the mother in her Originating Summons dated 17 June 2010 expressly proposed that issues in relation to contact shall be resolved in the UK, and Miss Woodard accepted, certainly at the outset of the proceedings before me, that this court had jurisdiction in relation to contact, although she submitted that the court should not exercise it.

Miss Heaton argues that once there is acceptance of jurisdiction in relation to one aspect of parental responsibility, then this acceptance must be construed to be to all aspects of parental responsibility. She points to the wording of Article 12. I note a distinction between the wording of Articles 12.1 and 12.3: Article 12.1 states that "The Courts of a Member State shall have jurisdiction in any matter relating to parental responsibility&#8221; as opposed to the wording of Article 12.3 &#8220;shall also have jurisdiction in relation to parental responsibility in proceedings other than those referred to in Article 12.1&#8221;.</p>

I can understand that the mother might think that she would be more likely to persuade a London judge of the benefits of the move to English residence and education but the Spanish judge should take that decision having at her reach all the evidence as to the well settled history and as to the children's achievements in their current environment. It would in my opinion create a most unhelpful precedent if a court exercising divorce jurisdiction, exceptionally and transiently seised with jurisdiction in matters relating to parental responsibility, were to issue an order permitting a parent to leave the jurisdiction of the child's habitual residence without any involvement of the courts of the children's long settled residence.&#8221;</p>

At the moment it is unquestionably in the children&#8217;s best interests for contact to be considered here. The parents have each agreed that course, and the Canadian court has now unequivocally accepted that the father may apply to the English Court.

Important evidence may need to be obtained from the children&#8217;s schools, from her employers, and from people who know and see the children, even if evidence is not to be obtained from an independent professional witness who has seen the children on their home ground. If there is to be an independently instructed social worker or a Cafcass officer, here, that is evidence that could be adduced in any Canadian proceedings.

If, for instance, Judge Newton endorses the contact regime imposed by the mother, then the father&#8217;s proposed residence application will be seen in a different light than if the judge takes a strong view that the mother had behaved wrongly.  I do not see any reason in principle why the &#8220;best interests&#8221; consideration in Article 12.3 is set in stone for all time, in contrast to seisin and acceptance.

The parties will be able to advance informed reasons why one jurisdiction is better than the other after the contact decision has been made.

The Explanatory Note states that the purpose of the Regulations was to amend domestic law &#8220;so as to make it consistent with, and clarify its relationship to, Brussels II Revised, the changes being necessary to amend inconsistent provisions of national law&#8221;.  The Explanatory Note continues that the amendments &#8220;also make it clear that when considering the jurisdiction in England and Wales and Northern Ireland that the Council Regulations needs to be considered before domestic jurisdiction is looked at.&#8221; I read that as confirming that the first question to look at is whether Brussels II Revised applies. </p>

She draws from that the proposition that the court ought not to exercise jurisdiction save in conformity with the child&#8217;s habitual residence. These are arguments in my view which go to the exercise rather than the existence of jurisdiction, where it is not explicitly based on habitual residence. </p>

That does not seem to have been the approach of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Re I,</span> but the court was not referred to the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/42" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 42</ref>.

In the light of the Explanatory Note to the Rules introducing the amendments consequent on Brussels II Revised, a purposive construction of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/2/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 2 (1)</ref> (b) (i) would support an interpretation of the provisions bringing it into line with the provisions of Brussels II Revised, and away from the UK based &#8220;continuing proceedings&#8221; jurisdiction. The time frame of the revoked FPR 2.40 is similar to the time frame for continuing jurisdiction based on divorce in Brussels II and Article 12 of Brussels II Revised. In my judgment to fall within the residual jurisdiction there must be proximity between the divorce proceedings and the court being asked to determine a question of making an order in relation to children. In any case it may be that essentially the same application or issue has been before the court, unresolved, for some time, but once an order has been made, then in my view the connection with the matrimonial proceedings would terminate. </p>

Miss Heaton says that the mother&#8217;s application should have properly have been presented as  an application to vary or discharge the existing contact order coupled with an application for leave to remove from the jurisdiction,  and was thus an application within the original matrimonial proceedings.
