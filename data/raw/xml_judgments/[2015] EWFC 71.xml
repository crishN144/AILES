The local authority commenced care proceedings the same month (DO12C00164). A finding of fact hearing took place in the County Court before His Honour Judge Bond in December 2012. His judgment is dated 3 January 2013. He found that the fracture was inflicted &#8220;by either the mother or the father, the other parent failing to protect M&#8221; but that &#8220;it is not possible to determine which of the two parents was responsible.&#8221; The care proceedings concluded on 15 November 2013 when Judge Bond made a 12 month supervision order and a special guardianship order in favour of one of the mother&#8217;s relatives.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Article 6 provides an absolute right to a fair trial. That right cannot be diluted.

In other words, this is <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>a case in which the application to set aside the supervision order and the special guardianship order is founded on some subsequent change of circumstance. It is founded on the fact &#8211; now established to the satisfaction of the original trial judge &#8211; that the mother was denied a fair trial of the original proceedings. In other words, the matter now before Judge Bond is not application BH14C00470; it is the substantive proceedings in DO12C00164.</p>

And, as he correctly points out, given the basis on which Judge Bond has decided to proceed, the new trial will necessarily involve a fresh and complete re-hearing of the local authority&#8217;s case on &#8216;threshold&#8217;, in relation to which, in accordance with <span style="font-style:italic">Re ZZ and others </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2014/9" uk:canonical="[2014] EWFC 9" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWFC 9</ref>, the burden of proof will be on the local authority.
