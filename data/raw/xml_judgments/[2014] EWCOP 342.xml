Few decisions are as significant as the decision about whether to have major surgery.  For the doctors, it can be difficult to know what recommendation to make.  For the patient, the decision about whether to accept or reject medical advice involves weighing up the risks and benefits according to the patient's own system of values against a background where diagnosis and prognosis are rarely certain, even for the doctors.  Such decisions are intensely personal.  They are taken in stressful circumstances.  There are no right or wrong answers.  The freedom to choose for oneself is a part of what it means to be a human being.</span></p>

The decision does not have to be justified to anyone.  In the absence of consent any invasion of the body will be a criminal assault.  The fact that the intervention is well-meaning or therapeutic makes no difference.</span></p>

Accordingly, interim measures aside, the power to intervene only arises after it is has been proved that the person concerned lacks capacity.

That would be to put the cart before the horse or, expressed another way, to allow the tail of welfare to wag the dog of capacity.  Any tendency in this direction risks infringing the rights of that group of persons who, though vulnerable, are capable of making their own decisions.  Many who suffer from mental illness are well able to make decisions about their medical treatment, and it is important not to make unjustified assumptions to the contrary. </span></p>

Between the beginning of June and the end of July, she was treated in hospital for an infection in the left foot.  While there, she acquired an infection and became seriously unwell.  Ultimately, this resolved, as did the condition of her left foot, and she was discharged.  However, by August the condition of her right foot had deteriorated to the extent that it had become gangrenous.  Medical advice was that it could not be saved and that auto-amputation was the best option.  This means that the foot would become mummified and would in time separate itself from the leg by natural processes.  </span></p>

During this time, she was also suspected to have cancer of the bladder.  There were discussions about whether she should have an amputation of her right leg to prevent the spread of gangrene and potentially life-threatening infection.  JB did not agree to this and doubt was expressed about whether she had capacity to decide.  A number of opinions were expressed, some doctors considering that she lacked capacity and others that she was simply making what was seen as an unwise decision.  On one particular day, a clinical psychologist who considered the issue in the morning and again in the afternoon reached opposite conclusions.  Another consultant psychiatrist, Dr B, was unable to decide either way.  Her community psychiatrist, Dr O, reported on 21 October that: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">"There is evidence that Chronic Schizophrenia can impact on decision making and other cognitive functions.  She is able to understand and retain information regarding proposed treatments however her ability to weigh information appears to be compromised.  She has a long-standing pattern of coping with minimisation and historically underplays the concerns raised by clinicians about her health.  Currently she reckons that if she continues to dress her foot then healing might occur but was unable to clearly show that she had considered the option of possible worsening sepsis and death.  She mentioned that she would rather not think about these issues.  She also said that everyone would die at some point&#8230;"</span></p>

Her right foot was now entirely mummified and by the end of January it had come off, leaving an unresolved wound.  Once again, the advice of the surgeons was that an amputation was necessary to allow the wound to be closed and to prevent it becoming infected.  JB continued to refuse consent for this on some occasions, though she expressed agreement on others.  Indeed, on 4 February she signed a consent form.  Once again, doubts were expressed about her capacity, with no clear conclusion being reached.  An example is the report of Dr B, who assessed JB on 14 January and concluded that </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">&#8220;I am of the opinion that one needs to be certain of her capacity to consent or refuse the proposed intervention&#8230; However one cannot say with certainty she lacks capacity.&#8221;  </span><span style="font-size:12pt">It was again agreed that an application would be made to the Court of Protection.</span></p>

At different times, it has been suggested that there should be amputation below the knee, through the knee or above the knee.  Each option has important consequences in relation to the process of rehabilitation and the possibility of the patient walking in future.  At the outset of this hearing the Trust's position was that a through-knee operation should be approved, but this then changed to a recommendation for a below-knee operation.  It is to be noted that the consent form signed by JB only two days before the proceedings began had covered an above-knee operation.  The relevance of all of this is that the attempts to assess her capacity have taken place against a background of shifting medical opinion.</span></p>

He refused consent to that treatment but allowed conservative treatment and his condition improved. However, the hospital refused to give an undertaking that the leg would not be amputated at some future time.

Surgically, her position is better now than it had been in October in that she is not currently suffering from any infection.  As matters now stand, it is Mr Collin's opinion that a below-knee amputation is the only sensible clinical decision to make, but if JB does not want this there would be no compelling reason to seek to persuade her otherwise.  A substantial risk of infection with possibly life-threatening consequences in the longer term undoubtedly exists and the medical advice from any surgeon in the land would be clear, but she does not have to take it.  Apart from anything else, the greater short-term risks arise from remaining in hospital with the risk of infection and from the small but not insignificant possibility of a major adverse consequence from surgery of this kind.</span></p>

He accepted that the assessment of mental illness was outside his remit but said that he was well qualified to assess the capacity of patients to consent to operations.  I agree.  All doctors and many non-medical professionals (for example, social workers and solicitors) have to assess capacity at one time or another.  Bearing in mind JB&#8217;s longstanding mental illness it is entirely appropriate that the core assessment of her capacity comes from psychiatrists, but other disciplines also have an important contribution to make.      </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The combined and complementary evidence of Dr Prabhakaran and Mr Collin provides powerful confirmation that JB has the ability to understand, retain and weigh and use the necessary information about the nature, purpose and effects of the proposed treatment.  I accept the view of Dr Prabhakaran that JB&#8217;s schizophrenia is relevant to the way in which she decides, and not to her capacity to decide.  Her tendency at times to be uncommunicative or avoidant and to minimise the risks of inaction are understandable human ways of dealing with her predicament and do not amount to incapacity. </span></p>

Further, her analysis demands more of JB than the law requires.  It is not for JB to understand everything, or to prove anything.  Dr O among others has perfectly properly raised questions about JB&#8217;s capacity, but her evidence does no more than that and does not discharge the burden upon the Trust.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">I do not accept the Trust&#8217;s submission that incapacity can be deduced from isolated instances of eccentric reasoning on the part of JB: for example, agreeing to intravenous antibiotics or blood transfusion but refusing the necessary cannulation.   I also reject the submission that those who conclude that JB does not lack capacity have failed to grapple with the facts that (i) she undoubtedly lacks capacity in relation to treatment for her mental illness and (ii) she has lacked capacity in relation to surgical treatment in the past and (iii) she has changed her position from refusal of all surgery to a willingness to contemplate an operation of some kind, a situation calling for investigation.  As to the first element, as has already been said, there is no necessary correlation between a lack of insight into schizophrenia and incapacity to decide about surgery.   The second element begs the question, in that it has not been established that JB has ever lacked capacity to decide about surgery.  Finally, the development in JB&#8217;s thinking about amputation was in my view well understood by Dr Prahakaran.  Insofar as it calls for any explanation, her view has evolved over time in a way that is consistent with her mental state.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">Nor do I accept the Official Solicitor&#8217;s submission that the issue is whether JB has the capacity to consent to a below-knee amputation as opposed to operations no longer proposed by the Trust, i.e. through-knee or above-knee amputations.  As explained above, what is required is an understanding of the nature, purpose and effects of the proposed treatment.  In this sense &#8216;the proposed treatment&#8217; is surgical treatment for a potentially gangrenous limb, and is not limited to one of the possible operations.  Treating each type of amputation as different is an impractical and unnecessary distinction that would diminish the scope of JB&#8217;s capacity and potentially lead to unprofitable reassessments with every change in the treatment programme.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">My conclusion is that JB undoubtedly has a disturbance in the functioning of her mind in the form of paranoid schizophrenia (as to which she lacks insight), but that it has not been established that she thereby lacks the capacity to make a decision about surgery for herself.  On the contrary, the evidence establishes that she does have capacity to decide whether to undergo an amputation of whatever kind.  She now appears to be open to having the below-knee operation that the doctors recommend.  Whether she has it will be a matter for her to decide for herself with the support of those around her. </span></p>
