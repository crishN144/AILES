	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">This is an interlocutory hearing in respect of a woman SK, now in her 30s, who it is agreed lacks capacity.  Proceedings were started by the local authority, the London Borough of Ealing, in June 2007 seeking declarations in respect of her capacity and injunctive relief against her family.  A seven day final hearing is listed in March 2008.  I am asked to determine two issues.  The first is whether SK should return to her mother&#8217;s home on a trial period before the final hearing next year.  The second matter is in relation to an extensive report by an independent social worker, Ms Walshe.  A request is made by her mother for a second social worker report as a paper exercise to begin with.  Both those proposals are opposed.  </p>

I announced at the end of submissions on the first point that I did not propose to authorise the trial period.  I heard argument on other issues which do not require a judgment.  Only my reasons for my earlier decision on the first point and my decision and reasons in relation to the second point now remain.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The background is complex.  Papers already fill five lever arch files.  Inevitably I have not been taken to much of that which is set out in them, but it may suffice if I set out the matter to this extent.  SK is the third defendant and represented by the Official Solicitor.  The first defendant KS, is her mother.  The ages of the parties, save that of the mother, is not clear.  She is 78 years of age.  SR, the fifth defendant is about 40.  LU, the second defendant, is about 38.  SK is either 32 or 36 years of age, and MHAS, the fourth defendant, is 30.  The parties have all been represented before me.  The second, fourth and fifth defendants are SK&#8217;s sisters.</p>

Whether all the sisters should be represented at the final hearing I have directed to be considered further at a directions hearing in January.  </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">It appears that the mother came to the UK from Afghanistan in 1990.  The sisters followed her within a few years.  SK was living with her mother at first.  She had a series of relationships with men.  In May 1997 she gave birth to a daughter.  She had herself to be admitted to hospital and her daughter was placed with foster parents.  Tragically her daughter died at the age of 10 months.  </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">SK then had a two year relationship with a man of whom the majority of the family disapproved.  As a result, SK had no contact with them.  She was in hospital on several occasions because of depression.  She obtained a flat.  In 2003 SK went to Afghanistan or Pakistan and married a nephew of the mother.  Whether the mother received financial reward as a result is in dispute.  </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">SK returned to the UK without her husband.  She was living on her own with support from LU in April 2005.  About November 2005 it seems that SK married a Mr A.  It was said to have been an abusive relationship.  There is an allegation that LU profited from this marriage, but that is likewise denied.  There are allegations of financial misuse of SK&#8217;s funds by her family in 2000 and in 2006.  The police, it seems, are investigating this matter.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">In November 2006, SR says she found SK at LU&#8217;s flat on her own.  She took her to her own home.  She remained there until May 2007 when LU took SK back to her own flat.  This brought matters to a head.  There had been local authority involvement between about 1999 and 2001.  The closing report at that time recorded that there were huge family issues and conflicts with conflicting and false information from the family.  These are issues which have reoccurred since.  </p>

At about this time, there was a confrontation, according to SK, with MHAS over money.  She alleged that her sister and brother-in-law assaulted her.  The police were involved.  Case conferences and visits followed.  </p>

SR, for her part, said that LU had kidnapped SK when she took her back to her home in May 2007.  The police were informed and sought a place of safety order.  She was placed with MHAS.</p>

The same day the local authority started these proceedings and obtained an order from Black J.

She reported that, following her assessment, she did not believe that SK had the ability to express her true wishes and feelings.  She went on:</p>

		      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.98in">&#8220;It is clearly evident from her past history that she has been manipulated with regards to her personal life, as well as financial matters.  It was also evident from the assessment that she is easily suggestible.  When asked about her understanding of marriage she said that her mother had arranged her previous marriages, but she lacked the concept of marriage and believed that it meant the presence of a husband.  She had no understanding of a sexual relationship, including its affects and implications.  She is incapable of understanding the consequences of marriage or to plan for her future.  She is unable to give informed consent for marriage.&#8221;</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">In September 2007, when the mother's proposals for a trial period were before the court, the Official Solicitor indicated his reasons for opposing them.  They were, in brief, the unresolved allegations against KS of maltreatment and exploitation of SK, the significant level of conflict within SK&#8217;s family, the difficulty in the family of engaging in a collaborative approach to secure SK&#8217;s best interests, the lack of understanding within the family of mental illness and of the nature of learning disability, and the reasons given by Ms Walshe, an independent social worker, to which I shall shortly come.  They have remained the main grounds upon which the Official Solicitor and the local authority have opposed the trial period.</p>

	      <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		  <level>
		    <content>
		      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.98in">&#8220;SK is suffering from a mental illness within the meaning of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>.  This illness has been diagnosed in the past as schizophrenia or depression.  As outlined above, I consider it most likely that SK has a schizo-effective disorder.  In SK&#8217;s case, her illness is characterised by prominent mood symptoms, auditory hallucinations, often of her dead daughter&#8217;s voice, and paranoid ideas and paranoid delusions about her family matters.  <marker name="tab"/>From that record it appears that most of the time she has some degree of symptoms.  Her insight into her illness and treatment is limited and in the past she has refused to accept appropriate treatment.  SK has a lifelong history of learning disability which, in her case, has at times been accompanied by seriously aggressive and irresponsible behaviour.&#8221;</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Later in her report, she concurred with the view of Ms Walshe that SK should not reside with any of her family at the present time.  </p>

	      <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		  <level>
		    <content>
		      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.98in">&#8220;It is clear that there is a great deal of affection and love between the mother and SK and they would both enjoy each other&#8217;s company.  SK is saying that she would Like to live with her mother.  The issue of a woman in her 30s living with her mother are both positive and negative.  If it is a good relationship, it can be beneficial to both parties.  However, if they have different views about how things should be done and what is in each other&#8217;s best interests, as is evident in this case, then this would lead to a limitation in SK&#8217;s ability to grow as an adult. </p>

		  <level>
		    <content>
		      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.98in">It is my belief from observation and information gained from this assessment, that the mother would find the practical, physical and emotional aspects of caring for SK very hard work.  She has not cared for SK as an adult for more than a couple of days and has herself lived alone for many years, adapting for loss of privacy and the person living with you needing regular physical and emotional support, would be very difficult for anyone, let alone somebody who already needs her own support to manage in a community in which she is quite isolated.</p>

		    <content>
		      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.98in">The mother does have an understanding that SK has needs that her sisters do not have and that she has a mental illness and a learning disability.  However, my two sessions with her show that in my view she does not understand clearly what these mean for SK.  There are concerns about the mother&#8217;s ability to protect SK appropriately from dangers and how to support her to learn and develop her independent and community presence.&#8221;</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">She highlighted various issues of concerns.  There was the mother&#8217;s ability to protect SK from the ill-attentions of her sisters, which she feels is other people&#8217;s responsibility.  Her current accommodation is not suitable for two adult females who need their own bedrooms.  Social integration is limited.  With regard to learning, the mother would look to others to address this, and other for domestic chores, did not seem to regard herself as a learning resource.  The mother is not able to say what she would do as a mother in a difficult situation and she would transfer parenting tasks to social services.</p>

Of course I would accept any advice that may be offered by the experts or other professionals now involved in SK&#8217;s care and am very happy to be monitored.  I have always been aware that SK has a limited understanding of her surroundings, and does not always know what she wants.

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Miss Weereratne pointed to the stability achieved in the conflictual situation since the local authority took proceedings as compared to SK&#8217;s position before.  The mother did not appreciate the emotional and psychological harm occurring to SK before that intervention.  Now there was non-conflictual contact taking place.  SK was vulnerable and suggestible, and were she to return, she would once more be in the middle of a conflicting and conflictual situation.  The evidence showed that there was no co-operation between the members of the family, and they were playing off one against another.  </p>

The night time arrangements had been improved and SK had in any event progressed and could now do as she was informed.  Education of the family had started.  She pointed to Ms Crommelin&#8217;s assessment in particular.  That was based upon meeting the mother and not factoring in the concerning background and history which has to be understood in relation to the whole application.</p>

He pointed to the background of volatility, where SK was not protected from her own inclinations, and there was no reason to think that the mother could now protect her when she had not done so before.  With so much unresolved and the mother&#8217;s questionable ability to protect SK, and the family at war with itself, it was not in SK&#8217;s best interests to place her within the family, even on a trial basis.  There was also the inadequate premises which the mother had.</p>

I cannot conclude that a trial period for SK with her mother is in her best interests.  There are a series of reasons for this to be found in those reports and in the arguments presented to me.  In particular I refer to the 22 burdens I set out from Ms Walshe&#8217;s report.  </p>

She had had little contact herself with her daughter other than her staying with her for some two weeks in January 2007.

The prospect for continued conflict is manifest, not only in the matters to which I have referred in the evidence, but in their statements which I have also read.  That conflict is bad for SK.  There is also a substantial question over whether the mother at her age can truly cope, even with support and assistance.  </p>

I can attach particular importance to conclusions when three professionals from two different disciplines reach the same ones.  They all start from the basis that the best place for an adult without capacity is within their own family.  There has to be a good reason for not recommending them being placed in such a setting.  Here, there are substantial grounds on a series of different fronts.  </p>

However, during the course of the first day, there was further detailed discussion between the local authority and Ms Walshe, which enabled her, in a further report (helpfully prepared overnight) to accept [a place] on the basis that she could not identify a more suitable permanent placement.</p>

There was, however, a need for stringent control of experts in children cases and a second medical report agreeing with the first one may of itself be of value in reducing or eliminating issues, (see <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">W v Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] 1 FLR 543" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] 1 FLR 543</ref> and <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re J (Care: assessment: fair trial</span>) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 1 FLR 77" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 1 FLR 77</ref>).  </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">In non-medical cases such as this, the position can be set out in this way.  (1) The court will look at the report itself and ask the following questions: does it appear either fundamentally flawed or biased in its approach; is it otherwise wrong, unbalanced or unfair?  If the answer to any one of these points is yes, then that may by itself be sufficient grounds to justify a second report.  If the answer is no, then the next question is the role played by the report.  Is it pivotal and can it be challenged without the need for a further expert report?  The answers to those questions may be determinative.  Finally, the impact of a further report on the timetable for the hearing may have to be considered.</p>

I hasten to say it does not mean that the report cannot be challenged successfully.  True it is that the benefits number 5 and the burdens number 22.

If there is substance in them, they may have varying degrees of importance, but it is not a pivotal report.  There are, and will be, more local authority reports on much the same ground.  Both can be readily challenged in cross-examination without the need for a further report and evidence can be called by the parties if necessary to refute quite a number of the points.  Finally, the presence of the Official Solicitor, acting in this matter on behalf of SK, is of particular assistance.  </p>
