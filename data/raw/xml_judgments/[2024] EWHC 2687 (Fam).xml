In that time he visited the children on a number of occasions, and, in 2023, agreed with the mother that the oldest children should go to Norway for a holiday.</span></p>

They did not return to England after the holiday, and the mother travelled to Norway to try and retrieve them. There was a scene at the home, the father called the police, and the mother had to leave. The authorities in Norway conducted an investigation, interviewing the oldest children about their allegation. A referral was made to Children&#8217;s Services in this country with respect to the two youngest children.  An assessment was carried out by them in April 2024 which concluded that, whilst there were concerns that the mother had used physical chastisement, home conditions were good, the mother had support from her family, and the children appeared to have a good relationship with her. The case was closed.</span></p>

He said he repeatedly asked the mother to return them and she would not. He says she also took them to Somalia without his consent. Whilst he acknowledges that the period of time which elapsed between the children coming here and the application brings the issue of settlement into play pursuant to Article 12, he argues that the children are not settled because of their experiences in the care of the mother.  In the alternative he submits that the court should decline to exercise its discretion to refuse a return. The Convention sets no time limit for applications and a summary return order should be made despite the length of time that has passed.</p>

He said that he tried many times (including by visiting the family) to persuade her to return the children but she refused. He felt helpless and did not report her to the authorities because he did not want to create a problem for the children.  In his oral evidence he said he had stopped asking the mother for the children&#8217;s return following their separation in 2021,  saying that it had taken him a long time to give up.</span></p>

He visited Somalia to try and persuade the mother to bring the children back, but she refused. He said he did not report her to the authorities or take action because he knew that there were no treaties between Norway and Somalia.   It was when she took the children to Somalia that the father said he again asked the mother to return the children to Norway and persisted in doing so when they came back to England.  The parties agreed that the older children should go for a holiday in Norway in the summer of 2023, and, when they made allegations to him of ill-treatment by their mother he became concerned. In his statement he said that the children refused to return.  The mother went to Norway to try and get the children, and he called the police.  The Norwegian Child Welfare Services became involved and interviewed the children. They are apparently waiting to interview the mother.  In his initial statement the father said &#8216;In the meantime, I am extremely concerned about [the children&#8217;s] well-being in England with the Respondent and respectfully seek their immediate return&#8217;.  He also stated that he was concerned the mother would remove them to Somalia with the children continuing to live an unstable life and continuing to be subjected to violence, not only at the hands of the mother, but in Somalian schools.</span></p>

In his oral evidence there were some things that he volunteered for the first time.

He said that this was the mother&#8217;s doing when he was away.  His evidence remained that the mother had bought tickets for herself and the children to come to England with money presumably provided to her by her mother, and that he had been given a return date of 17</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> August.</span></p>

What she said to the Guardian was consistent with what she said to this court.  She was adamant that it was at the father&#8217;s instigation that the family came to live in England in 2020, having given up the tenancy of their flat and telling the children&#8217;s schools that they would be leaving, albeit to go to schools in another part of Norway. Her evidence has always been that in the first instance it was the intention to go and live near her mother whilst the father found work in England, but that she could not find accommodation. She said that the father had phoned her from England just a few days before they left on 9</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> August and told her to come.</span></p>

In order to complete her enquiries the Guardian spoke to both the mother and father at length. She met both the children, joining the mother to collect them from school and seeing them at home afterwards. I will not set out all of her evidence here as it is clearly set out in the report. Suffice it to say she concluded that the children clearly identified their environment as their home, and that they have established school lives where they are considered to be well integrated and settled.  The children experienced school positively, conveyed close relationships with members of the extended family who lived locally. The Guardian said &#8216;the children&#8217;s day to day lives appear well-settled in England and there appears to be a good prospect of their circumstances remaining secure and stable&#8217;. Whilst taking into account the social work assessment of the children, the investigation by the Norwegian authorities and what the children have said about physical punishment her own observations were positive, with the children being relaxed, uninhibited and happy, with reciprocal displays of affection.</span></p>

Whilst she advised it is essential for the children to be given the opportunity to renew their relationships she was not of the view that this undermined her overall assessment of the children&#8217;s settlement.</span></p>

It has to be kept in mind that the settlement exception is intended to reflect welfare. The Article 12 settlement exception of all the exceptions is most welfare focused. The underlying purpose of the exception is to enable the court in furtherance of the welfare of the child to decline a summary return because imposing a summary return (i.e. without a more detailed consideration of welfare) might compound the harm caused by the original abduction by uprooting a child summarily from his by now familiar environment.</span></p>

It was part of a longer term plan that was accelerated when the mother could not find suitable accommodation for herself and the children near her mother whilst they waited for the father to make arrangements in England.</span></p>

That amounts to over three of the last four years, a very large proportion of their lives. Given their ages they have no memories of Norway. Their first language is English.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The father has sought to argue through Ms Wiseman that the children are not really settled in England. He states that they have lived a peripatetic existence, not knowing whether they are about to move from one place to another. He states that the move to Somalia, the introduction of a new stepfather, and ill-treatment by their mother will have prevented them from becoming settled in psychological or physical terms. Ms Wiseman submits on his behalf that the Guardian has not given these matters sufficient weight, nor the fact that the siblings have been separated. She argues the Guardian has been unfair to the father by suggesting that it is his own actions that have brought about that separation and in any event that the source of such a destabilizing factor is not relevant.</span></p>

The Guardian&#8217;s evidence was careful, cogent and entirely well-founded.  I fully accept what she says.  The children have not led a peripatetic existence since 2020. Although they have moved house they have remained in the same area, close to their maternal family. The visit to Somalia took place for a few months and ended a year before these proceedings were started.  Whilst there is some evidence that the children have been subjected to some physical punishment the conclusions of the assessing social worker and this experienced Guardian is that the children and their mother have a good and affectionate relationship and the children are not unhappy or wary of her.</span></p>

The Guardian&#8217;s view is that this has not prevented the children from being thoroughly settled in their home environment. I agree. This is hardly a surprise when the time that the children have spent in this country is so very long.   Article 12 of the Convention refers to the child being settled in a &#8216;new environment&#8217;.  The children&#8217;s environment here is not new at all.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The findings above give rise to a discretion whereby the court can decline to order that the children should return. The facts in this case are stark. The children have lived here for a long time. They have never been separated from their mother and despite the loss of their older siblings are happy in their home environment and at school. A move back to Norway would be likely to affect them very much, given the fact they have no memories of being there, they do not speak the language, and would have to go to a completely new environment.  This is not a case where the object of the convention to secure the prompt return of children to their country of habitual residence so that decisions for that child&#8217;s future can be made there can carry any significant weight.</span></p>

No doubt because of the strength of the other defences, this aspect of the case has not featured very much at this hearing albeit the parties have filed statements dealing with the issue of protective measures. The main issue of concern is the position so far as proceedings against the mother in Norway as the police still apparently wish to question her about the allegations made by the older children.  I do not have all the information before me as the last direction made by Mr. Justice Poole, namely that ICACU respectfully requests disclosure of all documentation in relation to the criminal investigation has not yet been complied with.  In my judgment the court would need to see this in order to make an informed decision as to whether there is a grave risk that the children would be exposed to psychological harm or placed in an intolerable situation by being separated from their mother.  As I have come to a clear view that I should not return the children on the basis of the other matters, in my judgment it would be disproportionate to deal with this any further.</span></p>
