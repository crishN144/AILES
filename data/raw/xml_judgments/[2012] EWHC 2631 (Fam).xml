	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The applications for parental orders were made by a male couple (hereafter referred to as &#8216;the Applicants&#8217;) who went through a ceremony or marriage in Belgium in June 2008 and are therefore to be treated in this jurisdiction as civil partners. The first Applicant is a British citizen who has spent most of his life in this country. The second applicant comes from Belgium. Following their marriage, the Applicants lived initially in Belgium, then in India, but since August 2011 have resided in this country where they intend to remain. For some time, the Applicants discussed the possibility of starting a family, initially via adoption, but subsequently through surrogacy. They considered surrogacy in Europe but, feeling that they would need to find a surrogate from within their friends or family, concluded that that was not an option in their case. They then considered surrogacy in India after spending several months working and travelling in that country and becoming aware of the growing number of international surrogacy cases through Indian clinics. The Applicants&#8217; evidence, which I accept, is that from the outset they were determined that they would only proceed with a surrogacy arrangement if they were sure that they could satisfy the requirements of any applicable laws to establish joint parentage and obtain citizenship for any future child or children. They conducted detailed research into the topic of surrogacy and sought advice from specialist solicitors, Natalie Gamble Associates. As a result of those researches, they learnt of the statutory provisions in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref>. In particular, they learnt that, in order to obtain a parental order, they would have to prove that the surrogate mother had given her consent to the order, and that such consent could only be given at least six weeks after the birth. The Applicants state that they therefore based all discussions with Indian clinics on the basis that this requirement would have to be fulfilled.</p>

They had a number of discussions with the director of the clinic who advised them as to the various options and local practices. In particular, they were advised by the clinic that its policy, in line with professional guidance in India, was that they would not be allowed to meet the surrogate mother.</p>

They became somewhat uneasy about the response of the clinic to their enquiries. On 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June, shortly before the expected date of delivery, the Applicants received an email from the clinic outlining some of the administrative processes surrounding the birth, including details of registration and passport applications. The email stated inter alia:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;There is a UK guideline which states the surrogate should be allowed about six weeks (since birth) to think over her decision of handing over the baby.

They pointed out that, where the surrogate mother is based outside the UK, the court has the power under rules to accept evidence of consent by way of a notarised statement. The solicitors proposed that they could prepare a written statement for the surrogate mother to sign, which would need to be translated into her first language and signed by her before a notary more than six weeks after the birth. The solicitors asked the clinic to confirm that the surrogate would be able to understand the written document, to identify the appropriate language for translation, and to confirm whether the clinic would be prepared to assist with arranging for the notarised signature more than six weeks after the birth. The director of the clinic responded to the solicitors assuring them that &#8216;we would be happy to be of help&#8217; to the Applicants.</p>

Thereafter, via email and telephone calls, the clinic promised that the forms would be returned. At one point, they were told that the return of the forms was contingent upon the provision of further information about passports and exit visas, which was duly supplied by the Applicants. On 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August, UK passports were issued for both twins.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2011, the Applicants submitted formal applications for parental orders under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref> to the Portsmouth County Court. On 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December, Her Honour Judge Black gave preliminary directions, including a direction for a CAFCASS report. That report, dated 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2012, recommended that a parental order be made in favour of the Applicants in respect of the twins, notwithstanding the fact that the surrogate mother had not given any valid consent after six weeks following the birth. On 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March, however, Judge Black understandably took the view that the issue of consent needed further investigation and analysis. She therefore directed the Applicants to file evidence concerning the question of consent and a full skeleton argument in support. Those documents having been filed by the Applicants, who were by this stage acting in person, Judge Black subsequently directed that the matter be transferred to the High Court and listed before me.</p>

It is only when all reasonable steps have been taken to locate her without success that a court is likely to dispense with the need for valid consent. Half-hearted or token attempts to find the surrogate will not be enough. Furthermore, it will normally be prudent for the Applicants to lay the ground for satisfying these requirements at an early stage. Even where, as in this case, the Applicants do not meet the surrogate, they should establish clear lines of communication with her, preferably not simply through one person or agency, and should ensure that the surrogate is made aware during the pregnancy that she will be required to give consent six weeks after the birth. </p>
