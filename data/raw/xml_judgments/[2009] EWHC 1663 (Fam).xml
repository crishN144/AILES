The father had produced a 17 page statement dated 12 April 2008 criticising Dr CM&#8217;s reports as &#8220;seriously flawed&#8221;. He had also prepared &#8211; seemingly with professional medical assistance &#8211; a 94 page &#8220;Critique&#8221; of Dr CM&#8217;s psychiatric assessment of the mother which questioned the &#8220;professionalism&#8221; of Dr CM&#8217;s work. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his statement of 12 April 2008 the father summarised his complaints against Dr CM under three headings. He asserts that: (1) Dr CM had insufficient information on the mother to ascertain if she was suffering from a mental illness / personality disorder &#8211; Dr CM, he said, had &#8220;tolerated her refusing to answer questions&#8221;; (2) Dr CM was biased towards the mother; and (3) Dr CM had disregarded concrete evidence, thus giving a misleading view of the mother &#8211; Dr CM, he said, had ignored evidence that had been made available to him (four alleged examples were given). Amongst his more specific complaints was that in interviewing the mother Dr CM &#8220;did not bother to apply&#8221; what the father asserts is a &#8220;well-known Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines.&#8221; </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As had been foreshadowed during the hearing in July 2008, on 2 October 2008 the father sent the court a request for leave to disclose certain documents to the appropriate professional body for the purpose of making a complaint about Dr CM. </p>

	    <intro>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have already set out the basis of the father&#8217;s criticisms of Dr CM&#8217;s reports. In his request dated 2 October 2008 he summarised the grounds of his application for leave to disclose what he said are the relevant documents to Dr CM&#8217;s professional body as follows:</p>
	    </intro>
	    <subparagraph>
	      <num style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:-0.49in">i)</num>
	      <content>
		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">In the first place, he said, a prima facie case had already been made out, in his statement of 12 April 2008 and in the detailed &#8216;critique&#8217;, that there are serious grounds for complaint to Dr CM&#8217;s professional body. Part of the meaning of &#8220;professional&#8221;, he said, is that members of the profession are subject to regulation in their conduct and competence &#8211; which would have little value if members of the public could not make complaints to the relevant regulatory body. It is, he asserted, plainly in the public interest that complaints should be possible and be duly processed, so the court should therefore normally facilitate the complaints process; the burden, he suggested, is upon the court or the other parties to say why any necessary leave to disclose should not be granted. </p>
	      </content>
	    </subparagraph>
	    <subparagraph>
	      <num style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:-0.49in">ii)</num>
	      <content>
		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Secondly, he said, he wished to complain about Dr CM&#8217;s competence in relation to both the report on himself and the report on the mother. In relation to himself he has of course, as he pointed out, a personal interest. In relation to the mother, and also himself, he has an interest as a party in competent expert evidence being provided to the court, for such evidence affects or potentially affects the outcome of the case, and hence the interests of the child and of himself <span style="font-style:italic">qua </span>father. Putting the matter at its highest, he believed that if Dr CM had carried out his remit in relation to the mother competently and professionally then he should have found that she had Borderline Personality Disorder, which would have considerably strengthened his case for sole residence of N, a case which, he said, he might not otherwise have abandoned. </p>
	      </content>
	    </subparagraph>
	    <subparagraph>
	      <num style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:-0.49in">iii)</num>
	      <content>
		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">Furthermore, he said, he has a lesser interest in the report on the mother being prepared properly, because he consented to pay &#8531; of the fees for it. There is, as he pointed out, an implied term in the contract that the work will be done in a proper professional manner and he objected to paying Dr CM&#8217;s fees until such time as there had been a ruling on the complaint he wished to make (and the same applies of course, as he said, to the report on himself).</p>
	      </content>

	    <num>10.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have and express no views of any kind as to the merits or demerits of the father&#8217;s complaints, as to whether or not there is any substance in the father&#8217;s complaints, about Dr CM. Because the matter was eventually compromised, Dr CM never gave evidence before me and was, therefore, never cross-examined. For all I know there may be substance in the father&#8217;s complaints; for all I know they may be utterly groundless. </p>
	    </content>

	    <num>11.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I need not list the voluminous documents that the father says should be disclosed to the GMC. In essence he says that, in order to give informed consideration to and make an informed adjudication upon his intended complaint about Dr CM&#8217;s methodology, the GMC will need to see the reports themselves, together with Dr CM&#8217;s letter of instruction and the material Dr CM was provided with pursuant to the court&#8217;s order, and any supplementary material he was also provided with. The GMC should also, the father says, have his statement of 12 April 2008, one of the (lengthy) exhibits to a statement he had made on 7 July 2008, and his detailed &#8216;critique&#8217; of Dr CM&#8217;s methodology, as these documents set out why he considers the methodology to have been seriously flawed and Dr CM&#8217;s work, as he puts it, unprofessional and incompetent.</p>

	    <num>12.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When this issue was first ventilated by the father, disclosure of documents generated in the course of children proceedings was regulated by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65" uk:canonical="1960 (8 &amp; 9 Eliz. 2) c. 65" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Administration of Justice Act 1960</ref> and rule 10.20A of the Family Proceedings Rules 1991. So it was in that context that the father sought leave to disclose the documents to the GMC. </p>

	    <num>13.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In accordance with directions I had given on 20 January 2009 and on 21 April 2009, the hearing of the father&#8217;s application came on for hearing before me (together with numerous other applications which will be the subject of a separate judgment) on 5 May 2009.   </p>

	    <num>14.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his position statement dated 24 April 2009 the father helpfully drew attention to the fact that, with effect from 27 April 2009, the new Part XI of the Family Proceedings Rules 1991 would be in force, replacing rule 10.20A. He pointed out that it appeared from rule 11.4(1)(c) that the leave of the court would no longer be required to disclose documents for complaint purposes. However, he made clear that he was leaving his application on the record &#8220;as this has been a contentious matter, and some parties may wish the court to restrict disclosure.&#8221;</p>

	  <paragraph eId="para_15">
	    <num>15.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Since it seemed to me that rule 11.4(1)(c) might potentially raise issues of significant impact in a wide variety of cases, and since the parties had understandably had little opportunity to consider its meaning and effect (for the new rule was not made public until 6 April 2009), I decided that I could not properly deal with the issue during the hearing on 5 May 2009. </p>

Second, they revoked rule 10.20A and substituted for it a new Part XI in the Family Proceedings Rules dealing with &#8220;Communication of information: proceedings relating to children.&#8221; The Rules, I might observe, say nothing as to the <span style="font-style:italic">reporting </span>of proceedings.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Three things about this new scheme, in contrast to the scheme previously embodied in the revoked rule 10.20A, may be noted. The first is that there is no limitation on the forms of &#8220;complaint&#8221; embraced within the new arrangements of the kind which were previously imposed by rule 10.20A(3). Rule 11.4(1) provides for the disclosure of the relevant information to &#8220;any person&#8221;. So the new scheme is no longer concerned only with complaints about lawyers and doctors or complaints to an elected representative or peer. The second is that there is likewise now no limitation on the information that may be disclosed in accordance with rule 11.4 without the need for prior judicial sanction in accordance with rule 11.2(1)(b). Rule 11.4(1) provides, without any expressed limitation, for the communication of &#8220;information relating to the proceedings&#8221; &#8211; in other words, the communication of <span style="font-style:italic">any </span>information relating to the proceedings. The third is the addition of the limitations and safeguards to be found in rules 11.2(2) and 11.4(3).   </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I should refer to one other part of the new scheme. The table which originally appeared as part of rule 10.20A(3) now appears, with many amendments, as part of rule 11.5. The new table retains the first of the three entries I referred to above &#8211; that relating to complaints about lawyers &#8211; though omitting the words &#8220;A party&#8221; in the first box. It omits the second entry &#8211; that relating to complaints to an elected representative or peer &#8211; and the third entry &#8211; that relating to the GMC &#8211; altogether. The reasons for these two modifications are apparent. In relation to any complaint about a lawyer or a doctor, or any complaint to an elected representative or peer, a <span style="font-style:italic">party</span> can now make disclosure in accordance with rule 11.4(1)(c), so there was no need for those parts of the previous table to be retained. On the other hand, a legal representative cannot, except when acting &#8220;on behalf of and upon the instructions of [a] party&#8221; avail himself of rule 11.4, so it was necessary to retain in the new table the ability of such a representative to make disclosure on his own account and without the instructions of his client.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Rule 11.4(1)(c) is expressed in very wide terms. It relates to <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> &#8220;complaint&#8221;, the only expressed limitation being that it must be a complaint &#8220;against a person or body concerned in the proceedings.&#8221; Those latter words, as it seems to me, merely define the persons or bodies who are relevant for this purpose. In other words, the complaint must be against someone &#8220;concerned in the proceedings.&#8221; But there is seemingly no requirement that the complaint itself have any connection with the proceedings. So rule 11.4(1)(c) imposes no limitation whatever, either in relation to the subject-matter or nature of the complaint, or as to the form the complaint may take or as to the person, body or organisation to whom the complaint is made.</p>

It is inconceivable that, in substituting rule 11.4(1)(c) for these parts of rule 10.20A(3), Parliament intended to take away from a party the right afforded to him in October 2005 to make disclosure to an elected representative or peer; this, after all, had been one of the aspects of the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (A Child) (Disclosure) </span>[2004] EWHC 411, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] 2 FLR 142" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] 2 FLR 142</ref>, that had given rise to great concern in some quarters. So this, as it seems to me, demonstrates that, whatever the true ambit of the word &#8220;complaint&#8221; in rule 11.4(1)(c), it plainly cannot be confined to complaints to disciplinary or regulatory bodies as that phrase would normally be understood. </p>

I might add that, in principle there is no reason why such a &#8220;complaint&#8221; should not be capable of being embodied in legal proceedings before some court or tribunal, so long the proceedings embody or involve something that can properly be said to be a &#8220;complaint against&#8221; a person who was &#8220;concerned in&#8221; the children proceedings.</p>

Seeking to meet one of the mother&#8217;s submissions (see below), Dr Pelling submitted that &#8220;complaint&#8221; in rule 11.4 does not mean &#8220;complain&#8221; in the sense of &#8216;express a grievance&#8217;. It is, he says, obviously to be construed as making a formal complaint against a person or body in the professional or institutional context, that is, that person&#8217;s or body&#8217;s regulatory or disciplinary authority or officer etc. There is, he says, no question of complaints and disclosure being made to all and sundry. A disclosure to the press, for example, under guise of a complaint, would still, he says, be a criminal contempt of court.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For once, as it seems to me, Dr Pelling sets his sights too low. I am not here concerned to explore all the possible ramifications of rules 11.4(1)(c) and (d), and in the final analysis the meaning of the crucial word &#8220;complaint&#8221; can only be elucidated on a case by case basis. For present purposes it suffices to repeat that although plainly the word &#8220;complaint&#8221; is intended to cover complaints made to disciplinary or regulatory bodies it is equally plainly not confined to such cases. And there is a powerful argument for saying that it is intended to have a wide meaning. After all, as used in rules 11.4(1)(c) and (d) it is obviously not confined to, though it may well embrace, the special meaning, as given in the OED, of &#8216;a statement of injury or grievance laid before a court or judicial authority&#8217;. More naturally, and when read in the context of Part XI as a whole, it might be thought, <span style="font-style:italic">pace </span>Dr Pelling, that &#8220;complaint&#8221; does indeed have the more general dictionary meaning of &#8216;an utterance or statement of grievance or injustice suffered&#8217;.</p>

Necessity, in the Strasbourg sense, has a meaning lying somewhere between &#8216;essential&#8217; or &#8216;indispensable&#8217;, on the one hand, and &#8216;useful&#8217;, &#8216;reasonable&#8217; or &#8216;desirable&#8217; on the other hand.

Nor should it be thought that this obligation is meaningless or unenforceable.

Although, as I have pointed out, rule 11.4(1)(c) may permit the use of information relating to children proceedings in other legal proceedings before some court or tribunal, so long as the proceedings embody or involve something that can properly be said to be a &#8220;complaint against&#8221; someone who was &#8220;concerned in&#8221; the children proceedings, the effect of rule 11.2(2) is to prevent the deployment of the material in any document filed with the court which is itself open to public inspection or at any hearing which is open to the public. And although rule 11.4(1)(d) would appear on one reading to enable a party to children proceedings to communicate information relating to the proceedings to a journalist, with a view to the journalist pursuing a media campaign complaining about the &#8220;law, policy or procedure&#8221; of the family justice system as it relates to children proceedings, the journalist will not be able to put the &#8220;information&#8221; he has received into the public domain.</p>

On one level the new scheme marks a radical change from the old. Much disclosure which previously would have required prior judicial sanction is now permitted without the need for any judicial involvement at all. And the width of the disclosure which is permitted by rules 11.4(1)(c) and (d) is, I cannot help thinking, much wider &#8211; and quite deliberately much wider &#8211; than would in all probability previously have been permitted by the judges. On the other hand, and this is of fundamental importance, the Article 8 and other privacy and confidentiality rights which are typically engaged when such disclosure is being contemplated are protected by the various provisions of Part XI to which I have drawn attention &#8211; in particular by rule 11.2(2) &#8211; and which had no counterpart even in rule 10.20A.</p>

After all, the limitations and safeguards to be found in rule 11.4(1), rule 11.4(3) and, more particularly, in rule 11.2(2), operate in much the same way as the limitations and safeguards previously suggested by the judges. It has not been suggested that rule 11.4(1)(c) is not Convention-compliant. Nor, in my judgment, could such a complaint sensibly be made. Rule 11.4(1)(c), read in conjunction with rule 11.2(2) in particular, shows the balance being struck in a way which, even if it requires no prior judicial sanction, is Convention-compliant, falling, as in my judgment it does, comfortably within the margin of appreciation afforded by Strasbourg to the United Kingdom. </p>

It is not. Prior judicial sanction is not a requirement of the Convention. And prior judicial sanction is not a requirement under rule 11.4(1)(c).</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">In the first place, Part XI is part of what, as I have said, is a dramatic and radical change in the law giving effect to a new public policy. It is not for the judges to whittle away that policy, not least where a central part of the new scheme is the abolition of the requirement for prior judicial sanction for disclosure. The power conferred by rule 11.2(1)(c) is a residual power to be exercised, as it seems to me, with caution and only in limited circumstances. Too ready a willingness to exercise the power under rule 11.2(1)(c) &#8211; even worse, a judicial enthusiasm for the energetic use of rule 11.2(1)(c) &#8211; could all too quickly and easily lead to an impermissible emasculation of the policy underpinning rule 11.4(1)(c).</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">The third point is one which, understandably, has been highlighted by Dr Pelling. As he points out, in practical terms the court and the other parties need not know, and typically will not know, about a complaint being made and documents being disclosed. And, as he correctly points out, there is no duty upon a complainant party to inform the court or the other parties. Rule 11.2(1)(c) neither imposes nor implies such a duty. I agree. So the reality is that in practice it will be impossible to prevent much wider disclosure than hitherto. Parliament, he says, cannot have intended the courts or other parties to act like policemen, trying to monitor, impede, delay, or frustrate potential complaints in advance; nor can Parliament have intended a system of <span style="font-style:italic">quia timet</span> applications or own motion orders restricting disclosure to develop.

For the application which she was addressing was not an application to restrict a form of disclosure which was permitted by rule 10.20A(3) but, on the contrary, an application to authorise a form of disclosure which was not permitted by rule 10.20A(3). So the focus of her consideration was rather on rule 10.20A(2)(a) &#8211; the analogue of rule 11.2(1)(b) &#8211; than on rule 10.20A(2)(b) &#8211; the analogue of rule 11.2(1)(c).

She says that Dr CM was available to appear in court during the hearing in July 2008, when the father could have cross-examined him on his methodology. But he chose not to and instead, she says, is trying to cross-examine on paper. Moreover, she says, the father has brought no evidence to suggest that Dr CM&#8217;s reports were wrong or that his findings were incorrect. And if, as the father asserts, Dr CM&#8217;s methodology was incorrect, then it was equally incorrect with regard to the report on the father himself &#8211; so he can make his complaint by reference to that report and without sending the report on the mother to the GMC.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Unsurprisingly, Dr Pelling on behalf of the father disputes the substance and force of much of Ms Farror&#8217;s submissions as I have just summarised them. But his real argument is much more fundamental and formidable, for he attacks the central assumption which, in truth, underlies most of the guardian&#8217;s case, just as it underlies the mother&#8217;s case. As he correctly says, the question now &#8211; since 27 April 2009 &#8211; is not whether to order disclosure but whether to restrict the right to disclose under the new rule 11.4(1)(c). </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Pelling poses the question: Is there a presumption now that disclosure under rule 11.4(1) is generally to be permitted and directions of the court under rule 11.2(1)(c) restricting disclosure only to be given in exceptional cases? Or is the effect of rule 11.4(1) purely to make any disclosure not automatically a contempt but the court still exercising control as it used to so that there is no presumption of disclosure but in each case restrictions will be considered on the merits in much the same way as when leave was formerly required? </p>

As a matter of policy, he says, the right to disclose under the new rule 11.4(1)(c) will usually prevail.</p>

Dr Pelling has helpfully directed my attention to various passages in it which support his arguments but which there is no need for me to set out. </p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Referring to rule 10.28(4) (which empowers the court to direct that media representatives shall not attend a hearing which they would otherwise be entitled to attend), he submits that it is plain that rule 10.28 creates a presumption that the media are to be admitted, and that rule 10.28(4) is not to be interpreted as giving the judiciary the same discretion that they formerly had to exclude the media. To adopt the same approach as has traditionally been adopted would, he says, plainly defeat the policy objective of rule 10.28. The test for invoking rule 10.28(4) is, he submits, a high one. Mere assertion, speculation and sentiment will no longer do; there must, he says, be real evidence of serious detriment to the child&#8217;s interests, a party&#8217;s or witness&#8217;s safety, the orderly conduct of the proceedings, or to the proper administration of justice (as the case may be) before the presumption of rule 10.28(3)(f) can be reversed.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">In the same way, he submits, the same principle applies to the new Part XI, that where information about children proceedings is now permitted to be communicated at an individual or institutional level &#8211; but not, as he observes, to the public &#8211; then there is a high test before the presumption that a party is free to communicate information as in rules 11.4-8 is reversed by a restrictive order of the court pursuant to rule 11.2(1)(c). That, he says, is the policy of the enactment and it is not for the judges to continue as formerly. Indeed, as he rightly comments, there would be little point in having the new Rules if that were so.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Part of the policy embodied in Part XI is, he says, a simplification of the rules on disclosure. So, if the purpose is to make a complaint, then the intention is clearly that the complaining party shall be free to adduce any information that he considers necessary in order to make his complaint, and the decision as to what information to select should be his and not the court&#8217;s, save in exceptional cases. As he puts it, the days of tedious time-wasting and expensive document-by-document examination by the court before granting leave to disclose are now gone. And the burden is now not upon the applicant to justify disclosure, but on any opposing party to justify the non-disclosure of specific documents. It is, he submits, a high burden.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The importance of policy in this area of the law cannot be underestimated. The enactment of the 2009 Rules, giving effect to the new policy spelt out in the Government&#8217;s White Paper, represents a policy change in England and Wales to a much wider freedom to disclose to individuals or organisations, including regulatory bodies, though not to the public at large. The courts, he says, must change accordingly. There is, as he rightly says, a world of difference between the old system of disclosure, rigidly controlled by the court, leave always being required, and the new system of free disclosure without leave but with the power of the court to intervene and restrict.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The right to complain about professional persons is of very great importance. As a matter of public policy or public interest the law generally upholds that right. Regulation of the professional person by the relevant professional body is the price that is paid for the privilege of belonging to a profession and for all the exclusive advantages that accrue to the practitioner. So, he submits, far from the privacy of legal proceedings being a reason to restrict the right to complain, it is rather a reason in favour of the right, for, otherwise, incompetent professionals will go quite unchecked: they can neither be exposed publicly because of the contempt law, nor complained against to their professional body. That is, he says, a sure recipe for the fulfilment of Bentham&#8217;s prophecy in words which, although directed more at the judiciary, also apply, he says, with equal force to expert witnesses:</p>

It is, he says, a run-of-the-mill case in the category of cases where a parent alleges some kind of personality disorder in the other parent detrimental to the welfare of the child. So if his right is judicially restricted then consistently so should every father's right be restricted who alleges professional incompetence in the author of a report on the mother examining whether she has a mental or personality disorder or not. </p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">But the result of such an approach will, says Dr Pelling, be that charlatans will continue to flourish unchecked in the darkness of the secrecy of the Family Division and without their professional body (here the GMC) being able to do its duty to police their profession, to uncover incompetence, expose the charlatan, and protect the public and individuals affected. That, he submits, is not in the public interest and the effect would be gravely damaging to children and the fair and proper administration of justice generally. Parliament, he says, has now rightly elected to make it easier to complain about professionals in children cases and it is not for the judges to whittle that policy down on what he calls spurious grounds of privacy.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Pelling accepts that a serious adverse effect on the child could justify restriction on disclosure but there is, he says, no evidence of that in the present case. It is not enough for the mother or the guardian merely to allege that she would be distressed and that this would impact on the child. Generally, he says, the welfare and interests of children will be enhanced by allowing complaints to be made about professionals in what he calls &#8216;the family law industry&#8217;.</p>

And quite apart from that, the GMC has power to hold hearings in private or in public with anonymisation. No doubt, as he says, the GMC would have regard to any conditions on disclosure imposed by the court such as preserving anonymity. The father, as complainant, does not wish to be anonymised but has no objection to the mother&#8217;s and N&#8217;s names being kept from the public in any GMC proceedings.</p>
