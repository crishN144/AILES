		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in">&#8220;It is important to note that a judge asked to make a section 39 direction in the course of proceedings will in every case balance the competing forces of Article 8 and 10 but upon the section&#8217;s conventional construction, which I favour, he will do so in a context limited by the fact that if he makes an order it will expire on the subject&#8217;s 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday. If his order under section 39 is extended, subject to later revocation, for the life of the subject it means that the judge is being asked to give very great, it may be thought overriding, weight to Article 8. Moreover, the common law principle of open justice is no less important; and is likewise intruded upon by the argument of the appellants.&#8221;</p>

		  <intro>
		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in;text-indent:0.32in">The identities of the parties are an integral part of civil proceedings and the principle of open justice requires that they be available to anyone who may wish to attend the proceedings or who wishes to provide or receive a report of them. Inevitably, therefore, any order which prevents or restricts publication of a party's name or other information which may enable him to be identified involves a derogation from the principle of open justice and the right to freedom of expression. Whenever the court is asked to make an order of that kind, therefore, it is necessary to consider carefully whether a derogation of any kind is strictly necessary, and if so what is the minimum required for that purpose. The approach is the same whether the question be viewed through the lens of the common law or that of the European Convention on Human Rights, in particular articles 6, 8 and 10. As to the latter, see <span style="font-style:italic">In re Guardian News and Media Ltd </span><a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2010/1.html" title="Link to BAILII version" class="Hyperlink">[2010] UKSC 1</a>, <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2010/1.html" class="Hyperlink">[2010 2 A.C. 697</a> at paragraphs 43-52.

The case did not concern an application for approval of a settlement involving a child or protected party, but the making of an anonymity order in the context of an attempt to prevent publication of personal information. To that extent there are obvious differences between that case and the present, but in paragraph 21 of his judgment Lord Neuberger&#160;M.R. identified the following principles which are of general application and therefore of direct relevance to applications of the present kind: </p>

He rejected that analysis, however, holding that the true question for decision is whether it is <span style="font-style:italic">necessary</span> for the court to grant a derogation from open justice and thus from the rights of the public at large. In our view he was right to do so and he was also right to hold that the absence of any objection from the defendant or the media does not relieve the court of the duty to consider whether a derogation from the principle of open justice is necessary.</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.18in;text-indent:0.32in">Although, as we have indicated, we do not think that approval hearings lie outside the scope of the principle of open justice, we think there is force in the argument that in the pursuit of justice the court should be more willing to recognise a need to protect the interests of claimants who are children and protected parties, including their right and that of their families to respect for their privacy, in relation to such proceedings. Such a willingness is reflected both in the Family Procedure Rules and in the Court of Protection Rules. It might be thought that approval hearings, whether involving children or protected parties, are comparable in nature and deserve to be viewed in a similar light, although it has not been suggested that in general such hearings should be held in private. The function which the court discharges at an approval hearing is essentially one of a protective nature, as it was when it exercised the function of parens patriae on behalf of the Crown in relation to wards of court and lunatics. The court is concerned not so much with the direct administration of justice as with ensuring that through the offices of those who act on his or her behalf the claimant receives proper compensation for his or her injuries. The public undoubtedly has an interest in knowing how that function is performed and the principle of open justice has an important part to play in ensuring that it is performed properly, but its nature is such that the public interest may usually be served without the need for disclosure of the claimant's identity.</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.18in;text-indent:0.32in">An important aspect of justice is consistency. The question for decision in each case is whether a derogation from the principle of open justice is necessary in order to ensure that justice itself is done. At one level that must depend on the facts of the individual case, but it is important to ensure a reasonable measure of consistency in order prevent the administration of justice being brought into disrepute. This is an area in which fine distinctions are difficult to justify and not easily understood. Proceedings of this kind are sadly not uncommon and some or all of the issues to which this appeal gives rise regularly confront judges dealing with such applications. It appears that applications for anonymity orders are becoming more frequent and, according to the very experienced judge who dealt with the matter below, there is uncertainty among judges about the course that should be taken. In those circumstances we think it appropriate for us to provide some guidance for judges at first instance.</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.18in;text-indent:0.32in">In our view the court should recognise that when dealing with an approval application of the kind now under consideration it is dealing with what is essentially private business, albeit in open court, and should normally make an anonymity order in favour of the claimant without the need for any formal application, unless for some reason it is satisfied that it is unnecessary or inappropriate to do so. Such an order should be drawn in terms that prohibit publication of the name and address of the claimant and his or her immediate family and also (if not already covered) the name of his or her litigation friend. The court must also recognise, however, that the public and the Press have a legitimate interest both in observing the proceedings and making and receiving a report of them. Accordingly, the Press should be given an opportunity to make submissions before any order is made restricting publication of a report of the proceedings, but for obvious reasons it will be unnecessary to notify the Press formally that an application for an anonymity order will be made. If the Press or any other party wishes to contend that an anonymity order should not be made, it will normally be necessary for it to file and serve on the claimant a statement setting out the nature of its case.&#8221;</p>

For my part, I would not share that view. Rather the decision reflects the emphasis the courts now place on the need to accord due respect to the Article 8 rights of litigants, especially of children, young people and protected parties balanced against the Article 10 rights of the press and broadcast media.

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.58in;text-indent:0.42in">Rather, the concern is that for the court to make an order such as that requested would be an extraordinary, exceptional, and, we submit, unjustified extension of the court&#8217;s use of its jurisdiction, and an unwarranted and unjustifiable intrusion on and limitation of the public and the media&#8217;s rights to freedom of expression under Article 10. The concern of the PA and TNL is that if the court makes an order in a case such as this, it will extend the range of injunctions available to local authorities far beyond anything considered in the cases of Thompson and Venables, Maxine Carr or the Woman formerly known as Mary Bell. An injunction would leave the press bound for the rest of AB&#8217;s life. While restricting what the media could do, it could also have the effect of placing a serious limitation on what AB herself might be able to do, or consider herself able to do. For example, she might, at some stage, wish to consider offering the story of her experiences for publication, either to a newspaper or magazine or in the form of a book. With an injunction in place, might she feel obliged to obtain the local authority&#8217;s consent to take whatever action she wished? And what if the local authority were to decide that it was not in her best interests &#8211; or possibly its own &#8211; to follow such a course of action?&#8221;</p>

It was for that reason that I gave a judgment in public last December and ordered that each of the respondents should be identified.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I further consider that there is a high public interest in supporting the victims of CSE to come forward and report their abuse to the authorities and to co-operate with them. Whilst the issue of lifelong RROs in possible future CSE injunction cases will have to be determined on their own merits, there is a very real risk, in my judgment, that my refusal to grant a RRO in this case, might deter other young victims of CSE from coming forward to the authorities. In principle I propose to make a RRO in favour of AB for her lifetime. </p>
