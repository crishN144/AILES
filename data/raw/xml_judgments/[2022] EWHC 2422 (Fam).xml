The judge has given leave for this version of the judgment to be published on condition that (irrespective of what is contained in the judgment) in any published version of the judgment the anonymity of the child who is the subject of the proceedings and members of their family, any individual having day-to-day care of or medical responsibility for the child and/or in the withdrawal of treatment from the child, and any clinician who has provided second opinions or advice to the Applicant Trust in the management of the child&#8217;s care, treatment and/or diagnoses, must be strictly preserved. All persons, including representatives of the media, must ensure that this condition is strictly complied with. Failure to do so will be a contempt of court.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case concerns the most sombre decision of whether life-sustaining treatment for a baby boy, A, should continue. The court is required to make that decision because his parents and those treating him cannot agree. A judge approaches a decision such as this with an open mind but is not free to apply his or her own moral views or religious beliefs. Rather, the judge is bound to apply existing legal principles.</p>

It is no small commitment to represent parents in a case such as this and it is a testament to the legal profession that it should provide unpaid specialist services in this way. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A was born in April 2022. His initial progress was largely unremarkable until 10 June 2022, at the age of nine weeks, when he was found in a floppy and limp condition at home. An ambulance was called and he was transported to Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Accident and Emergency Department.  He was stabilised there and then transferred to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) at the Evelina Children&#8217;s Hospital (Evelina) in central London.  The records indicate that he was in cardiac arrest when the paramedics arrived and despite resuscitation attempts his brain was starved of oxygen for approximately 32 minutes. On admission to the Evelina, A had fixed dilated pupils. He was neuro-protected for three days, meaning that he was kept cool and effectively anaesthetised. An MRI scan on 14 June 2022 showed &#8220;hypoxic ischaemic brain injury, multiple intracranial subdural and subarachnoid haemorrhages and spinal cord abnormalities&#8221;. He had therefore suffered a primary injury of intracranial bleeding and, secondary to that, severe hypoxic ischaemia. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Brain stem testing was performed on 17 to 19 June 2022 and death was declared at 1315 hours on 19 June 2022. A&#8217;s parents would not consent to the discontinuation of mechanical ventilation and requested a second opinion. Two doctors from a different NHS Trust in London performed brain stem tests on 22 June 2022 and confirmed the declaration of death. Still the parents would not consent to the withdrawal of ventilation and so on 27 June 2022 the Trust made an application to the High Court for a declaration that A was dead. An initial directions hearing was held before Peel J on 28 June 2022 but a few days later on 1 to 3 July 2022 A was seen to attempt to breathe. The Trust, swiftly rescinded its own determination of brain stem death and applied to amend its application to seek, instead, a declaration that it was in A&#8217;s best interests to withdraw treatment. At a hearing before Hayden J on 13 July 2022 permission to amend was given and a directions order made including the grant of permission to the parents and the Guardian jointly to instruct an independent expert witness &#8211; see <span style="font-style:italic">Guy&#8217;s and St Thomas&#8217; v.

The images show evolving and extensive changes to the parenchyma, the functional brain tissue. On the sagittal plane images for example, the majority of the light grey areas showing parenchyma on 14 June 2022 give way to dark grey areas showing cerebrospinal fluid on 14 September 2022 &#8211; the fluid has filled the spaces left by necrosed brain tissue.

A does not require much oxygen - about 20% - to maintain good oxygen saturation, but he does require very high ventilatory pressures &#8211; the highest having been 30 cmH<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span>O, and the current pressure being 28 cmH<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span>O. These high pressures are required because although he has flaccid limbs he has a rigid trunk: his neck, thorax and abdomen. He does not suffer spasticity, rather his abdomen and thorax are constantly rigid. This means that greater pressure is required to move the diaphragm down against the abdominal rigidity to allow for his lungs to fill with air. The muscle rigidity in the abdomen has pushed the diaphragm up in the chest, reducing left lung volume. The right lung, protected from similar upward pressure by the liver beneath it, has compensatory hyperinflation. The very high ventilatory pressures give rise to an ongoing risk of barotrauma to the lungs &#8211; they could &#8220;pop&#8221; as Dr Z put it. However, more recently there has been some slight softening of A&#8217;s abdomen and a slightly lower ventilatory pressure at 28 cmH<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span>O. This is still a very high pressure and the truncal rigidity continues. It prevents A from being able to be lain prone.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The determination in June 2022 that A was brain stem dead followed application of the Academy of Royal Medical Colleges&#8217; document &#8220;A code of practice for the diagnosis and confirmation of death.&#8221; There is no dispute that the criteria for &#8220;diagnosing&#8221; A&#8217;s brain stem death set out in this document were met. The correct tests were performed. The correct procedures were adopted. There were no errors made by the clinicians who followed the code of practice. On 22 June 2022 critical care consultants from another London NHS Trust reached the same conclusions as those at the Applicant Trust that A was brain stem dead. However, at the beginning of July 2022, A started breathing and the declaration of death by the Trust was immediately rescinded. A would not meet the criteria for brain stem death now. It is reassuring to know that the application of the code to young babies such as A is being actively considered. I understand there to have been a few case studies reported worldwide in which breathing followed determinations of brain stem death in adults as well as children. I also understand that the onset of breathing did not herald good recovery and that the prognoses remained bleak for all those patients. Nevertheless, it is understandable that F and M should question the reliability of confident statements about A&#8217;s prognosis given that they were told that their son&#8217;s brain stem had died but he later started intermittently to breathe independently.  </p>

Then, on 2 July 2022, he started breathing. This was rhythmic and sustained although insufficient to consider extubation. This must have seemed to the parents at the time to be a miracle. Very sadly however,  A&#8217;s breathing has since deteriorated. On 19 August 2022 Dr Z took A off the ventilator and placed A on the anaesthetic circuit ensuring he was fully oxygenated. He made three breaths in four minutes. On repeating the exercise on 14 September 2022 A took three gasps (not breaths) in five minutes. Dr Brierley conducted similar exercises. On 28 July 2022 he disconnected the ventilator and noted a sustained respiratory effort by 2.5 minutes but insufficient to sustain life and therefore to consider liberation from mechanical ventilatory support. On 23 September 2022, Dr Brierley disconnected A again and noted only two spontaneous breaths in three minutes, &#8220;far fewer than when I saw him in July&#8221;. Although Dr Z noted gasps rather than breaths, the trajectory of deterioration in breathing is common to both her and Dr Brierley&#8217;s observations. </p>

He readily accepted the limits of his knowledge and of medical science. He explained the technical aspects of his evidence in plain language. He was very mindful of the parents&#8217; views and their painful position. He accepted that in two respects the parents had been given medical advice about A which had turned out to be in error:</p>

In fact, A&#8217;s condition and his ventilation requirement has, in Dr Brierley&#8217;s opinion, effectively remained the same and he told the court in oral evidence that he could not now predict how long A might be kept alive on ventilation, although his life is limited.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Brierley posited two hypotheses as to how brain stem testing could have &#8220;confirmed&#8221; neurological death when, a fortnight or so later, A was able intermittently to breathe. The first was that whereas in a person with a closed skull severe brain swelling will cause the brain to be pushed downwards into the hole at the base of the skull (brain herniation or &#8220;coning&#8221;), for a baby who has open fontanelles (or for an adult who has undergone a craniectomy) the swelling can expand the brain in different directions. Thus, when the swelling subsides, damage to structures such as the medulla (which controls breathing) may not be total or permanent such that breathing may re-start. The second hypothesis was that damage to A&#8217;s spinal cord may somehow have caused reversible damage which temporarily prevented all breathing. As I understand it brain stem death testing for adults would require spinal cord injury to be excluded. These are merely hypotheses. Dr Brierley told the court that he has been in discussion about this case with the President of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, the Chair of the Paediatric Critical Care Society, and the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges via colleagues and that a working group has been established to clarify the &#8220;pre-conditions&#8221; before a determination of death using neurological criteria is made in a child of A&#8217;s age.</p>

It does not seem conceivable that he will regain consciousness. For as long as he lives he will remain in intensive care. </p>

Although there are no signs that A does experience pain, he could not exclude the possibility of sensation of pain by way of some form of vestigial reflex response, but the capacity to experience pleasure could effectively be ruled out because of the complete absence of cortical activity. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Brierley commended the exemplary care afforded to A at the Evelina. In his opinion everything that could have been done for A had been done. The time when treatment or interventions might make a difference will be in the early days after a severe brain injury. At this stage, after fifteen weeks in the PICU,  there are no further interventions and there is no further treatment that will help A. However, Dr Brierley would not now be as confident as he was a few weeks ago that A will be likely to die within a relatively short time if ventilation were to be continued. A&#8217;s life expectancy is limited but Dr Brierley would be cautious about putting any time on how long A might survive on continued mechanical ventilation. A had not suffered barotrauma despite the very high ventilator pressures. Hospital acquired infection would be likely to affect him at some stage - notwithstanding the exceptional nursing care he is given - but he could not say when or whether A would succumb to it.  </p>

In entering discussions about treatment limitation it is important to acknowledge the importance of the value that the child and his/her parents place upon their life and their view of its quality for that child, regardless of disability. These discussions may arise in the context of the burdens imposed by a child's illness and/or the treatments that the child is already receiving or that are proposed, their inability to benefit from treatments, or a combination of all three.</p>

Examples include children in Persistent Vegetative State (PVS), Minimally Conscious State, or those with such severe cognitive impairment that they lack demonstrable or recorded awareness of themselves or their surroundings and have no meaningful interaction with them, as determined by rigorous and prolonged observations. Even in the absence of demonstrable pain or suffering, continuation of LST may not be in their best interests because it cannot provide overall benefit to them. Individuals and families may differ in their perception of benefit to the child and some may view even severely limited awareness in a child as sufficient grounds to continue LST. It is important, here as elsewhere, that due account of parental views wishes and preferences is taken and due regard given to the acute clinical situation in the context of the child&#8217;s overall situation.&#8221;</p>

He will not improve with time alone and there is no treatment to give him that will improve his condition. He will remain in intensive care for the rest of his life. He will not recover consciousness because the brain tissue loss is so extensive and irreversible. Upon extubation he would not be likely to live more than minutes rather than hours. His life will be extended by continuing ventilation, but it is an extended life that would have no benefit to him.</p>

Dr Z explained that the ventilator is sensitive to a change of position of that kind. A was completely still when I saw him but he has at times shown some small movements. Dr Z and Dr Brierley explained that twitching movements are known to occur in severely brain damaged patients. F recalls that when he was a child his own ear would become hot and red whenever he was embarrassed or felt a strong emotion. His father had the same trait. He has noticed A's ear turning red. Dr Brierley has explained this as a known physiological response in some children with vasodilation to the earlobes leading to increased blood flow. The reddening of A&#8217;s ear is not due to inner emotion but is a product of the autonomic nervous system which mediates vascular tone. Although A&#8217;s head circumference has reduced &#8211; an exceptional finding in a young baby &#8211; his body has grown which the parents have taken as a positive sign. However, this is to be expected since he is receiving nutrition through his nasogastric tube. The parents have also noted some variation in the size of A&#8217;s pupils. In fact, his pupils do not react to light but slight changes over time are well known to occur &#8211; it is called anisocoria &#8211; and are not an indication of recovery from severe brain injury.</p>

As I observed during the hearing, the law clearly recognises that physical harm can be caused to an unconscious person. In the criminal law, for example, an unconscious person can suffer actual or grievous bodily harm and it would be no defence to a charge under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100" uk:canonical="1861 (24 &amp; 25 Vict.) c. 100" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Offences against the Person Act 1861</ref> that the victim was unconscious. The judge was in my view entirely justified in citing examples from the law of tort in which it has been recognised that physical harm can be caused to an insensate person. As Mr Mylonas observed, if the proposition advanced on behalf of the appellant was correct, there would be no limit on a doctor's ability to perform any surgery upon any insensate patient. For my part, I fully endorse the judge's reasoning for rejecting the appellant's proposition at paragraph 76 of his judgment.&#8221;</p>

The forensic approach is 'subjective', in the sense that it requires all involved, family members, treating clinicians, the Courts to conduct an intense focus on the individual at the centre of the process.

Nevertheless, as Hayden J powerfully articulates, respect of A&#8217;s innate human dignity requires the court to apply an intense focus on A. Having regard to the authorities set out above, it seems to me that the court recognises and respects A&#8217;s dignity by conscientiously applying the legal principles that have been laid down, not by making a decision that accords with the court&#8217;s own concept of dignity. Those principles require the court to consider A&#8217;s best interests in the widest sense, including burdens and benefits of which A is, and will remain, unaware. It would be wrong to assume that human beings, including babies as young as A, have &#8220;no interests except in those things of which we have conscious experience.&#8221; &#8211; Lord Hoffmann in <span style="font-style:italic">Airedale NHS Trust v Bland</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1993] AC 789" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1993">[1993] AC 789</ref> at 829. An assessment of A&#8217;s best interests will therefore take into account the care and devotion given to him by his family, the importance of his family&#8217;s religious beliefs and culture, and the circumstances in which he is and could be cared for and treated. The anxious assessment of A&#8217;s best interests in the widest sense accords respect to his innate human dignity. The court does not apply a separate test of dignity &#8211; there is no objective concept of dignity on which the court can rely to help it determine what is in A&#8217;s best interests. Rather, the intense focus on A and the application of the established legal principles, recognises and respects his innate dignity as a human being. </p>

However, some caution must be exercised in respect of this submission. The standard of proof applicable in these proceedings is the balance of probabilities. Whilst it is tempting to say simply that the possibility that Tafida feels pain cannot be entirely ruled out and therefore the court must proceed on the basis that it is better to err on the side of caution, this does not maintain fidelity to the applicable standard of proof.

I would go further, I consider it would be quite wrong, when balancing the difficult and sensitive issues raised here, not to take account of the fact that treatment might be causing H pain. In this case, as I have set out above, the situation is further complicated by the fact that Dr Lumsden agrees that it is likely that H periodically experiences some kind of &#8220;primitive pain&#8221; reaction and discomfort. Dr Lumsden states that this is not to be equated with the pain that a sentient adult might experience. The civil standard of proof test i.e., the balance of probabilities, certainly requires to be applied in particular, and prescribed circumstances. In this context, however, i.e., in an investigative, non-adversarial, sui generis process, such a constricted approach lacks the necessary nuance. It is medically impossible to exclude the possibility of pain in H&#8217;s case. There is no test, there can be, in the case of a young child, no formal assessment. The conclusions reached are based on observations alone to establish a negative i.e., what is thought not to be there. It is trite to say that this is a delicate and sensitive process. The Court&#8217;s finding should reflect nothing more and nothing less than that reality when it is evaluating those factors that illuminate H&#8217;s best interests. Where the doctors cannot exclude the possibility of pain, neither should the Judge.&#8221; </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Davy for the Guardian presented the judgments of MacDonald J and Hayden J as setting out two conflicting approaches to findings in cases of this kind. The first approach  reflects the dicta of Lord Hoffmann in <span style="font-style:italic">In Re B (A Child)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2008/35" uk:canonical="[2008] UKHL 35" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] UKHL 35</ref>, </p>

There is no room for a finding that it might have happened. The law operates a binary system in which the only values are 0 and 1. The fact either happened or it did not.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Hence, if I were to find that A probably does not feel pain then the possibility that he does feel pain is excluded when the best interests assessment is made. The second approach is to avoid a binary determination and to carry forward both the probability that A does not feel pain and the possibility that he does feel pain into the best interests assessment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am not sure that the choice between the two approaches is as stark as Mr Davy suggests. The binary approach articulated by Lord Hoffmann applies if a fact has to be proved.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Re A (A child)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2016/759" uk:canonical="[2016] EWCA Civ 759" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWCA Civ 759</ref>, the first ground of appeal was that, &#8220;the judge was plainly wrong to make a finding of fact that A was in pain and/or felt pain.&#8221; The Court of Appeal reviewed the evidence on which the judge had had to decide that issue and noted at [49], </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Hence, the Court of Appeal approved the making of a finding of fact, which must have been made on the balance of probabilities, as to whether the individual concerned could feel pain. In that case there was disputed expert evidence as to whether pain was experienced. It would have been impermissible for the court to have made a finding that expert A was correct, and then to proceed to a best interests assessment on the basis that the expert B might have been right. A determination was necessary and the decision is a binary one. However, in the present case the situation is different.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I find that the weight of the evidence is that A probably does not consciously experience pain &#8211; he has no awareness of pain or discomfort - but that some vestigial reflex responses to pain or discomfort, for example, when suctioning takes place, cannot be excluded. The evidence on the issue of pain appears to have some similarities with the evidence in <span style="font-style:italic">Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust v H</span> (above). If A does &#8220;suffer&#8221; pain or discomfort, I am satisfied that given the death of cortical brain tissue, it is without awareness and only as a reflex response. Even that level of experience of pain is unlikely - his heart rate and blood pressure have not responded to stimuli and his EEG is unresponsive to stimuli, but it cannot be excluded and need not be excluded for a meaningful determination of best interests to be made. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That is the finding that I take forward in my assessment of best interests. It is not necessary to make a finding on the balance of probabilities as to whether A has a reflex response to pain. I proceed on the basis that it is possible that he does so. The court is able to feed possibilities as well as probabilities into a best interests assessment. In some instances it is necessary for the court to make a finding to resolve disputed evidence or to determine a crucial issue. If so then  the court will have to make those determinations on the balance of probabilities. In <span style="font-style:italic">Knight</span>, the court needed to make a determination as to whether Pippa was in a minimally conscious state or was wholly unaware. That was a decision to be made on the balance of probabilities in the light of all the evidence. Once the finding had been made on the balance of probabilities, the alternative finding no longer fell to be considered as part of the best interests assessment. The situation appears to me to be quite different in the present case where a best interests assessment can be done on the basis that A has no conscious awareness of pain (on the balance of probabilities) but may have a vestigial reflex response to pain. Those two conclusions are not mutually exclusive. In this case, as in <span style="font-style:italic">Newcastle v H</span>,  the court is able to make findings that allow for possibilities and uncertainties and to take those into account in an assessment of best interests.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Applying the legal principles set out above, I proceed on the basis that the burdens of treatment should be taken into account even though they probably do not cause pain or discomfort to A of which he is aware. He undergoes frequent deep suctioning, he is ventilated, he is fed through a nasogastric tube. These constitute burdens upon him even though he is not conscious of them. The interventions are not as burdensome as they are in many cases but they are burdens nonetheless.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The overwhelming weight of the evidence is that A does not and will never experience pleasure. It is distressing for his parents to contemplate this, but A will not be aware of their presence. However, just as there can be harm without awareness of pain, so there can be benefit without consciousness of pleasure. In considering A&#8217;s interests in the widest sense I should consider the circumstances in which he is being cared for and his place within a loving family. A is the object of love and devotion from his parents. His life has meaning to them, to his brother, and to those who are caring for him at the Evelina. It is of benefit to A to be cared for in such circumstances. However, the benefit  to him is limited. The family care is provided for him in the setting of a PICU. It is right to note that his care has been de-medicalised so far as is possible. He is not administered any drugs for sedation or otherwise. He is not on a drip and has no intravenous lines. However, he is subject to the interventions already noted and the unanimous evidence of the clinicians and expert was that A will never live outside an intensive care unit. That is not a family home. He will not develop as a child within the family and be able to interact with them. He will not be able to form relationships with his caring family. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Weighing all the burdens and benefits to A from his current life, I have little hesitation in concluding that the burdens outweigh the benefits. He experiences no pleasure and no comfort. He has the benefit of loving care from his parents but he also suffers the burdens of interventions required to keep him alive. He has no awareness of either. He is trapped in an intensive care unit and deprived by his condition of all the opportunities for interaction, development, and family life that a baby might otherwise enjoy. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is a stark choice in this case. There are only two possible outcomes. The first is that ventilation is continued. A would remain in the PICU. His life expectancy would be uncertain but limited. He would be subjected to the same or similar interventions as at present. He would be at risk of suffering infection or barotrauma. The alternative is to withdraw ventilation. The parties have agreed a care plan in the event of a decision by this court that continued ventilation is not in A&#8217;s best interests. It involves a plan for ceilings of care and then extubation. On extubation it is likely that A would survive for a short time only. The care plan would allow him to be made as comfortable as possible and to be with his family when he died.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The evidence establishes that it is virtually certain that prolonging A&#8217;s life by continued ventilation and intensive care will not lead to any form of recovery. His existence will continue in the same way. The sole benefit of continued ventilation is therefore to prolong life. It cannot be known for how long life can be prolonged but it would be for longer than were ventilation to be withdrawn. Dr Z said that it is A&#8217;s death that would be prolonged but whilst A&#8217;s condition could be described as &#8220;dying&#8221;, he is in fact living &#8211; he has life and the law which I must apply is that there is a rebuttable presumption that steps should be taken to preserve life. </p>

That has been made clear to them by their Imam and in a fatwa (a ruling on a point of Islamic law) from a Madrasah. I take into account the parents&#8217; strong religious convictions and that A is a member of a family in which those convictions play such an important role but I cannot be bound by them, any more than I can be bound by the different religious convictions or secular beliefs of any other parent or party in other cases. I have to make a decision applying the legal principles set out above by which I am bound, not by adhering to the principles of a particular religion.</p>

The power of hope is very strong but some realism is also required. Given the devastating nature of A&#8217;s brain injuries there can be no realistic hope of an improvement or a medical breakthrough in the next few weeks or months that will change for the better the balance of benefits and burdens that now characterise A&#8217;s life.</p>

He undergoes invasive interventions to keep him alive. He has now been in intensive care for over fifteen weeks and has shown no signs of consciousness, no voluntary or purposeful movement, no awareness of the world around him, no responses to stimuli, he has EEGs which are the equivalent of a flat-lining heart monitor, and MRI scans which show a devastating loss of brain tissue. Sufficient time has now passed since his admission to the Evelina to conclude with confidence that he has no hope of any form of recovery and will never leave intensive care. Continued treatment is to that extent futile. Continued ventilation and intensive care would allow A to remain alive for longer than were they to cease but, whilst there is a presumption that life should be preserved, that presumption is rebutted in this case where A will only to continue to suffer more burdens that benefits from living.</p>

The burdens suffered by him in order to keep him alive outweigh the benefits to him of being kept alive by a significant margin. Treatment is futile in the sense that it cannot bring about any improvement in A&#8217;s condition or the quality of his life. So long as he is kept alive he will suffer more burdens than benefits from being alive. There are no other options than to keep him alive by continued ventilation in an intensive care unit so prolonging the burdens to him of being kept alive, or to withdraw mechanical ventilation which will then bring an end to his burdens.</p>
