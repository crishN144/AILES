	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.44in;margin-right:0.15in">These are care proceedings brought by Warwickshire County Council in relation to three children; K (who is about to be 12 years old), L (who is 4) and M (who is approaching his first birthday). Their mother is AQ (the mother henceforth). M&#8217;s father is BP (I will also refer to BP as the father for ease in this judgment that relates largely to his child). CR is L&#8217;s father and the father of K is DS. Very early on in the proceedings I determined that DS should not be served with notice of the proceedings, on the basis that he had had nothing to do with K since she was a baby, had been violent and abusive towards the mother and was still involved in violent crime. The mother was terrified that he would learn of her current whereabouts.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.44in;margin-right:0.15in">The children are represented in these proceedings through their Guardian, Karen Hughes. The care proceedings were issued on the 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2019 and so are now in week 34.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.44in;margin-right:0.15in">This is a fact-finding hearing which has sought to establish the likely cause of injuries sustained by M as long ago as December last year. I can only apologise to M&#8217;s parents for the delays that have occurred in this case, largely as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic that has affected every part of our society. The only comfort to them and the court is that M, K and L have remained cared for within their family, with the help and support of their maternal and paternal grandparents, who have supervised both the mother and the father in their care of M. Due to their exemplary care of the girls, and the analysis of risk being much lower, the mother and the father have been able to have the unsupervised care of the girls. In so far as is possible, the lives of the children have been able to continue without too much disruption. The local authority has had the benefit of an interim supervision order since the 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2019.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.44in;margin-right:0.15in">This situation has also had the benefit of allowing for the girls being able to spend time with CR. Although he is not her father, K has a warm and loving relationship with him, and she and L spend approximately five nights out of every fourteen in his care. I gave my permission for CR to be have a representative present during this hearing, even though the factual issues do not relate directly to him, as any findings that I make may have implications for L and it was important that he properly understand the evidence I have heard and the basis for my decision.  </p>

Within twelve minutes of birth, he was transferred to SCBU. Soon after, it was necessary to transfer him to Leicester Royal Infirmary.

This, however, would not make his bones fragile or predispose him to fracture. This is because his adjusted calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase and parathyroid hormone levels were within normal range. His radiological imaging had not shown reduced bone density or any evidence of any diseases of the bones. Advice from the British Paediatric Adolescence Bone Group (BPABG) is that in the context of unexplained fractures in infancy the level of 25 hydroxyvitamin D (vitamin D) is not relevant to the causation of the fractures unless there is radiological evidence of Ricketts using conventional x-ray techniques and biochemical evidence of Ricketts, i.e. abnormal blood levels of calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase or parathyroid hormone. In my opinion therefore vitamin D insufficiency will not make his bones fragile or predispose him to fractures.&#8221; </span></p>

It is asserted, on the balance of probability, that this was an inflicted injury by a deliberate application of excessive force, and that either the mother or the father is responsible. The parents have always denied ever hurting M or handling him in a way that could have broken his rib. Unusually, at the conclusion of the evidence, it was submitted on behalf of the Guardian that it was not possible for the court to determine a causative event or any failing in parental care that could establish that the threshold was crossed.  </p>

But when the GP saw M, it was she who called for the ambulance, and the mother travelled immediately to hospital with him, leaving her car and pushchair behind. M was admitted to Warwick Hospital with a cough and a fever and the diagnosis was initially one of viral bronchiolitis, but he was not found to be RSV positive.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.44in;margin-right:0.15in">Dr Johnson was clear that the fracture is most likely to have been caused within a period 3-8 weeks prior to the 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> December. However, in his oral evidence, just as in his written report, he was prepared to concede that the fracture might have been present on the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> October, but not visible on the x-ray. He was more flexible about extending the farthest date of the window to 9 weeks than being prepared to move the nearer date. In his words, if there had been a perfect scenario that explained the causation of the fracture that had occurred nine weeks from the 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> December, the x-ray appearance would not exclude that being the likely cause. He was less willing to be flexible about the end of the window being the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November. Dr Johnson was keen to impress upon me that the dating of fractures is an imprecise science and can only ever be a best estimate, based on the clinical knowledge that we have as to the body&#8217;s healing response. But there are many factors that can affect an individual&#8217;s response that inevitably leads to a degree of uncertainty.  </p>

It is also clear that feeding and nutrition were a difficulty for M. Dr Ahmad accepted in oral evidence that premature babies are routinely discharged with prescriptions for a multi-vitamin, vitamin D and iron, as well as a high concentrate formula as a result of the fact that a significant proportion of the mineralisation of the bone in a foetus occurs in the final trimester. M lost one half of that valuable time in utero. In fact, M was prescribed Abidec (a multi-vitamin) from the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September, but not vitamin D.

Dr Ahmad was clear that there had to be an explanation for the falling levels. Bleeding from the GI tract was one explanation, but if it is right that the mother only saw blood on a few occasions, he could not rule out there being another explanation. He did consider that M being anaemic was not directly relevant to the causation of the rib fracture or the level of force required to inflict it. However, it might be associated with and an indicator of poor nutrition. </p>

He was not getting enough iron, that much was clear. Whilst the bio-chemistry results performed on the 8th December were normal (apart from a slightly low vitamin D), he acknowledged that those tests had not been performed at any time before that date, so whether M was suffering from poor nutrition that was affecting his bio-chemistry was an unknown prior to that date.  </p>

But in any event, the local authority makes the proper submission that both observed events occurred outside of the window for the timing of the fracture and so cannot be the cause of it. The parents accept that neither of those incidents could be the cause of the observed fracture, and it is also accepted that the &#8216;brutal&#8217; physiotherapy did not cause a fracture, as none was observed on the x-ray taken on the 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December, despite M having been taking Ranitidine and Omeprazole for a number of weeks prior to that date.  </p>

Such a focal application of force is more likely than not to cause a bruise, although if there was some bone fragility, the force required to break the bone would be less and so a bruise might not be seen.

But I do have to note that within the window from the beginning of October to midNovember as identified by Dr Johnson, M had spent three nights and six days in hospital, and had ten medical appointments, many of which were related to his breathing, in which I must be able to infer his chest and back would have been exposed in order to listen to his chest.

But the impression that I have formed is that they are both quite quiet, mild mannered people, who when in a relationship with each other, have found a way of communicating that does not involve arguments. The father in particular, is softly spoken and unassertive, and I can entirely see how, as a new parent, he would have naturally taken a step back from caring for a new born baby and girls who were not biologically his, in favour of the mother who clearly regards being a mother as the most important job she will ever have. Having said that, I entirely accept their joint evidence that he is a loving and caring father to all three of the children. Whilst they clearly decided between the two of them that he would go out to work and the mother would take the load at home, there cannot be any criticism of either of them for that choice, nor would it be right for me to assume that decision inevitably caused conflict. Every family is different, and what works for one group of people would be a disaster for another.

Just like them, I do not know how the fracture was caused. What I am entirely satisfied of is that there are a number of features in M&#8217;s medical history that could have led to a degree of bone fragility; prematurity, poor nutrition (as a result of his general ill-health, poor feeding, and possible liver or kidney problems), alongside the recognised side-effects of taking Omeprazole and Ranitidine. I do not know whether his poor feeding was affecting his ability to absorb the nutrients he required in order to develop strong bones. I do not know whether his Vitamin D was low in the window when he sustained the fracture. I do not know whether there was a session of physiotherapy that is not noted, or whether a procedure or examination was undertaken in a way that it should not have been. Neither am I able to determine any of those questions. The medical picture for M throughout the first three months of his life was so complex, that it is quite impossible for me to determine what, if any, was the effect of one or a combination of all of these factors might be. But the parents are not required to establish the probability of an alternative explanation, nor do I have to be satisfied as to the probability of an alternative cause.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.44in;margin-right:0.15in">Whilst I entirely accept the submission made by Mr Sampson QC that it cannot be the case that a local authority seeking findings in relation to a fracture such as this must be able to establish at each relevant point that a child&#8217;s blood chemistry and therefore bone strength were normal, in this case, in circumstances where there are features that have been accepted as being able to cause increased bone fragility and I do not have tests that show all was well, there must be at least a possibility that there was a reduction in M&#8217;s bone density that might have been a significant feature in the causation of the fracture.  </p>

I am acutely aware of how difficult the last eight months have been for all of them, including the respective grandparents, L and K and M. Child protection procedures exist to prevent children being harmed, sometimes very seriously. I hope that they will be able to accept that this experience was necessary, not to protect M in the end, but to protect all of the other children in this country who do need the help and protection of professionals to keep them safe from harm. I very much hope that this family can now concentrate on their recovery and I wish them the very best for the future.  </p>
