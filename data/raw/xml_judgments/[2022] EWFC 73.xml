This changed during the hearing, indeed after what should have been the close of evidence. (Procedurally this hearing has not moved in a straightforward way, which theme will no doubt return within this judgment). Eventually, the plan morphed to placement in two sets of two, but with regular reviews of the search for the older two, which may then, at any point within six months (after six months a cut off for the adoptive search) turn into a search for two individual placements for the older two children (thus, three placements in total, all adoptive)</span></p>

Something so fundamental as to how to divide the four siblings into two groups of two if they are not to be placed together. The care plans submitted placed the children in a particular format of two groups of two. The ADM documents placed them in a different two. When asked why this was, in her oral evidence the SW started by saying that it was a typographical error. She then went on to acknowledge that it wasn&#8217;t, it had in fact been her view that the middle two should be together and the oldest and youngest together due to the strength of relationship of the middle two, and that this had been a well considered plan, due to the nature of the relationship that they had.

They should not be having to react, with their Counsel, to ever changing plans and evidence served last minute. It is difficult to understand how it is that these proceedings can be so heavily delayed and yet come into Court in such poor order, and as I made clear at various points during the hearing, this could not have been rendered more painful and difficult for the parents had it been deliberately designed that way. Having said that, I ensured that time was given at each stage that it was necessary, and I am satisfied that the parents have in fact had a fair and full hearing. It was unfortunate, however, that parents who are facing the permanent loss of four children, had to endure and listen quite so much and wrangling between professionals. </span></p>

In regard to some of the issues C has not been able to provide any real context. This creates suspicion and perhaps undermines her reliability and credibility.

Although C is currently engaging in work around domestic abuse for which she is to be commended, it should be noted there has been a recent finding against parents, about extreme levels of domestic abuse the children have been exposed to and the harm this has caused&#8230;.. the Trust remains concerned about potential future emotional harm and exposure to domestic abuse. Since C has been known to Sandwell Children&#8217;s Trust in her role as a mother, a clear gap in the correct form of therapeutic services remains prevalent. This means C will have neither emotional or psychological capacity to see or appreciate the impact her relationship with L and her parenting style impacted on P, E-R, E or J&#8230;.Based upon information outlined within this report, Ms Birch&#8217;s professional analysis of C&#8217;s lack of capacity to recognise and make insightful changes in the interests of her children and prioritising their needs above her own remains current.

I note the conclusions of this updating assessment, including: &#8220;It is recorded throughout this assessment L has been dishonest with both the assessing social worker and Ms G in terms of knowing about the pregnancy with E&#8230;. Furthermore, L has not been entirely honest with Ms G about the voice recording and has significantly minimised what occurred&#8230; L has a history of being described as being avoidant with inconsistent engagement with professionals&#8230; This is further iterated within the GP letter from 2020 and the Early Help chronology where by L has refused support from their service. There are significant concerns about L&#8217;s  lack of capacity to be wholly truthful. As outline within this assessment there are inconsistencies with information shared by him. Furthermore, L continues to deny being a perpetrator of domestic violence and abuse. L lacks capacity to recognise and take responsibility in acknowledging his behaviours and how these contributed to the domestic abuse and violence within his relationship with C and the impact this had on E-R, P and J in the form of emotional harm.&#8221;</span></p>

She admitted that it was deficient in certain aspects when questioned on behalf of the Guardian.

But I don&#8217;t think she really believed that the F had behaved in the way that the Court found. When pushed by me she did say yes, but I don&#8217;t think at her heart that she truly believed it. I consider she has, for understandable reasons, bought into the Father&#8217;s narrative. What I mean by this is that any acceptance of risk by her is highly partial and is quite limited. She simply does not recognise in her beloved partner the risky dangerous man that the Court has found to exist in the Father.</span></p>

They were removed from, what has been established, were appalling home conditions and dreadful domestic abuse. One of the children has talked about seeing daddy punch mummy. One has described what is thought to be identified as maggots behind his bed. The youngest child nearly died and spent time in intensive care upon removal. Perhaps not surprisingly, the children are demonstrating disturbed behaviours. Extremely disturbed behaviours. That is not in the slightest bit surprising given what we all now know that they have endured.

By this point, the allocated social worker was on sick leave and the team manager was attending via Teams, but appeared to be absent for some part of the Guardian&#8217;s evidence. </span></p>

I was rewarded by the team manager physically attending at 3pm. By 5pm the Local Authority was absolutely no further forward in being able to explain what therapeutic intervention would be made available and when. The head of service had declined to attend via Teams (I having been told earlier in the afternoon that she was available to attend remotely &#8216;from 4pm&#8217;) but then attended at 5.05pm and, in fairness, immediately appeared to understand the severity of the situation.</span></p>

She started by saying that she had agonised about the right plans for these children. She considered &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">that the emotional state of the children largely being ignored by the Local Authority&#8221;  </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">but certainly it was not being ignored by the GAL. I am satisfied that the Guardian has contemplated, long and hard, carefully and thoughtfully, the best way to balance and to manage the competing needs and the competing difficulties of the children. In some respects the needs of the children compete with each other and contrast. In some respects doing the best thing for one might appear to suggest a contrary course of action when compared with what doing best for another might point towards. What is certainly clear, however, is that in this difficult case the children require the decision maker for them, in this instance the Court, to consider them all as individuals, with their own, specific, personal needs. They are not simply a group of siblings. They are a group of siblings with particular difficulties and vulnerabilities, some of which may compete.</span></p>

There is no need for further assessment of the Mother, the Mother having been, in my opinion, fully assessed already. There is no gap in the evidence, no change in circumstances, no other fact or matter that would render any further such assessment necessary, because the fundamental issue as I will go on to consider, is that the Mother does not accept that she has chronically neglected the children, and if she is unable to reach acceptance of that in the course of two assessments and the giving of evidence in the witness box, she is not going to accept it to any further assessor.</span></p>

There has been, quite rightly in my view, no application to re open threshold or to resile from any admissions. The focus of the hearing, rightly, has been on future planning and welfare disposal. But it is interesting to me, as I pronounce, very firmly, that threshold is crossed for the making of final orders and on the basis of the composite threshold document set out at A41 in the bundle, that the Mother does not, at her heart, accept that her children were chronically neglected.

He had contributed, most definitely, to the appalling situation the Mother found herself in by July 2020 when she found herself utterly unable to cope.

The children still do not know about B, over a month after his birth. When the social worker had planned to inform only P about B&#8217;s existence, at school, the school expressed considerable concerns about the potential impact and the guardian had to intervene to advise the social worker not to undertake the visit in a rushed and unplanned manner as that would only serve to cause disruption to P and J. It was clear from the social workers evidence that she hadn&#8217;t properly considered the risks of informing P in school (that being a safe place for P) or of not telling J at the same time which would only lead either to J being told in a wholly unplanned way by P or P being required to keep the information secret.

As a result of the local authority&#8217;s inaction and the fact that P was in desperate need of emotional support, the foster care took steps to identify counselling through a charity which could be provided to P at school.

Foster placements, long or short term, do not provide legal security. They can and often do come to an end. Children in long term care may find themselves moved from one home to another sometimes for seemingly inexplicable reasons. Long term foster parents are not expected to be fully committed to a child in the same way as adoptive parents. Most importantly of all in the current context, a long term foster child does not have the same and enduring sense of belonging within a family as does a child who has been adopted. There is no way in which a long term foster child can count on the permanency, predictability and enduring quality of his placement as can a child who has been adopted.&#8221; [39]</span></p>

Where a child is in the care of a local authority, the starting point is that the authority is obliged to allow the child reasonable contact with his parents (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/34/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 34(1)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>).

There are open adoptions, where the child sees his or her natural parents, but I think it would be fair to say that such arrangements tend not to be seen where the adoptive parents are not in full agreement. Once the adoption order has been made, the natural parents normally need leave before they can apply for contact.&#160; </span></p>

These are some of the hardest decisions that any family court is required to make. But I am afraid to say that the evidence in this case is overwhelming. Accordingly, it is my determination that I must make the care order as sought, and I approve the care plan for adoption. It is the only outcome that can meet these childrens&#8217; needs throughout his life. I dispense with the consent of the parents to the making of the placement orders, and I make that order. I approve the plans for the reduction of contact as set out by the local authority. </span></p>

This case has been extremely difficult and almost impossible to &#8216;keep on track&#8217;. It has taken the strenuous efforts of the Guardian, Counsel for the Guardian, and the Court to ensure that the case proceeded in a proper manner, to the extent of the Head of Services for the Local Authority having to be summoned to Court at 5pm on a Friday afternoon.</span></p>

That evidence was given on the first day of the hearing. From that point onwards it should have been patently obvious to the Local Authority that there was a real issue with their care planning and that careful consideration needed to be given to the complexities of the sibling relationship and their individual needs. Instead, the Local Authority remained doggedly fixed with its original care plan, providing generic reasoning only in its defence, and failing to see the complexities and nuances of the case.</span></p>

They were the orders initially being suggested, for very good reason, by the childrens&#8217; Guardian, and had the Local Authority been able to bring a more responsive, thoughtful, flexible eye to what was happening in Court the proceedings could have been much shortened and the parents spared having to listen to lengthy arguments amongst professionals about how care planning for their children should or should not be undertaken. I very much hope that this will not have to happen again.</span></p>
