The local authority accepts that the grandmother should be given notice of the proceedings. She should be informed of her entitlement to apply for party status and of the fact that it is possible she may be entitled to automatic party status. If the grandmother wishes to be a party to these proceedings she can make an application. If she makes an application it is open to her to contend that she is entitled to automatic party status.

The question of whether a court of another relevant Member State would be better placed to hear the case (or a specific part of the case) is an evaluation to be performed on all the circumstances of the case. It is intimately connected with the question of the best interests of the child, given the construction of the regulation and the logical connection between the questions. That said, the starting point for the enquiry into the second question is the principle of comity and co-operation between Member States of the European Union enshrined in the European Union Treaty which the provisions of B2R were designed to reflect and implement (see, for example [2], [21] and [23] of the preamble to B2R).

It is entirely proper to enquire into questions of fact that might inform the court's evaluation of whether a court is better placed to hear a case. Without wishing to prescribe an exhaustive list, those facts might include the availability of witnesses of fact, whether assessments can be conducted and if so by whom (i.e. not a comparative analysis of welfare perceptions and principles but, for example, whether an assessor will have to travel to another jurisdiction to undertake an assessment and whether that is a lawful and/or professionally appropriate course), and whether one court's knowledge of the case provides an advantage, for example by judicial continuity between fact finding and evaluation and so on.&#8217;</span></p>

The question remains, what is encompassed in the &#8220;best interests&#8221; requirement? The distinction drawn in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">In re I </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">remains valid. The court is deciding whether to request a transfer of the case. The question is whether the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">transfer</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> is in the child&#8217;s best interests. This is a different question from what eventual </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">outcome</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> to the case will be in the child&#8217;s best interests. The focus of the inquiry is different, but it is wrong to call it &#8220;attenuated&#8221;. The factors relevant to deciding the question will vary according to the circumstances. It is impossible to be definitive. But there is no reason at all to exclude the impact upon the child&#8217;s welfare, in the short or the longer term, of the transfer itself. What will be its immediate consequences? What impact will it have on the choices available to the court deciding upon the eventual outcome? This is not the same as deciding what outcome will be in the child&#8217;s best interests. It is deciding whether it is in the child&#8217;s best interests for the court currently seised of the case to retain it or whether it is in the child&#8217;s best interests for the case to be transferred to the requested court.&#8217;</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Three further points need to be highlighted. The first is that whilst Article 15 gives the court of another member state the right to apply for the proceedings to transfer it does not mandate &#8216;the courts of a Member State having jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter&#8217; to order that the proceedings be transferred. It is clear from the use of the word &#8216;may&#8217; in Article 15(1) that that court has a discretion. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The third point arises from the final words of Article 15(2) which provide that &#8216;A transfer of the court&#8217;s own motion or by application of a court of another Member State must be accepted by at least one of the parties.&#8217; It would appear to follow that even if the court answers in the affirmative all three of the questions posed by Article 15(1), unless at least one of the parties accepts that the proceedings should be transferred the court is not entitled to order transfer; the discretion does not arise.</span></p>

The local authority, the mother and the Children&#8217;s Guardian on behalf of the children all oppose transfer of these proceedings to Latvia. The father has not engaged in these proceedings. His views are, therefore, unknown. Pursuant to Article 15(2) it could be argued, therefore, that as no party has accepted that the proceedings should be transferred the court has no power to transfer these proceedings to Latvia even if the three questions raised by Article 15(1) are answered in the affirmative. Notwithstanding that point, in my judgment, out of respect for the position taken by the Latvian authorities, it is appropriate that I should determine the issue by answering the three questions raised by Article 15(1).</span></p>

They are Latvian nationals. Until April 2010 they had lived in Latvia all their short lives. They returned to live in Latvia in April 2015 and remained living there until May 2016. During that period they lived with their maternal grandmother and also, from July 2015, with their mother. They still have both maternal and paternal family members living in Latvia. In my judgment it is plain that they have &#8216;a particular connection&#8217; with Latvia for the purposes of Article 15(1).</span></p>

In light of the extent of the children&#8217;s connection with Latvia&#8217; described in the previous paragraph&#8217; coupled with the involvement of the Latvian social services and the Latvian court in 2015 and 2016, to which I referred earlier, I accept that it is arguable that the Latvian court is &#8216;better placed to hear the case&#8217;.
