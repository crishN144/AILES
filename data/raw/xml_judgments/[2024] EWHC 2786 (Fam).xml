Both parties have been well and sensitively represented by Counsel, in a hearing which forms part of a long running set of proceedings involving the parties&#8217; son, known as TC, who is aged 9. In addition to full skeletons from both parties and a large number of authorities from counsel, I have also received 2 bundles comprising over 1,000 pages, including the transcript of both parties&#8217; evidence. The judgment itself runs to 50 pages, including 217 paragraphs and a number of passages of dialogue during its delivery between the judge and counsel.

The Judge characterised his findings as &#8220;significant physical and emotional threats&#8221; some of which were &#8220;frightening&#8221; and others &#8220;bizarre&#8221;.

An order dated 17 August 2022 recited that the Respondent should attend a DAPP with RESPECT accreditation as recommended by Cafcass. The Respondent completed a DAPP with The A Project in February 2023. The A Project is not RESPECT-accredited, but was approved by CAFCASS. Contact between TC and his father progressed on a supervised basis, notwithstanding the findings. On 12 May 2023 HHJ Kushner moved contact from supervised at a contact centre to supervised in the community. On 11 September 2023 the same Judge progressed contact from supported to unsupervised in the community with supported handovers. The appellant mother objected to some extent to each of these developments, but reports provided indicated that the arrangements proved successful.  </span></p>

The appellant was also not represented at a further review hearing on 31 October 2023 where an accelerated contact schedule, albeit not including overnight stays, was ordered. The appellant sought permission to appeal this interim contact order. That permission was refused by Peel J on 12 February 2024.

In her judgment on 31 May 2024 the judge progressed contact from 14 hours on a visiting basis over 2 days on alternate weekends to overnight on alternate weekends during the school summer holidays &#8211; then 3 months hence. In her very full judgment, in which she recited the significant history of the case, including all of the findings made against the father, she found that while he still did not accept the court&#8217;s findings, he did demonstrate a general understanding of domestic abuse. The judge set out in full the relevant paragraphs of PD12J, and there can be little doubt that she was fully cognisant of the mother&#8217;s concerns, as she questioned her about her perception of the risks at some length. At various points during the judgment there are what can only be described as testy exchanges between the judge and Ms Traugott, the appellant mother&#8217;s counsel.</span></p>

The stay application sought that the order be stayed until the permission application could be heard, as &#8216;the progression to overnight contact was made without proper consideration for PD12J and the child&#8217;s wishes and feelings&#8217;.  By an order of 22 July 2024, I suspended the introduction of overnight visits until this application for permission had been determined. Visiting over two days every other weekend has continued as previously ordered.</span></p>

He did not consider that the matter should go back to supervised contact or even supported contact and considered that it could remain as it was.  He did not consider that there was any real bias in the contact centre report, nor did he think that overnight contact was off the table.  Rather, he was looking at the mechanism for moving it on.

Under my questioning of the CAFCASS officer, whether there was a way through and whether there was some reason not to have overnight contact other than what had been the reported expressed wishes of TC, he insisted that simply adding overnight so he was away for two days, whether it was testing it, Saturday overnight through to Sunday, I asked whether in fact it could be for a shorter period, incorporating the Sunday breakfast.

She had to exercise her discretion cautiously, which on the face of her judgment is what she has done. PD12J provides a framework through which findings of domestic violence must be considered in every case, and factored into the court&#8217;s decisions.

The judge&#8217;s finding that TC was probably influenced by his mother&#8217;s negativity around contact certainly does not amount to a finding of alienation, and cannot therefore be criticised on the basis that it did. </span></p>

Whilst the questioning took some time, and was evidently upsetting for her, the appellant was able to answer clearly and firmly, and produced answers to the court&#8217;s questions which properly reflected her case.
