	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">THE<marker name="tab"/>JUDGE:  In this application, the Central Manchester NHS Foundation Trust, represented by Miss Cavanagh, seek declarations in relation to a child, Child A, who was declared clinically dead at 10.10am on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;February 2015.  That declaration was confirmed by two brain stem tests, the latter taking place at 17.30 hours the same day, confirming the results of the earlier test and, therefore, supporting the declaration i.e. that brain stem death had occurred at 10.10am on that date.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Child A is a 19-month-old boy.  His parents are Saudi nationals and they have been living in the United Kingdom for the last two years.  The father, who has been present in court throughout this application, is studying for a PhD.  Child A has a brother, Child B, who is nearly 6 years of age and a sister, Child C, who is 2&#189;.</p>

On 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;February 2015, Child A choked on what appears to have been a tiny piece of fruit.  Shortly before 2.30 in the afternoon that day, his mother found him choking and it seemed he quickly became unconscious.  The mother is not at court.  She is with her other children and, understandably, she is profoundly distressed.  That afternoon, she telephoned the ambulance immediately.  It arrived promptly and the paramedics were immediately able to perform bag valve mask ventilation en route to the hospital.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">By the time Child A arrived at the hospital, he had unrecordable saturations.  His position was grave.  It was plain to everybody that Child A was in severe respiratory distress on his arrival.  Though he was breathing spontaneously, he had a marked airway obstruction.  Tracheal intubation and cricothyroidotomy did not relieve the situation.  Hypoxia and ischemia led to cardiac arrest and, at 15.11 hours, that is to say easily within half an hour of arriving at the hospital, CPR was commenced.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">In addition to intubation and needle insertion into the trachea, performed by the consultant anaesthetist, Child A saw an ENT consultant who was able to operate immediately to remove the foreign body, via endoscopy and to retrieve a small stalk which appeared to have come from a satsuma.  By 15.31 hours, cardiac output had been re-established and Child A was transferred to paediatric intensive care.  There he remained fully ventilated and assisted by a neuro-protective regime which involves the application of a group of therapies which, to the best understanding of medical science, is thought to reduce the extent of brain swelling and the raising of intracranial pressure, following hypoxic ischemic insult.  So Child A was heavily sedated, the CO2 control was carefully balanced and he was rested at an angle of 30 degrees, thought to offer the best neuro-protection to reduce swelling but it was entirely obvious to all the nurses and staff that the outlook for Child A was profoundly bleak.</p>

The scan, perhaps not unpredictably, revealed extensive severe ischemic changes involving the grey matter of Child A&#8217;s brain.  It could not have been more obvious, both from the clinical presentation of this little boy and of the content of the MRI scan that the brain injury was so extensive that it was something from which it was impossible for Child A to survive.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">It must have been almost impossible for his mother and father to understand how a day which began so ordinarily on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;February could have deteriorated so rapidly and unexpectedly into what the father has described to me as &#8220;a living hell&#8221;.  In my view, it is almost impossible for any adult to absorb the extent of the parent&#8217;s distress.  Human instinct senses that level of pain and recoils from it.  Ultimately, all we, the lawyers and doctors, can do is to offer Mr and Mrs A and their family our profound sympathies and condolence.  This is a Muslim family.  Mr A has wanted to cleave to what thread of life he perceives his son still to have.  He has listened to the evidence of Dr Stephen Playfor and his response is, in my assessment, one of bewilderment, frustration and anger perhaps an inevitable component of such unimaginable grief.</p>

By this stage, Child A had begun to show signs of significant cardiovascular instability.  He had developed diabetes insipidus.  This occurred in consequence of impaired hormone production from his profoundly injured brain.  At hospital, he was given an infusion of vasopressin to stabilise the diabetes, as I understand it, in order to protect his kidneys and to seek to fend off dehydration.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The brain stem tests followed well established clinical guidelines.  Despite the impressive name, they are, in fact, simple bedside tests: an assessment of the pupils&#8217; reaction to light; corneal reflexes; cough reflex; evidence of any respiratory movement; apnoea tests; and gag reflex.  For each test, on those two separate occasions, the results pointed overwhelmingly and sadly, conclusively, to brain stem death.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">One of the questions posed by the father here was whether brain stem death is synonymous with clinical/legal death.  The father certainly does not consider the two to be equivalent. This seems to me at least as rooted in his Muslim beliefs as in his basic paternal instinct.  I have considered the Code of Practice devised by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (2008) both in relation to &#8220;The Diagnosis and Confirmation of Death&#8221; following irreversible cessation of brain stem function and in relation to the conclusions and recommendations of the 1991 &#8220;<span class="A1" style="font-weight:normal;font-family:'Helvetica Neue CE'">Report of a working party of the British Paediatric Association on the diagnosis of brain-stem death in infants and children&#8221;</span>.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Dr Playfor, who I found to be an impressive, kind and reflective witness, gave me this assistance: he told me brain stem death, does not equate to the death of the whole brain.  There are studies that demonstrate that you can have electrical activity in some areas of the brain after brain stem death is established.  The key point, he said, is that no patient has ever regained consciousness or awareness following brain stem death.  Dr Playfor went on to explain the reason for that in language which I found to be simple and accessible.  The nerves which generate the breathing mechanism and maintain the integrity of the heart rate are all connected to the brain stem.  In simple terms, when the brain stem dies, it is impossible for a patient to breathe unassisted.</p>

Patients in the vegetative state (VS) have also lost this capacity (see section 6.9). The difference between them and patients who are declared dead by virtue of irreversible cessation of brain-stem function is that the latter cannot continue to breathe unaided without respiratory support, along with other life-sustaining biological interventions. This also means that even if the body of the deceased remains on respiratory support, the loss of integrated biological function will inevitably lead to deterioration and organ necrosis within a short time. </span></p>

What does follow from such a diagnosis is that none of these potential activities indicates any form of consciousness associated with human life, particularly the ability to feel, to be aware of, or to do, anything. Where such residual activity exists, it will not do so for long due to the rapid breakdown of other bodily functions. </span></p>

It is for this reason that patients with such activity can no longer benefit from supportive treatment and legal certification of their death is appropriate.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Child A&#8217;s parents have simply been unable to contemplate turning off ventilatory support.  Mr A clings on to any sign that may undermine these catastrophic medical conclusions, pointing to the twitching and retraction of Child A&#8217;s legs, which are spinal, not cerebral reactions.  That seems to me to be entirely understandable.  He and his wife, whose lives have been rocked in the course of the last week, have tried to put together a package of measures to take Child A (whilst continuing his ventilation) to Saudi Arabia.  Some of the papers indicate that the father favoured that course because he wished Child A to die there but I was not at all surprised to hear from him, in evidence, that his real motivation was to take Child A to Saudi Arabia in the hope that he might live.  In Saudi Arabia, the father told me, for religious reasons, a life support machine would never be switched off. This would appear to be correct. It is perhaps also important to note that in the USA the parallel guidance identifies &#8216;whole brain death&#8217; as the legal definition of death, specifically rejecting the UK Guidelines as too narrow (&#8220;<span class="reference-text">Controversies in the determination of death&#8221;: A White Paper by the President's Council on Bioethics, Washington, DC. page 65-66).</span></p>

He was prepared to, and did, contact the medical liaison officer at the Saudi Arabian Embassy, exploring, perhaps somewhat improbably on reflection, the possibility of taking Child A in his present condition to Saudi Arabia.  </p>

In accordance with protocol the Coroner had been informed.  He wrote to Professor Pearson, the Trust&#8217;s clinical director, in these terms:</p>

It seems wholly inappropriate for a deceased body to be intubated and ventilated when this is futile and, to my mind, unethical.  Accordingly, I must ask you to cease this and extubate him so that his body can be moved to the mortuary from which it can be released to his parents.  If the family wish to repatriate his body to Saudi Arabia, then I will provide an out of England certificate.  Obviously, your clinicians will need to communicate this to the parents and allow a short but reasonable time for the parents to be with him pending the extubation.&#8221;</span></p>

No Coroner appears to have asserted such authority in circumstances where life support remains engaged, following brain stem death.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">As the manner in which these provisions are drafted indicates, they are designed to facilitate the investigation of the cause of death.  The facts of this case are a reminder once again that in a multi-cultural society there has to be recognition that people, particularly those with strong religious beliefs, may differ with medical professionals as to when death occurs. In the Christian, Muslim and Jewish faiths the concept of the &#8216;breath of life&#8217; has ancient and important resonance. It is hardly difficult to understand why the still breathing body is regarded as alive, even though &#8216;breath&#8217; may be entirely delivered by machine. An insistence on a legally precise definition of death to trigger the involvement of the Coroner, in such challenging circumstances is, in my judgment, so obviously wrong as to be redundant of any contrary argument.</p>
