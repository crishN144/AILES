This application arises in relation to alleged breaches of orders made on 8 August 2014 and 15 August 2014 within wardship proceedings brought under the inherent jurisdiction concerning Isabella, the three year old child of the mother and father, a child who is habitually resident in this country but who is currently in Poland.  In those wardship proceedings, the mother has sought, and seeks, the return of Isabella from Poland where, it has now been found, Isabella has been wrongfully retained.  </p>

In the circumstances, the disadvantage to the father by his non-attendance is not as significant as it may be in other cases.

That said, at the outset of the hearing I indicated to Mr. Gration that, in the event that I found the alleged breaches proved on the basis of the material presented, I would intend to give the father (and paternal grandmother) an opportunity to make representations to the court in person, or through legal representative, by way of mitigation or otherwise, in relation to the imposition of the penalty.

The orders for her return were repeated. The detail of the orders was discussed in court in the presence of the father and the paternal grandmother (see [30] below).  A penal notice was attached to those orders, and the father and paternal grandmother were each warned of the consequences of breaching them.  The father and the paternal grandmother were each directed to return Isabella to England and Wales by no later than Thursday 14 August 2014.
