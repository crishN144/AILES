	      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case concerns two children, whom I will call B and C. They are the children of Mr and Mrs A. B is a boy who was 11 in August 2003. C is a girl aged 9 and a half.  Their parents are both professional people. Mr A is a hospital consultant now aged 55: Mrs. A is a teacher, now aged 50. They were married in April 1992 and separated in October 1997. Their divorce was made absolute in September 2001   By virtue of an order made in the county court on 27 March 1998; Mrs. A obtained a residence order in relation to both children. </p>

	      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although I have not investigated the history, my understanding is that there was litigation effectively from the date of the parties&#8217; separation in October 1997, when Mrs. A removed the children from the former matrimonial. Although ultimately compromised, the divorce was, as I understand it, initially defended. Given the subsequent hostility between Mr. and Mrs A, it is unlikely that the period leading up to their separation was entirely amicable. </p>

	      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Early in 2002, Mr A issued an application for a joint residence order and a defined contact order. His complaint was that Mrs A had been making unilateral decisions about the children&#8217;s health and education and marginalising him from those decisions.  He had objected to a proposed change of school for C, and asserted that as a consequence, Mrs A had informed him that C was frightened of him. Contact between Mr A and C stopped in March 2002. </p>

For my purposes, the important order is that made on 11 July 2002, which invited the National Youth Advisory Service (NYAS) to respond on the two questions of contact between C and her father, and Mr. A&#8217;s application for a variation of the order for residence made by the district judge on 27 March 1998.  </p>

She reported on 3 July 2002. She described B as a rather vulnerable, very sensitive child, who was &#8220;devastated and distracted&#8221; by his parents&#8217; disputes. C had been very fond of her father but had now apparently turned against him. She did not want contact. Dr. L was not sure how she could be helped to see him again, but said that C needed to make her peace with her father.  She reported that C wanted to move schools, and that B needed and would make use of some therapeutic input. She was not sure if C would make use of a similar therapeutic input, but that did not mean she did not need it. </p>

I shall return to the detail of this report later. In summary, however, it recommended the making of a defined interim contact order between C and her father in the period leading up to the final hearing on 20 November 2002.  The first period was to be at a family gathering due to take place on 21 October 2002.  There were then to be further contacts observed by Mrs. P.</p>

	      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 17 October 2002 the district judge joined the children to the proceedings and appointed Mrs. P their guardian. In accordance with Mrs. P&#8217;s advice, he made a detailed order providing for the first period of contact on 21 October and thereafter two periods of contact to be observed by Mrs. P. The court recorded its understanding that the contact visits were directed with the parties&#8217; agreement and expressed its expectation that Mrs. A would make C available for all of them.  </p>

	      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The contact fixed for 21 October 2002 did not take place. On 18 November 2002, Mrs. P filed her second report. It set out in considerable detail the work she had done since 16 October 2002. Her recommendations were dramatic. She proposed an interim residence order for a period of three to four weeks in Mr. A&#8217;s favour to allow the children what she described as a &#8220;short respite break&#8221;. Those arrangements should be reviewed before the children broke up for Christmas.  The court should set down a finding of fact hearing to resolve concerns expressed by Mrs. A that C was at risk from her father. She suggested this be heard either by an experienced circuit judge or transferred to the High Court.  She also expressed the view that the court might well wish to consider making an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> inviting the intervention of the local authority on the basis that the children were suffering significant harm.  She also invited consideration of a psychiatric or psychological assessment of both parents. </p>

	      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The district judge acted promptly on Mrs. P&#8217;s recommendation that the case be transferred to the High Court. On what was intended to be the first day or a two-day hearing, he secured the immediate whereabouts of the children for the day and transferred the case to the High Court forthwith.</p>

Mr. A and NYAS were seeking the immediate removal of the children from Mrs. A&#8217;s care in accordance with the latter&#8217;s recommendation.  Fortunately, I was sitting as applications judge and was able to accommodate an immediate hearing, which lasted into the following day. I decided not to follow Mrs. P&#8217;s primary recommendation.  I directed that there should be contact between both B and C and their father as recommended by Mrs. P, and that contact should take place in the presence of C&#8217;s godmother, Mrs. H. I also directed a finding of fact hearing to take place on 16 and 17 December 2002 to deal with Mrs. A&#8217;s allegations that Mr. A represented a threat to C. </p>

	      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Contact remained problematic, but the finding of fact hearing took place. At the conclusion of it, I was a certain as I could be that Mr. A was not a risk to C, and that, in particular, there had been no sort of sexually inappropriate behaviour by Mr. A towards C, and that there was no lack of appropriate sexual boundaries between Mr. A and C as Mrs. A had alleged.  I concluded that C had a loving relationship with her father, and that there was no reason why she should not both see him and stay with him.</p>

On this basis, although I was invited to do so by Mr. A, I declined to make any change in the residence order, but made it clear that in the light of my findings, I expected contact between Mr A and C now to be fully restored. </p>

Mrs. A had applied for a suspension of my order directing contact, and directions as to whether C should be seen by a member of the local police or social services child protections team.  I dismissed that application and ordered that the children should live with their father.</p>

In preparation for that hearing, I had ordered on 19 December 2002 that NYAS should obtain a report on Mr and Mrs A from a psychologist, Mr. BC &#8211; that report to be available by 30 April 2003. In the event, Mr BC&#8217;s report was delayed. However, sufficient progress had been made by Mrs. P and Mr. BC for them to be able to recommend that the July hearing should be postponed for six months. I therefore listed the case for further directions on 16 December 2003</p>

	      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 16 December 2003, there were further reports from Mrs. P and Mr. BC. Their joint view was that there was no purpose in the case proceeding to a full hearing. The children were now spending 50% of their time with each of their parents. That was acceptable to the children and to both Mr. and Mrs. A. The only issue was that Mr. A wanted the interim residence order, which I had made, in his favour to be retained: Mrs. A wanted there to be a shared or joint residence order. Although it was recognised as being highly unusual, both parents and NYAS wanted the joint residence orders to last until each child was 18, and also sought an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 91(14)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> preventing each of them making any further application to the court without the court&#8217;s permission. Details of the shared care arrangement, with careful identification of what days in each week would be spent with whom throughout 2004 were agreed, as was a schedule of items in relation to the exercise of parental responsibility, identifying those items which required mutual consultation and those which could be exercised unilaterally. I regard this as an extremely useful document, and attach a copy of it to this judgment.   </p>

	      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In a nutshell, Mr. A&#8217;s argument was that the current shared care arrangements had only come into being after the interim residence order had been made in his favour. The only way they could be guaranteed to continue was if he retained the sole residence of the children. He was committed to the shared care arrangements, and assured me through counsel that he would honour them. But if, he said, Mrs. A obtained a shared residence order, she would abuse it, and there would be a return to the strife which had beset the family since 1998, when a sole residence order had been made in Mrs. A&#8217;s favour.</p>

As will already be equally apparent, however, this is a case in which identification of the children and their parents would be seriously detrimental to the welfare of the family, whose privacy must be fully protected.  At the same time, the case demonstrates points of interest and importance in the ongoing debate about the role of the courts in contact and residence disputes.  It is, therefore right, in my view, that my reasons for reaching my decisions in the case should be made public.  I am therefore handing this judgment down in open court, but directing that nothing should be published which would identify the children or their parents.</p>

C had stopped seeing her father in March 2002, and was stating that she no longer loved him or wished to see him. She gave me a very unconvincing list of her worries and anxieties about seeing her father. B had stopped seeing his father in March 2002, but at his own insistence he had started seeing his father again in April 2002. B felt desperately sad that C was no longer going for contact. He did not know, as a 10 year old child, how to resolve the problems in his family. B appeared an emotionally burdened child.</p>

		<p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:1.5in">With respect to the parents, Mr. and Mrs. A, a virtual state of war had been going on for over 5 years. It appeared that the first response of both parents in the event of even the most minor disagreement was to rush to solicitors or to make applications to the court. The bundle of case papers I was sent at the start of this case was so large it could be measured with a ruler. I can confirm that I read the whole bundle fully; this is a recent concern of Mr. A. In my opinion, reading the bundle was a sad testimony that two intelligent people had lost all perspective and common sense in their hatred of each other and their need to battle and win over their ex-partner. I was clear they had lost the focus on their primary role, which was to raise their children to adulthood, either separately or apart, as best they could.</p>

This went well; it was obvious that C had a strong attachment and a loving relationship with her father. Overnight stays were started and became successful. Confusingly, C became more and more distressed to leave her mother&#8217;s care when I collected her, but would settle down quickly after the separation. I had no doubt that contact was positive for C. </p>

In the early days of my involvement, the more I tried to re-assure Mrs. A, as an experienced social worker in child protection, the more this issue assumed credence in Mrs. A&#8217;s eyes. A finding of fact hearing was held. The court gave similar assurances to Mrs. A by finding that her concerns were unwarranted. This did not stop Mrs. A. She involved a friend in questioning C about these matters. On 30 December 2002 the court considered whether the children&#8217;s residence should change. The court ordered Mr. A to become the residential parent, and for the children&#8217;s contact to their mother to be at my discretion. This order put me in the driving seat. I had no doubt that the best way forward for B and C was a shared care arrangement. </p>

This arrangement, which has been detailed in my earlier reports, has been running successfully since April 2003. The one undisputed fact in this case now is that the shared care arrangement suits both children well. The children are happy and thriving. They are making excellent progress at school, and in their social lives. B and C both feel they can maintain a neutral stance, as they spend equal time with each parent. I believe that the parents have now leant not to involve the children in their adult disputes to the same extent as before. B and C no longer see the need for me to keep seeing them. To them, the problems have been resolved. </p>

		<p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:1in">First and foremost, yet again, it demonstrates the difficulty and complexity of cases of this nature.  The dispute between these children&#8217;s parents has lasted from the date of their separation in October 1997, and was amongst the most bitter and protracted of my experience. C was 3 when her parents separated. Thus throughout her short life she had never consciously experienced a time when her parents lived together in harmony. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:1in">It demonstrates the distress and the damage caused to children by long-standing and continuous hostility between their parents. The pressure on B and C has been enormous. B at one point told NYAS that he could not bear it any longer. It is, of course, too early to tell if the damage caused to these two children will spill over into their adolescent and adult lives. I hope, of course, that it will not. However, there is nothing more that the court can do, and I am satisfied that the litigation must come to an end with the making of the shared residence order.</p>

		<p style="margin-left:1in">It demonstrates the manner in which parents can impose their own wishes and feelings onto children and thus frustrate the formation or maintenance of a proper and loving relationship between the children and the other parent. C had been persuaded by her mother that she did not love her father and did not want to see him, when the opposite was the truth. Fortunately, the work done by NYAS, in conjunction with firm court orders, has restored the relationship between C and her father, and she now lives with him for half of her time.</p>

		<p style="margin-left:1in">It demonstrates the value and importance of the children having their own separate representation in certain cases. The children in this case were separately represented in the proceedings by the NYAS. The work done by NYAS was invaluable, firstly in restoring contact between C and her father and then in achieving a shared care arrangement. It was a paradigm of what can be achieved by skilled and energetic social work intervention by the children&#8217;s guardian. It was also; it has to be said, exceptional in the amount of time and effort Mrs. P put into the case;  </p>

		<p style="margin-left:1in">It demonstrates what the court can and what the court cannot achieve. On the positive side, the court was able to engage NYAS, also by conducting a formal hearing and making clear and specific findings of fact, I was able to decide categorically that allegations made by Mrs. A that Mr. A had been guilty of sexually inappropriate behaviour with C were untrue. On the negative side, neither NYAS nor I was able to improve the relationship between the parents or convince them of the damage, which the unrelenting power struggle between them was causing to their children. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:1in">It demonstrates the highly damaging and destructive nature of false allegations of sexual misconduct and abuse, and the caution, which is required when such allegations are made for the first time in the middle of a bitterly contested family dispute. In this case, the allegation did not come spontaneously from C: it came from C&#8217;s mother reporting something C had allegedly described. I was quite satisfied that nothing untoward had occurred between C and her father, but that because of the intensity of her feelings towards her former husband, Mrs. A had distorted and misinterpreted entirely innocent activities between Mr. A and C.</p>

		<p style="margin-left:1in">This is a case where a shared residence order is appropriate. But it also demonstrates clearly that shared residence orders are not a panacea. Shared residence and an equal division of the children&#8217;s time between their parents&#8217; houses is possible in this case because the parents live close to each other, and the children can go to school from either home. The children welcome it because, in C&#8217;s words, which I have already quoted, it gives his parents nothing left to fight about.  But it is a pragmatic solution, which does nothing to address the underlying hostility between the parents. Whether or not is succeeds; only time will tell. </p>

		<p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:1in">The case demonstrates that intractable contact and residence disputes cut across all class barriers. In this case, the father of the children is a hospital consultant: the mother is a teacher.  In their different ways, and away from each other, both are individually charming and attractive people. Their hostility towards each other, however, was tangible and frequently led to quite irrational behaviour. The Children Act Sub-Committee of the Lord Chancellor&#8217;s Advisory Board on Family Law commented in its consultation on contact disputes that it was frequently the case that   the more intelligent the parents, the more intransigent and bitter the dispute. This case is an example of that. Contact and residence disputes are no respecters of class barriers. </p>

From the time the case unexpectedly into my list on 20 November 2002 to its final resolution on 16 December 2003, I heard every application in it. My familiarity with the facts and with the parties meant that applications could be made to me at short notice, and I could make decisions swiftly. When a crisis occurred shortly before Christmas 2002, I was able to arrange a hearing swiftly to deal with it. It was not necessary for colleagues to read their way into a case to which they would be coming for the first time. </p>

Before setting out the facts, however, I wish to make it clear that I am not seeking to demonise either parent.  Although some of Mrs. A&#8217;s actions were particularly inappropriate and damaging to the children, I am satisfied that both parents love their children deeply. However, both share the responsibility for the impossible and damaging position in which they placed them</p>

When Mrs P met C for the first time on 10 October 2002, C told her that she did not wish to see her father. Mrs. P explained carefully about the court, and that the judge wanted Mrs. P to see C having contact with her father. Mrs P and C spoke at length about C&#8217;s worries and C agreed to write out a list of them. This is a very sad document for an eight-year-old child to produce, particularly when nearly all of it turned out to be untrue.</p>

However, when she arrived to collect C for the contact, she was told by Mrs. A, in C&#8217;s absence, that C had decided she did not want to see her father, and would not come for the contact. Mrs. A also showed Mrs. P a Women&#8217;s Aid Information Pack, which she had obtained after listening to a programme on Radio 4 on the previous day.  As it happened, Mrs. P had listened to the same programme, which was about children forced to continue to have contact against their will and when the children had disclosed previous serious sexual or physical abuse against their father.  Mrs. A made a comparison between C&#8217;s situation and the situation of the children discussed in the programme, and told Mrs. P that having read the Pack, she was reluctant to push C to go for contact against her wishes. She said she needed to get to the truth about why C was reluctant to see her father. </p>

Mrs. A said that C did not trust Mrs. P as she was going to force C to go to the contact.  Mrs. P did not force the issue. She said she hoped C would come, and that she intended to wait outside until 5.00pm so that C could talk to her mother. She would then drive off and go and meet her father as planned.   Mrs. A came out to the car at about 4.55 to speak to Mrs. P, but C did not emerge.</p>

C replied that she wanted to tell Mrs. P about her father not wearing underwear in bed when she woke up in the middle of the night and climbed into his bed.

This, however, proved to be a disaster, firstly because of arguments between the parents about what Mrs. P considered minor matters, but also because Mrs. A began to talk about her concerns about the lack of sexual boundaries between Mr. A and C. As it happened, Mrs. P had only that morning received a letter from Mrs. A&#8217;s solicitors in which those concerns were particularised.  Mr. A read the letter and became extremely angry and distressed. He accused Mrs. A of trying to ruin his reputation. He shouted abuse at Mrs. A. Mrs. P said the meeting was over and decided to take Mr. A outside. He continued to shout abuse at Mrs. A, who turned to Mrs. P and said: &#8220;I told you he was like this&#8221;.

B had developed the habit of defecating in what he described as &#8220;oriental style&#8221; by squatting on the rim of the toilet bowl. Apparently in so doing he had caused a mess at home in his mother&#8217;s house.  His father allowed him to defecate in this manner in his house, and no doubt B told his mother so. My own view was that this was something, which was not socially acceptable in middle class England, and that B should have been so told by his father.

If true, the clear implication is that Mr. A had used what would otherwise be the entirely innocent activity of C sitting on top of him in bed for his own sexual gratification.  The incident, accordingly, deserved careful examination. </p>

The first, of course, was that it is an accurate reflection of what the child said, and that the child was speaking the truth. At the other extreme was the proposition that the allegation was not only untrue, but had been fabricated by the parent to whom it is alleged the child spoke. Between the two were a variety of possibilities. </p>

	      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Sometimes, in my experience, the anxiety about contact or residence demonstrated by the resident parent is so great that he or she simply misinterprets an innocent remark made by the child. That is what I have found may well have happened in the other incidents with which I have dealt. Sometimes, the anxiety displayed by the parent is so great that it induces the adult to lead the child into a description of an event, which has not occurred, but which the adult believes may have occurred. Sometimes the child, anxious to please the residential parent, and acutely aware of that parent&#8217;s heightened anxiety, is led by the parent into an allegation which, once again, simply has not occurred, but which both the adult and the child, in due course, come to believe. Sometimes, an innocent event is misinterpreted, either deliberately or through parental anxiety, and wrongly translated into an allegation of abuse. </p>

There were serious inconsistencies between her evidence in the witness box and the version on paper. I did not think she was an accurate historian. Her explanations for the inconsistencies lacked all conviction.  An incident like this, which she clearly believes to be very serious, would, I think, have been clearer were it an accurate account of what happened. Whilst I was quite sure that she has good qualities as a mother, I was equally sure that her level of anxiety over contact was so great that not only had it badly affected C, but that it had also been responsible for this allegation being made.</p>

I was entirely satisfied that all of that activity was innocent, and a normal part of family life.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with children seeing their parents naked &#8211; as Mrs. A herself agreed. Nakedness is only abusive when, in the adult mind, an adult sexual motivation is introduced, and the adult&#8217;s or child&#8217;s nakedness is used for adult gratification. Having heard and watched both Mr and Mrs. A in the witness box, I was as satisfied that I can be that Mr. A&#8217;s contact with his daughter had been entirely innocent at all times. I accepted his denial of any form of sexual impropriety.</p>

But, on the balance of probabilities what I find has happened is that following the unfortunate failure of the contact on 21 October, Mrs. A spoke to C about her father. I cannot believe that C instigated the conversation.  Questioned by Mrs. A, C may well have told her mother about getting into her father&#8217;s bed, and sitting on top of him when he was in bed. That innocent activity has been transmuted by Mrs. A into an allegation of sexual misbehaviour. That had happened, because, despite her protestations to the contrary, Mrs. A remains profoundly angry with Mr. A, and profoundly anxious that C and B may be removed from her care. </p>

The evidence in this case &#8211; the medical bundle in particular, cries out with the message that these two children were suffering because of their parents&#8217; mutual hostility. That is a message, which I endorse.  Each of the parents dealt with their anger in different ways, but that each was very angry I had no doubt. I think Mr A is sometimes able to disguise his anger under a professional veneer, but equally, I think he underestimates the effect of his anger about Mrs. A on the children. They are well able to appreciate how angry he is.  Children should not either be exposed to, or to be expected to cope with such a complex emotional dynamic. </p>

I made it quite clear that there was absolutely no reason why C and B should not see their father and stay in his household. They were not at risk of any form of physical or sexual abuse. The only risk was emotional abuse caused by difficulties over contact. There was no reason why, with Mrs. P&#8217;s help, extensive contact over Christmas should not be agreed. I looked to both parties, but Mrs. A in particular, to work with Mrs. P to facilitate contact. I told Mrs. A that I would not be impressed, if this case came back to me for a further contested hearing, if I was told by her that C did not want to go to contact. If C continued to say she did not want to go to contact that could only mean that Mrs. A did not want her to go to contact. She had assured me this is not the case. The proof of the pudding, in the trite phrase, would be in the eating.</p>

She expressed her surprise that the issue of C being at risk of sexual abuse had been raised again by Mrs. A, and that she had involved her vicar and two friends.  The consequence had been that, for the first time, B and C had spent Christmas apart, and Mr. A&#8217;s Christmas arrangements for himself and his extended family had been wrecked.</p>

		<p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:1in">NYAS and I decided that prior to the hearing on 30 December 2002, I should see both B and C to carry out the most up-to-date assessment of the children as possible. From my interviews today with C, it is clear that she is rather fed up with talking about an incident, which she herself does not describe as a serious event, when she was playing with her father in his bedroom, some time ago. During the play, her father lifted C on top of him. C did not like this. C says that they continued playing afterwards. She did not exhibit any undue stress on talking about this; apart from when she was asked by myself to clarify why she had said it was like sex.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">It is apparent that C is still rather innocent about sexual matters, and thinks sex is like kissing and lying on top of each other, as she had seen in a James Bond movie. I am of the view that C&#8217;s rather innocent statements about this event have been distorted and exaggerated out of all proportion by her mother and her friends. I believe that C&#8217;s understanding about what constitutes sex has been misinterpreted. SM and JJ have not explored with C the context that this event took place. I accept that C, with prompting from her mother, now says she did not like this, but to me she put it clearly in the context of having taken place during a play session with her father, rather than being in a context where Mr. A gained sexual pleasure out of it&#8230;</p>

She says she does not love her father and does not want to see him. She says this repetitively, without emotion and rather as if this is a learnt mantra. I am now concerned that C&#8217;s own reality has been taken away from her. She can only see what her mother wants her to see&#8230;.</span></p>

However, I took the view that this course was not appropriate on the facts of the instant case.  There would be a substantial delay, and the children were in urgent need of respite. Foster care was inappropriate. Although Mr. A had been as engaged in the battle as Mrs. A it was more likely that, at least in the interim, the children would be under less pressure living with him than with Mrs. A. Equally, a removal into Mr A&#8217;s care was the only means of ensuring that C would maintain her loving relationship with her father. </p>

A great deal of work remained to be done with both Mr and Mrs A, and I accepted Mrs. P&#8217;s advice that there should be a psychological assessment by a psychologist, BC, and that the position should be reviewed in three months.

Contact with their mother was introduced in accordance with the proposals made on 30 December 2002. Both children appeared happy at school. Work began with the psychologist designed to establish how best Mr. and Mrs. A could exercise their shared parental responsibility.  In her report for the directions hearing dated 24 February 2003 Mrs. P identified NYAS&#8217; goal as moving towards shared residence. Contained within the report was a proposal for the equal division of the children&#8217;s time over a given fortnight.  Annexed to the report was a more ambitious schedule setting out the proposed division of time up until 24 April 2003. Shared residence accorded with what the children wanted. NYAS recommended that Mr. BC have permission to see the children and observe their relationship with both parents as part of his assessment, and that the case be listed for final hearing.</p>

I did this because I was advised by NYAS that considerable progress had been made in the case and that the children were now happily dividing their time equally between their parents. There was also a suggestion that, following meetings between Mr and Mrs A with Mr. BC and Mrs. P, Mr and Mrs A were beginning to be able to reach amicable agreements about how they were going to communicate and make decisions about the children in the future.  Mr. BC&#8217;s opinion was that this work should continue for another six months, as there were still many issues unresolved. </p>

The cycle would then recommence. The advantage of the scheme was that in term time the children were delivered to and collected from school, thus avoiding parental contact at handovers.</p>

Mr. A&#8217;s conviction that all the family&#8217;s difficulties were attributable to Mrs. A, and that she suffered from some defect of personality which made it impossible for her to change made me think that, despite his understandable sense of outrage at the allegations of misbehaviour made against him, he had really learnt nothing from the whole process.  The damage caused to these children flows directly from the mutual antipathy of their parents. That is simply not the responsibility of one or the other: it is the responsibility of both.  Mr. A demonstrated that antipathy in the meetings with Mrs. A, Mr. BC and Mrs. P.  He does not appear to be able to see that this is an antipathy, which his children do not share, nor should they. That, after all, was his complaint against Mrs. A &#8211; that she was alienating C in particular from him.</p>

If Mr. A&#8217;s attitude cannot soften in any way towards Mrs. A, I see real tensions ahead between the children and himself, and further harm caused to the children arising from his attitude.</p>

Hale LJ cites a passage (at <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 1 FLR 499" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 1 FLR 499</ref>) from the Law Commission&#8217;s Report (Law Com No 172 published in 1988) on which the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> is based, and which bears repetition.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">Apart from the effect on the other parent, which has already been mentioned, the main difference between a residence order and a custody order is that the new order should be flexible enough to accommodate a much wider range of situations.  In some cases, the child may live with both parents even though they do not share the same household.  It was never our intention to suggest that children should share their time more or less equally between their parents.  Such arrangements will rarely be practicable, let alone for the children&#8217;s benefit.  However, the evidence from the United States is that where they are practicable they can work well and we see no reason why they should be actively discouraged.  None of our respondents shared the view expressed in a recent case [<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Riley</span><span style="font-weight:bold">&#8217;s</span> case] that such an arrangement, which had been working well for some years, should never have been made.  More commonly, however, the child will live with both parents but spend more time with one than the other.  Examples might be where he spends term time with one and holidays with the other, or two out of three holidays from boarding school with one and the third with the other.  It is a far more realistic description of the responsibilities involved in that sort of arrangement to make a residence order covering both parents rather than a residence order for one and a contact order for the other.  Hence we recommend that where the child is to live with two (or more) people who do not live together, the order may specify the periods during which the child is to live in each household.  The specification may be general rather than detailed and in some cases may not be necessary at all.</p>

However, a shared care order has the advantage of being more realistic in those cases where the child is to spend considerable amount of time with both parents, brings with it certain other benefits (including the right to remove the child from accommodation provided by a local authority under s.20), and removes any impression that one parent is good and responsible whereas the other parent is not.&#8217;</p>

It is a basic principle that, post separation, each parent with parental responsibility retains an equal and independent right and responsibility to be informed and make appropriate decisions about their children. However, where children are being looked after by one parent, that parent needs to be in a position to take the day-to-day decisions that have to be taken while that parent is caring for the children. Parents should not be seeking to interfere with one another in matters, which are taking place while they do not have the care of their children. Subject to any questions which are regulated by court order, the object of the exercise should be to maintain flexible and practical arrangements whenever possible.  </p>

It must, therefore, reflect the reality of the children&#8217;s lives. Where children are living with one parent and are either not seeing the other parents or the amount of time to be spent with the other parent is limited or undecided, there cannot be a shared residence order. However, where children are spending a substantial amount of time with both their parents, a shared residence order reflects the reality of the children&#8217;s lives.

In <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Re A</span>, there were three children, a boy and two girls. The girls lived with their mother and the boy lived with his father. The boy was unwilling to see his mother, and was not doing so.  A Recorder made a shared residence order. The father applied for permission to appeal.  Granting permission to appeal and allowing the appeal in part, the Court of Appeal set aside the shared residence orders. In so doing, Hale LJ said (at [2002] 1 FCR 177 at 181: -</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in"><span style="font-weight:bold">17] I</span> completely appreciate why the recorder wished to make a shared residence order in this case.  He wanted to recognise the equal status of each parent in relation to all three of these children.  He may, although he does not say so, have been afraid that the father would not recognise this if he did not make a shared residence order in relation to all three children.  But the law is that the parents already have shared parental responsibility for their children.  They have equal and independent power to exercise that parental responsibility.  A residence order is about where a child is to live.  It is very difficult to make such an order about a child who is not only not living with one of the parents but is, for the foreseeable future, unlikely even to visit with that parent.  Notwithstanding, therefore, that that parent does not wish there to be any distinction between the children, because she does not wish M to feel rejected by her, the court&#8217;s order has to be designed to reflect the real position<span style="font-weight:bold"/>on the ground.  That being the case, in my view the shared residence order in relation to M was inappropriate.  For that order there should be substituted an order that M is to live with his father and to have contact with his mother in the same terms as the order laid down by the learned recorder.</p>

The Court of Appeal, upholding her decision, said that such a distance did not preclude the possibility that the children&#8217;s year could be divided between the homes of two separated parents in such a way as to validate the making of a shared residence order. A shared residence order had to reflect the underlying reality of where the children lived their lives, and was not made to deal with parental status. Any lingering idea that a shared residence order was apt only where the children alternated between the two homes evenly was erroneous. If the home offered by each parent was of equal status and importance to the children an order for shared residence would be valuable.</p>

Here, the parents are not, alas, capable of working in harmony. There must, accordingly, be an order.

Mrs. A sought to control the children, with seriously adverse consequence for the family. She failed.  Control is not what this family needs. What it needs is co-operation. By making a shared residence order the court is making that point. These parents have joint and equal parental responsibility. The residence of the children is shared between them. These facts need to be recognised by an order for shared residence.</p>
