On 25 May 2022, following a positive viability assessment of the paternal grandparents, the children moved to their care and I made interim care orders to ensure there was a robust safeguarding framework around what was, potentially, a more vulnerable family placement. </p>

At the first case management hearing on 25 May 2022 I listed it for a fact-finding hearing in the first available slot, which was at the end of November 2022. Unfortunately that fixture was lost due to the need for genetic testing of both parents (which had to be conducted by a laboratory in Germany) and a further specialist medical opinion following on from that testing. Thereafter the earliest date on which the hearing could be re-listed was in April 2023. </p>

In November 2022 the children moved to the care of their maternal grandparents, where they have remained. The maternal grandmother, Mrs N, had originally been joined as an intervener but after the medical evidence was received the local authority indicated that it no longer sought to place her in the pool of potential perpetrators, and she was discharged. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The local authority&#8217;s primary position is that S&#8217;s injuries were inflicted by one or both of his parents. The local authority does not suggest that either parent acted deliberately or maliciously. Its case is that the most likely cause of each injury was a build-up of anger or frustration on the part of one of the parents, leading to a momentary loss of control. The local authority&#8217;s case is that there is insufficient evidence to identify which of the parents perpetrated the injuries. </p>

I had originally understood this finding to be sought in the alternative, in the event that I made a finding that S&#8217;s injuries were caused during these periods, but having reviewed the threshold document during the course of submissions I see that this is in fact a free-standing allegation of neglect, which the local authority is seeking irrespective of my findings about the injuries.</p>

There are two potential explanations for the injuries which have been put forward on their behalf, although neither is advanced as a positive case.</p>

On her behalf, however, Ms Cheetham has drawn my attention to aspects of the evidence which the guardian considers to be of particular relevance. It is probably fair to say that the submissions on behalf of the guardian pointed towards a finding of inflicted injury; indeed, as I will explain later, Ms Cheetham suggested that at least one of the potential alternative explanations put forward on behalf of the parents was so unlikely that it could be definitively ruled out. Similarly, while careful to emphasise that the guardian was not seeking a finding against either parent, Ms Cheetham highlighted some of the evidence which might tend to suggest that the father rather than the mother was responsible, and reminded the court of the advantages of identifying a perpetrator where it is possible to do so. </p>

It is also a tautology: the true distinction is between an accident which is unexpected and unintentional and an injury which involves an element of wrong. That element of wrong may involve a lack of care and/or an intent of a greater or lesser degree that may amount to negligence, recklessness or deliberate infliction. While an analysis of that kind may be helpful to distinguish deliberate infliction from, say, negligence, it is unnecessary in any consideration of whether the threshold criteria are satisfied because what the statute requires is something different namely, findings of fact that at least satisfy the significant harm, attributability and objective standard of care elements of s 31(2) of the CA 1989.</p>

But the more important point is that the court must be careful to place an expert&#8217;s opinion that a fracture has been caused &#8220;non-accidentally&#8221; within the context in which it is offered. The expert is giving an opinion about causation, based on the nature of the injury and his or her clinical experience. The court&#8217;s role is not to categorise the injury, but to determine whether it is attributable to the care being given to the child by the parents not being what it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give. In making that determination the court must survey all the evidence, both expert and lay. </p>

Dr Ellis&#8217;s investigations were extremely thorough and he went to significant lengths to explore the potential significance of a genetic variant found during genetic testing of S. In the end no party has sought to suggest that S suffers from any congenital condition which could have caused or contributed to the fractures he has sustained. </p>

There was some discussion in the experts&#8217; meeting about the degree of twisting involved in an oblique, as opposed to spiral, fracture. Dr Oates, to whom Dr Ellis deferred, said that he thought there was likely to have been &#8220;some pulling action, but a degree of twisting&#8230; I can&#8217;t say how much of this was twisting and how much of it was pulling. It is likely to be a combination of both&#8221;. In oral evidence he repeated that &#8220;trauma does not occur in a lab environment&#8230; in reality, if a force is applied, unless it&#8217;s applied right down the centre of the bone there is likely to be some associated twisting action&#8221;. </p>

Dr Oates said that rib fractures in infants and young children are exceptionally unusual: &#8220;a baby is evolutionarily designed to negotiate, without injury, the very narrow space of the birth canal and therefore the ribs are inherently pliable&#8221;. </p>

In the experts&#8217; meeting the experts discussed the possibility of both the rib and humerus fractures being caused during an incident of this nature. Dr Oates suggested a scenario in which T jumped and landed on S with one knee landing on his back and one on his humerus, creating a twisting effect. Dr Cartlidge suggested a heel or knee landing on the chest and then sliding down onto the humerus. Both agreed that this would have to be an exceptional and unusual event. </p>

As a radiologist at a large paediatric trauma centre he has vast experience of interpreting radiographs of young children. His hospital (Birmingham Children&#8217;s Hospital) carries out between 250 and 300 such x-rays each week. They are most often done because there is a concern that the child may have a chest infection or other non-traumatic illness. It is &#8220;vanishingly rare&#8221; to see an incidental fracture on such an x-ray. Dr Oates emphasised that the issue of fractures in young children was an area of work that he was &#8220;passionate about&#8221;, read about a lot and discussed with colleagues. He thought that if there were reports of either of the mechanisms suggested on behalf of the parents causing rib fractures in young babies, he would be aware of them. </p>

In his written report he gave the opinion that S would have been distressed for about 5 to 10 minutes after each of the fractures was sustained. In his oral evidence he accepted that if he had been breastfed soon after this would have had a soothing effect, and would reduce the duration of his crying; he said he could not say how long the duration would be in those circumstances, but when a timeframe of one to two minutes was put to him he responded that that sounded too brief.

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">&#8220;Each of the rib fractures would have been initially painful, probably for about 10 minutes. The right-sided fractures could have been caused by a single event. Thereafter the pain would have lessened, but deep breaths, crying and handling around the chest would have exacerbated ongoing discomfort causing S to be more fractious than usual for at least a few days. Yet, young babies cry so frequently without a specific reason being identifiable that the cause of his ongoing distress is unlikely to have been recognised by someone unaware of any trauma. There might have been bruising on the chest if it had been tightly gripped. Occasionally, a crackling sensation can be felt or heard from fractured bone ends grating against each other. [&#8230;] If the Court finds the revealed accounts of symptomatology to be reliable, then S being noticed to have a popping/cracking sound coming from his torso/chest and also abnormal breathing during the early evening of 22 April 2022 is very suggestive of the right-sided rib fractures being present at this time.&#8221;</p>

If the events were unwitnessed, the humerus injury would be likely to be noticed if the right shoulder or elbow was substantially moved, such as during dressing or undressing. If the rib fractures were unwitnessed, any person caring for S would be likely to have noticed that he was crying more than usual, but unlikely to have known that he had been injured. </p>

Based on the likely mechanism involved (i.e. a compressive action to the chest), I cannot exclude such a scenario with certainty but I believe it would have to be considered a highly unusual event to sustain so many rib fractures, and would not obviously explain the right humeral fracture. Similarly, the possibility that S&#8217;s older brother T may have inadvertently caused the injuries would seem unlikely. I will expand upon my interpretation in the main body of the report but ultimately, I have concerns that the true explanation for the injuries has not been disclosed.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Dr Ellis was assiduous in following up this result. He arranged for both parents to be tested; this revealed that the mother had the same VUS as S. He contacted a number of laboratories to ask for clinical information about others who had been found to carry the same VUS, obtaining three responses which provided information about 11 patients. Ultimately he concluded that it was unlikely that the VUS found in S had caused any increased bone fragility. This was based on the absence of any relevant clinical features in the mother; the fact that S had sustained no further fractures as he become more mobile; and a lack of evidence of a preponderance of bone fractures in others carrying the same VUS. That conclusion is not challenged. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The second medical loose end is that the radiological investigations raised the possibility for Dr Oates that S might have suffered further fractures beyond the rib and humeral fractures identified above. In his written report Dr Oates observed that the Part 1 skeletal survey showed an irregularity and slight angulation of the right distal tibia metaphysis (the lower part of the shin bone). He said that this &#8220;raises concern for a specific type of fracture known as a classical metaphyseal lesion fracture&#8230;. While I have my suspicions that this is a further injury, I cannot be categorical based on this or the part 2 skeletal survey, and the possibility that the appearance falls within normal limits cannot be excluded&#8221;. In his oral evidence Dr Oates explained that he had given this issue considerable thought, and ultimately had decided that he could not state that this was a further fracture. Again, that conclusion is accepted and the local authority does not seek a finding of any further fractures beyond those to S&#8217;s ribs and humerus. </p>

So was I. In the Family Court, where sadly many parents have experienced trauma that affects their ability to create secure attachments in their children, it is sometimes easy to forget what ordinary good quality parenting looks like. It was obvious from the mother&#8217;s evidence (and that of the supporting lay witnesses) that in the weeks following S&#8217;s birth the mother was completely, and delightedly, absorbed in her children. Her evidence was in no way rose-tinted: she described the tiredness, the challenges of juggling the needs of a toddler and a baby, and having to learn new strategies for this when previously she had only needed to focus on one child. But it was also clear from all of the evidence that she was enjoying the challenge: &#8220;in her element&#8221; was Mrs O&#8217;s description of her. </p>

Again I agree. By that I do not mean to exclude the possibility of a sudden loss of control, which even a loving and attuned parent may be susceptible to. What is more significant, in my view, is that I am very confident that if this mother had known or suspected that S had suffered an injury she would not have left him without medical attention, and would immediately have sought help, regardless of the consequences for her or anyone else. </p>

I have had the conduct of this case since these proceedings were issued; I have taken note of how the parents have conducted themselves in court, how and when their evidence has been produced, and how they have responded as the medical evidence has come in. I have also gathered information about their family life and how their relationship works from the documentation, including the evidence and assessments of family members, and the medical notes including the family support worker notes over the period when S was in hospital and the parents were closely observed. I do not think these parents would have been able to manage a shared guilty secret over such a long period of time. It would, I think, have torn them apart. In fact one of the lay witnesses said that the experience of the past year, horrific as it has been, has strengthened their relationship and &#8220;gelled&#8221; them together. </p>

For example, at the outset of his evidence the father corrected an estimated time-frame he had given for leaving the children alone in the living-room on 22 April 2022, from &#8220;5 to 10 minutes&#8221; in his witness statement, to no more than three minutes. The reduction in the time estimate potentially limited the father&#8217;s exposure to the local authority&#8217;s allegation of neglect, but a far more significant potential adverse consequence for him was that it reduced the time available for T to fall and land on S, and therefore weakened the likelihood of the injuries having occurred unnoticed on this occasion. </p>

A significant concern for the medical experts has been the parents&#8217; failure to identify any occasion when S&#8217;s injuries could have been caused accidentally. It would have been easy for them, as the evidence developed, to suggest that they had on reflection remembered an occasion when S screamed more loudly than usual during the night; or for the father to say that when he returned to the living room on the evening of 22 April S&#8217;s crying was louder than when he had left. Even an innocent parent might well feel a temptation in the circumstances of this case to embellish or exaggerate their evidence. These parents have not done so. </p>

During S&#8217;s time in hospital, the mother stayed with him and the local authority put in place arrangements to ensure that he was constantly supervised by a family support worker. During this period the police and/ or the local authority asked the parents to put together a timeline of events leading up to the hospital admission. It is clear from the FSW notes that the parents worked on this document together, in the presence of various family support workers. They did not need to do that: there were times when the mother left S to be watched by a FSW and, for example, went to the cafeteria to spend time with the father and T (who was not allowed on the ward). If there had been any intention to deceive, either or both could have taken steps to ensure that the timeline was prepared in private, without a third party listening in. They did not. </p>

The mechanism involved in an injury caused by T must necessarily have involved a significant number of variables (the relative positioning of the children, and T&#8217;s unpredictable movements) that would be unlikely to recur. Further, T and S were together unsupervised only very rarely and for short periods of time, and there is no evidence that they were left alone at all in S&#8217;s first few weeks (over the period of the first injury), when the father was on paternity leave and there were many visits to and from family members. </p>

In her submissions Ms Badejo pointed out that S slept in bed between his parents for 33 nights. If the first injury was caused in this way, and went unnoticed, from that point onwards the event that caused the subsequent injuries could well be described as an accident waiting to happen. </p>

In the experts&#8217; meeting Dr Cartlidge said that he was &#8220;straining&#8221; to suggest a mechanism by which this could have happened; in his oral evidence, having viewed one of the videos produced by the parents showing T jumping off the sofa, he said that on reflection a further mechanism might be a stumble which involved T&#8217;s knee landing on S&#8217;s chest, and the heel of his hand on the mid shaft of the right humerus. </p>

The medical evidence is to the effect that a scenario of this nature must be highly unusual, because very many young babies have boisterous older siblings, and yet babies very rarely present at hospital with rib fractures. It follows that for a young baby to be injured by a sibling on two separate occasions must be extraordinarily unlikely. This is compounded by the fact that there is no history of T being left alone with S during the period when the first injury occurred, and it is unlikely that he would have been. </p>

She was also, inevitably, tired after childbirth, nights spent breastfeeding on demand and days spent caring for a toddler and young baby (I note from the FSW records that there was at least one occasion in the hospital when she fell asleep while feeding S in the night; and another when, half-awake, she reached out for him and pulled him by the arm without realising what she was doing).

This would have been likely to agitate any injuries, and it is difficult to understand how S could have presented as he did during that visit &#8211; as a normal, contented baby &#8211; if he had already suffered the significant injuries that were found the following morning. I note that during his stay in hospital S was clearly suffering pain and there were a couple of occasions when he became distressed when his pain medication was due. </p>

However she was very well supported, and I am not sure that there were in fact many days when she did not have the company of another adult: the evidence of Mrs O and Mrs N made it clear that they were very much around and on hand, and they were by no means the only people who visited the mother, or were visited by her, during that time. Although the mother was on maternity leave the parents kept up T&#8217;s childcare routine, so T was at nursery on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and spent Thursdays with Mrs N. It was therefore only on Mondays and Fridays that the mother had a full day with both children together. </p>

S was breastfeeding on demand; he was a hungry baby and sometimes would feed as frequently as every hour, or &#8220;cluster feed&#8221; for several hours at a time. As is quite common, the father&#8217;s main role was to care for and entertain T. The mother told me that, as when T had been a newborn, for S &#8220;mum was everything&#8221; and if there was a choice of either parent, he was always going to settle with her rather than with his father. I did not get the sense that either parent saw this as unusual or negative: their expectation, clearly, was that S&#8217;s relationship with his father would develop when he was a little older, as T&#8217;s had done: Mrs N described him as &#8220;T&#8217;s best mate&#8221;. Ms Badejo made the powerful point in submissions that if the father had trouble settling S, all he needed to do was hand him to his mother. There were few, if any, occasions when she was not on hand. </p>

The father was on paternity leave for most of the relevant period, and the days were a combination of days at home getting used to being a family of four, and visits to and from family and friends. There was very little time when either parent was alone with the children. They were almost always together, and for much of the time in the company of others. </p>

During the visit he gave them his phone and they told him they were on their way to visit the mother. The police records suggest that the officers were mildly surprised that after the visit, the father made it to the hospital before they did, and there is a suggestion that he may have been hoping to influence the mother&#8217;s account. The father&#8217;s answer, borne out by other documentation, is that after the police took his phone he immediately went to buy new ones for both himself and the mother, and took hers to the hospital. He asked, reasonably, if he had been motivated to influence her account why he would have stopped at Tesco&#8217;s to buy the phone. </p>

It seems fairly clear from the notes of the 111 call that the possibility of a traumatic injury (as opposed to an illness) was first raised by the call handler, and the father&#8217;s suggestion of the sling as a potential cause arose in response to that. In any case, I am not sure that it is correct that the parents did not discuss this in the brief period before the mother left with S for the hospital: neither could remember with any clarity the content of any conversation between them at that point. Even if it is, I do not see how it points towards the father&#8217;s guilt. </p>

Their initial response when S became unsettled was to see how he progressed; when he was no better in the morning, they called 111 for advice, and when that was given (and especially when they discovered that his arm was floppy) the mother rushed immediately to the hospital (the 111 call finished at 8.16 and the mother&#8217;s and S&#8217;s arrival at the hospital was registered at 9.03). There is no sense that either sought to prevaricate or stall once the possibility had been raised (by the 111 call handler) that S&#8217;s condition might be serious. Equally, the decision to wait out the night to see if S&#8217;s presentation changed is consistent with a shared assumption (the father told me that, inevitably, the parents were googling S&#8217;s symptoms) that the most likely explanation for S&#8217;s presentation was a cold or chest infection rather than an injury. </p>

I think it highly likely, having considered the evidence relating to both parents, that if either had experienced a momentary loss of control, causing them to act in such a way as to cause S significant injury, he or she would have been horrified and immediately remorseful. I struggle with the idea that either parent could or would have allowed S to suffer pain without seeking medical attention for him<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">
		<p class="FootnoteText"><span> </span>S&#8217;s increased fractiousness as a baby, compared to T, adds weight to this argument. It seems likely that a guilty parent would have interpreted the behaviour of a baby who woke more frequently, and seemed more unsettled, as a potential sign of injury or pain. I remind myself that the parent in question would not have known that the injury was a broken rib, that would heal without treatment: there would surely have been a real fear that an even more serious injury had occurred. </p>

Some treat their children with kid gloves; others are more robust. During the course of a day caring for small children most parents will take the odd risk and make the odd misjudgement. Most of the time nothing bad happens and the parent breathes a sigh of relief. Sometimes things go wrong and the child is hurt, but unless the parent&#8217;s behaviour has crossed the line which divides ordinary real-life parenting from unacceptable negligence, the professional response &#8211; rightly &#8211; is to treat these events as accidents. After all, it would be possible, in theory, to prevent almost every accident if children were never allowed to run or jump or climb, and if their every move were monitored by an adult who remained within arm&#8217;s reach and undistracted at all times. But that is not how normal family life works. </p>
