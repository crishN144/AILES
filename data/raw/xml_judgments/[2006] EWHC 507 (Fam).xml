	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I would like to begin this judgment with three preliminary comments.   First and foremost, I am deeply conscious how stressful a case such as this is, above all, obviously, for the parents of the child concerned; but also for the doctors who have made a profound professional judgment which is now held up to intense and, in this case, very public scrutiny.   I would like to thank the parents and also the doctors for their courtesy, patience and, so far as is possible in such a case, good humour throughout so stressful a hearing.   Secondly, I am very grateful indeed to all the advocates both for their sensitivity and also for their great help to me during what is, obviously, a very difficult case for the court.   I hope that, whatever the outcome, each side will feel that their advocate has served them well.   Thirdly, since the second day of this hearing I have sat in public with a number of journalists and others present.   I am in no doubt that it was appropriate that this case, not just this judgment but almost the whole of the evidence, be heard in public and I am glad that the BBC made their application. I have not personally felt that the presence of the media has been intrusive in the court room; nor, so far as I could observe, has it been oppressive to, or added to the burden upon, the parents, even when giving their evidence.   I thank the media for the sensitivity they have shown, at any rate within the court room.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this judgment I will call Mr B &#8220;the father&#8221; and Mrs B &#8220;the mother&#8221;, and refer to them collectively as &#8220;the parents&#8221;.   The father is aged 29 and the mother is aged 22.   They married in January 2004.   The mother has two children from a previous relationship, a boy aged 5 and a girl aged 4, who are treated as if they were the children of this father.   The only child of their own marriage is M who was born on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2004 and is now aged 18 months.   At birth he appeared entirely normal.   When he was a few weeks old his parents began to realise he was unwell or not developing normally.   In particular he seemed to be very floppy.   They took him to a nearby hospital on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2004 when he was just 7 weeks old.   He has never since left that hospital, which contains within it highly specialist staff and facilities for the treatment and care of babies and children.   Very soon indeed the doctors diagnosed, and the diagnosis is undoubted and not in issue, that M suffers from spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">SMA is a congenital condition resulting from an inherited genetic abnormality.   Neither parent knew that they were carriers of that abnormality.   In all its types or forms SMA may affect about one in every 6,000 people born in this country.   However it can vary very considerably indeed in severity.   As a result, doctors internationally use a scale to classify severity.   In Type O cases the baby is born dead.   Amongst survivors at birth, Type 1 is the most,  Type 2 a less, and Type 3 the least severe.   The type into which a child falls depends upon the age of onset and the degree of functional performance or loss of performance.   Type 2 and 3 cases may only manifest a considerable time, perhaps even years, after birth and the degree of impairment may only be relatively limited.   Many such people live very full and active lives, and I wish to stress that this case and this judgment simply have nothing to do at all with SMA in its less severe forms.   Within Type 1 there is sometimes a further sub-division into tenths, with 1.1 the most severe of all and 1.9 the least severe of the Type 1 case, bordering with, or merging into, Type 2.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">M was admitted to hospital at 7 weeks, when the condition was at once apparent to, and diagnosed by, specialist doctors.   The floppiness was becoming noticeable to his parents even before that.   This early onset, coupled with the later course of the disease in M, leads to the diagnosis, which is not in issue, that he has Type 1 SMA, at or around the severity of 1.1, i.e. the most severe of all amongst those who are not born dead.   Dr Philip Jardine, a consultant paediatric neurologist who specialises, amongst other matters, in caring for children with SMA, was instructed on behalf of the parents in this case as an expert witness.   He has examined M and all his medical records but is not one of the doctors who treat him.   He described M as &#8220;the most severely affected child with SMA that I have ever personally seen&#8221;.   All the doctors who have given evidence or reported, whether as treating doctors or as expert witnesses, are united in the view that the disease in M is very severe indeed.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The condition is degenerative and progressive, i.e. it can only get worse.   It may in some sufferers reach a plateau, but it cannot get better.   It affects the voluntary muscles (but not the involuntary muscles such as those of the heart) which become progressively weaker and may ultimately cease to work at all.   Since the affected muscles include the respiratory muscles, death is, in a true  Type 1 case, absolutely inevitable unless, after a certain point (usually only a few months of age, and before the age of one year), artificial ventilation, i.e. breathing, is commenced.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In M&#8217;s case he could initially use many of his muscles in an age-normal way.   For instance, he could formerly cry audibly, smile, swallow, breathe and move his limbs, although he never reached the point of being able to sit unaided.   Very sadly indeed, he has now reached a point where, save for movement of his eyes and possible slight but barely perceptible movement of his eyebrows, corners of his mouth, thumb and toes or feet, he cannot move at all (whether he can still move even to this extent is in issue and I will refer to the evidence later).   He has not been able to breathe unaided at all since July 2005.   He has required positive pressure ventilation via an invasive endo-tracheal tube (i.e. a pipe passing through his nostrils and down his windpipe towards his lungs, through which air/oxygen is pumped under pressure) continuously since October 2005.   He cannot swallow at all, and has been fed through a gastrostomy tube (i.e. a tube inserted through his tummy into his stomach) continuously ever since November 2004.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In addition to suffering SMA, M also suffers or has suffered epileptic fits.   Epilepsy is not a recognised symptom or side-effect of SMA.   In M&#8217;s case it may either be an inter-current disease which he just happens to suffer as well; or it may (I stress, may) be a consequence of an episode of hypoxia (i.e. loss of oxygen to the brain) at some stage due to his breathing difficulties.   Currently his epilepsy is controlled by drugs and he has not had any seizure for some time.   The fact that he suffers epilepsy, but of a kind that can be controlled by drugs, is really irrelevant to the issues in this case except that it <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">may</span>, I stress may, be an indicator that he has suffered some brain damage due to hypoxia.   </p>

	    <num>10.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The NHS Trust, in reality the treating doctors, consider that the quality of life for M is now so low and that the burdens of living are now so great that it is unethical (the word &#8220;cruel&#8221; has been used) to continue artificially to keep him alive, and that his endo-tracheal tube should be withdrawn.   By the use of sedatives, he could have a peaceful, pain free and dignified death, but he would die almost immediately, probably within a few minutes.   I stress very strongly indeed that the level of sedation would merely be sufficient to prevent pain and distress.   The sedatives would not cause death.   He would die from his own inability to breathe.   However M is not unconscious, still less in a permanent vegetative state.   He is conscious.   He is awake most or all of the day, and then sleeps at night.   It is probable, and must certainly be assumed, that he continues to see and to hear and to feel touch; to have an awareness of his surroundings and in particular of the people who are most close to him, his family; and to have the normal thoughts and thought processes of a small child of 18 months, with the proviso that because he has never left his hospital bed he has not experienced the same range of stimuli and experiences that a more normal 18 month old might: for instance, he has never, since he was 7 weeks old, been outside.   But people talk to him and stories are read to him; he is shown TV and DVDs and music is played to him on CDs; and it must be assumed that he processes all these sights and sounds in his mind like any other child of his age and gains pleasure  from them.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There have been legal cases and decisions in which approval has been given for the withdrawal of life support from, followed by immediate death of, brain dead or severely brain damaged children or patients.   And there have been legal cases and decisions (of which the case of Charlotte Wyatt is an example) in which advance approval has been given not to embark upon (i.e. to withhold) forms of treatment or life support, if later needed, if the condition of a child is very poor.   So far as I am aware, no court has yet been asked to approve that, against the will of the child&#8217;s parents, life support may be withdrawn or discontinued, with the predictable, inevitable and immediate death of a conscious child with sensory awareness and assumed normal cognition and no reliable evidence of any significant brain damage.</p>

In the first case he did make an order giving approval and permission for artificial ventilation to be discontinued to a baby of 3 months, which would result (as in the present case) in immediate death.   But in that case, as a result of meningitis, the baby had suffered &#8220;a serious degree of brain damage&#8221; and was &#8220;subjected to repeated convulsions due to the brain damage&#8221;.   She had what was described as &#8220;cerebral blindness&#8221; and could not see or hear in any normal sense of those terms.   Sir Stephen said &#8220;It is almost a living death.   She is not in a coma as medically defined; she has a very low awareness of anything, if at all&#8221;.   I could not use that description of M.   Further, in that case the parents themselves agreed with the decision (see page 45 C).   </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the second case, the child concerned, like M, suffered from Type 1 SMA.   She, like M, was conscious.   Further, she was able to recognise her parents and to smile.   However, unlike M, she was only on intermittent positive pressure ventilation.   The doctors considered, and the parents agreed, that she should be weaned off that ventilation before she became fully dependant upon it.   The issue was whether, if or when she suffered a respiratory arrest,  positive pressure ventilation should be restarted.   The parents sought an order that it should be, but Sir Stephen Brown P declined to grant one, in part because of the well established principle that a court will not order a doctor to undertake a course of treatment which the doctor is unwilling to do (see page 5, left hand column); but also because Sir Stephen expressly held that it was in the best interests of the child not later to reimpose ventilation if needed (page 5, right hand column).   Since the doctors considered that a respiratory        arrest would be inevitable (see page 3) the case is very close to the present one.   But it did not involve or contemplate the immediate death of the conscious child; and the actual withdrawal of intermittent ventilation was agreed to, and supported, by the parents.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is a well established procedure whereby in disputed cases a hospital or NHS Trust can apply to the High Court for a declaration.   In accordance with that procedure, the NHS Trust in this case applied in December 2005 for a declaration:  1) (as is obvious) that M lacks the capacity to make decisions with regard to his future medical treatment; and 2) that it shall be lawful, notwithstanding his parents&#8217; refusal to consent, and in M&#8217;s best interests for [the medical staff]  (a) to withdraw all forms of ventilation from him, and (b) generally to furnish such treatment by way of pain relief or sedation and nursing care as may be appropriate to ensure M suffers the least distress and pain and retains the greatest dignity [viz. at the time and in the manner of his dying].</p>

That application reflects &#8220;Option 3&#8221; in the range of treatment &#8220;options&#8221; to which I will later refer.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The case concerns in its widest sense &#8220;the upbringing of a child&#8221; and accordingly <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> provides the statutory test that &#8220;the child&#8217;s welfare shall be the court&#8217;s paramount consideration.&#8221;   But the case also concerns someone who is a patient; and when what is ultimately in issue is when and by what processes the child/patient should be allowed to die, the case concerns &#8220;upbringing&#8221; in a very special and intense sense, and that short statutory test needs some elaboration.   But the law around this topic is now well established and tolerably clear and can, I believe, be shortly stated in the following propositions without the need for copious reference to authority.   The essence of these propositions lies in the &#8220;intellectual milestones&#8221; to which the Court of Appeal referred in paragraph 87 of the reserved judgment of the court in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Wyatt v Portsmouth Hospital NHS Trust <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2005/1181" uk:canonical="[2005] EWCA Civ 1181" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] EWCA Civ 1181</ref>.</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I avoid reference to the concept of &#8220;intolerability&#8221;.    It seems to me that it all depends on what one means by &#8220;intolerable&#8221; and that use of that word really expresses a conclusion rather than provides a test.   If it is correct to say, or once it has been concluded, that life is literally &#8220;intolerable&#8221;, then it is hard to see in what circumstances it should be artificially prolonged.   If, conversely, it is &#8220;tolerable&#8221; then it is hard to see in what circumstances it should be permitted, avoidably, to end.   In any event the most recent word from the Court of Appeal on this concept of &#8220;intolerability&#8221; is that contained within the reserved judgment of the court in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Wyatt v Portsmouth Hospital NHS Trust</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2005/1181" uk:canonical="[2005] EWCA Civ 1181" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] EWCA Civ 1181</ref> at paragraphs 76 and 91 where they say that the concept of &#8220;intolerable to the child&#8221; should not be seen as gloss on, much less a supplementary test to, best interests.   Although they continue by saying that the concept is a &#8220;valuable guide in the search for best interests in this kind of case&#8221;, I doubt my own intellectual capacity on the one hand to exclude it even as a &#8220;gloss on&#8221;, much less supplementary test to, best interests; and yet on the other hand treat it as a &#8220;valuable guide&#8221;.   If it means no more than that the conclusion that it is in the best interests of the patient to be allowed to die should only be reached in a clear and strong case, then that is already part of the intellectual milestones and part of my own proposition 7 above, and the quoted passage from Lord Donaldson of Lymington.</p>

This required to be directly considered in the case of  Anthony Bland, <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Airedale NHS Trust v Bland</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1993] AC 789" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1993">[1993] AC 789</ref> where the issue was whether forms of life support could lawfully cease to be supplied to a patient in a permanent vegetative state.

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;I agree [with Professor Glanville Williams] that the doctor&#8217;s conduct in discontinuing life support can properly be categorised as an omission.   It is true it may be difficult to describe what the doctor actually does as an omission, for example where he takes some positive step to bring the life support to an end.   But discontinuation of life support is, for present purposes, no different from not initiating it in the first place.   In each case the doctor is simply allowing his patient to die in the sense that he is desisting from taking a step which might, in certain circumstances, prevent his patient from dying as a result of his pre-existing condition &#8230;.&#8221;</p>

No doubt his best interests will ordinarily require that he should be placed on a life support system as soon as necessary, if only to make an accurate assessment of his condition and a prognosis for the future.   But if he neither recovers sufficiently to be taken off it nor dies, the question will ultimately arise whether he should be kept on it indefinitely.   As I see it, that question &#8230;. can only be answered by reference to the best interests of the patient himself, having regard to the established medical practice.&#8221;</p>

My task, difficult enough in itself, is to decide, and only to decide, where the objective balance of the best interests of M lies.   If I decide that it is not in his overall best interests to continue with a given form of treatment, in particular with continuous pressure ventilation, then I must say so; and it will follow as a matter of law (and I will declare) that it is lawful to withdraw or withhold that form of treatment.   The ethical decision whether actually to withdraw or withhold it must be made by the doctors concerned.

It is obvious from letters they have written to, and discussions they have had with, the parents over many months that they have tried with sensitivity and patience to find consensus as to the treatment plan.   It is clear that each has thought very carefully about the ethics of the treatment currently given to M, and each now supports, and in effect makes, this application after a long period during which they have increasingly felt that continuation of ventilation is not justifiable.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is thus a very formidable body of medical evidence of very high quality in this case which is all, without exception, to the same effect.   Although there is much detail in the various individual reports and also in the considerable oral evidence which I heard, I believe that the summary under the heading &#8220;Present Condition&#8221;, and one or two further quotes from the first part of the Joint Expert Report gives a fair overall summary of the medical opinion.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">M has lived for a long time for a child with his condition (type 1 spinal muscular atrophy).   The main reason for this is the very high standard of care he has received from his family and hospital staff.   The experts believe that the continuous bowel antibiotics that he has been receiving may have played an important role in his long term survival.   He is not in a persistent vegetative state.   He is able to make some very limited voluntary responses to his environment.   It is not possible to give an opinion about his cognitive function as this is impossible to assess.   His responses vary both during the day and from day to day.   These minor changes are not clinically significant and do not change the conclusions of our report.   Most children with his condition would have normal cognitive function.   Four of the experts had reviewed a recent video, which documents some movements in M.   The presence or absence of these movements does not change our conclusions below.   These movements are not a useful prognostic indicator for the long term and do not alter the long term natural history of the condition.   It is very difficult to assess how much discomfort or distress M experiences.   It is inevitable that some interventions particularly blood sampling, deep endotracheal suction, physiotherapy and bagging are uncomfortable for him.   An assessment of his quality of life is very difficult.   Two of the experts noted that assessment of quality of life in people with neuromuscular disorders by health professionals is often pessimistic&#8230;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">From the oral evidence as a whole the following important points emerge or are stressed.   Even with the continuation of the present treatment death is inevitable.   M could survive even for a small number of years or could die suddenly and soon.   Dr Wallis considered he would die within weeks or months and that survival even for a year is extremely unlikely.   However he has not actually examined M, and Dr S I and Dr S N each feel, I think, that he could actually survive longer.   His condition has deteriorated considerably in the last 6 months or so.   There has been a marked decline between his condition and responsiveness when Dr Hughes saw him on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2005 and when Dr Jardine did on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2006.   His condition must and will continue to deteriorate.   He will become increasingly affected by painful contractures of his joints and, although it has not really commenced yet, by scoliosis (i.e. curvature of the spine).   His autonomic system will dysfunction and there will be problems of constipation or diarrohea.   Any faint movements he can still make must and will ultimately cease altogether.   This means that even if fully sensate and of full cognitive functioning, he  will then simply not be able to communicate at all.   Although there have been wonderful advances in enabling paralysed people to communicate, Dr Hughes said that those advances still require the patient to be able to move something, if only a controlled flicker of an eyelid.   She said that however long M may live and with any technological advances that one may foresee, there is no way he will ever be able to communicate anything even if, as she assumes, his brain is functioning normally.   She did say, however, that he may be able to absorb and learn language, and absorb and process the thoughts and ideas that language communicates, including, of course, stories and poems.   Already he cannot make any sounds.   Currently his eyebrows can just form a frown but ultimately he will become completely motionless.   Eventually all eye movement will cease and, indeed, his eyes will remain closed.   Apart from further severely limiting his quality of life, this means that he will be unable to  convey whether he is suffering pain or discomfort, or alternatively experiencing any pleasure.   It also means that it is already impossible to assess his degree of cognition or, indeed, whether he has any brain damage.   MRI scans have not indicated any such damage but the possibility exists that he does have some brain damage not detectable on a scan.   But it cannot be tested by any other test based on recognition or response.   Although most children with SMA Type 1 have normal cognitive function, Dr Hughes has an impression, but it is only an impression, that he does or may have some loss of cognition.   She said, however, that as cognition is usually normal in SMA patients the assumption must be that it is normal in M.   She said there is no objective evidence to support that it is normal, but none to support that it is not normal.   Dr S N said, similarly, that M has not got the cognitive features usually seen in a child with SMA, but it is impossible to assess because he has no ability to respond.   In the view of Dr S N, the worst possible scenario is in  fact if he does have normal cognitive function and is aware of everything that is happening to him (i.e. all the medical procedures).   Dr S N said that to him that is quite a horrible thought.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">All the doctors who gave evidence stressed that the medical procedures to which he is necessarily exposed inevitably cause discomfort, distress or pain depending on the procedure.   The doctors know that these procedures cause discomfort, distress or pain from their observation and experience of other children who require similar treatments but who have not lost the power to communicate.   In the case of M personally, they observe (and indeed the parents observe and accept) reactions of distress or pain in that his heart rate, which is constantly monitored, may suddenly rise, or his eyebrows still just perceptibly frown, or he produces tears.   Procedures producing discomfort include the need for regular suctioning of his endo-tracheal tube several times a day, bagging with an oxygen mask when the tube is changed, and the physiotherapy which is necessary to maintain his general health and to loosen secretions.   When deep suctioning is required, with the suction tube going deeper towards his lungs, the discomfort is likely to be greater and at a level of true pain although it only lasts for minutes and the pain does not persist after the deep suctioning stops.   If he needs blood tests or the insertion of intravenous lines to administer certain antibiotics, then there is pain from the needle, particularly as it is very hard in his case to find a vein and often needs several attempts.   Additionally, Dr Hughes made the important point that he may be in almost continuous discomfort from inability to move or wriggle his body in bed, nor to ask for help when he wishes to be turned or moved.   He is, of course, frequently turned  and moved as a matter of nursing routine, but Dr Hughes explained how there may be many times  when he is uncomfortable and wishes to be moved but is helpless to do anything about it.</p>

He can no longer open his eyes fully and effectively, and is developing a ptosis, but Dr S I is convinced he can still see because he will follow movements with his eye although his eye movements are now irregular.   He can probably feel stroking and touch.   Dr S I said that the main issue is that it is so difficult to know how he feels.   If he is aware and able to appreciate his surroundings, it is very hard to know whether he is comfortable or in distress or pain.   He may be comfortable and happy or he may be uncomfortable and unhappy without us knowing about it.   That, he said, is precisely the dilemma we are faced with.   His own feeling is, however, that M is unhappy and is distressed although it is very difficult to answer that.   But before he lost all facial movement there were times, as indeed are recorded in the medical notes, when Dr S I felt he was profoundly unhappy and distressed.   Dr S I, who is an intensivist, considers that M is now dying and that by continuing with ventilation we are prolonging the dying process but in an uncontrolled manner.</p>

But his eye movements are irregular and it is unclear whether he fixates or focuses.   He has no reason to believe that M cannot hear or feel touch, although Dr S N cannot say whether he feels it as a pleasure.   He himself has not recently observed any movement in M&#8217;s thumbs but is aware that he does move them.   He briefly disconnected the ventilator on Sunday 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March but had to reconnect it after 15 seconds because the breathing effort was so weak.   From this he concludes that if the ventilator is withdrawn M will die very rapidly.</p>

Almost every day she is at the hospital and with him from about 12 noon until about 8.45 pm &#8211; i.e. over 8 hours, and longer at weekends.   Her sincerity and her devotion to M is not in doubt and is praised by the medical staff.   I have to caution myself that she cannot, because of her relationship, be objective; but it is the fact that no one other person has spent so much time with M and been as intimate in their contact with him.   I do consider that she is, in various respects, very understandably and humanly, deluding herself.   But I considered her to be entirely honest in her evidence; and even if not wholly objectively reliable, considerable weight has to be attached to her account as a source of evidence.</p>

She says that his eyes fix on her and will follow her until, because he cannot move his head, he cannot see her any more.   She says that when his brother and sister are there, which they very frequently are, he shows recognition of them and his eyebrows and corner of his mouth will move slightly upwards.   If she touches his thumb it will move.   She is convinced that he sees, hears and takes in certain TV and DVD programmes and music on CDs.   (The doctors themselves all agree he can most probably hear.)   He has his favourites and will turn his eyes away and nod off if bored.   His brother and sister sing to him and play Round and Round the Garden to which, she believes, he reacts positively and with pleasure.</p>

Pharmaceutical companies are indeed working on treatments, but on the evidence available to me, mainly from Dr Hughes, any available drug treatment is still years away, and the very best it might hope to achieve in the foreseeable future is to arrest further deterioration in a patient but not restore lost function.   So, very sadly, any future drug treatment will be far too late for M.</p>

Option 4, extubate M (i.e. remove the endo-tracheal tube) and provide palliative end-of-life care.

If that is the outcome, then the parents would greatly prefer option 3, although it would require an operation under general anaesthetic with the attendant risks and discomfort or pain.   They believe that performing a tracheostomy might make it possible for M to live at home or at least have some outings around the hospital grounds.   So it is to option 3 that their cross-application specifically relates.   In my view and that of the doctors, it is completely unrealistic to imagine that M might ever go home or, probably, even go into the grounds.   Before he went home the family would have to be rehoused, an intensive care unit would effectively have to be created in the new home, and a package of intensive and continuous staff would have to be made available and financed.   I am afraid that simply is not going to happen in his lifetime.   Even a short journey or outing in the hospital grounds would require the presence not only of nurses but of a doctor which is unlikely to be available.   The doctors oppose the tracheostomy because they consider in any event that long term ventilation should be discontinued.   <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">If</span>, however, it <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">is</span> continued long term, then Drs S I and S N themselves incline to feel that the ventilation might better be by tracheostomy rather than long term endo-tracheal tube.   In my view, however, option 3 and the possibility of a tracheostomy does not fall for direct consideration by me and would occur, if it occurs at all, following further discussions between the doctors (including surgical staff) and the parents in the event that I reject the application of the NHS Trust.   Further, if I do reject the application of the Trust, the doctors may,  as I have indicated, agree to perform a tracheostomy, in which case one may lawfully be done since the parents, who have parental responsibility, would consent to it.   In that event, any declaration by me would be unnecessary and superfluous.   Alternatively, the doctors may not agree to perform a tracheostomy, in which case any declaration by me might appear to be an attempt to do what I have no right or power to do, namely to require doctors to carry out a positive medical intervention against their own judgment and will.   For  those reasons I will in any event dismiss the cross-application issued by the parents.</p>

The endo-tracheal tube would be gently withdrawn at a time and at a place (which might include the parents&#8217; home or a hospice) which was carefully planned and agreed.   Appropriate sedation would be given to dull pain and distress, but not, I stress not, of itself to cause death; and M would die rapidly but peacefully, disconnected from all equipment, and in the arms of his parents if they wish.   The evidence of Dr S I in particular satisfied me of the experience which the staff have, and the sensitivity and care they would give, to enable M to have a peaceful and dignified death, or as Dr S I called it &#8220;a good death&#8221;, which the doctors regard as a real benefit to M of choosing that option.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If option 2 is not continued and the life of M not prolonged as long as possible, then the parents would prefer option 5 over option 4.   I feel, however, that option 5 has little to commend it from the point of view of M&#8217;s best interests, and it borders on being, or may in practice become, unethical;   for it would involve continuing with invasive ventilation but withholding forms of treatment and care (in particular deep suctioning and physiotherapy) that really necessarily go with it.   He would probably die within days or weeks, perhaps from a blocked tube.   The time of death would be unpredictable.   The statement of Sister K indicates that nursing staff might find it very difficult to follow that option.   It is clear to me that if either option 4 or 5 are to be followed (which each contemplate an early death) then it is only 4, not 5, which is in his best interests and medically and ethically acceptable.   Aspects of option 5, such as not administering intravenous antibiotics or continuing blood sampling, might be added as variants or a qualification to option 2.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The test is one of best interests, and the task of the court is to balance all the factors.   The Court of Appeal have suggested that the best and safest way of reliably doing this is to draw up a list on which are specifically identified, on the one hand, the benefits or advantages and, on the other hand, the burdens or disadvantages of continuing or discontinuing the treatment in question.   At a relatively early stage of this hearing I therefore asked each advocate to draw up and submit to me their respective proposed lists, and they kindly did so.   It has been an enormously useful discipline, both during evidence (when the lists were used as a kind of check list), the argument and now as I reach my decision and prepare this judgment.   I would like, as an aside, to suggest that in similar cases each party should prepare such lists as part of their preparation of the case.   The lists can always be added to, or amended, in the light of the evidence, as happened in this case.</p>

I record, however, that even at the end of the hearing the list prepared by Mr Huw Lloyd on behalf of the Trust (and with, I believe, input from Dr S I and/or Dr S N) contains under the heading &#8220;Benefit&#8221; only one item &#8220;Preservation of life&#8221;.    Whilst that may be said to be all embracing, it does not recognise or identify any specific benefit that M may be getting from his life, though the &#8220;Disbenefits&#8221; are listed with considerable specific detail.</p>

Most of the items have a resonance in what I have already said in different parts of this judgment.

The actual application I am considering, viz the Trust&#8217;s originating summons, asks for a declaration as to the best interests and lawfulness of &#8220;withdrawing&#8221; the ventilation and associated treatment, in which case the benefits/advantages and burdens/disadvantages are essentially reversed: the benefit or advantage would be the cessation of pain etc., the burden or disadvantage would, in this case, be the inevitable immediate death and loss of whatever benefit M currently gains from life.

In the present case they seem to me to be principally (i) forming a reliable appraisal of what the benefits are &#8211; the burdens are more clear; (ii) deciding what weight to attach now to predicted future significant additional burdens (such as later scoliosis and autonomic problems) of this progressive disease; and (iii) overall appraisal of the weight to be attached to so many varied considerations which cannot be weighed &#8220;mathematically&#8221;, and so arrive at the final balance and decision.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At this stage I do not attempt to weigh the benefits but merely to describe them, in human but I hope not sentimental terms.   M has a life.   He is a living human being.   He is and always has been conscious.   He has attained the age of 18 months and, despite his condition, the physical size and development of a child of that age.   It is possible that he has some degree of brain damage or impaired cognition, but that is uncertain and is not a normal feature of SMA.   Although Dr Hughes said, correctly, that there is no objective evidence to support that his cognition is normal but none to support that it is not normal, she agreed that one must make the assumption that it is normal.   In my view it would be totally unacceptable (and false legal reasoning) to proceed on any other basis.      I accordingly must proceed and do proceed on the assumption that M has normal, age appropriate cognition and power of thought; and normal, age appropriate capacity for moods and emotions, and the capacity to feel pleasure from the stimuli he may receive.   Clearly the range of stimuli and experiences he has received in his life is much more limited than those of a normal, healthy 18 month old and so the range of  his thought may be limited because, to put it rather crudely, there are fewer things he can think about.   But still there are many, surrounded as he is by sights, sounds, experiences, people and activity.   Dr Hughes said that if he lives he may be able to learn language and process the thoughts and ideas that language communicates (assuming normal cognition).   Since he has been exposed to language all his life, it seems to me that I cannot exclude, but must indeed assume, that he has already learnt some language which he may use in his mind to help process thought.</p>

Although he no longer has the capacity to smile, I can see no reason which would justify an assumption that he derives any less pleasure now from their presence and the relationship.   If he did still possess the physical capacity to smile and communicate, the absence of smiles might tell one much about the relationship or his sense of pleasure.   But as what he lacks is that capacity to smile and communicate, the absence tells one nothing.</p>

There is no need to multiply examples and the list is endless.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is one further matter to which I must specifically refer.   The doctors all consider that there is a positive benefit to M in being able to plan, arrange, and by sedation enable what Dr S I called &#8220;a good death&#8221;.   In contrast, one of the &#8220;disbenefits&#8221; in Mr Lloyd&#8217;s list of continuing with ventilation is that there may be a &#8220;potentially distressing undisciplined death in an uncontrolled situation.&#8221;   There is much force in the point.   Probably everyone would hope for  &#8220;a good death&#8221; for themselves and their loved ones.   Some people, especially an elderly person who may feel he has already had a full life, might strongly desire to achieve a good death even at the expense of a shorter life.   But not all.   The instinct to survive is so strong that others may endure great and prolonged suffering in the struggle to survive.</p>

These circumstances include, critically, the facts that he already has been and is on ventilation and has already survived to the age of 18 months; is assumed not to be brain damaged; is in a close relationship with a family who have spent and are able to spend very considerable time with him; and does already have an accumulation of experiences and the cognition to gain pleasure from them.</p>

It is not a &#8220;policy based&#8221; judgment at all and is not designed to have &#8220;implications&#8221; (although I fully appreciate that it may do so).    My sole and intense focus has been on this child alone, in his circumstances as they are today (but taking into account deterioration).</p>

The time is not now; but may come when the parents have to face up to the inevitability and need, for M&#8217;s own sake, of withdrawal of ventilation.   If they do, they will know that they have done everything possible, for as long as possible, to enable M to achieve and value for as long as possible all that his life could give to him.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Every day some parents somewhere, in consultation with doctors, have to make agonising decisions about the best interests of children with severe SMA or similar disorders.   I hope that this judgment and decision will neither deter doctors from commencing ventilation when they consider it should be tried; nor lead any parent who has taken or may take, on the advice of doctors, the agonising decision not to start, or to discontinue, ventilation, to feel that their decision was mistaken.   For every case and every child is unique, and this case concerns M alone.</p>
