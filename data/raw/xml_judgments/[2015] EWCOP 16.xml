His uncle&#8217;s visit to West Wales took place before I knew AW. DW saw him for the first time recently in August 2014 following a phone call from my sister informing him of his uncle&#8217;s deteriorating condition. I therefore oppose DW&#8217;s application as he has had so little contact with his uncle over so many years and has little personal knowledge of his tastes and needs whereas DB has been a good friend to AW and will act in AW&#8217;s best interests as his deputy.&#8221;</p>

MG is clearly a very significant person in AW&#8217;s life. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that she is <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">the</span> most important person in his life, and her views as to what is in his best interests carry considerable weight.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">In May last year I dealt with a similar case in which there were two competing applications for the appointment of deputy: one from a close friend and the other from a family member. The judgment was published on the BAILII (British and Irish Legal Information Institute) website as <span style="font-style:italic">Re BM</span> [2014] EWCOP B20. In that case I set out the law relating to the appointment of a deputy in some detail, and there is nothing I wish to add.</p>

DW was unaware of these events for five months until SB rang him to inform him of AW&#8217;s condition.

As regards his conduct during the proceedings, I cannot criticise him for refusing to accept DW&#8217;s offer that the two of them be appointed as joint deputies. Joint appointments rarely work satisfactorily in a situation such as this, where there have been fairly bitter competing applications, and any ongoing acrimony between the two men could adversely affect the administration of AW&#8217;s affairs.</span></p>
