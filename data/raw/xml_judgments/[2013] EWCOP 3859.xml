At a Round Table Meeting held in April 2013 the parties have together attempted to resolve matters but to no avail and a court order is now needed in order to regulate MN&#8217;s life in his best interests and to bring this protracted litigation to an end.</p>

There are consolidated Court of Protection proceedings in relation to BN and DN, (MN&#8217;s brothers) which play no part in today&#8217;s hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> A care order was made by Mrs Justice Bracewell in respect of MN on 7 December 2001 (when he was just 8), on basis of parental neglect. Her judgment sets out the myriad of serious concerns and findings in respect of the care the parents gave to each of the children, (including MN), and of their inability to co-operate with the authorities in the interests of their children. It should be noted that notwithstanding the proper criticisms levelled against the parents in respect of their care of MN, there has never been any doubt as to their love for, and commitment to, their son or indeed any of their children.  An application by the parents to have the care order discharged was refused by Bracewell J on 22 July 2005. </p>

As MN&#8217;s 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday approached ACC made an application to allow for MN&#8217;s transfer to a suitable adult facility. The court gave permission for MN to move to live at RCH which he did on 11 November 2011. ACCG, the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Applicant, took over responsibility from ACC for the funding of MN&#8217;s placement where he still lives when he turned 18.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">MN has severe learning and physical disabilities together with autism and an uncommon epileptic condition resulting in frequent seizures and risk of sudden death. A nurse has to be available at all times to administer emergency drugs to MN if the need arises. MN has poor muscle tone and uses a wheel chair. He is doubly incontinent. MN has the cognitive ability of a child aged less than 1 year. He has no speech but can express his feelings by facial expression, sounds and gestures. MN needs help with feeding as he is vulnerable to choking; he requires 2:1 care with his personal care and accessing the community. Overall MN has to have his carers near by at all times and during the night MN has one sleeping member of staff and one member of staff who stays awake to look after him.</p>

Final declarations in relation to capacity have been made by consent. MN is represented by the Official Solicitor who, on behalf of MN, approves the care package proposed and funded by ACCG.</p>

Mr Gillman-Smith&#8217; first report is dated 2 December 201.  A 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> addendum report was filed on 30 May 2012 to respond to the parents&#8217; observations on the first report and following Mr Gillman-Smith having observed contact between MN and his parents. This was followed by a 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> report dated 17 May 2013 addressing and updating the issues which seemed now to be at the forefront of the litigation. A further report was filed in these proceedings on 31 October 2013 which related to contact between BN and DN (MN&#8217;s brothers) and the family. Finally, on 14 November 2013, Mr Gillman-Smith was asked to read the statements filed shortly before the hearing and to indicate whether his previous conclusions remain unchanged. Mr Gillman-Smith&#8217;s involvement has therefore extended for a period of 2 years and his reports run to nearly 300 pages.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Gillman-Smith&#8217;s opinion since 2011 has been that RCH provides <span style="font-style:italic">a safe, settled and supportive environment to MN that can also be proactive with regards to care provision particularly in relation to MN&#8217;s physical care needs</span>. The parents have &#8216;for the time being&#8217; accepted the position as to residence, whilst not accepting Mr Gillman-Smith&#8217;s assessment of RCH. They have (not surprisingly), been unable to identify any other facilities which would be suitable for MN and ACCG will not fund a package which would involve MN living at his parents&#8217; home (which, all save the parents, believe would not in any event be in his best interests). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Over the years the relationships as between the parents and care providers and social workers have always been difficult. At its height the father received a custodial sentence for assaulting a social worker and, until relatively recently, he was not allowed to join his wife and daughters on visits to RCH as it was felt that there was a risk that he would be aggressive and intimidate the staff.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mrs Justice Bracewell has given two judgments in this matter; in the initial care proceedings she set out in detail her findings in respect of the father&#8217;s aggression and hostility and of his inability to listen or address an issue. Bracewell J found that Mr N had intimidated the Guardian and had a prolonged history of obstruction of professionals, of refusal to co-operate with authority and of being intimidating to anyone with whom he disagreed. In her judgment in 2005 Bracewell J held that history had repeated itself in the intervening period and she said that she had no confidence that the parents would or could co-operate with professionals. The parents have made it clear in these proceedings that they do not accept, on any level that such findings are merited either in relation to the older or more recent history of this family.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During the course of the present proceedings, and at the instigation of RCH, contact between Mr and Mrs N and MN has been greatly relaxed and increased with the result that the current plan now is that providing the parents give RCH an hour&#8217;s notice, (in common with the all the families of residents at RCH), the N family may visit MN whenever they choose. Despite this progress, the parents remain highly critical of RCH and in particular the manager of the care home, who has, notwithstanding the concerns recorded below by the Independent Social Worker in relation to the attitude of the parents, has been the instigator of this new, open contact regime, believing it to be in MN&#8217;s best interests. </p>

In relation to the first visit Mr N did not agree to the assessment unless his solicitor was present and thereafter did not allow the Occupational Therapist in the house until the solicitor arrived, and more recently Ms N&#8217;s lawyer was present and a note was taken the solicitor having arranged to attend the house  to go through a statement at a time arranged in order to coincide  with the Occupational Therapist&#8217;s appointment. A feature of the attitude of the parents throughout the papers is a resistance to allowing care providers into their home.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Occupational Therapist concluded that, from an Occupational Therapist perspective only, MN could in principle go for a short visit to the family home. This was on the basis however that no personal care of MN could take place there (MN is incontinent). Trained carers would therefore need to wait outside the family home during the visit and one of the carers would need to be trained to administer emergency medication if the need arose. The parents would have to allow the staff into the house to settle MN and feel confident that they would listen to guidance as to his care. The care home manager, who has been responsible for the increase in contact, asked her staff if they were willing to support MN on such visits. Only the care home manager herself and her deputy were willing, the rest of her staff fearing that the parents would not co-operate, would interfere with the care they provided for MN and would be aggressive and intimidating towards them. They believed there was a high risk of confrontation with Mr and Mr N which would compromise their ability to support MN. If there were ever to be more prolonged visits to the property there would need to be substantial adaptations to the fabric of the building. Mrs N asks that consideration is given to such adaption being carried out at the expense of ACCG.</p>

The Official Solicitor expressed the view that the court should decline to take any of the additional submissions into account; (although this morning when I was about to give judgment the Official Solicitor asked me to adjourn judgment for a short time to allow him to file submissions in the event that I dealt with the Human Rights issue).

Their expectation was that, over three days, witnesses would be called and cross examined and submissions made prior to the court reaching a &#8220;best interests&#8221; decision as to whether or not MN should have contact at the home of his parents as the first stage of a gradual progression to either living or spending lengthy periods of time with them there.

The court should not say that notwithstanding there is no funding for contact at his parents&#8217; home, (whether it be Perth or Mr and Mrs N&#8217;s home), the court will nevertheless opt for that hypothetical option. </p>

There have quite properly been negotiations between the parties in relation to the options that are in fact available; for example RCH has been taking MN to meet his parents at a caf&#233; called H once a month. The parents explained to  ACCG that this was difficult for them as they could not always afford a trip to H and therefore McDonalds was substituted as a more affordable option together with the phrase <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;or other agreed venue</span>&#8221;  added to the contact schedule in order to give a sensible degree of flexibility. This is precisely the type of negotiation which is to be encouraged in Court of Protection cases.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There will undoubtedly be cases where courts wish to explore with providers the possibility of funding being made available for packages of care which may, for example, have been identified by independent social workers.  In my judgment such discussions and judicial encouragement for flexibility and negotiation in respect of a care package are actively to be encouraged. Such negotiations are however a far cry from the court embarking on a &#8220;best interests&#8221; trial with a view to determining whether or not an option which has been said by care provider (in the exercise of their statutory duties) not to be available, is nevertheless in the patient&#8217;s best interest.</p>

Miss Bretherton makes the point that such an approach is unwieldy, but I return to the observations of Munby J in <span style="font-style:italic">A v A,</span> that the crucial distinction goes to the identity of the decision maker, if the decision which the judge has been asked to <span style="font-style:italic">review consider or endorse is overturned</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">as the case may be</span> is that of the public authority exercising its statutory discretion, then the dispute properly falls to be considered by reference to public law principles.  </p>

In my judgment such a course not only reflects the law as it stands but avoids a situation arising where the already vastly overstretched Court of Protection would be routinely asked to make hypothetical decisions in relation to &#8220;best interests&#8221; with the consequence that CCGs are driven to fund such packages or be faced with the threat of expensive and lengthy judicial review proceedings.  Such an approach undermines the first principle that the court can only make a decision that the incapacitated person can make from choices which are available or can, through discussion and negotiation, be made available. </p>

Such a claim would have to be made out against the backdrop that ACCG&#8217;s refusal to provide the funds for contact to take place at the parents&#8217; home (and thereafter to pay for adoptions to the property), arose in the context of the parent&#8217;s home being a property at which MN has not lived (or perhaps even visited) for 13 years and an &#8216;open door&#8217; plan for contact at RCH a little over 6 miles away.

Article 8 declares a right to respect for private and family life, home and correspondence. Courts and local authorities are both public authorities and must not interfere with the exercise of that right except as Article 8(2) provides. It does not need a prescribed starting point to achieve compliance with that.</span></p>

In its wider form, incorporating reference to both private and family life, there is a danger that it contains within it an inherent conflict, for elements of private life, such as the right to personal development and the right to establish relationships with other human beings and the outside world, may not always be entirely compatible with existing family life and particularly not with family life in the sense of continuing to live within the existing family home.&#8221;</span></p>
