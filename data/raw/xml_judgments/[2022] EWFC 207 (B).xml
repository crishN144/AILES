I know that Mother, C, and the second respondent, D, will be very anxious, and so by way of a very short summary, to try and allay some of their anxiety, this judgment will confirm that A&#8217;s rib injuries were inflicted, and not linked to birth trauma or re-fracturing after birth trauma. This judgment will also find that the Local Authority have not proved that there is a real possibility that either C or D caused the harm to A. </span></p>

C took A to the GP and then to a local Hospital. All in all, four visits, as I understand it. Because of her concerns C was not satisfied with the treatment that A was receiving and on 13 August 2021 took A to another hospital, where A had been born. On that occasion A was admitted and had a nasogastric tube inserted.</span></p>

Initially Dr Jones accepted that an original fracture could possibly refracture if force was applied to the same site before re-healing had concluded. He agreed that a healing fracture would probably refracture with less force applied than was needed for a bone that was fully healed. On re-examination on this point, Dr Jones shifted his position on the period that he was considering, indicating that anything concerning refracture would have to occur within two to three weeks of the original fracture, and that this would be outside his maximum eight week timeline by some days.</span></p>

I have already referred to the evidence that the Court heard from C and D . There is no evidence before the Court to enable the perpetrator to be identified, so the Local Authority must prove that in respect of each identified person there is a real possibility that they caused the harm. It is obvious and, indeed, must be accepted that all three family members had opportunity at various times during the timeframe.</span></p>

It is not clear to me what evidence the Local Authority rely upon to establish that there is a real possibility C and D caused the harm to A. Being muddled in their evidence on the note that E left, and what they think about what E may or may not have done is irrelevant. It seems to me that all the Local Authority can point to is opportunity and as has been set out, very clearly on behalf of both parties, opportunity is simply not enough.</span></p>

I do not underestimate the stress that she would have been under at the court hearing and the fact that she has had to wait the best part of a year to attend court. The fact that her account of her father's behaviour after August 2021 differed to her mother's account frankly takes the court no further forward. In fact, the discrepancies themselves were minor. Both witnesses recalled him pacing; he had lost a stone in weight and that he was a bit quieter than normal.</span></p>

Who would want to have to accept the possibility that your own father has hurt your child and caused all the ensuing problems. In her closing submissions, at paragraph 48, Miss Prolingheuer had set out a possible scenario of how C might have come to injure her child but C denied that very strongly when giving her evidence.</span></p>

If she had, indeed, hurt her Child at an earlier stage and recognised that she had done so, is it likely that she would have been so insistent on getting treatment for A and possibly run the risk of being found out? I find that to be implausible.</span></p>

She strongly denied any wrongdoing with A and made it crystal clear to the Court in what she told us, that A was her priority, and that she would not lie for her daughter C. She told us too that if she had known anyone who had hurt A , she would have said so, and I believe that evidence.</span></p>

Frankly, I find that implausible. D will have been aware, no doubt, of the likely final orders that this Court could make if she were to continue a lie in the face of that, and I do not accept that she was lying to this court. I believe D's evidence. I accept that she did not hurt A .
