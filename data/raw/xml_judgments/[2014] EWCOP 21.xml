The father and son relationship is tenuous. They were estranged for many years and they live a long distance apart. Conversations with JU indicate that he has given little consideration to the full range of responsibilities an appointed deputy undertakes. Nor has he demonstrated that he has the qualities to manage the affairs of another. I wrote to JU on 28/04/2014 in accordance with the court&#8217;s directions following a lengthy telephone conversation with him on 15/04/14 when he put forward the statement that as EU&#8217;s son he was rightly entitled to become his deputy and could manage EU&#8217;s affairs adequately from a distance. He stated that he did not trust Suffolk Adult Care Services. He did not seem to comprehend the wider fiduciary duties of a deputy. I was concerned that JU was expressing his own interests and not those of his father. As yet the proposal to have a three way meeting with EU, JU and a social worker and/or independent mental capacity advocate has not been possible as JU has not indicated when he would be available to attend.</p>

Regrettably this has not been completed at the time of making this statement. It is proposed that further efforts will be made to meet with JU and to arrange a meeting with him and EU so that they can consider the future dealings of EU&#8217;s finances and affairs together with Adult Care Services (&#8216;ACS&#8217;). ACS will request that an IMCA is appointed for this process. A further best interests meeting will be held, to which JU will be invited, and my authority will make a further best interests decision regarding how EU&#8217;s finances should be managed. There are a number of possible outcomes but the decision will primarily be as to whether SCC will pursue its application to become deputy or alternatively will withdraw its opposition to JU&#8217;s appointment.&#8221; </p>

Someone with a close personal knowledge of P is also likely to be in a better position to meet the obligation of a deputy to consult with P, and to permit and encourage them to participate, or to improve their ability to participate, as fully as possible in any act or decision affecting them. And, because professionals charge for their services, the appointment of a relative or friend is preferred for reasons of economy. </p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">In this case the reasons for appointing a family member as deputy rather than the local authority are far from cogent. EU&#8217;s sons have been estranged from him for the last forty years. Neither of them is familiar with his affairs and, because of their distance, both geographical and emotional, neither of them is in a position to consult and interact with him and encourage him to participate in the decision making process. </p>

I doubt whether he has fully considered the range of responsibilities undertaken by a deputy and I suspect that he may be placing his own interests before those of his father. There was an unseemly scramble to get hold of a Lasting Power of Attorney (&#8216;LPA&#8217;), even though JU had not met his father or considered whether he had the capacity to create an LPA.</p>

It attempted to comply with the court&#8217;s invitation to resolve this matter by mediation, but hit a brick wall of obfuscation and procrastination. It arranged for an independent mental capacity advocate to meet EU in order to ascertain his present wishes and feelings about the application, and the IMCA subsequently encouraged him to participate in the decision-making process by being with him when he addressed the court over the telephone at the hearing. </p>

A panel deputy really would be a complete stranger, whereas Suffolk County Council has had an ongoing relationship with EU for the last two years. The appointment of a panel deputy would also be disproportionate because they would charge considerably more for their services than the local authority. This can be seen from the different scales of remuneration for solicitors and local authorities set out in the Court of Protection&#8217;s Practice Direction 19B.</p>

The IMCA&#8217;s report makes it abundantly clear that he wishes to remain in the residential care home in Suffolk, rather than be moved to Derbyshire, and that he would like Suffolk County Council Adult Care Services to manage his property and financial affairs. He reiterated these wishes over the telephone at the hearing on 15 July 2014, and I can see no reason why they should not be implemented.</p>
