	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A is a 25 year old woman with mild learning difficulties, Asperger&#8217;s syndrome/autism spectrum disorder, and epilepsy who has been the subject of Court of Protection proceedings for five years. A currently lives in a care home (&#8220;placement A&#8221;) but her mother, B, applies for a declaration that it is in A&#8217;s best interests to return home to B&#8217;s care. The Local Authority, the NHS Trust responsible for A&#8217;s care, and the Official Solicitor acting for A, all oppose that application. The history of this case, the circumstances of A&#8217;s current situation, and the interrelationship between residence and medical treatment, mean that the decision about where it is in A&#8217;s best interests to live is rich with complexity. The feasible options are all fraught with risk and it is difficult to foresee a good outcome for A, whatever decision is made.</p>

HHJ Moir determined that A lacked capacity to conduct this litigation and to make decisions for herself about residence, care, contact with others, and medical treatment. No-one disputes that A continues to lack capacity in those areas. In April 2019, HHJ Moir decided that it was in A&#8217;s best interests to be removed from her home where she lived with and was cared for by her mother, and to be cared for in a specialist care home, placement A. In June 2020, HHJ Moir decided that it was in A&#8217;s best interests to suspend all contact with B. In September 2020, HHJ Moir decided that it was in A&#8217;s best interests to be administered hormone treatment covertly. That decision was taken in closed proceedings of which B and her representatives were unaware. Two years later, in September 2022, after the case was passed to me following HHJ Moir&#8217;s retirement, I decided that B should be informed that there had been closed proceedings and that her daughter was being covertly medicated. I decided that it was in A&#8217;s best interests that contact with B should be reintroduced. Over time, contact has developed from telephone to video to face-to-face contact. By consent of all parties including B, covert medication has continued and A has remained at placement A. She receives specialist medical and other care including hormone replacement treatment (&#8220;HRT&#8221;) which is covertly administered to her.</p>

The balance of hormones given to her prevents her from experiencing menstrual bleeding (except for two occasions of minor breakthrough bleeding). However, A has now been told that she has gone through puberty. Continued efforts have been made to impart information to her about the risks and benefits of HRT, but she steadfastly refuses to take it voluntarily and there has been no transition to open medication and there is no current plan to impart information to A about the use of covert medication. I have considered whether, without a proposed plan about ending covert medication or informing A that she has been covertly medicated, I can make a decision in her best interest about residence.

She was home-schooled by B throughout her childhood. She has never gone to school. Over time she became completely isolated from children and young people of her own age group. At the age of 11 she was diagnosed with epilepsy. Intermittently, concerns about A&#8217;s welfare were raised with authorities by neighbours but it took the intervention of a doctor in 2017, when A was 18,  to change the course of A&#8217;s life. A&#8217;s epilepsy was not fully controlled and on 13 September 2017 she suffered ten tonic-clonic seizures. Despite B&#8217;s reluctance to agree, A&#8217;s GP called an ambulance to the family home to take A to hospital.  Whilst in hospital A was made the subject of an urgent Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards authorisation to prevent her from being removed from the hospital by her mother against medical advice. A particular doctor noted that A&#8217;s presentation was of a person much younger than her age and referral led to her being diagnosed with Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (&#8220;POI&#8221;). Scanning was initially thought to show that she had no ovaries or uterus but in fact they were very underdeveloped rather than absent. The recommended treatment was hormone therapy but A refused it. Upon referral to a psychologist, A was found to have a full scale IQ of 65 which is within the learning disability range. Her learning disability had not previously been assessed or identified.</p>

He is anonymised in this and the previous judgments because although he has been instructed to give expert evidence, he has also been A&#8217;s clinician. Acting in this dual capacity should be avoided. Dr X himself said in evidence before me that this was not a satisfactory combination of roles. But he has had this dual capacity in this case for several years and no-one suggested to me that I should not hear his opinion evidence as an expert. His evidence to HHJ Moir in 2019 to 2020 was stark: without hormone treatment, A would not go through puberty and as a result she would suffer significant physical and mental health problems. She would be at risk of premature death. She would be deprived of the opportunity to develop into a fully adult woman. Hormone treatment was straightforward and virtually risk free. He was unaware of any similar case in which POI had gone untreated for so long or in which treatment for POI was being refused or denied to a woman who needed it. HHJ Moir recorded in her judgment from 2019:</p>

Given the very clear evidence that it was in her best interests to take it, the question arose as to why she was not willing to do so. HHJ Moir found that the answer lay in the relationship between A and B which she described as &#8220;enmeshed&#8221;.

A further appointment was arranged for 21 December 2017 but a phone call shortly before the appointment said that A would be unable to attend because her mother, who had LPA, had an upset stomach. A eventually attended an appointment on 19 April, some six months late, accompanied by her grandmother. The hospital note reads at G13:</p>

Ovaries have not developed properly and are so tiny as to be barely visible on ultrasound scans. Same for the uterus although, unlike the ovaries, this will grow with treatment. Neither A, nor apparently mum, were bothered by her lack of periods and being home schooled A does not have a peer group of class-mates with whom to compare physical development. She declined pubertal (inaudible) today by Sister J. Reassured that she is at no major excess risk of fracture now. However, in order to develop into a mature woman and, crucially, to avoid getting premature osteoporosis (brittle bone disease) in her 30s and 40s rather than her 70s or 80s, she will need to start oestrogen replacement and continue for four decades. Understandably, she is not delighted by the prospect but we explained the lack of any viable alternative. She elected for oral over patch oestrogen replacement with progesterone deferred until after she has begun to experience vaginal spotting.&#8221;</p>

B denies that this occurred. A said that they were going to pursue a private bone scan and ultrasound. Dr X advised that both scans would be a waste of time and money and that the ultrasound scan may cause unnecessary concern because a uterus that has never been exposed to oestrogen is often too small to be seen on ultrasound. Dr X told me that it would be useful to do the scans after treatment had been underway for a few years. Dr X did say that he had arranged for A to have a second opinion from Dr M which appointment A attended with her grandmother. Everything was again explained but A refused to have the treatment saying that she did not want to even have periods despite Dr M explaining that it would be possible to treat her without necessarily causing periods.

In 2019, at the age of 20, A had never been to school: she had been home-schooled her entire life by her mother but her learning disability had not been recognised or diagnosed until the interventions following her hospital admission in 2017. She had epilepsy that was not fully controlled. She had vitamin D deficiency. She had previously undiagnosed POI. She had not gone through puberty and was physically and mentally under-developed, yet her mother, as her sole carer, had never sought medical advice or attention for the obvious lack of development. Having been diagnosed with POI and having been advised of the low/absent risks and considerable benefits of treatment, A was declining the offer of medication, seemingly influenced by B to refuse it. They had an enmeshed relationship which was unhealthy and prevented A from forming and expressing her own views and developing her individuality.</p>

She did begin to take her anti-epilepsy medication regularly and began to take vitamin D tablets. In June 2020, concerned about B&#8217;s continuing influence on A, in particular in relation to A&#8217;s refusal to take hormone treatment, HHJ Moir suspended all contact between them. In her judgment at that time, she noted evidence that during contact, B had said to A, &#8220;remember who you are&#8221; and, &#8220;Don't let them tell you what to do.&#8221; The plan was to remove B&#8217;s influence and to continue educational work with A in the hope that she would volunteer to take the hormone treatment she so obviously needed. However, by September 2020, A was continuing to refuse hormone treatment. An application was then made, without notice to B or her lawyers, for a declaration that it would be lawful and in A&#8217;s best interests to administer hormone treatment to her covertly. HHJ Moir acceded to that application and made orders in closed hearings that B should not be informed of the decision lest she should influence A. Although B was not having contact, A&#8217;s maternal grandparents were still seeing her. They too were not to be informed of the covert medication plan.</p>

As a result she had gone through puberty with all the associated physical changes. Surprisingly perhaps, A had not commented on the physical changes she had undergone. Even more surprisingly, her grandparents had not commented on them either, despite seeing her on a regular basis. B, of course, had not been permitted to see A or to have any form of contact with her. Her parents, not having taken notice of the changes in A, had not alerted B to them.

B responded to this news by saying that she was pleased her daughter had gone through puberty. For the time being, B did not oppose A remaining at placement A and being covertly medicated whilst there, but she was anxious that covert medication should cease as soon as possible in A&#8217;s best interests and maintained that if given the chance, she would be able to persuade A to take HRT. Naturally there was some scepticism about that assertion given B&#8217;s previous attitude to treatment recommended by medical professionals, including Dr X. I considered it to be in A&#8217;s best interests for contact between A and B to be re-introduced but for covert medication to continue in the interim, as was agreed by all parties, and for A to remain at the care home, which B did not then oppose. B indicated that she would make an application for a change of residence at some point in the future, so that A could go home to her mother&#8217;s care. That is the application now made and which I have to determine.</p>

Then, overnight between the second and third days of the hearing, B suffered an accident requiring hospital treatment.

Extensive efforts have been made to provide health education to A with a view to presenting her with information on which, were she to act rationally, she would agree to take the HRT. She has steadfastly refused to do so. It should be remembered that she has been found to lack capacity to make decisions about her own treatment, otherwise covert medication could not have been authorised. When the issue was raised with her at a recent meeting with a solicitor for the Official Solicitor, A told him in very clear and colourful language not to even speak about the subject. In short, no progress has been made in persuading A to take HRT voluntarily. B says that she believes that if A were returned home, she would be able to persuade her to take HRT. </p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;[10] Where a patient lacks capacity it is accordingly of great importance to give proper weight to his wishes and feelings and to his beliefs and values. On behalf of the Trust in this case, Mr Sachdeva QC submitted that the views expressed by a person lacking capacity were in principle entitled to less weight than those of a person with capacity. This is in my view true only to the limited extent that the views of a capacitous person are by definition decisive in relation to any treatment that is being offered to him so that the question of best interests does not arise. However, once incapacity is established so that a best interests decision must be made, there is no theoretical limit to the weight or lack of weight that should be given to the person's wishes and feelings, beliefs and values. In some cases, the conclusion will be that little weight or no weight can be given; in others, very significant weight will be due.</p>

Those disparate matters have to be taken into account but a balance sheet exercise may not be particularly helpful. When such disparate matters are balanced, it is simplistic to suppose that if the list of advantages flowing from a certain decision is longer than the list of disadvantages, then the decision must be in P&#8217;s best interests.

If a balance sheet is used it should be a route to judgment and not a substitution for the judgment itself. A key step in any welfare evaluation is the attribution of weight, or lack of it, to each of the relevant considerations; one danger that may arise from setting out all the relevant factors in tabular format, is that the attribution of weight may be lost, with all elements of the table having equal value as in a map without contours.&#8221; </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr X&#8217;s oral evidence supplemented and clarified his detailed written reports. A will not engage with him and so he has been largely unable to assess her in person. He was very impressed by the way A&#8217;s medication has been managed at her care home. Covert medication has been given consistently over a period of more than three years without detection. A is given oestrogen as well as progesterone. This prevents bleeding. A has had only two minor bleeds which, again, shows how successful the covert medication has been. He advised that A has gone through puberty as a result of the covert medication and that that cannot be reversed. To optimise her health she requires maintenance HRT for the remainder of her life. If she were to stop HRT now then she would experience bleeding. In the short term she would have a significant chance of suffering hot flushes and night sweats &#8211; in effect she would be at risk of suffering from menopausal symptoms in her mid-twenties. She might suffer from less stable mood. In the longer term she would be likely to suffer a 20% loss of bone density. This would happen earlier in her life than it does for the great majority of women who experience menopause in middle age. Thus, she would be at risk of fractures earlier in life and, when she was herself older, she would be at increased risk of fractures compared with women of the same age. As a woman undergoing a very early menopause, she would have at least an 88% increased risk of cardio-vascular disease. I asked Dr X about what the absolute risk of cardio-vascular disease would be but he could not answer. Nevertheless, for the purposes of this application, I accept his evidence that a relatively increased risk of 88% is very significant.</p>

Blood tests would only reveal whether hormone medication had been taken in the previous 24 hours. Stopping hormone treatment would result in some loss of bone density even if it were later re-started, but there would certainly be value to A in re-starting at some point in the future even if she stopped taking the treatment now.</p>

However, A has not agreed to any scanning since she was started on covert medication and so the extent to which her uterus has matured is not known. Hence, the viability of IVF cannot be assessed.  In any event, Dr X was unsure if she would have the mental capacity to make decisions about such treatment.</p>

He said that the &#8220;elephant in the room&#8221; was B&#8217;s role in achieving that outcome. What was required was a frank conversation between A and B in which B admitted to her daughter that she had been wrong to doubt the value of hormone treatment, apologised for her mistake, and encouraged A to follow medical advice and to accept HRT. He said that without a sincere recognition of past mistakes, A would not accept as genuine any encouragement B might now give to her to take the medication. There would be a &#8220;credibility gap&#8221;.</p>

It will be recalled that A&#8217;s father is Northern Irish. A has had no contact with him since she was about 14 months old, but she appears to have adopted her mother&#8217;s feelings towards anyone or anything coming from Northern Ireland. Dr X strongly encouraged B to help A to overcome those feelings because Dr K is an excellent doctor. </p>

He did point out that he knows Prof Z, because they share expertise in a field which is a &#8220;small world&#8221;. Also, I would add, A&#8217;s view of who is independent is not necessarily rational.</p>

She told the court about her obsessive compulsive disorder. She maintained that this condition accounted for her phobia of anything associated with Northern Ireland, which also stems from the breakdown of her marriage to a man from that region, and to her dislike of certain things being brought into the house. She was unable even to say &#8220;Northern Ireland&#8221; or to name the place there where she had lived when married. She said that she had hated school. She decided to home school A when she had taken A to the same school B had attended, and A hated it too.

B&#8217;s case at the hearing involved a marked departure from her previously held position. She told the court that whilst she would not give A medication covertly herself, she would support others to do so. She suggested that her own home would not be suitable for the preparation of food in which medication was incorporated: the layout of the kitchen and living area would allow A to wander in and see what was being done. Instead, she suggested two alternatives. First, medication, including hormone treatment, could be delivered to the home and she would just advise A to take it. The obvious flaw with that plan is that A has been seeing and refusing hormone medication for the past three years. The second plan was to ensure that A attended her grandmother&#8217;s home for lunch every day and that food incorporating the medication could be pre-prepared and given to her there. Again, this plan seems to me to be unrealistic. What if A did not want to go to her grandmother&#8217;s one day, or wanted to eat something else? HRT has to be taken daily but this plan would give rise to many possibilities for medication being missed.</p>

The need for A to receive hormone treatment was a key reason for removing her from her home. I have to consider the feasibility of continuing covert medication, wherever A is residing, and whether continuation of covert medication in any setting is in her best interests. As part of any best interests decision about medication, consideration has to be given as to what, if anything, to tell A: should she be told that she has been covertly medicated? If so, when and by whom? Despite my directions in September 2022 for a plan for a transition away from covert medication, I do not have a transition plan before me. Therefore I have also to consider whether I can make decisions about a transfer of residence, and of the continuation of covert medication without such a plan having been formulated and approved.</p>

In his oral evidence Dr X was very complimentary of the staff at placement A for having administered HRT undetected for so long. But that points to the possibility of detection which is inherent in a covert regime. I am concerned as to the impact on A&#8217;s health and welfare should she discover that she is, and has been, covertly medicated. That risk is present and will continue not only so long as covert medication continues but also after it stops, if it ever does stop. If A discovered that she was or had been given medication against her will by secreting it in her food or drink, whilst she was still in placement A or in SIL, she might well lose all remaining trust in those caring for her. If that were to happen then she might well not believe what carers told her they were giving her to eat and drink, and there would be a real risk that she could choose to stop eating and drinking. She has done that previously. I also factor in the possibility that if B loses hope of her daughter returning home, she may be more likely to take matters into her own hands and to inform A that she is being covertly medicated. She has not done that to date, and I commend her for that, but  the hope that A might be returned home has provided an incentive to B to abide by the rules set by the court and the care home.  She has not found that easy and with the incentive removed she might relapse into the more confrontational mode of behaviour she has previously adopted, and which more recently she has shown some signs of adopting again.</p>

B told the court that she had listened carefully to the evidence and now believed that it would be in A&#8217;s best interests to take HRT and that she would persuade her to do so. She proposes that A continues to be covertly medicated at B&#8217;s home until A persuades her to take HRT voluntarily. I regard that proposal as unrealistic. Dr X said that in order to persuade A to take HRT voluntarily her mother would have to whole-heartedly apologise to A for having been wrong about hormone treatment in the past. Without a sincere acknowledgement of past mistakes, any attempts by B now to persuade A to take HRT will have no credibility. In my judgment, Dr X&#8217;s observation has considerable force. As it is, I found B to be unable or unwilling to accept responsibility for her past conduct and for the dire circumstances in which A found herself by 2019. I found B&#8217;s proposals for supporting the administration of covert medication and transition to voluntary medication, to be unrealistic. Indeed, although B says she supports A being given hormone treatment, her actions do not match her words. She has supported her daughter to refuse the medication in the past. She has not, even now, fully or genuinely accepted responsibility for that. She has not taken the opportunity clearly and consistently to persuade A to take the medication since contact was re-introduced. Furthermore, her proposals for covertly medicating A at home were so flawed as to suggest that she has no real intent for them to be effective. </p>

Whilst she would no longer be deprived of her liberty if she were to return home, and contact with her mother would no longer be regulated in the same way, continued covert medication in the community would still be a significant infringement of her autonomy and Art 8 rights. Hormone treatment is good for A&#8217;s health, but it comes at a heavy price in terms of infringements with A&#8217;s human rights. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have to consider the length of time over which these very serious interferences with A&#8217;s human rights may continue. Dr X&#8217;s evidence is that it is in A&#8217;s medical best interests to continue to receive hormone treatment for the rest of her life. Therefore I have to contemplate the possibility of A being deprived of her liberty, covertly medicated, and separated from her mother whether in a care home or in SIL, for the rest of her life. In nearly five years since A was removed from her mother&#8217;s home no-one has persuaded her to take HRT voluntarily. Even now, it is proposed that further strategies are deployed to try to persuade her. Whilst it is understandable that attempts should continue, in my judgement the time has come to acknowledge that such attempts are unlikely to succeed. A has been remarkably consistent and tenacious in refusing HRT. Nothing that has been attempted - removing her from home, suspending all contact with her mother, providing information and education, building her trust in her carers &#8211; has made any difference. It is more in hope than expectation that new strategies are now suggested, even after the close of evidence. I proceed on the basis that if A remains at placement A or within SIL it is likely that she will continue to refuse to take HRT voluntarily. Hence, if undetected by A, covert medication could continue for many years ahead, potentially for the rest of A&#8217;s life. Now that A has gone through puberty, the rationale for continuing HRT will remain for the foreseeable future. It would be wrong, therefore, to focus only on the next few months. A needs HRT for her health for the rest of her life. If, as I find, A is unlikely ever to agree to take HRT voluntarily, then for so long as she resides in placement A, a similar care home, or in SIL, then a decision has to be made to whether to continue covert medication for the foreseeable future.</p>

That is not reversible and so a significant element of the harm that was contemplated were she not to have been covertly medicated, has been overcome. The first goal of covert medication has been achieved. The adverse consequences to A of stopping hormone treatment now are significant but not as severe as the adverse consequences would have been had she never taken hormone treatment at all. Put another way, the additional benefits of HRT are considerable but they are not as considerable as they were when HRT was started. The balance of best interests has changed since orders were made removing A from her home and permitting the covert administration of medication.</p>

There are dangers to A from stopping the covert medication. Firstly, the medication is beneficial for A&#8217;s health and she would lose those benefits unless she began to take HRT voluntarily. Secondly, upon ceasing HRT, A is likely to experience bleeding and liable to suffer menopausal symptoms. Thirdly, as a result of experiencing those physical changes, and in any event, A might learn from B, or otherwise, that she has been covertly medicated whilst in placement A. That knowledge could be harmful to A as discussed earlier. She could lose her remaining trust in healthcare professionals with adverse consequences for her whether she is living at home or in a placement.</p>

Decisions would have to be made whether to lie to her in order to avoid her knowing that she had been covertly medicated. This would only heighten the risk that she would find out anyway, and that upon finding out, her trust in others would be even further undermined.</p>

Indeed, the best possible outcome for A is that she volunteers to take HRT. That is the most sustainable way in which she can achieve the medical benefits without infringement of her human rights. In my judgement there are two conditions that need to be met for there to be any chance of A being persuaded to take HRT. First, it will require honesty about the fact that she has been covertly administered HRT. Second, it will require the input of B. I have already observed that A has steadfastly refused to take HRT voluntarily despite all efforts to persuade her to do so whilst she has been resident at placement A. It is unlikely that A will be persuaded to take HRT voluntarily whilst, as now, she has no awareness that it has benefited her. As for B persuading A to take HRT voluntarily, I have serious doubts that B is willing or able to do so. She failed to do so when A was in her care previously and has not shown much willingness to assist in persuading A to take the medication when given the opportunity to do so whilst she has been living at the care home. Nevertheless, the best chance there is of A beginning to take HRT voluntarily is through B&#8217;s intervention. Their enmeshed relationship means that A is more likely to listen to B than to anyone else. If B can explain to her that the use of HRT has been beneficial to her and that she, B, was wrong not to have encouraged her to take it previously, then there is a small chance that A might choose to take it. </p>

Why tell A that she has been covertly medicated when there might be a way to avoid her ever knowing? For a number of reasons I do not agree:</p>

B did not know A was being covertly medicated until September 2022 but B now agrees with the medical professionals that it is important that A continues to take it so that she can get the full benefit from it.</p>

Stopping it would cause her to experience bleeding and may cause her to suffer menopausal symptoms. She would lose bone density much earlier in life than she would if she continued with HRT. This would give rise to a risk of earlier fractures. She would be at a very significantly increased risk of cardio-vascular disease. Albeit the most extreme risks to A would be some decades hence if she were to stop HRT now, those risks are of physical disability and even premature death.

Her mother is aware of the covert medication but A&#8217;s grandmother is not aware. The parties have previously submitted that A&#8217;s grandmother should not be told, but the Local Authority is now considering whether she might be enlisted to seek to persuade A to take HRT voluntarily. This will require a decision to be made whether to inform A&#8217;s grandmother that HRT is currently being given covertly. Approximately 18 months ago I asked for a plan for transition from covert medication. I do not doubt the difficulties of managing that transition but my perception is that the only exit plan from the covert regime is to persuade A to take HRT voluntarily. That plan has not succeeded and there has been no detailed planning for the option of ceasing covert HRT without A agreeing to take HRT voluntarily. The prospect of A not taking HRT at all has not been actively contemplated. If a decision to permit A to return home comes with an acceptance that covert medication would cease, then a plan does need to be made for that transition. There are therefore some uncertainties as to the next steps and I have to consider whether I should make a decision in A&#8217;s best interests about residence without further evidence and submissions on those next steps.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I note again the Bulletin from the Royal College of Psychiatrists quoted above. Covert medication should be used exceptionally, for severely incapacitated patients, and in the least interventionist way consistent with their best interests. The present case demonstrates the difficulties inherent in using covert medication in the case of an adult who whilst lacking capacity to make decisions about their own treatment, is not severely incapacitous; of using covert medication over a prolonged period; and of having to take additional interventionist measures such as deprivation of liberty, separation from family, suspension of contact, and closed proceedings, to support the covert administration of medication. Before covert medication is begun it should be asked how and when it will end and to plan for that eventuality. In the present case, unless covert medication is to continue for the rest of A&#8217;s life, it must end, but its ending is laden with complexity and risk.</p>

In my judgement, that self-description betrays a lack of insight. Clearly, there is no single template for motherhood, but at the time when B was removed from A&#8217;s care in 2019 at the age of 20, B&#8217;s relationship with A was deeply enmeshed, as HHJ Moir found. A aligned herself almost wholly with B&#8217;s views and wishes. B herself, lived through her daughter to an extreme degree. They spent all their time together and were very rarely apart. A was isolated with no friendships or contact with people of her own age, she was under-developed physically and mentally, she had very few independent living skills, she had not been given access to medical advice and treatment that she needed, she had adopted many of her mother&#8217;s obsessions and phobias, she had been denied adequate academic education and the opportunity for personal development. A did have learning disability and Asperger&#8217;s syndrome but B was heavily responsible for A&#8217;s isolation and lack of physical, mental, and social development. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">An enmeshed relationship is one in which an individual aligns their own wishes and goals with those of another. Boundaries between A and B have become blurred. This is demonstrated by their shared &#8220;phobia&#8221; of people from Northern Ireland, of their joint hostility to straightforward, reasonable medical advice, and their mutual retreat from the world into the confines of their home. Each has become deeply emotionally and reliant on the other such that they lack independent individuality. HHJ Moir referred to A and B&#8217;s relationship as enmeshed and I have adopted that description. In my view the evidence fully justifies that categorisation but it is right to note that, although I have evidence from Dr Ince on A&#8217;s capacity, I have not relied on any expert evidence on the dynamics of the relationship when reaching that conclusion.</p>

This enmeshed relationship previously resulted in A being deprived of medical attention and treatment that she required, reasonable medical advice regarding A being rejected, and significant social isolation. Under B&#8217;s care A was under-developed physically and mentally, and was ill-prepared for independent or even semi-independent living. There is nothing in the evidence I have seen or heard to lead me to believe that there will be a marked difference in B&#8217;s approach to her relationship with A were A to return home. B may have learned to say some things that she knows she ought to say to portray a more positive future for A at home, but I have no sense that she has any real desire to change. She gave no impression that she thinks she has ever done anything wrong.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">To an extent, A is protected from some of the damaging aspects of her relationship with B for so long as she resides in a care home or in SIL, but that protection has so far entailed tight regulation of contact between A and B, including a prolonged period of suspension of contact, and it is likely that similarly tight regulation would be required in the future. The Local Authority and Trust&#8217;s evidence at the hearing hinted at a possible application in the future to reduce the level of contact because it is felt that the re-introduction of face-to-face contact has been detrimental to A&#8217;s wellbeing. The purpose of controlling contact is to protect A from B&#8217;s influence. I believe that some realism is required &#8211; A and B&#8217;s relationship has been so enmeshed over such a long period, including during A&#8217;s most formative years, that it is not possible to negate B&#8217;s influence over her daughter. Suspension of any contact between A and B for a prolonged period did not bring about any significant changes in A&#8217;s views and attitudes about HRT, about her trust in medical professionals, and about her social engagement. The effect of A and B&#8217;s relationship on A will persist wherever A resides. The advances that A has made in placement A are, with respect to the staff, relatively minor. Her core behaviours have persisted. Her oppositional behaviour to healthcare and other professionals seems to be deeply entrenched and her unhappiness at being separated from her mother seems to make her dig her heels in even more.</p>

There are some small signs of B encouraging A to join social activities such as at a local bowling club. B will provide a clean and tidy home for A where A can enjoy her own room, use the kitchen, and spend time with her mother and grandmother without supervision or regulation. I have already noted that it remains possible, but not probable, that B has genuinely changed her views about HRT and will seek to persuade A to take HRT voluntarily.</p>

The negative consequences would be that she would be returning, without the protection that separation can provide, to an enmeshed relationship that has caused her significant harm in the past and is likely to expose her to the risk of harm in the future. It would not be practicable to administer HRT covertly and she would be unlikely to volunteer to take HRT.

She is being deprived of her liberty and prevented from enjoying a private and family life. She is being medicated against her will. Her wishes are not being met and that is upsetting to her. She has already benefitted from HRT medication and has gone through puberty &#8211; a process that cannot be reversed even if HRT ceased.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have to have regard to all the circumstances. No-one can predict the future and there are many uncertainties in the present case. I take into account A&#8217;s wishes and feelings and the views as to her best interests of B and of those who presently care for A. B considers it to be in A&#8217;s best interests to return home. I do not have evidence from every person caring for B at placement A but I proceed on the basis that they align themselves with the Local Authority&#8217;s position that it is in A&#8217;s best interests to remain in her placement with the possibility of a move to SIL. The Official Solicitor supports the Local Authority&#8217;s position.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A was removed from her home nearly five years ago. The main reasons for her removal, and the subsequent suspension of contact with her mother, were the damaging effects of the enmeshed relationship between her and her mother, and her refusal to accept hormone treatment, which was considered to be aided and abetted by her mother. Of those, at the time when the decision was taken, it was the refusal to accept treatment that was described by Mr Karim KC for the Official Solicitor as of &#8220;magnetic importance&#8221;. A continues to wish to return home and she continues to refuse hormone treatment. Her behaviour and attitudes have not significantly changed over those five years. I am concerned that the rationale for keeping her away from home, depriving her of her liberty, and medicating her without her knowledge and consent, will still be put forward in another five years from now, and indeed for the foreseeable future. A is unlikely to change in her refusal to accept HRT and so neither will the rationale for depriving her of her liberty.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The covert administration of HRT has brought benefits for A which are largely irreversible. Stopping HRT will be detrimental to her health but comparatively less detrimental than had she never been treated at all. Continuing covert HRT is fraught with risk. In my judgement, on balance, the continuation of covert medication is not in itself a sufficient justification, in A&#8217;s best interests, for continuing to deprive her of her liberty, for overriding her autonomy, and for keeping her away from her home. Returning A home might allow B to persuade her to take HRT voluntarily. I doubt that that will happen, but it is at least a possibility and in my judgement the chances of A taking medication voluntarily are slightly higher if she is returned home than they are if she remains in a placement. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The relationship between A and B is deeply troubling and has caused significant harm to A, but her relationship with B and with her grandmother is the family life that A knows and to which she strongly wants to return. Some measures can be taken, in A&#8217;s best interests to try to protect her from the most harmful aspects of her relationship with B, but it must be accepted that returning A home will remove a layer of protection that she has benefited from within the placement. However, if A&#8217;s enmeshed relationship with B prevents it being in her best interests now to reside at home, it is unlikely that it will ever be in her best interests to reside at home. It is difficult to see how their relationship will change. Hence, if A does not return home now, she may very well be accommodated away from home, separated from her mother, against her strong wishes, for the foreseeable future. The influence B has over A has apparently survived all attempts to dismantle it over the past few years. It is entrenched and cannot be wished away. Realistically, it is too late now to try to undo the all the harmful effects of the relationship. The best that can be done is to try to mitigate them in the future. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The measures that have been taken, in A&#8217;s best interests, to counter the influence of her enmeshed relationship with her mother, could hardly have been more extreme, but they have not succeeded. Covert medication has succeeded in allowing A to achieve puberty, which has supported her right to develop into adulthood. However, separation from her home and her mother has not had other significant benefits in terms of her development and independence. Were it not for the opportunity to administer HRT covertly, which placement of A in a care home provides, I do not believe that it could reasonably be argued that her continued separation from her home and family life could be justified as being in her best interests. </p>

Whatever decision is made, or if no decision is made, there will be both positive and negative consequences for A. I acknowledge the risk that my determination of A&#8217;s best interests will result in her returning home to an unhealthy relationship and will expose her to the harmful consequences of ceasing HRT. However, those risks are outweighed by the benefits of ending the deprivation of A&#8217;s liberty and the serious interference with her Art 8 rights, and of avoiding the risk of an unmanaged disclosure to her of the covert administration of HRT. The Court is enjoined to seek to achieve purposes &#8220;in a way that is less restrictive of the person's rights and freedom of action&#8221; (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/1/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s1(6)</ref>). Here, severe restrictions have been imposed in order to achieve the benefit of medical treatment. Now, the continuing and remaining benefits of treatment are not sufficient to justify the continued restrictions.</p>

The plan for a transition home will need to consider whether there should be an introductory period where A stays for a single night, say, before returning to placement A. Or will A find that very difficult? Should A&#8217;s grandmother be told of the use of covert medication? What arrangements should be in place to ensure that healthcare professionals have adequate access to A? What information should be given to A, when and by whom? On the evidence I have received, it seems to me to be in A&#8217;s best interests for information to be given to A in the following sequence: (i) that the plan is to return her home to live with her mother (this is what she has said she wishes but her continued wish to go home can be checked at this point); (ii) that she has been covertly medicated with HRT, and that this has caused her to go through puberty and to become a physically mature woman with many benefits to her health; (iii) that HRT will no longer be given to her covertly; (iv) what symptoms A is likely to experience now that HRT has stopped; then (v) that it would be greatly beneficial to A to choose to take HRT voluntarily (B should be involved in seeking to persuade her to do so). It will be necessary to go through stages (ii) to (v) as and when covert medication is stopped. Stage (v) may involve providing information to A over a sustained period with the involvement of her mother, perhaps her grandmother, and perhaps Professor D.</p>

These plans are not directed as to whether A should return home but to how that can be managed in her best interests. I shall conduct a further hearing at which such plans can be considered by the court and the timing of a return home approved. That hearing shall be on 18 April 2024 and I anticipate that A will be returned home shortly after that hearing.</p>
