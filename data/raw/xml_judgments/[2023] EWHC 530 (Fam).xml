In her oral evidence she started to say that it had been already understood between the parties at the time the Father took them to the airport that if the children liked Wales and wanted to stay then he would give his permission for that. I did not believe her. Furthermore it did not fit with the children&#8217;s own understanding of the holiday as to which they were transparently clear with the Cafcass Officer. I did not have the impression that she was trying to assist the court or giving a straightforward account during her evidence but rather that she was seeking to consider what might be the effect of her answers on her case before giving them. </span></p>

I accept and agree with Mr Hepher that the notion that she had the bags all packed and ready to go but that on the basis of the views of children of the ages of 10 and 8 decided to unpack them and stay is not credible. Even had I regarded that as credible it would have been undermined by the fact that the mother had, by the time she unpacked her bags on the Friday, already considered the question of local schools and been to see the one she wanted, such that she was able to submit an application for places on the Sunday. That is not in my view the action of a woman who is intending to get on a plane. It is the action of a woman who is thinking to stay and is putting in place plans to do so. I have wondered whether it might have been something done in advance of a return to Australia to make an informed application for permission permanently to relocate before the courts there. What drives me to the conclusion that more likely than not it was not, is that there was no hint anywhere in the papers before me or in any of the extensive text communications between the parties that the Mother ever intended to make such an application.</span></p>

The first occasion on which he was made aware of it was when she sent him photographs of the boys on their first day at school and Amy in her uniform in anticipation of the start date. One of the aspects of the Mother&#8217;s evidence before me that I found profoundly unimpressive was that I had the strong impression from her that she saw nothing at all wrong with this either at the time or when it was pointed out to her by Mr Hepher in his most effective cross examination of her. </span></p>

There were many in which arrangements were made for contact. Others still in which arrangements were made to transfer funds and to sell property from the family home which the landlord had decided to sell. Later in the summer there were texts relating to the holiday the Father was taking and for the time he would spend with the children once he had travelled from Australia. He agreed when asked about it in evidence that within that context there were messages in which he spoke about saying goodbye to the children if they were to remain in Wales. There were also messages in which he discussed with the Mother whether it would be better if he just dropped out of the children&#8217;s lives and no longer had contact with them. This he said came from his thinking that he could do nothing about it. He agreed with Mr Venables that when he said he had no right to stop them, he was talking about no moral right as opposed to no legal right because his was the affair that had wrecked the marriage and broken up the family. It was however not until he returned to Australia after the holiday that he sought legal advice and knew what he described as his &#8216;rights&#8217; were. He had to accept when pressed by Mr Venables that he could have gone to a solicitor before then &#8211; in May immediately after the mother didn&#8217;t return. He did not have to wait until August. He also accepted that although he could have sought advice, he in fact did nothing at all. In his oral evidence he repeated that he felt he was powerless.</span></p>

Rather, the court should assume the risk of harm at its highest on the evidence available to the court and then, if that risk meets the test in Art 13(b), go on to consider whether protective measures sufficient to mitigate harm are identified. It follows that if, having considered the risk of harm at its highest on the available evidence, the court considers that it does not meet the imperatives of Art 13(b), the court is not obliged to go on to consider the question of protective measures.</span></p>

More modest living conditions and / or more limited developmental support in the State of habitual residence are therefore not sufficient to establish the grave risk exception. If the taking parent claims to be unable to return with the child to the State of habitual residence because of their difficult or untenable economic situation, e.g., because his / herliving standard would be lower, he / she is unable to find employment in that State, or is otherwise in dire circumstances, this will usually not be sufficient to issue a non-return order&#8221; [para 60].</span></p>

Only if there were such a concluded agreement could it be said that there was clear and unequivocal conduct such as to fall within the exception. I have reached the conclusion that acquiescence has not been established in this case, although I acknowledge that it is a comparatively finely balanced matter. But it would be most unfortunate if parents in this situation were deterred from seeking to make sensible arrangements, in consequence of what is usually an acknowledged breakdown in the relationship between them, for fear that the mere fact that they are able to contemplate that the child should remain where he has been taken will count against them in these proceedings. Such negotiations are, if anything, to be encouraged. They should not therefore necessarily fall within the exception or necessarily lead to the conclusion that as a matter of fact there was a subjective state of mind that was wholly content for the child to remain here.</span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">In the light of the incorrect legal advice given to the father in January 1997,it would be difficult to treat the attempts to seek agreement on contact and the sending of the belongings to the mother as evidence supporting acquiescence. To that extent I agree with the judge. I part company with the judge however on his assessment of the advice given in April/May 1997. I am satisfied from the father&#8217;s account of what was said to him that first he was given the gist of the Hague Convention which included the advice that he might be successful in having the child returned to Australia but it would be a Pyrrhic Victory since he was unlikely to retain the child in Australia after a hearing in the Australian Family Court. Miss Parker asked us to take into account the evidence of the father in the October 1997 affidavit to which I have already referred. That evidence was in response to the argument in the mother's affidavit that he had been given the information about the Hague Convention in April 1997. The subsequent affidavit, designed to answer that point, conflicts with the earlier affidavit sworn in support of his application and does not to my mind ring true. In my judgment, the judge set too high a standard of requirement of knowledge of rights in his assessment of the April/May 1997legal advice and did not recognise that the father was given adequate and, in my view, realistic advice, as to the long-term outcome of the proposed litigation over the child. Once the father was given the relevant advice in April/May 1997 and did acquiesce in the retention of M by the mother, as I believe he did, his subsequent change of heart for whatever reason in September 1997 is irrelevant, since acquiescence had already taken place. Acquiescence is not a continuing state of affairs and, once given, cannot be withdrawn, see Re A above.</span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">It is significant, in my view, on the issue of acquiescence, that the judge found that the father did not ask for M to be returned even after April 1997until he issued the Convention application. Further, it has never been suggested in any of the documents before us that the father has asked or will ask to take over the care of M himself. The emphasis in this case has been throughout on arrangements for contact. The realistic advice of the second solicitor set out the likely eventual outcome of the litigation and that the child was likely to return to live in the UK. That advice must have had a crucial effect upon a father, not seeking custody or residence, but seeking the best access/contact arrangements he could achieve.</span></p>

He has provided evidence also of his savings and his household income neither of which are disputed. He further accepts before me that he will continue to pay maintenance for the children- which I would expect were there to be a return to be a matter which if disputed would become one for the relevant Australian authorities. The mother is an Australian national. She is able to work and was on the evidence I have about the intentions before she and the children left for the holiday planning on return to be at work. She will also be eligible for benefits in Australia. By the time of the closing submissions of the parties Mr Venables, realistically as I see it, did not in any meaningful way submit that the arrangements could not be sufficient. He submits that a mirror order would be required. It may be that that is something which will be subject to further discussion between Counsel following this judgment. </span></p>

As to the former, that may well be right - I have some limited evidence that she had friends of the &#8216;school run&#8217; sort and that there are no remaining family members save some cousins who are not close to her. I regard the Father&#8217;s suggestions to the extent that he made them in evidence that he would be a source of emotional support to her as unrealistic. As to the second aspect however I am entitled to take account of the fact that were these children to return to Australia they would not be being looked after by one parent as, in effect, a single parent since the other lives on the other side of the world but co parented by two separated parents as many children are. As to that aspect the Father&#8217;s evidence that he is a source of child support to call on is not unreasonable. It has been urged on me at this hearing that the breakdown of the relationship and the effect that has had on the mother contributes strongly to the situation which she invites me to find would be one which present her (and so the children) with a situation of intolerability on a return is something which has been entirely the Father&#8217;s doing. Care has been taken not to advance that as in any way suggesting that the Father is now bearing the consequences of his actions still less being punished for them. Although I have heard a great deal about the impact of the relationship breakdown on this family, I have not found it has assisted in establishing this defence.</span></p>

So I hold in my mind that when I am thinking about the views that they express they are straightforwardly the expressed views of 10 and 8 year old boys.

Mr Venables sensibly did not take issue with this and Mr Hepher equally sensibly did not seek to suggest that there was evidence that influence here was anything akin to coaching.</span></p>

Ms Callaghan had observed in her report that their comments were of a superficial quality. Asked to expand on this by Mr Hepher she agreed that there was a loyalty to their mother that came through. When for example she pointed out to Robert that although he had given a negative impression of his experience at school in Australia the reports from the time gave rather a different impression, he said that he was now not the &#8216;smartest&#8217; at school which she took to mean he was being challenged more. She did not agree with Mr Hepher that the two boys  portrayed Wales in an entirely positive light and Australia entirely negatively, but she did agree that where Robert had felt he had been positive about Australia he needed to find a way of rowing back from that &#8211; so having said it was positive to have the pool in the sun for example, there was a follow up about the bugs in the pool. I formed the impression listening to Ms Callaghan of boys who had been drawn too far into matters which were the province of the adults. That impression had a resonance for me when the Mother in her evidence spoke of the children deciding whether they should remain in Wales or not. A decision which in my view should neither be theirs nor permitted to be felt by them to be theirs. </span></p>

I disagree with Mr Venables that the reasons given by Robert for example, are not trivial reasons seen from the standpoint of a ten year old. In reviewing, as I have, the careful and helpful report of Ms Callaghan, it has seemed to me that much of what she reports has a sense of what Brian and Robert are saying with their lips rather than anything stronger. I bear in mind however the relatively low hurdle that is the first stage and so I have on a narrow basis concluded that these still relatively young boys are in simple terms voicing, as Mr Venables submits, an objection to return. When I come to consider the second discretionary stage however I agree with the submission on behalf of the Father that the situation militates strongly against refusing a return.</span></p>

Still less is it to be found in a request for access showing the wronged parent&#8217;s desire to preserve contact with the child, in negotiations for the voluntary return of the child, or in the parent pursuing the dictates of his religious beliefs. </span></p>

Is not doing nothing for the three months following the retention indicative of acquiescence as Mr Venables says it is? Mr Hepher had two answers to that. The first is that during that initial time the contemporaneous messages are strongly suggestive of the shocked and traumatised parent whose children have just been removed - as to which as above he relies on the judgment of Lord Browne- Wilkinson. The second is that what matters is the Father's state of knowledge not the detail of how that comes about. Not only the Father&#8217;s assertion at this hearing that he felt powerless but also the indications in the messages at the time are indicative of a man who did not have knowledge of what he could do. The messages are, submits Mr Hepher more consistent with that interpretation than with that invited by Mr Venables to the effect that the Father elected not to do anything or to take any advice, acquiesced and changed his mind once he had come over to visit. </span></p>
