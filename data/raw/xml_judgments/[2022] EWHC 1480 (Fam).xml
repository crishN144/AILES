The assessments completed at the time noted that HT assaulted multiple healthcare professionals and that detention in hospital had a detrimental effect on HT.  It was considered that there were no grounds to convert the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.2</ref> detention to a s.3 detention and HT was discharged to the care of her parents after attempts to identify a community placement were unsuccessful.</p>

On 16 June 2021, the decision was taken to admit HT to an adult PICU bed in circumstances where there were no Tier 4 CAMHS PICU beds available nationally and HT&#8217;s risk to others would not be properly contained on a general adolescent ward.   The local authority issued care proceedings in respect of HT on 22 June 2021.  HT was given a deferred discharge at a Mental Health Tribunal held on 25 June 2021.</p>

There have also been questions over the level of supervision in fact being undertaken in respect of HT in circumstances where she has been able to access within her placement knives and screwdrivers with which to self-harm, has gained access to medication and has sent inappropriate messages to her family.  Both parents complain that they are not kept up to date with respect to HT&#8217;s welfare by G, notwithstanding that they retain parental responsibility for HT. The local authority is likewise concerned that it is not always being notified of significant events, or that there is a delay in doing so. Whilst the placement has repeatedly intimated that it is in the process of applying for registration with Ofsted, there has been difficulty in establishing the precise stage reached with respect to that application.</p>

She also started a fire in the bathroom at the placement, leading to her arrest for arson in July 2021.  HT has now pleaded guilty to the offence of arson and the matter has been adjourned for the preparation of a Youth Offending Report.  Her sentencing hearing is on 6 June 2022.  HT has also made allegations against a family member of sexual abuse.  Lead did not wish to cooperate with a police investigation in respect of those allegations.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">More recently, on 28 January 2022 HT had to be talked down from a motorway bridge after becoming distressed and taking an excessive amount of paracetamol.  Unfortunately, when the police attended HT was threatened by police with being tasered and told that she was wasting police time.  The court has requested a statement from the Chief Constable of Lancashire setting out an explanation for the approach taken by the police towards a clearly distressed and suicidal 16 year old young person.  The Chief Constable of Lancashire maintains that the conduct of the police during the course of the incident on 28 January 2022 was entirely appropriate.  A formal complaint has been lodged by the local authority with the Lancashire Constabulary.  In the circumstances, I comment no further on the matter at this stage.  Following a mental health assessment undertaken pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/136" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.136</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> on 28 January 2022, HT was discharged back to her placement with G.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Further difficulties arose in March of this year.  On 16 March 2022 HT voiced suicidal thoughts to staff and intimated that she would make a further attempt on her own life.  She attended the Emergency Department with members of staff from the placement.  Within this context, on 17 March 2022, two medical practitioners and an AMHP completed an application for assessment under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.2</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> on the basis that they considered that the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.2</ref> criteria for admission were made out.   However, the Access Assessment thereafter completed by the unit responsible for Tier 4 CAMHS provision indicated that admission was not merited, that Access Assessment recording as follows:</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;Given that carers are willing to take HT home, and keep supporting her in the community and there is scope to increase input from MH services, alongside a short course of medication to relieve agitation and distress that HT is currently displaying, this would provide a less restrictive option than hospital admission.&#8221;</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The contended for justification for this decision was set out in further detail in the Access Assessment.  In particular, it was considered that (a) the risk behaviours displayed by HT during assessment were to be supported by the care home and were a common presentation for HT, which the care home have been effectively managing, (b) HT had not presented a high risk of self-harm since 28 January 2022 when she had to be talked down from a motorway bridge, (c) HT&#8217;s difficulties were of long standing with little role for assessment in hospital, (d) there was no inpatient treatment identified that could be given to HT, (e) the only potential benefit of admission to Tier 4 PICU was risk mitigation, and (f) during her previous two Tier 4 PICU admissions HT&#8217;s risk had escalated significantly, so admission would not decrease the risk.  Within this context, the statement of Dr Paramel contends that:</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;&#8230;clinically speaking, there was at no point a supportive gatekeeping assessment and all Adolescent Psychiatric Intensive Units would be extremely reluctant to support a young person under their care if the Gatekeeping Assessment does not support an admission. The reasons for this are likely to include:  </p>

This is in line with the Guiding principles, in particular the principle of &#8216;Least restrictive option and maximising independence&#8217; which states: &#8220;Where it is possible to treat a patient safely and lawfully without detaining them under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, the patient should not be detained&#8217; (para 1.2). Where there is an identified alternative community option, as was the case here, admission would be contrary to this principle.  </p>

Again this is in line with the Guiding principles, in particular the principle of &#8216;Purpose and effectiveness&#8217; which states: &#8220;Care plans for detained patients should focus on maximising recovery and ending detention as soon as possible&#8221; When considered together this indicates a requirement to clearly identify a need to be in Hospital for an identified purpose of assessment and/or treatment which cannot be delivered in the community. Here there was no clear role for Hospital based assessment or treatment identified following the gatekeeping assessment, which identified that HT&#8217;s clinical presentation was consistent and unchanged so as to warrant further assessment and the interventions required could not only be provided in the community, but it would be of benefit to HT to remain in with her current care team, having regard to her difficulties building therapeutic trusting relationships central to effective care and support.   </p>

That visit did not materialise due, it is said, to a miscommunication.  HT was upset that no input from the CMHT was forthcoming and Dr Paramel acknowledges in his statement that one of the triggers for HT&#8217;s distress is when things that have been promised do not materialise.  The statement of the Network Medical Director, Dr Prashant Kukkadapu, likewise acknowledges the breakdown in communication and that this resulted in HT feeling increased levels of distress.</p>

However, no Tier 4 beds were available.   On 21 March 2022, following a multiagency meeting, the results of the Access Assessment were reiterated, with a conclusion that HT&#8217;s presentation did not merit admission to CAMHS Tier 4 inpatient provision.  Whilst the local authority considered HT&#8217;s presentation to be psychotic, the unit responsible for Tier 4 CAMHS provision considered it was more suggestive of a trauma based response.  The proposed course of action was for HT to return to her placement with support from the Community Mental Health Team.  On 22, 23 and 24 March 2022 the Access Assessment team made attempts to call HT to agree a time to attend the property on all of these occasions HT made threats to assault and kill Access Team staff  if they attended her property.</p>

The Teams have worked collaboratively to try and support HT to engage with the Community Services.  HT has been offered a variety of different options to enable her to engage with this, from different professionals and services.  There was a break in communication following the Mental Health Act Assessment on 17 March for which we apologise.  This was rectified the same day and contact made.  There were a number of MDT meetings arranged to ensure all services were involved including HT&#8217;s care team. Communication arranged to keep HT involved identifying the best placed person, even as this changed. The Consultant Psychiatrist for Darwen CMHT, Dr Adelekan, was not involved actively in the MDT meeting however there was medical representation  at the MDT meting to support the decision making process.  As can be seen from the chronology above, the Trust has arranged and implemented a range of support services for HT since mid-March 2022 when the decision was made not to detain her under the MHA.  </p>

However HT is currently not able to engage in psychological therapy and she does not want to.  She has presented with emotional lability, self harming behaviour, aggression and repeat attendances, and the support that has been offered is designed to help achieve a phase of stability, so that she can be in the best possible place to then access and engage with further and more long term support from CMHT. HT&#8217;s care team within her placement and her Social workers are already supporting her in relation to this and will continue to do so.&#8221;</p>

By contrast, Clinical Commissioning Groups (hereafter &#8220;CCGs&#8221;) commission CAMHS services for children and young people requiring care in Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3.  The Mental Health Act Code states as follows at paragraph 14.78 and 14.79 with respect to this division of commissioning responsibility:</p>

The classifications in DSM-IV and ICD-10 were not themselves always sufficient &#8220;to distinguish those with the greatest impairment of functioning&#8221;, and several of the consultees commented that it would be unjust to rely on the criteria in these classifications to distinguish psychiatric illness from &#8220;mere mental distress&#8221;.

The court will not ordinarily entertain a claim for judicial review in respect of a decision not to allocate medical resources to a particular case, here the relevant decision being not to admit a child or young person to a Tier 4 CAMHS bed following an Access Assessment (see <span style="font-style:italic">R v Central Birmingham Health Authority ex parte Collier</span>, Unreported, 6 January 1988 and <span style="font-style:italic">R v Cambridge Health Authority ex parte B</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 1 WLR 898" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 1 WLR 898</ref>).  The court may, and in cases such as this one often does, join NHS England (and sometimes the relevant Clinical Commissioning Group) where the circumstances are such that the court may wish to invite reconsideration by the NHS Trust of the decision not to make Tier 4 inpatient provision for the subject child.  By way of example, this step was taken by Sir James Munby in <span style="font-style:italic">Re X</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2017/2036" uk:canonical="[2017] EWHC 2036 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWHC 2036 (Fam)</ref>.  Alternatively, the court may consider directing a direct a single joint expert qualified in Tier 4 CAMHS to provide a second opinion, albeit that the efficacy of this approach is likely to be limited by the fact that upon receipt of the report the court&#8217;s powers to give effect to an expert recommendation contrary to the position taken by NHS England are limited for the reasons I have already described.</p>

The instruction of a Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist is no longer pursued in circumstances where HT has made plain she will not co-operate with such an assessment.  Within this context, the question before the court is whether a further DOLS order should be made in respect of the restrictions in place at HT&#8217;s current placement with G by reference to the well established principles set out above.</p>

The extent to which a given welfare compromise is or is not acceptable will in turn depend, in part, on whether or not another welfare option that does not require such a compromise is or is not available. A course of action that can meet some of the child's needs may well not be acceptable where a course of action that meets all of the child's needs is available. But where a course of action that meets all of the child's needs is not available, a course that meets only some of the child's needs&#160;<span style="font-style:italic">may</span>&#160;become acceptable, particularly where the alternative is that none of the child's welfare needs will be met. Thus, for example, a placement that keeps a child physically safe from sexual exploitation but lacks appropriate therapeutic provision to address sexual trauma may not be in a child's best interests where a safe placement with therapeutic provision is available. However, a placement that keeps a child safe from sexual exploitation but lacks appropriate therapeutic provision may, depending on the facts of the case, be capable of being held to be in a child's best interests where a safe placement with therapeutic provision is not available, particularly in the shorter term whilst further searches are made and where otherwise the safety of the child would be threatened.</p>

If the latter, then it is difficult to see how the decision I have made can be lawful by reference to the current law governing the use of the inherent jurisdiction to authorise the deprivation of a child's liberty.&#8217;</p>

The child's welfare needs must be considered both holistically and realistically, which approach demands that the court consider the likely consequences of any order it does or does not make. Within that context, to leave out of the best interests equation the lack of availability of an alternative course of action with respect to L's welfare would be to artificially constrain the court from evaluating fully the extent to which it is in L's best interests for the court to authorise the current restrictions that constitute a deprivation of his liberty.&#8221;</p>

Against this, and having regard to her current presentation and the risks thereby evidenced, I am satisfied that it would not be in HT&#8217;s best interests for the current restrictions amounting to a deprivation of her liberty to be relaxed.

In this case however, whilst HT&#8217;s current placement is sub-optimal, it is at least keeping her safe in the broadest sense of the word.
