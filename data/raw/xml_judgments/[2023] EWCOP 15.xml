It is this court&#8217;s responsibility to preserve the status quo and to protect the vulnerable and in this case her assets, even though ultimately the issue will require determination in another court. The balance of convenience lies in favour of making an injunction.

His argument seemed to be that - notwithstanding his acceptance that no such application is presently before the Court - the Court of Protection will be considering whether to authorise someone to conduct civil proceedings on behalf of MMP. That, he says, is because the issue of who acts as attorney will effectively determine whether a property claim is brought. The Proceeds of Sale injunction was therefore to be considered as in support of that &#8216;best interests&#8217; decision. The Court of Protection can consider &#8220;whether there is an arguable case&#8221; that MMP has an interest in the proceeds of sale of 50 C Road and, provided that it is so satisfied, it can use its powers to &#8220;prevent dissipation of those assets.&#8221; </span></p>

The civil court would consider injunctive relief, applying all the usual tests of civil proceedings, including as to the appointment of a litigation friend for MMP. There is nothing to stop AP and/or IP bringing those proceedings, as they well know because they helped take MMP to consult solicitors. So, when the judge concluded that she &#8220;had to step in because otherwise there was no one to protect MMP&#8221;, she was wrong. The judge&#8217;s approach would lead to bizarre conclusions, namely that the only court which could determine the property dispute would have its hands tied on the question of interim relief because the Court of Protection may already have made injunctive orders.  It would be absurd if a court could finally determine a dispute but not give interim relief. It would set a dangerous precedent &#8211; what if no one ever brought the civil proceedings? And it would leave third parties at serious disadvantage because the Court of Protection will always prioritise P because that is what it is there to do. </span></p>

It is indeed frustrating if an objecting party fails to attend a dispute hearing. An applicant may reasonably ask why the court cannot infer from non-attendance that the objection is abandoned, and go on to make final orders rather than give directions for further hearing. For practical reasons, it may be unsafe to infer abandonment of objection from non-attendance (not least because explanation of a good reason for non-attendance may reach the court only after the hearing). However, there is formal reason too in the wording of Practice Direction 3B. The preliminary words of paragraph 5 (&#8220;If the parties reach agreement to settle the case&#8230;&#8221;) not being made out, the second half of the sentence (&#8220;the court will make a final order if it considers it in P&#8217;s best interests&#8221;) does not apply. In the absence of agreement, paragraph 6 applies. Any change to this approach would require amendment of the Practice Direction, which is not presently under active consideration by the Rules Committee.  Meanwhile, any frustration about non-attendance is better dealt with as a costs consideration.</span></p>

Moreover, the identification of matters which were agreed and  not agreed clearly indicates some judicial engagement. In accordance with Practice Direction 3B, the directions should therefore have been simply for case management and final hearing before another judge. Regrettably, in my judgment the Deputy District Judge went procedurally astray in providing for &#8220;a further dispute resolution appointment&#8221; before herself.

Can it be said that a freezing injunction is &#8216;necessary or expedient&#8217; for giving effect to, or otherwise &#8216;in connection with&#8217; the granting of authority to conduct proceedings? Again, in my judgment the answer to that question must be negative. Litigation can be properly </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">conducted</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> irrespective of what happens to disputed assets.

The ancillary order contemplated is an injunction to compel the current holder, A, to transfer the funds to the intended holder, B. Clearly the transfer is necessary to the decision, and clearly if A will not make it voluntarily, an order compelling him to make the transfer is ancillary to preventing frustration of the decision. The very clarity of connection between the decision and the injunction in this example reinforces my conclusion that a freezing injunction cannot be considered ancillary to either a determination of validity of LPAs or a decision to authorise conduct of litigation.  </span></p>

I varied Deputy District Judge Chahal&#8217;s remaining directions so that the matter be listed on a specified date before a different (resident) judge.
