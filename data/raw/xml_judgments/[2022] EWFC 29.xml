This hearing was originally listed, in addition to dealing with the issue of joinder, as the hearing of an application by the third party (&#8216;Level&#8217;, who are litigation lenders) to set aside a final consent order in financial remedy proceedings. This was an order which I approved as the allocated judge on 2 March 2021, entirely without knowledge of Mr Justice Newton&#8217;s order, and so Level&#8217;s party status in the case at that time. As essential background, I will first set out how that has occurred.</span></p>

That was evidently an accurate description. By the time of that hearing the proceedings had been ongoing since 2016, and they had already been the subject of a fully contested final hearing before Mrs Justice Parker, alongside fully contested children&#8217;s proceedings (again Mr Todd uses the word &#8216;bitterly&#8217;), and a successful appeal to the Court of Appeal of the financial remedy order. A rehearing was in prospect, and one of the provisions of the directions order which I made on that day was to provide for a listing for 5 days before me of that second final hearing. Both husband and applicant wife were represented by leading counsel.</span></p>

One of the principal issues then in dispute between the parties was whether the assets of a trust of which the husband was a beneficiary could properly be treated as a resource of his. Mrs Justice Parker had found that they could be so treated, but her order had been overturned on appeal.</span></p>

During that day, the wife parted company with her solicitors and leading counsel.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.74in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">One of the issues in the case up to that time was the fact that the wife had very little in her own name, and to fund the proceedings both in relation to the children and financial remedy applications, she had been the recipient of external legal funding. First, the solicitors whom she originally instructed entered into a Sears Tooth agreement with her. Later, that agreement was replaced by a series of loans from the Intervenors in this application (&#8216;Level&#8217;), which by February 2021 had a total value before additional interest of some &#163;865,828, and with interest now nearer to &#163;1m. By the order made by Mrs Justice Parker in July 2018, later (in December 2019) successfully appealed, the wife would have received some &#163;3m. Now by reason of the agreement entered into at the private FDR the wife was to receive the right to reside in a property owned by the husband&#8217;s trust for the rest of her life, but no additional liquid capital to meet her claim.</span></p>

We have been made aware that she might be attempting to enter into an agreement with the husband whereby she surrenders the entirety of her lump sum which would prevent her from being able to discharge her obligations under the loan agreement. We therefore urgently request that we are joined to the proceedings under case number LV16D01012 prior to the approval of any order. A formal application to join will follow but in the meantime, we urgently request that no order is sealed in relation to this case and that we are heard in relation to any order which is presented</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">.&#8217;</span></p>

Mr Todd QC argues that Level&#8217;s rights will be completely unaffected by the resealing of the order which reflects the agreement of his client and the wife. If they had wanted more security, he says, they should have obtained it before lending the money. Yet in this situation, it must have been the natural consequence of their agreement that if Level were to seek to enforce any part of the debt owed by the wife, it would only ever have been possible through the medium of the Court&#8217;s enquiry in the financial remedy proceedings. That enquiry is discretionary, so any recovery is by no means guaranteed, but just as the loans enabled the wife to participate in the earlier stages of the proceedings, so their recovery was always going to dependent upon the outcome of the proceedings. If those proceedings have been brought to an end collusively, as Mr Southgate QC asserts, and the court has now to re-exercise its function to approve any proposed outcome, then a proper understanding of those circumstances will very likely be crucial in determining whether to give such approval.</span></p>

In these circumstances the disadvantaged party, usually the wife, cannot seek assistance from conventional commercial lenders because there are usually restrictions on the extent to which she can provide sufficient security for the lending. In its quest to ensure equality of arms and a level playing field, the court has always been astute to ensure that both parties should have access to resources from which they can meet legal fees. Sometimes there will be agreement that one party should provide the other with a litigation fund at the outset. This avoids the additional costs of applications to court and/or the often significantly higher rates of interest charged by specialist litigation funders. Once the litigation is progressing, the court can control future expenditure on costs in a number of different ways but the principle is enshrined that fairness and justice require that both parties have access to litigation funding.</span></p>
