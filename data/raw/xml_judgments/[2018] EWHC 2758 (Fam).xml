	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In 1991/1992, it appears that the Husband attempted to commence an IT company in Belgium but he soon came to the conclusion that there were better opportunities in Russia.  At around this time, the parties set up KV Bank in Russia.  The Husband was the Chief Executive Officer and the Wife worked in the compliance department.  The Wife says that her father introduced the first commercial clients, one of which became the best client and that her friends from her lecturing provided invaluable help with regulation as they worked for the Central Bank.  The Husband says the client introduced by the Wife&#8217;s father eventually accounted for only about 3% of turnover whereas the best client, which accounted for 85% of turnover, was introduced by a friend of his.  Whilst I tend to the view that the Husband is more likely to be correct, it does not seem to matter at all to the exercise I have to perform.</p>

There was a banking crisis in 1994 and KV Bank almost went into administration but managed to survive.  In mid-1995, the Wife stopped working for the businesses.  The parties&#8217; first child, C was born in 1995.  She is aged 22.  She is studying in the USA.  The Husband says the total cost of her being there is around $100,000 pa, including college fees of $40,000 pa.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mira had done remarkably well.  The Husband instructed VB Bank to see if it could be sold.  It appears that VB Bank initially valued the business at $60 million but PB Insurance was very keen to get into the Russian market.  In February 2007, PB Insurance purchased MV Ltd, which held 66% of the shares in Mira, for $260 million gross.  There were undoubtedly significant deductions from the gross figure.  I will have to return to this when I make my findings of fact but the Husband&#8217;s case is that he received $87.6 million at this point.  Given the offshore structure that held Mira, there was no immediate tax on the sale proceeds.</p>

The Husband received &#8364;79.6 million for 48% of the shares.  His case is that he only got &#8364;35.1 million as he had to pay the balance into Rimski pursuant to loan agreements.

The gross price was $240 million.  The Husband&#8217;s case is that he received $197 million after deduction of just under $20 million in commission to VB Bank; c$3million in legal fees and a further payment of $20 million into Rimski to cover losses.  If he is right, he received a total net payment from PB Insurance of $284 million.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">His case is that, thereafter, he invested in a number of different business ventures in Russia and Latvia.  This included $91,272,422 in food and wine at Sokol; $41,825,648 in Orel; $23,169,674 in Pustelga; and $16,214,693 in land at Milvus on which he built a golf course.  This amounts to total investments of $172 million.  I will return to his case in relation to these businesses later but, in essence, it is that they have either failed (Orel); been confiscated by Russian officials (a hotel that was the main investment in Pustelga); been given to his son, B (Milvus) or are currently loss-making with no liquidity (Sokol).  It is also his case that he has spent very large additional sums over and above the capital investment propping up these businesses and in family expenditure.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In 2009, the London property was purchased for &#163;15.1 million.  It was registered in the name of Krechet Holdings (owned by Ardea Ltd) but the Husband sensibly accepts that he is the 100% beneficial owner.  The original mortgage was with LB Bank in the sum of (&#163;6.8 million) but the Husband re-mortgaged with FLB Bank in the sum of (&#163;12,950,000) in October 2015.  The property was renovated following its purchase.  The Husband says the renovations cost &#163;1.5 million.    The London property has recently been valued at &#163;17.5 million but, over and above the outstanding mortgage, there are interest arrears of (&#163;475,961) which increase at &#163;84,000 per quarter.</p>

Separate plots and flats were purchased and then amalgamated into one large property. This was done through a French SCI of which the Wife was the owner.  The Husband says that a total of &#8364;37,386,421 was spent but there was a mortgage of (&#8364;28 million). In September 2010, the parties moved to Paris, primarily, it appears, so that the children could be educated there.  They were not, however, able to move into the property until June 2011.  On 26 March 2010, Villa Bellissima, Bellissima Italy was purchased for &#8364;5.6 million.  The Husband says that &#8364;2.5 million was spent on renovations.</p>

The Wife alleges that the Husband &#8220;parked&#8221; assets in exactly the same way with B.   The Husband denies this and says that, in B&#8217;s case, these were gifts as B was taking over the running of the projects.  On 13 August 2011, the Husband transferred two plots at Milvus from his entity (Rusa) to that of B (Cygnus).  Five further plots were transferred to Cygnus by the Husband&#8217;s nominee on 5 June 2013 with two more following on 25 February 2014.</p>

He had started to work for his father in March 2012, first in the Ukraine in Marketing and Sales before moving, later that year, to Russia to make Sokol (the food and wine business) profitable.  It was struggling and had only sold 12,000 bottles in 2012.  He had become Head of Sales and Marketing in September 2013 and taken over the management of the business in 2014.  It is &#8220;haemorrhaging&#8221; money due to old machinery; an expensive and inefficient workforce; bad land investment; mismanagement; and the like.  When he arrived, the business had 30 managers whereas there are 12 today.  There is heavy regulation of wine businesses and he considers investment is needed of $10 million.  The previous manager had mismanaged the companies at a cost of around $12 million pa.  B had been able to reduce the losses quickly to $3 million pa.  He is the sole shareholder in the Abacus vineyard and winery which produces average wine as opposed to premium wine and is profitable.  Although B had sourced the business in 2014 and acquired it out of bankruptcy at a 95% discount, the Husband had loaned him $1.6 million to do so.   He says that his father recognised his big commitment to the project and that it was on the brink of collapse when he arrived such that he transferred the shares in several of the companies to B.  B says he worked tirelessly for five years to turn them around but he recognises that the Husband&#8217;s loans should be repaid if there are profits.  In relation to Milvus, he said that the Husband transferred it to him in 2012/2013 as an unfinished building with a nine-hole golf course.  He has done some work on it but it is still unfinished.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Husband&#8217;s section 25 statement is dated 20 December 2017.  He says he is based in Russia but divides his time elsewhere for business reasons.  He developed a keen interest in wine from his father.  PB Insurance discontinued the arbitration against him as he was not a party to the arbitration agreement.  He confirmed PB Insurance claimed for unpaid tax against Mirus (the corporate owner of Mira before the sale).  There was an award of &#163;7.7 million in PB Insurance&#8217;s favour.  He paid Mirus&#8217; costs of &#163;1.5 million.  PB Insurance recognised it could not enforce against Mirus, as the company had no assets.  An agreement was reached that PB Insurance would not pursue Mirus on the basis that the Husband paid PB Insurance&#8217;s costs.  A refused to return the assets the Husband had placed with him and they have not spoken since 2013.   He said that, from 2007 to 2015, he spent $103 million on business and family living expenses.  He invested $93 million in Sokol but it will fail if further funds (a minimum of $10 million) are not invested.  He lives in Radost in Moscow which the Wife seeks to retain.  The Husband has since said that, on 21 December 2017, Perdix issued a claim against him in Latvia for &#8364;3,015,452.  </p>

She complains that the Husband did not account to her for one half of the net proceeds of Mira which were legally hers.  Moreover, if there is a tax liability following the sale of the Paris flat, she will be liable even though she did not receive the proceeds of sale.  She says she has been told the claim, including interest and penalties, could be as much as &#8364;12 million.  She therefore seeks an indemnity from the Husband by, if necessary, a declaration.  She repeats that the Husband received $465 million from PB Insurance (as the documentation from PB Insurance says this) although she accepts it was subject to some deductions.  The Husband then made reckless investments without discussion with her.  She says she made it clear she was very much against the Sokol project.  The Husband has told her the investment was as high as $110 million.  The Husband has given vast sums to his sons.  He has failed to disclose a French account that, at one point since the separation, contained &#8364;394,000 although it had reduced to &#8364;107,162 by June 2016.  She adds that the chattels in the warehouse in Russia that had come from France were worth between &#163;2-3 million.  She has obtained sales invoices for a minority of the items in the sum of &#8364;1,258,000.  She does not wish to have any interest in the Husband&#8217;s business ventures as she does not trust him.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Luke Steadman of Alvarez and Marsal, produced his final report on 29 December 2017.  He confirms that the Husband invested $172.4 million in his businesses.  This broadly consisted of equity in Sokol of $30.3 million and $61.9 million in debt (loans); $41.8 million in Orel; $23.2 million in Pustelga; and $16.2 million in Milvus.  On a tentative basis, Mr Steadman values the Husband&#8217;s interest in Sokol LLC at $3,593,000 and in Crex at $204,000.  The maximum debt he could recover from S&#8217;s companies, including Wine FPX, is $35,115,293 although this may be theoretical and depend on a sale of the businesses.  At the time, he was unable to place a value on the Orel properties in Riga, Latvia due to a lack of valuations and evidence as to mortgages.  He thought there was some hope value in Turnix, which specialises in the production of ultra-capacitors in the Ukraine but the current value is negligible.  There is no value in Wine Trade TP but Wine Trade TLP was valued at $744,000.  I pause to note, however, that this company has been transferred to A.   Pustelga is valued at nil as the two companies are bankrupt.  Finally, the value of Milvus is unknown without a specialist land valuation although, again, I note that it is the Husband&#8217;s case that it has been transferred to B.  </p>

The equivalent Note filed on behalf of the Husband says he has produced 22 bundles of documents supporting his case and showing the expenditure since the sales of Mira and Rimski.  He says that the difference between his presentation and that of the Wife in relation to the sale proceeds of Mira is that she has failed to recognise that PB Insurance required both the payment of an $80.5 million &#8220;non-qualifying asset&#8221; reserve into Mira as well as an $80 million escrow account.  As there were total deductions of $42.9 million from what the Husband received over and above these sums, the total he got in his hands was $284 million net plus the payment for Rimski.  He makes the point that the Wife has not sought to set aside the transactions in favour of the Husband&#8217;s sons. </p>

The Husband was cross-examined, perfectly properly by Mr Dyer QC, who appears for the Wife with Ms Chapman, over a period of almost exactly two days.  I sensed, by the end of his evidence, that he was feeling the strain.  There were two potential reasons for this.  The first was that he was disconcerted by the questions he was being asked.  The second was that he was unwell.  At the conclusion of B&#8217;s evidence on Friday afternoon, 26 January 2018, Mr Dyer said he intended to apply for an order seizing the Husband&#8217;s passport in due course.  I did not indicate whether this submission found favour with me or not although Mr Peel QC, who appears for the Husband with Ms Williams, indicated it was an ambitious strategy.  </p>

Mr Dyer asked, rhetorically, why he had not sought treatment in London and wondered if it was related to the Wife&#8217;s application for a passport order.  He later added that the Husband has previously been treated in Germany.  It may be that the Husband wished to be treated by doctors in his own country.  I have not heard oral evidence on this aspect and cannot therefore come to a conclusion.  Nevertheless, I directed that a medical report be filed by 4pm on Wednesday 31 January 2018.</p>

First, I must decide whether or not he did deliberately tell lies.  If I find that he did, I have to ask myself why he lied.  The mere fact that someone tells a lie is not in itself evidence that the person concerned has undisclosed assets.  An individual may lie for many reasons.  They may possibly be &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">innocent</span>&#8221; ones in the sense that they do not denote a false presentation of his current financial position.

But having had the opportunity of watching him over many days in court, and not only when he was in the witness box, I am satisfied that the husband was an honest, truthful and, for the vast majority of the time, also an accurate and reliable witness.

He really had no explanation for this failure.  He was asked about the disclosure he gave to FLB in April 2015 which was undoubtedly misleading and wrong.  He had told FLB his updated assets as of 17 April 2015 were (a) property in London worth &#163;21 million (which ignored the mortgage); (b) property in Italy worth &#8364;16 million; (c) 49.96% of Rimski &#8211; &#8364;51 million (whereas he knew full well by then that the shares were next to worthless); (d) cash proceeds of sale of Mira - &#8364;467 million (which was an inaccurate gross figure); and (e) investment assets - &#8364;50 million in private equity funds (which was, on his case, misleading and inaccurate as to current value).  In a letter dated 17 April 2015, he said his annual income from investments was &#8364;2 million.  That is certainly not his case today. He tried to explain these documents in a number of different ways, claiming mistake and that the &#8364;50 million referred to the investment in Orel.  He was constrained to accept that the agreement to pay &#8364;51 million for the second half of Rimski had been turned down in 2011, four years earlier and that he subsequently sold the shares for only &#8364;9,000.  As to the income figure, he suggested this might be the sale of assets but that is not what he said.

His explanation that it was not supplied as Mr Steadman wanted individual budgets for each company was risible.

The history behind this is that the Wife says that statements for these accounts were sent to the London property.

I was shown some attempts to get the statements from FLB last autumn although Mr Dyer says these were sent to an email address that is no longer in operation.  Even as the evidence closed, I still did not have any statements although I accept that the most recent delays appear to have been on the part of FLB.

He said he had forgotten about the account but I do not accept that evidence as he was reminded about it via the letters from the Wife&#8217;s solicitor.

Mr Peel reminds me that the Wife&#8217;s maintenance was supposed to be &#163;180,000 pa arguing that the Husband&#8217;s expenditure was not out of kilter with that but it misses the point, namely that he was paying nothing to the Wife.   </p>

It revealed a second credit card with GVB that had never been disclosed.  Moreover, when B gave evidence, he said that his father had a credit card permanently for the Colomba Bank account and that the GVB account belonged to his father and not him.  The Husband told me, through his counsel, that B was mistaken.  Subsequent disclosure from GVB shows that the account was indeed opened by B but he clearly did not think that this account belonged to him.

When asked to update the statements at the outset of the case, the Husband said, for the first time, that he had transferred Pustelga to a third party in March 2017 for nil consideration.  No logical reason was given for this transaction other than that Pustelga was expensive to run.  The Husband said it cost $200,000 per annum but this seems a very high figure.  The third party was only identified as a person who works with Orel in Latvia.  The Husband added that the agreement said he could continue to use Pustelga to channel &#8364;150,000 to pay his personal bills but I believe I was being told the source of this money was the Husband&#8217;s financial department and originated from the Sokol Group.  The suggestion appeared to be that it was necessary to avoid money laundering problems but this seems unlikely if the source really was Sokol.  </p>

He told me he had instructed lawyers in France and he thought the French tax authorities had missed the deadline for making a claim.  He therefore said that, as he didn&#8217;t see any risk, he did not see why he had to give the Wife an indemnity.  He said he would not sign an indemnity on his own.  The counter argument is that, if the risk is non-existent, there is no prejudice to him in signing the indemnity.   </p>

I accept that the valuations merely revealed that the mortgages on the properties were significantly in excess of market value but I cannot accept that the Husband did not know about the valuations.  If he did not, he should have checked when asked for any valuations.  It was another silly lie although I cannot see what he gained from it.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The position of Wine FPX is completely unsatisfactory.  The case presented by the Husband and B is that B decided to branch out into cheaper wine that could be sold as a supplement to Sokol&#8217;s premium wine.  I was told that a local vineyard was in bankruptcy and that it was possible to buy it for a discount of 95%.  B had soon been able to turn it round and make it profitable.  Mr Steadman had extracted the figures from the accounts which showed a loss of (Roubles 45 million) in 2014; a loss of (Roubles 52 million) in 2015; but a profit of Roubles 293 million in 2016.  The 2016 accounts showed an operating profit of Roubles 104 million increased by &#8220;other income&#8221; of Roubles 267 million but subject to expenses to reach the Roubles 293 million figure.  When asked about this &#8220;other income&#8221;, B was unable to identify it but said that, although the revenue of Wine FPX was increasing every year, the figures in the accounts were not correct.  He said they were &#8220;massaged&#8221; as the company was under a tax investigation.  The tax investigation was resolved in November 2017.  He then said that they had increased the numbers in some years and reduced them in others.  This means that the figures Mr Steadman relied on were completely inaccurate and Mr Steadman had not been told of the inaccuracy.  B then said that he believed there was a profit of around Roubles 60 million in 2016 and Roubles 50 million last year.  At an exchange rate of 80 roubles to the pound, these figures equate to &#163;750,000 and &#163;625,000 respectively.  </p>

The consequence of all of this is that I cannot rely on the disclosure given in relation to the Sokol Group at all.  The Husband has not disclosed the 2017 budget.  The Wine FPX accounts are works of fiction.   The true position is shrouded in mystery other than that they have a very good product, excellent facilities and an enormous sum of money has been invested in the business.  </p>

He told Mr Dyer that he got the majority of the information that he asked for but did not get any forecasts for any of the Sokol companies.  He said he found it surprising when he was told there weren&#8217;t any. He was not asked to do a forensic investigation and did not do so.  He told Mr Peel that his team did receive cooperation but it took a long time.

I remind myself that the Husband owns various companies in the Group in which he invested $31 million and he also has loans outstanding to the companies transferred to B in the sum of $60 million.  Mr Steadman had valued the Husband&#8217;s companies on the basis of an Enterprise Value using four different scenarios, namely closure of the business; continuation of the business as now; recovery of the business; and expansion of the business. He assigned 25% to each value to give him an overall value which was Roubles 506 million.  He then deducted the net debt of the companies of (Roubles 291 million) to give an equity value of Roubles 215 million which is $3.7 million.  Mr Dyer referred him to a comparable sale of a company in 2014 in the same region that was loss making but where the price equated to 3.3 times the turnover.  Mr Steadman&#8217;s valuation was between 2.2 times and 2.8 times Sokol&#8217;s turnover.  If the higher multiple was used, said Mr Dyer, the value would increase to $7.9 million.  Mr Steadman stuck to his figure saying that it is impossible to know what synergies there may have been in the other sale to make the target company more valuable to the purchasing company than might otherwise have been the case.  I remind myself that valuation evidence of this kind is an art not a science.  Moreover, if I cannot rely on the figures given for Sokol&#8217;s turnover, it is all academic.  If Wine FPX&#8217;s figures are unreliable, what confidence can I have in Sokol&#8217;s?  Overall, I accept Mr Steadman&#8217;s evidence but subject to the caveat that he was using the figures he was given which may well be inaccurate or misstated. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">I now turn to my conclusions.  I start with the historical position.  It is quite clear to me that the Husband&#8217;s case today as to the net amount he received from Mira and Rimski is accurate, although I accept he did not give a frank account at the commencement of these proceedings.  By the end of closing submissions, Mr Dyer effectively accepted that the Husband&#8217;s figures were correct.  I have come to this conclusion having analysed the documents disclosed.  It is clear to me that the $80.5 million &#8220;non-qualifying asset payment&#8221; and the $80 million escrow account both went back into Mira to recapitalise the business.  This is not remotely surprising given the huge sum received by the Husband, particularly when it is remembered that VB Bank&#8217;s original estimation was that the business was only worth $60 million.  It follows that the Husband received:-</p>

This means he received a net figure of $284,000,000.  I entirely accept that there is no documentary evidence that he paid the $20 million into Rimski but it seems inherently likely to me that he did so, given the requirement that he made a further payment in when the business was sold the same year.  In any event, it does not matter very much in the context of the sum he did receive.</p>

Given the fact that the bank subsequently became worthless, it seems highly likely that he would have had to do so.  Initially, Mr Dyer argued that the Husband received the benefit of half this sum but I am satisfied that he got no value out of the company after the first sale.  After all, the agreement was that he would get a further &#8364;51 million for the remaining shares but this was vetoed in Cyprus.  Again, this is not surprising given the subsequent demise of the Bank.  I might have had some trouble in accepting that the Husband went on to sell his remaining shares for only &#8364;9,000 to the Bulgarian investors in 2015 were it not for the withdrawal of the Bank&#8217;s licence in September 2016.  The writing was on the wall and the Husband appears to have seen that and got out before there was any question of any further personal liability.</p>

I recognise that I have not seen the FLB statements, although the current delay appears to lie with FLB not the Husband.  The statements she did see do not show millions of pounds in the account and I remind myself that he did say he had a current account at FLB in Paris in his Form E.  </p>

It is not surprising that he wished to reinvest in further businesses.  If that had not been his approach, he would never have made the money in the first place.  I am satisfied that he did not deliberately go out to lose this money.  The investments were largely made long before the breakdown of this marriage.  He is Russian and had made his money in Russia so it was not unreasonable to invest again in Russia.  He has suffered from the difficulties in the Russian economy and, in particular, the problems following the annexation of Crimea, that he could not have anticipated.  This has led to a collapse in the Rouble and in business confidence.  I accept that he was not experienced in wine and food before he launched Sokol but he was just as inexperienced in banking and insurance before he started KV Bank and Mira.  The knowledge of the Wife and her father does not meet this point.  Indeed, KV Bank itself went bankrupt and would have brought the family to penury if the Husband had not been able to get it all going again via Rimski.  </p>

I recognise that it is a source of frustration for her that she opposed the Sokol venture and now has to accept a half-share of its losses.  Regrettably, there is no perfect solution in many cases.

The Husband accepts that he transferred assets to A to avoid possible enforcement in the arbitration proceedings.  I do not know the value of these assets but the evidence is clear that the Husband has fallen out with A and will not get the money back.  I suppose it could be said he has only himself to blame but there it is.  The position with B is not so straightforward.  I do not know if the Husband transferred the assets to B to avoid enforcement or, in relation to the latter Milvus transfers, whether the Wife&#8217;s claim played any part.  It does not matter in relation to Sokol because the Husband has retained the benefit of his loans but it does matter in relation to Milvus. The Husband had invested a significant sum ($16.2 million).  It is nonsense to suggest that only B could bring the project to fruition.  B had no independent finance to enable him to do so and no expertise in this area.  I recognise that B told me it was now his asset but it was gifted to him and, if his father needs the money back, I take the view that B owes a moral obligation to his father who has done so much for him.  If he refuses like A, the Husband has only himself to blame.  If his finances were as dire as he says, he should not have parted with this asset.  I recognise I have no valuation but that does not matter.  I take the view this is either a resource of the Husband or, if I am wrong about that, it should have been and amounts to wanton dissipation.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">I am not, however, prepared to accept the Husband&#8217;s presentation of Sokol.  He has invested a total of $91 million in the companies plus the financing of the losses that, at one point, was said to be $12 million in a year.  The website shows significant impressive assets that must have a value.  The Husband and the businesses own at least 4,000 hectares.  He values the land at $1,000 per hectare which is $4 million of itself, although some of this is included in the land he owns direct.  I am satisfied that Wine FPX and Sokol operate together to their mutual benefit and I accept B&#8217;s evidence as to the businesses supporting each other.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">I do not know if Sokol is still losing money.  I am satisfied that the 2017 budget was not disclosed for good reason.  It must have shown significant projected profit.  I recognise that projected profit does not always result in actual profit but I am entitled to draw inferences from the failure to disclose.  If the Husband is telling the truth, he should have disclosed the document but explained that the actual position was not so favourable.  Given the acceptance that the Wine FPX figures are fiction, I am minded to accept that, overall, the group is profitable and financing both the Husband and his son.  If it is not, given the amount invested, he again has only himself to blame.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">I have no idea as to value.  Mr Steadman valued the Sokol equity companies at $3,593,000 and Crex, the cheesemaker in which the Husband owns 20%, at $204,000.  He placed a figure of $35 million on the Sokol debt although I accept that he said that it was &#8220;theoretical recovery of loans&#8230;.no current liquidity and value may depend on sale.&#8221;  I am quite clear that, if there is liquidity, whether on a sale or otherwise, the Husband is entitled to be repaid and will be repaid.  It could hardly be said that the $1.6 million loaned to Wine FPX should not be included although I accept it is a small sum compared to the other loans.  It follows that I find there is value in Sokol.  In one sense, it is impossible to say how much but I am going to ascribe a value of &#163;5 million to the loans (including Wine FPX) and &#163;2,771,810 to the equity companies and Crex.    I accept these sums are not liquid but I have discounted the loans very heavily, particularly given the value of the land and the profitability of Wine FPX.  I am satisfied that I am entitled to include these figures, so heavily discounted, in my schedule of assets.  Again, if I am wrong, the Husband has only himself to blame.  Finally, my overall conclusion is that the Husband is in a position to provide himself with an income from these assets.  Mr Peel asks why the Husband should have to go &#8220;cap in hand&#8221; to his son.  The answer is because these businesses were the brain child of the Husband; he set them up and invested enormous sums in them; he structured them in such a way that he might have to go &#8220;cap in hand to his son&#8221;; and he is owed very significant sums of money from them that he needs as and when it becomes available.   </p>

The Husband suggested a fund from the sale proceeds of the London property which I reject as being unreasonable.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">The only question is whether the Husband should pay all the education fees or whether they should be split equally.  If the Husband had satisfied me as to his current financial position, it may well have been that equal division was appropriate but he has not.  It follows that I make an order that he pays D&#8217;s school fees and C&#8217;s education costs in America.  He has been doing so and should continue to do so. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in"> I have decided that the Wife should have the benefit of the property in Brussels.  The report of her expert, Tibault Le Hardy, dated 18 January 2018 suggests it is held in joint names but the assets schedule shows it as belonging to the Husband.  The expert suggests that both parties must sign the deed of transfer before a notary in Brussels.  I do not believe that will happen.  It is said that it is &#8220;theoretically possible&#8221; that the English order could be treated as a deed of transfer and registered direct but that seems inherently unlikely to me.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">I am of the view that an order for sale with payment of the net proceeds to the Wife is far more likely to achieve the result I propose.  I therefore make an order for sale and for payment of the proceeds to the Wife.  I am prepared to certify that it is for her maintenance pursuant to the wide definition given in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Van den Boogard v Laumen</span> [C-220/95).  It will be up to her then to enforce it as best she can.    </p>
