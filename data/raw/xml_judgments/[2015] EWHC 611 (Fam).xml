	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 4 February 2015, I heard an application on behalf of Evelyn Rojas Sanchez (hereafter &#8220;the mother&#8221;) for the committal to prison of Pawel Oboz (&#8220;the father&#8221;) and Jolanta Oboz (&#8220;the paternal grandmother&#8221;) (see <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2015/235" uk:canonical="[2015] EWHC 235 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWHC 235 (Fam)</ref>).  The mother alleged breaches of two orders made by Judges of the Family Division dated 8 and 15 August 2014; by those orders the father and the paternal grandmother were required to return the child Isabella (aged 3) to this jurisdiction from Poland, where they had unlawfully retained her following a holiday.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I took the unusual course, for reasons set out in that judgment (see [4] and [5] of <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2015/235" uk:canonical="[2015] EWHC 235 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWHC 235 (Fam)</ref>), of hearing that application in the absence of the Respondents, who had remained in Poland.  I found that the father had been properly served with the proceedings, had been afforded adequate notice of the application, and had offered no explanation for his absence; I concluded that it was fair and just to proceed in his absence.  I determined the facts of the application and concluded that the mother had made good her case.  I specifically found (see [38] and [41]) that the father had breached the orders by not returning Isabella to this country, and had not taken steps to facilitate her return. I adjourned the question of sentence so that the father could avail himself of representation, further giving him the opportunity to return Isabella to the jurisdiction; had this happened by today, I would have been able to take into account on the question of sentence.</p>

The wilful retention of a child abroad in circumstances such as these is child abduction of the most heinous kind; it is an act of emotional abuse to the child.  In this case, Isabella has been deprived of her relationship with her mother who until her unlawful retention in Poland was her primary carer; she has been denied the regularity of an environment which is familiar to her.</p>

By adjourning today&#8217;s sentence I gave the father opportunity to return Isabella &amp;/or to come to court to explain himself &amp;/or to offer some mitigation for his conduct.  He has chosen to do none of these things.</p>
