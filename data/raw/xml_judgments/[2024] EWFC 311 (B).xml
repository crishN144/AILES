They have tried to do this by working out tax brackets from his drawdown on his pension, from documentation, which I have to say was not the most helpful, from the CMS and seeking third party disclosure orders.</span></p>

That adverse inference covers the extent of his current assets and that would include the value of the business, which is or may be his main asset which, as a result of this judgment, is going to remain in the husband&#8217;s name. This will provide him with an ongoing income. </span></p>

If somebody chooses not to attend a final hearing and they do not want to attend court, there is nothing I can do about that, but, as I warned at my PTR order, there may be unhelpful consequences to them. As far as the Husband is concerned, he has withheld giving the Court information about his current financial circumstances and has failed to engage. Ultimately this is a matter for him but I can and do draw an adverse inference. </span></p>

This was Mr&#160;Deegan, counsel.  I am very grateful to Mr&#160;Deegan for his help to the Court, it enabled me to conduct what I consider to be a fair hearing.  He had, in my judgment, carefully read the papers, he understood the case that he believed, and I believe, the husband would have wanted put, on his behalf, and he asked appropriate questions that, in my judgment, Mr&#160;B would have wanted to ask the wife.  Therefore, I am satisfied that the wife was fully challenged in terms of her evidence, enabling this to be a fully contested hearing.</span></p>

To put it mildly, he was extremely unhappy about an order in one of the preliminary stages of the proceedings, made by Deputy Judge Wooderson.  At the time, in November 2022, I tried to sort that order out, so that I could move the case along and my intention, although I am sure the husband would say that this was misplaced, was to help the husband, in terms of moving the case forward.  However, that was not recognised or, sadly, appreciated by the husband, and what followed was then multiple, nested, applications to the Court to sort out something that I believe I had already resolved, and was again resolved, with the attendance of Mr B, at the intervention hearing.  Not happy with that, Mr&#160;B then made numerous further applications, presumably with the intention of wearing everybody down.</span></p>

However, I am going to make a bar at the end of that, a section&#160;28(1A) bar because the youngest child will be 18 at that stage and I suspect that over that period of time, the wife will be able to increase her income, particularly as the children become more independent, and she is going to be able to increase those earnings, to some extent.</span></p>

I do not have that information, so I suspect there is more assets there than we know about, but &#163;210 is the figure I have taken for the wife.</span></p>

From that needs to come the commission to be deducted but it seems to me that I cannot have one approach for one party and one approach for the other, so I am taking out chattels completely.  There is an issue about chattels, in terms of the wife getting some chattels that the husband has taken back.  I think, in my judgment, the fairest thing to do is just take all of that out apart from the two watches.  </span></p>

It seems to me that there is no place in my consideration for looking at the costs orders as an asset of the wife, or looking at it as a debt of the husband because that will lead to a muddle.  There are Children Act proceedings, there are costs orders in relation to preliminary issue hearing that have not yet been resolved, as I understand it.  Those costs orders should, in my judgment, just be enforced, as the best the wife can do in terms of enforcing them against whatever assets she can find in due course.  I have taken them out of the equation, not because I want to disregard them, but just because they are debts that have accumulated as a result of the court process and it seems to me that that is the fairest thing to do, rather than try to give the wife notional assets and the husband a notional debt without knowing actually whether that debt is ever going to be satisfied.  Therefore, this exercise is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but that is the approach that I have taken.</span></p>
