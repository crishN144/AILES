Coroners&#8217; documentation refers to the death as being treated as &#8216;unexplained.&#8217; The guardian is concerned that children in these parents&#8217; care have been put at risk but at this time it is unknown the exact level of risk, and therefore whether the parents have insight into this as we do not know exactly what happened. Thus, the court may need to seek a finding of fact hearing to explore this properly and expert overview of the postmortem medical and police papers, mothers maternity records and births records for the birth of the twins to provide if there is any missed evidence/ opinion as to causation can be formed.</span></p>

Rather it is the instruction of an expert for the purposes of establishing (if warranted) the factors considered in such an application. I refer back to &#167;7 above. The expert is said to be required as &#8216;this this may be the last opportunity for a proper and full assessment to define the risk to these and any future children of this young family.&#8217; It is contended this need not lead to delay if the outcome remains neutral but that if a positive finding comes back then any additional delay would be justified.

They argued the appointment was not necessary given the available evidence and that it would cause unjustified delay. In addition, it would have a broadly negative impact on the parents and family without any purpose. The application amounted to a fishing exercise and any conclusion as to co-sleeping would not amount to a threshold finding. Whatever the view of the expert it would have to be assessed on the basis that it was a paper exercise in comparison to the physical examinations and conclusions drawn at the time. There is no basis for arguing the instructed ISW has been unable to fully engage with the issue as to risk from co-sleeping in the absence of an expert report.</span></p>

I agree with those for the parents who argue there has been a thorough and extensive consideration of the cause of death of this child. The Court has access to the results of a physical examination undertaken by a consultant paediatrician and the post-mortem examination undertaken by a paediatric pathologist. In addition, an assessment of contemporaneous circumstances can be found in the police process which ran alongside the medical investigation. </span></p>

Whilst this conclusion does not identify a discrete cause it is nonetheless a professionally acceptable categorisation of cause of death. The &#8216;unexplained&#8217; component is not suggestive of a lack of thorough investigation rather it is the conclusion reached on the available medical investigation after a thorough investigation. It is very difficult to understand on what basis a paper review would likely reshape conclusions as to cause of death with any greater accuracy.</span></p>

I have noted the high-quality evidence available, evidence which was obtained for the very purpose of assessing likely cause of death. Evidence which had the profound benefit of being contemporaneous and which was able to physically exam the child. I have received no foundation for casting doubt on either the qualifications or the quality of those investigations. I also have regard to delay. These proceedings have already exceeded 26 weeks and today I have had to extend the proceedings further. I accept it is possible this information could be obtained without causing further delay but there is a reasonable likelihood it would push the case back further into May of next year. For the avoidance of doubt this might be delay which was justified and indeed required were the circumstances difference. But in the circumstances before me I consider it highly likely such delay will be shown to have had no purpose at all. I also bear in mind (e) insofar as there is evidence already in existence from professionals on this very issue. In my analysis above I have commented as to factor (b) in that the issue would be co-sleeping alone; this is an acknowledged fact of the case, and it seems clear it is a possible cause of the death. I have struggled to see what benefit would be provided to the case by greater clarity for the reasons given above. I bear in mind the other factors but make no specific further comment.</span></p>

(ii) The likely cost to public funds can extend to the expenditure of court resources and their diversion from other cases. (iii) The time that the investigation will take allows the court to take account of the nature of the evidence. For example, an incident that has been recorded electronically may be swifter to prove than one that relies on contested witness evidence or circumstantial argument. (iv) The evidential result may relate not only to the case before the court but also to other existing or likely future cases in which a finding one way or the other is likely to be of importance. The public interest in the identification of perpetrators of child abuse can also be considered. (v) The relevance of the potential result of the investigation to the future care plans for the child should be seen in the light of the s. 31(3B) obligation on the court to consider the impact of harm on the child and the way in which his or her resulting needs are to be met. (vi) The impact of any fact-finding process upon the other parties can also take account of the opportunity costs for the local authority, even if it is the party seeking the investigation, in terms of resources and professional time that might be devoted to other children. (vii) The prospects of a fair trial may also encompass the advantages of a trial now over a trial at a possibly distant and unpredictable future date. (viii) The justice of the case gives the court the opportunity to stand back and ensure that all matters relevant to the overriding objective have been taken into account. One such matter is whether the contested allegation may be investigated within criminal proceedings. Another is the extent of any gulf between the factual basis for the court's decision with or without a fact-finding hearing. The level of seriousness of the disputed allegation may inform this assessment. As I have said, the court must ask itself whether its process will do justice to the reality of the case.&#8221;</span></p>

When considering the potential evidential result of a fact-finding hearing it may sometimes be appropriate for the judge to have regard to the apparent quality of the evidence. It will never be appropriate, however, to carry out a detailed evaluation, not least because the court can only make findings on the totality of the evidence and at the case management stage not all of the evidence will have been filed. Anything akin to a mini trial of the allegations would therefore be wrong in principle and wasteful of time and resources. Although each decision will depend upon the circumstances of the case, the apparent quality of the evidence is accordingly unlikely to be a powerful factor in the overall decision unless it is clear without the need for detailed assessment that the evidence appears to be particularly strong or particularly weak&#8230;</span></p>

It is not always a straightforward decision. Care proceedings are quasi-inquisitorial. They are not confined within the tramlines of adversarial pleadings. There is therefore a recurrent danger that they veer off track. In a case with a complex family history, the court will often be encouraged by one party or another to explore an issue that has been unearthed during the investigation. Judges have to be very careful before acceding to such an application to avoid the unnecessary use of the limited resources available. In deciding whether to hold a fact-finding hearing, it is imperative that they conduct a proportionality analysis by reference to the factors identified in the Oxfordshire case and Re H-D-H.&#8221;</span></p>

I observe &#8216;potentially&#8217; as I keep in mind the question of translating the expert&#8217;s possible conclusion in such regard into a finding of the Court would itself require a decision as to future fact finding and would itself likely be controversial given the alternative evidence available. Whilst it is not for me to conduct a mini-trial at this stage I am conscious of the submission already made on behalf of the parents that a Court could not, even in the presence of a positive opinion as to cause from the expert assume that would enable a finding given the opinions expressed by the examining clinicians.</span></p>

I question the prospects of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">conducting a fair fact-finding hearing</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt"> in the circumstances that confront me. As noted above a conclusion of co-sleeping as likely cause would be but stage 1 of an investigative process conducted by the Court. For this to justify a threshold finding it would require proof of significant harm attributable to the care given by the care giver. I consider this would necessitate an investigation not of the fact of co-sleeping but of the circumstances surrounding the same. With the passage of time material information such as parental toxicology would not be available. There would be no opportunity to carry out a non-paper examination to counter any views reached by the expert. In this context I doubt the real benefit of any </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">evidential result</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt"> reached at the end of such a process. To what extent would it materially progress the case. I accept one would have a finding, but I question to what extent this materially assists the professionals in working with the parents or the real likelihood of the parents reshaping their approach as a consequence. Plainly, I have doubted the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">necessity</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt"> of the process given significant and high-quality existing evidence. Finally, I cannot for my part see that the result of the same would have obvious </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">relevance for the investigation as to the future plans for the children</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">. In this case the investigation is already proceeding on the basis that co-sleeping is an important risk factor. The key issue in such regard appears to be the capability or willingness of the parents to recognize the same and develop their parenting style in the light of the same. I disagree with the guardian that something significant changes if the parents are confronted on the same basis in the light of a professional opinion as to probability as compared to possibility. I agree the situation would be different if this were a suggested fact-finding issue which would of itself be a basis for determining placement for the children. But it is not. As to the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">interests of the child</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt"> I consider these are far more closely linked to a timely resolution of these proceedings than to a determination of co-sleeping as a likely cause of death of their sibling. I am mindful of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">time the investigation will take</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt"> and particularly so given the likelihood of it further delaying the process whilst in my assessment bringing limited value to the process. Considering the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">justice of the case</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt"> and the related observations in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">Re H</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt"> I question the real extent of actual dispute between the parties in relation to this issue. As I have made clear there is no factual dispute as to co-sleeping and the evidence is clear that this may have been a possible cause of death. It is a risk factor which needs to be understood and assessed with respect to the future care needs of the other children. It can be assessed. It does not require the Court to elevate the possibility to a probability.</span></p>
