M was born as the result of artificial or assisted conception and of an agreement, the basis of which is highly contested, between S (the 1</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">st</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> Respondent and the mother) and H (the 1</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">st</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> Applicant and the father) and B (the 2</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">nd</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> Applicant) his partner. H is in a long-term and committed relationship with B and was at the time of conception. H and B contend that they had an agreement with S that she would act as a surrogate and that H and B would co-parent the child but that S would continue to play a role in the child&#8217;s life. S says that she and H entered an agreement that excluded B that H would be, in effect, a sperm-donor and that she would take on the role of M&#8217;s main parent and carer. She described herself and H as being like two heterosexual parents that have a child and are separated. Through out these proceedings S has vociferously rejected B playing any parental role in M&#8217;s life. </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">Very sadly this case is another example of how &#8220;agreements&#8221; between potential parents reached privately to conceive children to build a family go wrong and cause great distress to the biological parents and their spouses or partners. The conclusions this court has made about the agreement between the parties which led to the conception and birth of this child will inform the basis of future decisions the court has to make about the arrangements for the child. The lack of a properly supported and regulated framework for arrangements of this kind has, inevitably, lead to an increase in these cases before the Family Court. </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">The case consisted of applications by H and B (the Applicants) for parental responsibility and for residence and contact (now child arrangement orders) and of cross-applications by S (the Respondent) for residence and contact. These applications were made under s8 of the Children Act (CA) 1989 in February 2014 prior to the Children and Families Act (CFA) 2014 coming into force. On the 25</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> April 2014 Deputy District Judge Morris made an order that H has parental responsibility for M. There have been repeated references to surrogacy in these proceedings particularly on behalf of H and B as it is the Applicants&#8217; case that they had reached an agreement that S would act as their surrogate so that they could have a child who would be a part of their family. S says that H had agreed to be her sperm donor. The legislation which governs altruistic surrogacy has no part in the decisions of the court as S does not consent to a parental order or to having acted as a gestational surrogate; indeed even on the Applicants&#8217; case S was to play an active role in the life of the child. The law which applies is that which applies in all private family disputes and is set out below.</span></p>

The Respondent had registered the child on her own with her surname and with first names chosen by her that had not been discussed with the Applicants or agreed between the parties. The Applicants also applied for an order prohibiting S from having M baptised according to Christian Orthodox rites as although all three of the parties are Christian H is a Protestant and B is Roman-Catholic. An order was made by Recorder Bazley QC which prohibited any party form removing M from the jurisdiction or from causing or arranging for her to be baptised or christened. In the event S not only disobeyed the order of the court and had M baptised but lied about having done so. She informed the court and the parties that she had M baptised in October 2014 at the hearing in January 2015; this despite her assurances to the contrary to the guardian in December 2014 and to the court in her own statement dated the 7</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> January 2015.</span></p>

In addition to those applications referred to above which concern decisions by the court about with whom M should live, the time she should spend with the parent or parents with whom she is not living, the court has to decide whether M&#8217;s name should be added to, restrictions on travel outside the jurisdiction and the issue of a Romanian passport for her, and whether further applications to the court need to be limited pursuant to s91 (14) of the CA. </span></p>

The circumstances of M&#8217;s conception and birth are relevant because M will, in time, need to understand the background to her birth, and secondly because it will inform and assist the court in reaching its decisions to conclude what agreements were made prior to M&#8217;s conception and birth. This approach to a factual dispute was endorsed by the Court of Appeal in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">Re N</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">. In that case the court at first instance found that the &#8220;surrogate&#8221; mother had deliberately embarked on a path of deception, driven by her compulsive desire to bear a child or further children, and that she had never had any objective other than to obtain insemination by surrogacy, with the single purpose of acquiring for herself another child.

In addition, after this judgment was given, there is a police record of S complaining to the police that W&#8217;s computer was full of pornographic images and that he had acted as a sperm donor in relation to the conception of the two girls.</span></p>

In the course of that hearing the guardian invited the court to consider in principle whether an expert assessment was necessary; not because it was her case that an expert assessment was necessary, but because of the difficulties over S&#8217;s legal representation and in consideration of how she put her case regarding breast-feeding and co-sleeping. The guardian, presciently, thought that an assessment in respect of attachment would be sought by S at some point. The guardian wished to avoid a late application for an assessment and the possibility of further delay in this case, in circumstances where she had already expressed concern as to why it has taken so long to settle arrangements for M.  Should the court have determined that an expert assessment was necessary, the solicitor for the child was prepared to undertake the practical steps so that the mother would not be unduly disadvantaged by her lack of legal funding and further delay would not occur.</span></p>

The fact that there are not any emails produced after February supported his case. It also fits in with the insemination taking place about the fourth week of April 2013, in the Applicants&#8217; home with B there on at least one occasion. It is, and I use the term advisedly, inconceivable that B was not aware of what was going on before April and was not party to any of the discussions. In this as in much else I do not accept the evidence of S. Her later use, in evidence, of the term &#8220;sperm donor&#8221; is completely at odds with the tone and contents of her emails in February. It is not possible to accept both from what H told her in the emails and from the obviously close relationship of H and B (which I have seen at close quarters throughout the trial) that S could have ever thought that she was having a child with H to the exclusion of B; she says so herself in her emails. I conclude that she must have either deliberately misled the Applicants about her intentions or changed her mind as the pregnancy progressed.</span></p>

Having at first encouraged H to be involved S was already trying to exclude H not long before M was born from involvement with the birth and with the child. I accept the evidence of H and B that S was a part of the arrangements that were made to rent a larger property. If as she claimed they were aware from the outset that any child would be her&#8217;s  and live with her there would have been no reason to go to the expense of moving and furnishing a larger home. It highly unlikely that S could ever have thought H, who had told her he so desperately wanted a child in his emails, would decide to act as a sperm donor for her, there was no reason for him to do and it would have been entirely at odds with his own plans and wishes.</span></p>

Far from being a child that she conceived with her good friend, as she describes it, her actions have always been of a woman determined to treat the child as solely her own. She made sure that H was not at the hospital when M was born; she registered the birth without putting H on the certificate and did not give the child any names except those chosen by her and did not reflect the child&#8217;s paternal family names in that choice. The history of these proceedings bears this out; H and B were left with no choice but to issue applications.</span></p>

S has repeated used the emotive image of a child being removed from her mother&#8217;s breast and refused breast milk as part of her attempts to gain sympathy and opprobrium for the Applicants and the court. It is not in the interests of any child to use breast-feeding, or co-sleeping, to curtail that child&#8217;s interaction with another parent or to deny her an opportunity to develop a healthy relationship with that parent. I have little doubt that that is what S set out to do, at least in part, and it was an action which was contrary to M&#8217;s best interests and emotional well-being.</span></p>

S used the DNA test to delay H&#8217;s involvement in M&#8217;s life.

Indeed he went out of his way to provide her with a role and a place in M&#8217;s life. Despite being disparaged by S and having allegations made about his conduct and financial probity he continued to offer contact at much greater frequency than the guardian recommended when he could so easily have adopted the Guardian&#8217;s regime.</span></p>

There was no other reason for S to lend H and B money (they were better off than she was) and the timing of the transaction coincided with the house rental. H&#8216;s evidence that he was quite desperate to have a child and his anguish was described in the emails he sent. H wanted to have a family with B; there is nothing in his words or actions at the time the agreement was broached or later that even obliquely indicates that he wanted to either act as a &#8220;sperm donor&#8221; or have a child to bring up in conjunction with S.

M&#8217;s GP records confirmed that there had been a telephone consultation and reported temperature of 38.7C. On the 18 November 2014 no overnight contact took place.  S had again taken M to hospital where she was admitted with a possible viral fever; the records report that M was eating and drinking well, crawling, very active. A small bruise or mark was seen on her right ear lobe which seemed to be part of her illness. M was discharged at 5pm when S took her home. There was nothing on the hospital records of any real concern; nor that contact should not have taken place.</span></p>

Although some weeks after the hearing concluded S changed her position and agreed to M staying over-night with her father and B it is evident that she did so as she accepted that she had to following the decision to refuse her permission to appeal.  Prior to that S had, as I have set out above, used the fact that she continued to breast-feed M as a reason for reducing or limiting contact and claimed that it was in M&#8217;s best interest. It is the current orthodoxy, which the court does not gainsay, that breast feeding, if possible, for the first year or more as it provides many health advantages for a child. In her first statement in April 2014 S said that she wanted to breast-feed for the first 9 months; as time has progressed so the length of time she wishes to breast-feed has increased. In her oral evidence she was unable to say how long it would go on but indicated that it would be as long as M wanted it to which could be as much as several years into the future. </span></p>

The practice is not recommended for babies and small infants as there is a danger of over-lay and as a result may be considered to be more controversial, but that was not a matter that I was asked to decide.  This practice when it takes place cannot be used as a reason to inhibit or curtail a child&#8217;s right to form a positive and substantial relationship with her other parent or parents; which was a direct effect of S&#8217;s practice in this case and she used it as part of her argument to support the curtailment of overnight stays. Based on the needs of a child, as M grows she must be allowed to become independent and grow as a human being separate from her parents and carers.  At her age it is most unlikely that she will not suffer any harm sleeping on her own; indeed she has already experienced it without ill effect when she stayed with her father and his partner overnight.</span></p>

What I could see did not assist her case. The filming itself was provocative; an unnecessary and potentially aggressive act. As it was taken when M was being handed over after contact it could only be designed to show H and B in a poor light and none of the parties appeared to behave very well and in a manner that was in keeping with the need to remain calm and positive for M&#8217;s sake.

I heard the evidence of B&#8217;s mother. She was a co-operative and calm witness; a woman of some poise and sophistication. She made it plain to me that she wanted to take on the role of grandmother and not of a full-time carer. She told me she has two sons who live in London and contemplated moving there in the future, perhaps to live permanently and with their assistance. She was obviously fond of H, referring to him as one of her three sons. From the way she spoke and gave her evidence she clearly adores M, and calls her &#8220;Little Star,&#8221; but she does so as a grandmother. B&#8217;s mother accompanied him to hand M back to her mother so that she could spend as much time with M as possible, and I accept her evidence. I it when she told me about the conduct of S at the handover, not least because it was consistent with her conduct throughout the proceedings. S was aggressive and loudly vocalised her complaints about the situation and the behaviour of H and B, and she tried to involve B&#8217;s mother in the dispute.</span></p>

He said that he had very little hope that her behaviour towards him would change; and that he had found her negative comments about him, about gay relationships and about his relationship with H, in particular, upsetting and hurtful.  Some of the comments and allegations made to the guardian were vituperative; S said that B was a misogynist and that she feared he would be violent to her; that he dressed in such a manner that his pubic hair was visible.

The latter requires that M is afforded the scope to grow up in an environment where conflict is at a minimum. M is not yet able to say as she is just learning to talk so I do not know her expressed wishes and feelings but I assume it that for the immediate future she would want to continue to remain with S and continue to spend time with and H and B, including overnight stays. </span></p>

There is a potential for enmeshment and stifling attachment rather than a healthy outward looking approach to the child&#8217;s life.

I have little doubt that the breast-feeding was used a device to frustrate contact during the proceedings, a conclusion supported by S claiming at first that she could not express her milk which so reduced the time available for contact; subsequently when it was clear that M could be fed and was able to eat other foods S no longer had difficulty expressing milk.

Moreover it is intended that a regime of supervised contact should not continue for long but that once M is settled and living with the Applicants the parties will be able to reach their own agreement and arrangements over contact which was always the intention of H and B and so that M can spend time with S in a relaxed environment including in S&#8217;s home.</span></p>

It should not be so frequent as to lead to any confusion in the child&#8217;s mind about where and with whom she lives and who are her main carers; nor should it be so infrequent as to lead to distress or anxiety. M is very young and will settle quickly; the role of S will be more peripheral than it has been in the past and its importance and frequency for M will be dependant on its quality; the purpose of time spent with S is to assist M&#8217;s security, sense of identity and to enhance a settled existence for her. There will be an order setting out the time M is to spend with S (s11C (1) (iii) CA) and it would be prudent to have a Monitoring Order pursuant to s 11H.</span></p>

The nature and duration of these proceedings on the Applicant fathers must have been very stressful and was certainly very costly. They have undoubtedly been subjected to the strain and provocation as a result of S&#8217;s course of behaviour over the currency of the proceedings including her informing H&#8217; family in Romania of his sexual orientation and of his relationship with B; S repeated disparagement and allegations about the nature of the relationship between H and B caused personal distress to both men; and her antipathy towards B which caused practical difficulties in contact arrangements. </span></p>
