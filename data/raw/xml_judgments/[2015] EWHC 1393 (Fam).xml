The Respondent is her former husband, Mr D.  The final dissolution of their marriage has not yet been confirmed by Decree absolute but it is common ground that their marriage came to an end in 2012 when he moved out of the main family home into a separate cottage within the grounds.  I propose to refer to the parties in this judgment as &#8216;husband&#8217; (H) and &#8216;wife&#8217; (W).  I intend no disrespect to either in so doing.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">This was a long marriage which endured for the best part of 20 years.  The parties married at the beginning of January 1995 having by then lived together for some two years.  It was a second marriage for H and a third marriage for W.  By then, he had two children from his first marriage, a son and a daughter, who are now respectively 44 and 43 years old.  H has dual citizenship.  Both are now UK tax resident but non-domiciled.  H is now 71 years old and, on his case, nearing the end of his productive working life with retirement beckoning.  W is almost 11 years younger.  She will celebrate her 60</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">th</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> birthday in a few days&#8217; time.  </span></p>

The eldest child is currently studying at university and thereafter will spend a further five years studying post-qualification.  The second oldest child is in his final year at school. From September 2015, he hopes to attend university.  The youngest child is a  pupil at boarding school and is studying for her GCSEs.  Her current plan is to read history at Oxford or Cambridge with a view to a law conversion course thereafter.  Everything which I have heard and read about these children persuades me that they are bright, intellectually accomplished young people who have a shining future ahead; they are a credit to each of their parents.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">W issued her petition seeking dissolution of the marriage on 19 September 2012.  Decree nisi was pronounced in January 2013.  The financial proceedings were transferred to the High Court to be heard by a Judge of the Family Division by order of District Judge Malik at the First Appointment in January 2013.  On 12 March 2014, Parker J dealt with a Financial Dispute Resolution appointment which did not result in settlement.  As part of a raft of directions made on that date, she listed the matter for a final hearing with a time estimate of 7 days.  For reasons to which I shall come, W was ordered to pay H&#8217;s costs of that hearing, such order not to be enforced until the conclusion of the proceedings with which I have been dealing.  Open offers were exchanged, albeit that W&#8217;s response to H&#8217;s proposal took almost 8 months to materialise.  Final directions were made by me at a pre-trial review in January this year.  Thus it was that on Tuesday of last week, 3 March 2015, I commenced hearing this case.</span></p>

Mr Robert Peel QC appeared for H.  His instructions come from Radcliffes Le Brasseur.  I should say at the outset that I am grateful to all three counsel in this case for the care which has so obviously been taken in the detailed preparation of their written and oral submissions.  They have assisted me enormously in my analysis of the evidence and in the conclusions which I have reached on the basis of that evidence.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Throughout the currency of this litigation, there has been an ongoing dialogue between the parties&#8217; respective solicitors in relation to financial disclosure.  Both parties made their initial presentations in Forms E in January 2013.  Since then, H has responded to three lengthy questionnaires served by W.  Her current solicitors, Withers LLP, were instructed at the end of October 2014.   They inherited a case where a significant quantity of documents had already been disclosed.  From the foot of that disclosure, they compiled W&#8217;s third questionnaire and, in January this year, took out an application in the Royal Court in Jersey for the production of bank statements relating to various corporate entities owned by a Jersey Trust which H had set up in June 2004, some nine years into the marriage.  The detailed open offer which flowed from their recent instruction by W at the end of November last year was stated to be subject to a specific caveat in relation to </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">&#8216;some significant outstanding disclosure issues which need to be resolved before a full and final agreement can be concluded&#8217; </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Garamond">[2/D9]</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.  </span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">On 18 February 2015, less than two weeks before the start of this hearing, the parties exchanged section 25 statements in which each set out in some detail their final positions.  H complains that this was the first time he had been presented with a clear formulation of W&#8217;s case in relation to his alleged non-disclosure.    Mr Peel has described it on his behalf as a straightforward &#8216;ambush&#8217;.  Because the exchange of narrative statements was simultaneous rather than sequential, he did not have the opportunity to respond in any detail to that case.  However, in the time available, he was able to obtain statements from various third parties whom W alleged were, or might be, involved in holding assets on his behalf or otherwise assisting him to obscure the true state of his finances from the gaze of the court.  I gave leave for those statements to be admitted in evidence.  Mr Dyer did not wish to cross-examine any of those witnesses save for one, Peter Tanfield, a long standing business associate of H&#8217;s.  He, it appears, was travelling in Africa and was not responding to emails or telephone messages which might have enabled us to set up a video link in order to receive his evidence.   </span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Thus, by the time we reached the final day of evidence, the only witnesses from whom I had heard were W, H and their accountant, Mr Adam Collins.  I also had the benefit of reading the contents of three bundles of documents, including the detailed narrative statements relied upon by each of the parties.  Within the bundles I had two reports prepared by the single joint expert, Mr Paul Smethurst.  He had been instructed by the parties to value the business and trust assets.  His figures have been accepted and incorporated into a very helpful schedule of assets which is by and large agreed as a reconciliation of the wealth available to these parties.  Excluding the value of some future run-offs from a number of commercial mandates (to which I shall come) and the issue of whether or not H has now revealed the full extent of his assets, there is just over &#163;5.5 million which falls for division in this case.</span></p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.25in">9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Aside from some minor issues of computation, there is broad agreement between the parties as to how the assets should be divided in terms of the value to be delivered to each at the end of this marriage.  The spectre which hovers still over these proceedings is W&#8217;s suspicion (if not actual belief) that H has yet to make full and final disclosure of the means at his disposal.  These suspicions are based upon a number of unexplained transactions which are underpinned to a significant extent by the opportunities which she says are available to him to disguise transactions or &#8216;park&#8217; funds with his business associates.  In these circumstances, much of the oral evidence and cross-examination which I heard over a number of days was devoted to H&#8217;s response to her non-disclosure case.  I shall need to make detailed findings about his evidence in due course.  As to where it takes the case, Mr Dyer accepts that he cannot point to the existence of any specific funds or assets but invites me to reflect any adverse findings of fact which I might make by awarding W a 75% interest in the net proceeds which will be generated from a forthcoming sale of the former matrimonial home.  That additional uplift, over and above her joint legal and beneficial interest in the property, represents a sum of just under &#163;522,000.  That figure (or the formulation of the departure from equality which he was seeking on behalf of his client) did not emerge until closing submissions but it is said to represent, on the case advanced by W, a fair reflection of outcome.  Whether that figure can properly be said to reflect a 50% share of what is likely to remain hidden is something to which I shall come in due course once I have reviewed the evidence.  In his final submissions to me, Mr Dyer quite properly accepted that he was not in a position to quantify the extent of the so-called &#8216;hidden&#8217; assets in this case.  The uplift of 25% over and above what would otherwise be W&#8217;s entitlement from the sale of the family home was, in the circumstances, a fair reflection of any conclusion which the court might reach if I were to find that H had lied in his repeated denials that everything was now &#8216;on the table&#8217; in terms of his financial disclosure obligations.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">The company is incorporated in Jersey and is involved in the recovery of distressed debts on a worldwide basis (mainly in third world countries) on behalf of international banks and insurance underwriters.  H&#8217;s income is derived from &#8216;success fees&#8217;, or commission payments, which are generated when debts are recovered (or partially recovered) pursuant to contracts which have been referred to in these proceedings as &#8216;mandates&#8217;.  The commission rate is usually between 12.5% and 15% and each mandate is a bespoke contract tailored to the needs of a specific client, the identity of the debtor and the risk involved in pursuing recovery in whichever third world jurisdiction is involved.  In terms of time scale, some mandates can take up to ten years to produce any return; others will be abandoned if the prospects of recovery are viewed as negligible or if the creditor client decides to write off the debt.  In addition, from time to time, H carries out contractual obligations for clients on an ad hoc basis for which, in respect of a particular project or piece of work, he is paid on an hourly basis for his time.  One of the documents which has been produced during the course of this hearing was a detailed schedule of active (or recently active) mandates currently held or operated by Maple.  In relation to each of 62 such mandates, H has provided a commentary as to status.  Some 42 remain active in one way or another.  From this commentary and the evidence which he gave during the course of the hearing, it is possible to build up a fairly clear picture as to the nature of the debt recovery business and the geographical and political aspects which operate in each case, or category of cases, to limit the prospects of recovery.  As H confirmed, his business is seen very much as &#8216;a remedy of last resort&#8217; by some of the major banking and insurance institutions in the world.  It is only when litigation has failed (or, at least, the conventional routes of enforcement of any judgment debts secured through local courts) that he will step in to assist in the recovery process.  Often, that process is unproductive either because his clients are unwilling to &#8216;throw further good money after bad&#8217; or because the debtors are insolvent and without any assets to pay.  H&#8217;s modus operandi, as he explained it, was to travel to the debtor&#8217;s country (and I heard about operations in places such as North Korea, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Senegal, the Ivory Coast and Uzbekistan), befriend the debtor, find out what the issues may be and thereafter to attempt to negotiate an instalment or other programme for payment of at least part of the debt.  It is a business which depends upon personal connections.  As H told me, it can be a lengthy and sensitive process and there is no guarantee of a successful outcome at the end of the day.  Sometimes recovery of the debt may involve finding an &#8216;angel investor&#8217; to shore up an ailing company through an investment of funds so that there is some cash flow from which the debts can be paid.</span></p>

Mr Burne is based in Alabama in the United States and he is responsible for debt collection in North and South America.  There is no formal arrangement or partnership deed in existence; rather their relationship is based upon a long-standing friendship and mutual trust.  H told me that theirs is a very close working relationship and they speak by telephone on an almost daily basis.  Sadly, it appears that Mr Burne&#8217;s wife is very unwell at the present time and that may or may not impact upon decisions which will need to be taken shortly in terms of the future direction of the Maple business.  As matters currently stand, they share fees derived from the mandates on a 50/50 basis regardless of which of them actually works on a particular contract.  Mr Burne is some 15 years younger than H and the point is made on behalf of W by Mr Dyer and Miss Chapman that his income stream is unlikely to cease on retirement from the business.  Not only will he continue to have the benefit of the existing mandate run-offs, he will also earn his 50% of future commissions recovered by Mr Burne.  That appears to have been the arrangement or understanding between them when Mr Burne joined the business without being required to inject any equity participation.  I shall need to return to the issue of the financial consequences of H&#8217;s retirement in due course.  For present purposes, I propose to deal with the business structure and its inter-relationship with the trust.</span></p>

This is known as the Regency Partnership (&#8216;Regency&#8217; or &#8216;the Partnership&#8217;).  It is an onshore entity whose function is to provide administrative services for Maple.  Fees (usually 7.5%) are collected on debts recovered.  Thus, it is the means or vehicle by which the parties are able to bring income into the United Kingdom in order to meet their general and other living expenses.  In addition, it does work on an ad hoc basis for a French road building company called Mullerat.</span></p>

It is agreed that the Trust will be collapsed in a tax efficient manner and the parties will share the funds thereby released on a 50/50 basis.  The mechanism for collapsing the Trust is likely to be the creation of two separate sub-Funds which will be allocated to each of H and W who will thereafter appoint their own trustees.  The tax implications have yet to be worked through but it is agreed that these and any other costs will be top-sliced in advance of any division of the net funds.  W raises no objection to the preservation of the corporate &#8216;wrappers&#8217; which are currently owned by the Trust.

The single joint expert quite properly took the view that, because of the uncertainty surrounding recovery, he could not factor into the underlying net asset value of Maple any uplift in relation to these sums.  Nevertheless, the potential figures involved are not insubstantial.  H has estimated the net fees payable to him after deducting expenses, including Mr Burne&#8217;s share, to be just under &#163;14 million if he were to recover 100% of the &#8216;face value&#8217; of the mandated debts.  However, on the basis of the current status reports he has provided, he expects to recover no more than a total of &#163;1.43 million over the next 10 years. From that notional sum has to be deducted the administrative costs of the recovery which may account for some 50% of the income.  As Mr Peel points out, this nets down to c. &#163;700,000 on which he will pay tax.  At </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Garamond">[2/D393-394]</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">, I was provided with a summary of the net profit which H has earned from Regency  and Maple in the last six years.  The pre-tax profits over that period show total income of &#163;710,164 for the Partnership and &#163;651,822 for Maple, a combined average of just over &#163;220,000 per annum.  Thus, says Mr Peel, H&#8217;s estimate of his net receipts from the mandate run-offs once an allowance has been made for tax is not far short of the annual income which the accounts show him to have been earning in the last years of the marriage.</span></p>

It is a substantial property set in 16 acres.  There is a cottage and a barn within the curtilage of the property.  Since their separation some two and a half years ago, W has been occupying the main house and H has been living in the cottage.  He runs his &#8216;office&#8217; from the barn where he is assisted by an administrator and some part-time staff.  The property was originally on the market for &#163;3.5 million.  It is now being offered for sale by two local agents at &#163;2.75 million.  The property is not subject to a mortgage although there are three business loans which will need to be repaid from the proceeds of sale. The agreed equity if a sale at this price can be achieved is &#163;2.086 million.  In principle, the parties had agreed to share these sale proceeds equally.  W&#8217;s case, as it is now advanced by Mr Dyer on her behalf, is that she should receive 75% with the balance being paid to H.

The loan secured on the property will need to be repaid to Ada Limited which will, in turn, remit the funds to the Trust.  At present, the balance owing (some &#8364;1,159,455) appears to be greater than the value of the property.  The advice which the parties have received is that any balance over and above the current value may be written off in some fiscally efficient manner once they have taken tax advice.  They have also been advised that this loan needs to be repaid using funds external to the Trust itself.  It may well be that these will come from the proceeds of sale of the English family home in due course.  Any costs of transfer (as yet unascertained) will be shared equally and, in terms of the account between them, W will make a balancing payment to H of just under &#163;400,000.  How this will all work in practice remains to be seen since W wishes to retain the French property as part of her settlement.  She told me that she has not yet decided where in this country she would wish to make her home once The Manor Farm has been sold.  She may move to live in the French property as some form of &#8216;stop gap&#8217; arrangement whilst she reflects on what she wishes to do.  If her finances permit, she may decide to buy in England and keep the French property as a holiday rental investment.  H does not object in principle to the transfer of the property into her sole name but he says through Mr Peel that it has consequences upon her future domestic economy in terms of the costs of maintaining two homes with a finite income stream flowing from the rental yield.  Insofar as it impacts upon W&#8217;s future needs case, I shall come back to this at a later stage in my judgment.</span></p>

Whilst Olivia&#8217;s plans are now fairly advanced in terms of the next six or seven years, the two younger children are still at school and their future is less predictable.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">In his opening note, Mr Peel sought to make much of the way in which some of the specific allegations against H had only emerged vey recently in her section 25 statement.   He pointed to the volumes of disclosure which H had made to date as these proceedings have taken their course over a period of more than two and a half years.  He reminded me that, as an equal partner in Regency, she had enjoyed full and unrestricted access to all and any information and documents which she required.  It did not appear to be in dispute that W had indeed accessed a substantial quantity of documents and emails going back several years in her attempts to understand some of the business transactions.  The relationship between the parties has obviously become increasingly strained over the course of this litigation and there is quite clearly an atmosphere of restrained antipathy and mistrust between them.  It cannot have helped that they have been required to live in fairly close proximity to one another during a difficult period of marital breakdown.  W accuses H of having at least one affair towards the end of their marriage (which he denies).  She described to me occasions since their separation when he had been over-bearing and had made threats both in relation to her personal security and in terms of his unwillingness to provide her with transparency in relation to the family finances.  She accused him of restricting the information he provided to a &#8216;need to know&#8217; basis.  All of these factors appear to have laid the foundation in her mind for the subsequent allegations of non-disclosure.  She has since trawled through what I suspect are hundreds (if not thousands) of documents in an attempt to understand the accounting procedures deployed by H in relation to the funds flowing in from the individual mandates.  Where the various paper trails have ended without satisfactory explanation, she has deduced that he must have been withholding information about funds received &#8216;under the radar&#8217; and &#8216;parked&#8217; with friends or third parties.</span></p>

These sums, she contends, were never passed through the books of either Maple or the Partnership and are therefore not reflected in the formal accounts of either entity.  Whilst she has been unable to point to any undisclosed bank account or other solid evidence of non-disclosure, through Mr Dyer she nevertheless invites me to proceed on the basis that there is a sound evidential platform to be gleaned from extraneous evidence to support her suspicions.  She says that these payments are innately untraceable and are likely to be held for H by his close associates and/or business colleagues.  She says that the parts of the world in which he operates and the cash basis which underpins many of the transactions which he undertakes provide him with substantial opportunities to conceal dealings of this nature.</span></p>

He has been interrogated robustly through a series of three written questionnaires, most recently in January this year when W&#8217;s current solicitors undertook a thorough review of the papers and his disclosure to date.  He points to the fact that he has co-operated fully with Mr Smethurst, the single joint expert, and has provided whatever information has been requested of him.  He points to the open access which W has had to all and any documents she has needed, including (now) a full run of the business bank accounts held by Summit in Jersey.  Mr Collins, their business accountant, has made himself available to answer all and any enquiries which W might have.  He is someone who is intimately involved in the Partnership business and who, with his team, is responsible for preparing the accounts each year.  It was he whom the parties entrusted some years ago to fly to Jersey to review the systems put in place by the Trustees for the provision of information and figures to the parties.  I was told that, as a result of his input, those systems were changed and upgraded.</span></p>

These relate to the payment on two separate occasions of his grandchildren&#8217;s school fees in 2010 and 2011.  On both occasions, the fees were paid directly to the school using a route which did not involve the remittance into the jurisdiction of funds directly traceable to H.  As H himself now admits, the purpose of these particular transactions was to avoid paying the tax on those remittances.  He accepts that it was wrong to have handled matters in this way and admits that he is embarrassed by the exposure which the spotlight of this litigation has brought about.  Nevertheless, he asks me to accept that W was fully aware of, and agreed to, the payments being made even if she may have been unaware of the manner in which the fees reached the school bursars.  He points to the fact that every penny of what he has earned during the marriage has been spent for the benefit of his family in one form or another.</span></p>

On that occasion, there was an exchange between leading counsel (W then being represented by a different team) which involved the production of a number of documents which W had extracted from H&#8217;s office.  I am told that, as a result, the negotiations effectively stalled whilst H, through Mr Peel, sought to deal with W&#8217;s questions throughout the remainder of the day.  This led Parker J to order W to pay the costs of that hearing but on the basis that (a) they were not to be enforced until the conclusion of the final hearing, and (b) her time for appealing that costs order would run from that date.</span></p>

In that event, she was asked to particularise each and every aspect of her case and to identify any documents on which she sought to rely in support.  There was no response to that letter.  By November 2014, W&#8217;s new team was on board and requesting copies of the Trust bank statements which, to date, the Trustees had declined to provide.  (H had never resisted disclosure of these documents but the Trustees had been unwilling to provide disclosure over and beyond the formal accounts.)  As I have recorded earlier in this judgment, those bank statements have now been provided, albeit in two separate tranches.  The final tranche was delivered after the hearing had commenced.  At no point in the trial was I taken to any of the statements which took up two large boxes.  Mr Dyer confirmed, on W&#8217;s behalf, that he was not seeking to reopen any cross-examination of H on the basis of the second tranche of disclosure of those statements.   That is hardly surprising given that his case in relation to the allegations of non-disclosure is that the monies diverted by H were never passed through any of the business or Trust bank accounts and are not reflected in the formal accounts which are informed by the bank statements held by Summit.</span></p>

She accepts that she is unable to point to evidence of an undisclosed account (whether or not in H&#8217;s name) which is the repository for funds siphoned off from the mandates by way of a side agreement or undercover cash payment, nor can she point to the existence of an asset which represents the product of such funds.  The volume of material placed before me and the schedule of disclosure which H has made in these proceedings militates against any suggestion that he has ignored his obligations to provide disclosure, whether pursuant to a court order or on a voluntary basis.  As to lifestyle, whilst these parties are separated in terms of any continued marital relationship, they have continued to operate a joint financial base as partners in the business.  As such, W has had, as she accepts, unrestricted access to such documents as she has wished to see.  H is currently living in the cottage next to the main family home.  The children have been coming and going between those homes.  She knows when he takes them away on holidays and he has provided information about the cost of those trips.  Each continues to provide financial support for the children.  In this sense, she has been a first-hand observer of H&#8217;s lifestyle in the period which has elapsed since their separation and she does not seek to advance her case on the basis of lifestyle choices which are inconsistent with his declared income.  His income on the face of the documents which I have seen (which is effectively their joint income from the Partnership and from the Maple mandates) does not appear to have changed significantly over the last six years, including the last two years of their separation.</span></p>

It features in more than one of W&#8217;s allegations of non-disclosure against H.  He had entered into a mandate with a bank (bank D) (which was subsequently taken over by HSBC) to recover from Natal Mines a debt of just over US$1 million.  Having secured the mandate, he entered into a Services Agreement with MVP for local assistance &#8216;on the ground&#8217;   which was likely to include obtaining a formal judgment against Natal Mines.

That sets out the terms of the joint venture in relation to the recovery of the Bank&#8217;s debt.  Article 5 deals with the distribution of any funds recovered and the proportion in which they were to be shared between MVP and Regency Ltd.  It provides that the first US$500,000 recovered would go to Regency  Ltd with any surplus over and above that sum being paid to MVP.  Art 5.3 contains a specific reference to the possibility of &#8216;further recoveries&#8217;, being the recovery of costs and interest.  In this event, any sums recovered in respect of costs expended would be paid to the party which had incurred such costs whilst interest recovered would be paid to MVP.</span></p>

He asked H merely to recover what he could at minimum cost to the Bank.  Following a further conversation, the Bank told H that they would accept a payment of US$250,000 in full and final settlement of the Natal Mines debt (then US$1,009,924).  There was an agreement between H and HSBC that in the event of recovering US$500,000, the Bank would receive 50% (i.e. US$250,000) and Regency Ltd would retain the balance</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="4">

That litigation had been ongoing for some considerable time and H had no active involvement in the proceedings or the ultimate recovery.  However, when he discovered the extent of Mr Bernard&#8217;s recovery, he went back to seek an uplift in Regency Ltd&#8217;s share of the recovery proceeds.  He told me that Mr Bernard was a difficult individual with whom to negotiate and he had no legitimate expectations of any further recovery.  Nevertheless, Mr Bernard appeared to be willing to consider an additional payment from the total funds recovered.  Having looked at the total profit recovered by MVP once allowance had been made for the costs of recovery (for example, the heavy litigation costs), he told H that he was prepared to make an additional payment to Regency Ltd in the sum of US$87,000.

He told me that he had been aware of the plan to pay the grandchildren&#8217;s school fees in advance although he had no direct knowledge about when the payments were actually made.  He had spoken to H in general terms about the tax implications and had warned him that, if funds were remitted into the jurisdiction from Jersey, they would be taxable as a remittance.  However, if the funds were paid directly to the grandchildren or to third parties on their behalves, the remittances would be treated as the children&#8217;s money, rather than H&#8217;s, and taxed accordingly on a lower basis.  Whilst the children would be liable for the tax as beneficiaries of the payments, there was likely to be material benefit in terms of the tax which would be saved when an assessment was eventually made by HMRC.</span></p>

He accepts that these funds did not pass through Regency Limited&#8217;s bank account and that the receipt of these funds is not reflected in the annual accounts for that period.  In order to &#8216;square the books&#8217;, H had caused an invoice to be issued and delivered to MVP in the sum of &#163;55,204.06 </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Garamond">[1/C245]</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.

As to why the invoice rendered on behalf of Regency Limited pre-dates the run of emails, I do not know (and H could not explain) unless it was backdated to fall into the company&#8217;s year end (which is 30 April).  H accepted that Mr Dyer was perfectly entitled to characterise the invoice as a &#8216;sham&#8217; or &#8216;dummy&#8217; invoice.  He openly admitted that he had never expected to be standing in court answering questions about this particular transaction when he took what he believed to be a tax efficient means to divert the MVP payment to discharge his promise to his son to pay Emma&#8217;s school fees.

It predates the first in terms of the chronology of H&#8217;s participation with Mr Bernard and MVP. H&#8217;s evidence was that this particular mandate started in 2001/2002. Bank P was the lead creditor amongst a number of institutions which were owed money by Natal Mines.  In the absence of securing any recovery, the Bank finally made a claim against its reinsurance policy with the underwriters who paid out a total of US$18 million.  H told me that he visited Africa on a number of occasions without making any progress in terms of recovery.  By that stage, it seemed that the Banks would have accepted a return of between 25% and 30% of the loans but nothing had been secured.  In the course of his work on this mandate, H was able to discover that part of the Bank D debt was secured against one of the mines owned by Natal Mines.  Contrary to the terms of that security, Natal Mines (the debtor) had sold to a BVI third party its mining and exploration rights in that mine thereby defeating the Banks&#8217; security.  H recounted to me during the course of his evidence some of the physical and other challenges which had confronted him as he sought to pursue the debt on behalf of the lead Bank.

Mr Bernard is not involved in the business of debt recovery on the same scale as H; his principal business is the sale of electrical equipment throughout Africa. He also deals in the supply of mining equipment.  However, as a result of that encounter, Mr Bernard told H that he would look into the situation and report back if he felt he could assist in H&#8217;s attempts at recovery on behalf of the banks.  A subsequent meeting was set up between the two men and Bank P.  The result was the Service Agreement which was entered into between Regency Limited and MVP on 15 June 2007 </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Garamond">[1/C262]</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.  This refers to discussions over a collaboration to recover a debt of US$50 million on behalf of various banks. Article 5 of that Agreement provided that, whilst Regency Limited would receive the first US$300,000 of any recovery, any further sums recovered up to US$18 million would be shared between Regency and MVP as to 60% to Regency  and 40% to MVP.  Anything between US$18 million and US$35 million would be shared on a 50/50 basis.

H told me that an Israeli company which had local interests in the area had created a situation in which hundreds of local artisanal miners had been released onto mine dumps as a result of which the assets were being looted and stolen.  Mr Bernard had secured the mine dump, erected security fences around the perimeter and employed a security firm to patrol the mine daily on a 24 hour per day basis.  This had involved a very substantial financial investment on his part but it was one which had persuaded the banks that he was serious about making attempts to recover their outstanding debt.   Over a significant period of time, he took further steps (including legal action) which resulted in a full recovery of the debt which the banks had, by then, all but written off.</span></p>

Since she was aware of his involvement on behalf of several banks in recovery actions against Natal Mines, she asked him whether he had signed a Service Agreement with Mr Bernard and/or MVP in relation to recovery from X LTD.  She says she was particularly interested in this contract since he had mentioned it previously to her in conversation and said he hoped it might produce a sum of c. &#163;1 million in success fees.  Without, it seems, any particular anchor to this potential contract, she recalls a conversation which she had with Lisa Brockley at Summit during the course of which Miss Brockley is alleged to have said to W that she hoped </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">&#8216;[W] would find all the money&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.

When he was asked by Mr Peel for further details during the course of his oral evidence, he told me that in relation to his own enquiries about debt recovery which was the subject of his conversation with W, he had known that there was a contract between German and Australian parties.  Mr Fortin, the managing director of Natal Mines, had told him there was a substantial debt outstanding but would not give him any further details which might have enabled him to &#8216;bid&#8217; for the mandate.  He had asked around but even Mr Bernard had been unable to assist him to identify the parties which would have been the first step towards securing a formal mandate.  He reconfirmed what he had said in his written evidence:  to this day he does not know the identity of the parties to the loan, and the X LTD mandate to which W has referred never existed in terms of a formal instruction to Maple or the Partnership.</span></p>

There is nothing in either the email or the attachment to it which is fundamentally inconsistent with H&#8217;s case.

He told me that he had a mandate with the company which is referred to in the invoice (&#8216;Garrick&#8217;) and had made one recovery of a fairly substantial sum which had been payable over a period of time.  As a result of some machinations between the French government and Garrick against the background of elections which were ongoing at the time on the Ivory Coast, there was a further agreement for the supply of equipment notwithstanding the debt which was then due to Garrick.  As a result, H&#8217;s contract was cancelled.  As Maple had by then only been paid a single tranche of its recovery fee, H was obliged to write off the balance of the debt.  There was at that point in time a book debt in respect of a sum which was owed to Mr Tanfield for work which he had done in relation to this contract as H&#8217;s local associate &#8216;on the ground&#8217;.  All he had done up to that point in time was to effect the initial introduction between H and K Henry.  There was subsequently an agreement that no fee would be payable for that introduction.  Whilst he had no direct input into drafting the invoice, H accepts that he used this &#8216;book entry&#8217; in respect of Mr Tanfield&#8217;s fee to create a contra entry in a sum equivalent to the school fees he was due to pay for Rachel in order to &#8216;square the books&#8217;.  He accepts full responsibility for this tax avoidance scheme (for that is what it was) which he says was never explained to Mr Tanfield.  All Mr Tanfield knew was that H was going to send him some money which he, in turn, would pay to the school on H&#8217;s behalf.  In cross-examination, he accepted that he might well have asked Mr Tanfield to send the invoice so that the accounts could be reconciled.  H accepts he was wrong and repeats his acute sense of embarrassment at having acted in the manner he did.  He accepts without qualification that the invoice was based upon a debt which had been waived.  He has since made a clean breast of these matters with the Trustees through a self-report to Lisa Brockley.</span></p>

He rejected the suggestion made to him by Mr Dyer in cross-examination that the court could not place any reliance on the figures shown in the company accounts because of &#8216;under the radar&#8217; dealings.  He said that W&#8217;s exhaustive search through voluminous bank statements and accounts going back 15 or 20 years had shown exactly how he dealt with the business and that all he had earned over the course of those years had been for the benefit of his family.  He had given his own children the benefit of a private education and felt very strongly about providing that benefit for his two grandchildren.  It was a priority about which W was very well aware and it was unfair for her to seek to hang on the peg of his payment of the school fees an allegation that either there were undisclosed funds available to him or that his dealings with the business were thoroughly contaminated by these two transactions.</span></p>

H accepts that there is a significant element of cash involved in his transactions with his business associate.  He was taken by Mr Dyer to a spreadsheet which had been prepared by the staff in the Partnership&#8217;s offices.  It is called </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">&#8216;Reconciliation of Amounts on Euro Account&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> and covers the period from May to December 2009 </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Garamond">[1/C320]</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.    One of the entries on that spreadsheet refers to the payment to Mr Tanfield of &#8364;25,000 at Heathrow airport.  H confirmed that this was a cash sum paid in 2009 and reflected one of several such payments.  These payments represented sums due to Mullerat (the French road building company for whom Mr Tanfield acted as a consultant) with whom the Partnership did a significant amount of work.  They were used by Mr Tanfield to make payments to sub-contractors and others working locally (where Mr Tanfield is based) or elsewhere in Africa.  Cash payments were an integral part of their business arrangements because 90% of the people with whom Mr Tanfield deals do not operate bank accounts.  Whilst the level of cash transactions has decreased in recent years, it remains a necessary element of fulfilling the mandate contracts.  H told me that this was the primary purpose of the HSBC Euro account with HSBC (which he refers to as &#8216;the Trust account&#8217;).  It was why the reconciliation spreadsheets were produced on a regular and &#8216;running&#8217; basis.  Once a particular project or piece of work had been concluded and all receipts and expenses had been reconciled, the fee due to Regency would be transferred from the Euro Trust account and paid to the Regency account.  Such payments were then reflected in the Partnership accounts as income.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">In terms of H&#8217;s input on behalf of the Partnership, H was to explain during the course of his oral evidence that, during the course of Mullerat&#8217;s road-building projects, the specification will often change from that agreed in the underlying contract.  Extras were continually cropping up as routes changed or engineering work had to be carried out.  Before payments were authorised by Mullerat, engineers had to be called in to &#8216;sign off&#8217; on these additional works.  It was H&#8217;s job to find the engineers who were then referred to Mr Tanfield who was effectively &#8216;project managing&#8217; locally in Africa.  All the work &#8216;on the ground&#8217; was carried out by Mr Tanfield and H had little input on behalf of the Partnership.  Once the amount of any individual contract had crystallised, H would invoice Mullerat.  From the sums received, he would pay Mr Tanfield and the people working under him.  Much of the cash paid to Mr Tanfield was used by him to pay the local engineers which was why the sums were often significant.  They were, in effect, part of the wages bill for the projects and contracts which were carried out locally in various parts of Africa.  Within the bundles, I was provided with a complete run of spreadsheets for the three year period May 2009 to May 2012.  These appear to demonstrate an accounting procedure which is entirely consistent with the explanation which H gave me.</span></p>

He confirmed the system by which Regency/the Partnership invoiced a significant amount of the work undertaken by Mullerat in Africa and acted more or less in the capacity of Mullerat&#8217;s agent.  Monies received were held in the Euro account (which he described as the equivalent to a solicitor&#8217;s client account) on behalf of Mullerat and, from these funds, payments were made as disbursements to various third parties as Mullerat&#8217;s agent.  He told me that the figures which appeared in the Partnership accounts represented Regency&#8217;s share of fee income net of sums paid out on behalf of Mullerat.  The figures were checked and reconciled and Mr Collins was confident that they were accurate.  He had spoken to W about the accounts and made a point of going through the figures with her on an annual basis before the accounts were signed off in order to ensure that she was happy with both the accounts and the operation of the Partnership during that year.

His understanding was that the presentation of the financial information in the Maple accounts was the result of H&#8217;s and W&#8217;s collective wish to see the figures in that format so that they were able to have a much clearer understanding of the information being accounted for within the Jersey companies.  This had been the purpose of his visit to Jersey on their instructions in 2008.  He had made a further visit to the Trustees&#8217; offices in July 2009, and carried on with overseeing the restructuring of the administrative procedures throughout most of 2010.  In this way, he was able to reassure H and W that the reports and information they were getting from the Jersey Trustees were adequate, accurate and sufficient to provide them with all the information which they wanted in terms of running the business effectively.</span></p>

That work was described in the invoice as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">&#8216;work undertaken by a number of lawyers and experts working on all the international debts of the country as per the attached summary&#8217; </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Garamond">[1/C334]</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.  The invoice was issued through Regency Ltd (the BVI company owned by the Trust).  (In fact two invoices were produced in very slightly different amounts.  I accept that the second was issued to correct a typographical error which had arisen in relation to the calculation of the conversion of the debt from French Francs into Euros.)   H had anticipated that Mrs Jacques might reasonably expect to recover a sum of about &#8364;5 million.  No payment having been received, a further invoice was issued in June 2010.  At the same time, it appears that H took advantage of a visit to London by the Prime Minister of Country A to seek his intervention in achieving a resolution and payment of the debt.  When that approach failed, H introduced Mrs Jacques to a well-known London firm of solicitors, Clyde &amp; Co, who were instructed to threaten formal proceedings for the recovery of the debt.  I have seen letters from that firm sent in February and August 2011 to the Prime Minister of Country A.  It seems that a dialogue between those solicitors and the Ministry of Finances was opened following the threat of legal proceedings because, in October 2011, there appears to have been a concession by the Country A government which agreed to make a payment before the end of that month.</span></p>

She alleges that he made a number of business trips to the Ivory Coast during 2011.  On one of those visits, she suspected that he was accompanied by a woman with whom she alleges he was having an affair.  She telephoned the hotel where she knew he was staying and was apparently informed that &#8216;Mr and Mrs D were staying at the hotel. The implication in the statement appears quite clear :  the woman in question was Mrs Jacques.   H confirmed in his oral evidence that he had not had any inappropriate relationship with Mrs Jacques.  When W was asked whether she was alleging that this was the identity of the woman to whom she was referring in her statement, she took a step backwards and told me that this was not so.  I have to say I was somewhat puzzled by this evidence since W bases her allegation on the existence of a side &#8216;deal&#8217; or arrangement between H and Mrs Jacques on the link she makes in her own mind between a heated confrontation which took place with H on his return to the former matrimonial home and the &#8216;renegotiation&#8217; of the terms of his success fee with that lady.

There was very clearly an undercurrent of suspicion and, in some instances, hostility towards H in much of her evidence.  She regards him as a potential point of conflict in terms of her personal dealings with him and, as she told me, this is the main driver for her wish to set up the education fund for the children&#8217;s tertiary schooling.</span></p>

Not only has she had access to the computer files and hard drives, she has now had access to a full run of the bank statements operated by the Jersey Trustees.  She has seen all the mandates.  She accepted that her &#8216;audit through the books&#8217; has informed and focused many of the questions she has raised with H during the course of the proceedings and, in particular, since her new solicitors took over in October 2014.  She believed that there should have been a greater volume of funds flowing through the Maple and Trust accounts.  She was concerned about one particular mandate in respect of which she would have expected to see funds from a &#8364;58 million / &#8364;59 million transaction reflected in the trust bank statements.  The statements relating to that particular period were due to arrive later that day and she told me she would then be in a position to verify what H had said about it.  He was not cross-examined subsequently on this point by reference to the statements and nor did Mr Dyer seek to introduce any of the statements in evidence.  I can only surmise that this line of enquiry was either closed down in W&#8217;s mind by what she read in the statements or that they did not  assist her (or me) one way or the other.</span></p>

Whilst it was suggested to him that he was being evasive in his written answers, I accept as true his explanation to me that he was, indeed, thoroughly embarrassed about the steps he had taken and he was careful in his oral evidence not to implicate Mr Collins in any wrong doing in relation the advice he had received.</span></p>

I am prepared to accept that the ongoing tensions between them over the course of the last two or more years may well have led to confrontations or flash points when H may have used intemperate language in W&#8217;s presence.  I suspect these occasions may well have been the reflection of much frustration on both sides.  W did not believe that she was being shown the whole picture.  As she became more deeply enmeshed in the detail of his working life and practices as a result of her extensive trawl through the papers, her suspicions have only increased.  H, for his part, has been confronted &#8211; in effect &#8211; with the requirement to prove a negative.  As each round of the paper disclosure exercise has produced further enquiries from W&#8217;s team, he has probably felt his back to be up against a brick wall without the means of satisfying W that he had, and has (on his case), put his cards on the table.  I bear in mind that H is now 71 years old and that, on any view, his working life is coming to an end.  Findings of non-disclosure and the possibility of receiving a diminished share of the assets as a direct consequence are, I accept, matters of significant importance to a man whose ability to retrench over future years of income generation is more or less non-existent in terms of anything other than the existing mandate run-off.  At times, he appeared genuinely wearied by the administrative burden which this case has imposed on him and I accept that this is a case where opportunities for further wealth creation in the future are likely to be limited.</span></p>

If and insofar as she may have interpreted what he said as such a threat, I know not but I am prepared to accept what she told me about reporting the matter to the police despite the absence of any evidence to suggest that is what she did.  However, she was operating in an environment of suspicion and mistrust.  H&#8217;s business interests are conducted in some uncomfortable (and even hostile) environments where the standard norms of transparent commercial operation may not always be observed, as even he admits.  She was undoubtedly worried about her own future financial security and that of her children.  I suspect that it was in these circumstances that she took from a conversation with Lisa Brockley the impression that there might well be some difficulty in tracing all the money.  Miss Brockley is a director of Summit Trustees Limited.  As such, she is not only regulated in her dealings by the Jersey Financial Services Commission in her conduct of trust business; she owes the beneficiaries a fiduciary duty to conduct those affairs honestly and transparently.  She has denied making any such statement to W although it is clear that H did not inform the Trustees at the time about the transactions concerning the school fees payments.</span></p>

Had that been the case, there would have been no need for W&#8217;s solicitors to instigate proceedings in Jersey to secure production of the bank statements since H was actively encouraging their disclosure at the relevant time.  Mr Collins&#8217;s evidence was to the effect that these were entirely professional offshore Trustees who had quite properly implemented appropriate administrative changes to their accounting procedures when he had been involved in 2010, 2011 and 2012.  He told me about the extent of the inter-relationship between himself (as the Partnership&#8217;s accountant) and the Trustees.

It comes from Mr John Miller, one of the directors of Summit, and was sent to H on 2 October 2012.  W raised concerns about references in that email to some proposed adjustments in the 2012 accounts for Maple.  There is reference in the email to reductions in a loan made to &#8216;Natalie&#8217;, the office administrator.  I was told that H had lent her a sum of c. &#163;13,000 in relation to a deposit on a property purchase.  That loan was fully documented, and H told me during the course of his oral evidence that Natalie had made various repayments against that loan by paying money to him or to third parties in respect of business or family expenses.  For example, I heard about sums which she paid in Euros on behalf of H and W to a firm of removers which was transporting furniture down to their home in the South of France.  H had an arrangement with Lisa Brockley at Summit that a record would be kept of these informal payments and set offs would be made against Natalie&#8217;s loan. The email from Mr Smith refers to recharging sums of just over &#163;5,000 as expenses for repairs or administration work in the various accounts.  It also makes reference to an existing loan of &#163;150,000.  This, I was told, was separate and distinct from the personal loan to Natalie and related to an inter-company loan recorded in the business accounts. I do not have the full email exchange and cannot see H&#8217;s reply but he told me during the course of his oral evidence that he did not understand these references himself and, given that they related to accounting procedures dating back two and a half years, he would need to ask Lisa Brockley if further clarification was required.  </span></p>

However, these individuals are not related to one another in any way.

W was asked during the course of cross-examination by Mr Peel whether it was part of her case that each of these individuals who had conspired with H were holding money on his behalf knowing that their instructions from H flowed from his desire to defeat her claims.

All their property dealings have been entirely transparent and properties which they have purchased (including their French home) are held in their joint names.  W has had unrestricted access to all their joint financial information.  From her own account to me of their conversations around the kitchen supper table, H would freely share with her information about the business and future opportunities which might be exploited as firm mandates at some point further down the road.  When he set up the offshore Trust in Jersey, he made her an equal beneficiary not simply as his spouse but in her own right.  That structure had been put in place on W&#8217;s own evidence some eight weeks before she even became aware of its existence.  She was fully involved in running the business through the Trust (at least insofar as the provision of information was concerned) as Mr Collins&#8217;s evidence demonstrated. </span></p>

Did the institution of these proceedings by W operate on H&#8217;s mind in such a way that his entire animus towards her changed and the modus operandi, or course of dealings, he had established for the family&#8217;s financial benefit over nearly 20 years became a convenient edifice behind which to obscure the siphoning off of substantial and material sums of money in these proceedings ?  Even that possibility would not begin to explain W&#8217;s case which requires me to find that he has been intent on perpetrating this fraud on her and the court for the last seven or eight years since 2007 (the year in which the US$50 million mandate to which I have referred in paragraphs 67 to 71 above).

Whilst I shall come on to analyse her case as it advanced from the foot of &#8216;needs&#8217; in due course, I do not consider that the &#8216;sound evidential basis&#8217; for drawing the conclusions which W invites me to make as explained by Mostyn J in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">NG v</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"/><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">SG (Appeal: Non-Disclosure) </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">(supra) has been established.  H has on two occasions sought to achieve a tax saving on remittances to a third party or parties (ie. the schools) which he was not entitled to claim.  In so doing, he utilised a mechanism which involved not simply the payment of money at his direction through a third party but the creation of document(s) which regularised the payment in the company/Partnership books.  For that, he is properly the subject of censure.  However I do not find that the evidence before me taken as a whole justifies the quantum leap which W asks me to take into territory which involves an assumption that, because he has been prepared to act in this manner in relation to his grandchildren&#8217;s school fees, he should necessarily be branded a &#8216;non-discloser&#8217; merely because the opportunity to conceal transactions might hypothetically exist in the circumstances in which his business is transacted.  Her suspicions have no doubt been fuelled to an extent by the difficult exercise she has undertaken in trying to fit together pieces of information without the benefit of the narrative explanation which H has provided during this hearing.   Nevertheless, I am prepared to accept as true what he said to me that all of his efforts over the years have been for the benefit of his family.  I could see very clearly the extent of the deep affection he holds for his three children from this marriage.  That is something from which they benefit from each of their parents and I hope and expect that, with these proceedings behind them, the parties - as parents - will feel able to move on into a more settled regime whereby the children come and go freely as young adults between both their parents&#8217; homes.  </span></p>

H&#8217;s own estimate in the event of 100% recovery would make his share worth just under &#163;14 million gross (net of Mr Burne&#8217;s share and expenses).  He has estimated the probable &#8216;net recovery&#8217; to be about &#163;1.53 million.  Whilst this figure ignores any potential interest payable, as Mr Dyer reminds me, I now know considerably more about how these mandates operate in practice and I accept that, whilst that may be correct as a statement of principle, it is unlikely in the future to result in an actual return which is significantly inflated by interest.  As H explained, interest is only recoverable once the entire outstanding principal sum has been recovered and even then probably only in the event of a judgment debt after protracted and expensive litigation.  Whilst I am aware that there have been three occasions in the past where full interest was recovered, this was largely down to the work undertaken by H in days when retirement was a far-off eventuality and he was travelling widely to extract maximum value from each mandate and often over protracted periods of time.</span></p>

It is completely impossible to predict at this stage (a) when recovery might be made, and/or (b) what that recovery will be in terms of the figures.

Nevertheless, it is simply impossible for me to predict with any certainty at this stage what sums he might recover.  The evidence I heard over the course of this hearing has persuaded me that there is the potential for windfall recovery in certain situations and it would be unfair to deprive W of her share of any benefit of that element of future recovery.  Similarly, in seeking to be fair to W in fixing her entitlement now at a sum certain, I might be visiting future unfairness on H should he recover less than he expects.  I have come to the conclusion that, despite the financial nexus between them which such an outcome will inevitably prolong, W should receive her share of the mandate run-off expressed as a percentage of the net recovery in H&#8217;s hands.</span></p>

I now have a much better understanding of the degree of work and involvement which can sometimes be required of H in bringing these contracts to the stage where they mature and pay out.  That is not always the case but it seems to me that a discount of 10% (ie. an uplift of 20% in his favour) does not properly reflect the fact that, at 71 years old, he will continue to operate in often hostile business environments to claw back the financial benefit currently locked in the mandates.  I accept his evidence that he finds the work gruelling and the travel tiring.   Although I accept that W will continue to make her own contributions under section 25(2)(f) in terms of her care for the children, they no longer absorb her entire focus and energy in perhaps the same way as once they did as small children.  Within three years, each will be away from home at university pursuing the next stage of the beginning of their adult lives.  Whilst I need no persuading that parental obligations can, and generally do, outlive any fixed or notional time line in a child&#8217;s journey through life, the fact is that W&#8217;s time will become increasingly her own to develop her French property, to travel, or to do as she chooses.  In my judgment, H should be entitled to retain across the board two-thirds of any recovery he makes from the mandates and W shall be entitled to 33.33% of the net sums received whether paid in tranches or in single payments by the debtor in each case.  These should be expressed as a series of separate contingent lump sum payments to W.</span></p>

He is willing to do this and enjoys the confidence of each of H and W.  In my view he would be particularly well placed to carry out this exercise given his detailed working knowledge of the business.  His costs of this exercise should be shared equally by way of top-slicing these costs from the bottom line figures before W&#8217;s 33.33% entitlement is calculated.  In this way, there is an incentive on both sides to keep his costs to a minimum.  Before that exercise happens, a schedule will need to be drawn in order to set out the sums (if any) paid to Mr Burne and any other third parties involved in the recovery, the administrative and other costs and expenses and a notional deduction for H&#8217;s tax.  It would be unfair were he to receive his share on a gross basis whereas W received hers on a net basis.  I would hope that the parties will be able to agree upon a formula of words to be annexed to the order in due course.  In the event of any further disputes on the &#8216;policing&#8217; aspects of the payments due to W, I shall rule if necessary but I very much hope a consensus will emerge now that Mr Collins has been identified as the candidate for this particular exercise.  I take the view that it would sensible to &#8216;spell out&#8217; the procedure to be adopted either in the body of the order or in a separate schedule attached to it so that in future, should either party need to seek declaratory relief from the court in relation to the sums due to W, it will be evident from the order how the calculation is to be made.</span></p>

W&#8217;s case, about which I heard some evidence, is that the greater burden for the children&#8217;s expenditure has fallen on her shoulders since the parties separated.  She has provided a number of schedules in relation to the sums she has spent on items such as clothes and travel.  H does not seek to criticise this level of expenditure on the three growing children.  He, too, will have incurred expenses in relation to the children.  I take the view that, whilst the circumstances surrounding the inequality of their drawings in recent months may have proved a source of aggravation in terms of managing the business cash flow, the sums involved are not so significant in the context of the overall assets that I should now seek to embark upon some sort of fact-finding exercise to ascertain the reasonableness of W&#8217;s expenditure.

If each is treated as paying 50% of the other&#8217;s costs bill, the effect without adjustment would be that H is subsidising W&#8217;s costs.

I bear well in mind that it was only the forensic process undertaken during the course of this trial which actually threw open the windows so as to enable an informed understanding of various transactions undertaken by H in relation to the business.  I am prepared to accept that W had legitimate concerns arising from some of the documents she had recovered from the business computer and that, in certain respects, H&#8217;s written explanations had not been as full or comprehensive as they might have been.

Whilst I will not in this already lengthy judgment set out my particular reasons for the choice of trustee (unless either of the parties wishes me to do so), I take the view that Alice Garrade (W&#8217;s nominee) and James Dunhill (H&#8217;s choice of trustee) should be invited to act as joint trustees of the fund.  The former is a relatively young woman who has known the children for most of their lives.  She lives in Australia but has 15 years&#8217; experience in the banking industry.  Whilst she is a family member, W confirmed that she recognised H should be able to communicate with her as and when he needed in relation to these matters.  The latter is a tax lawyer who knows the children well and in whom H has considerable confidence.  I take the view they should be able to work well together over the life of the trust fund for the benefit of the children.  In these days with email communication and Skype facilities readily available, I see no reason why their residence in different continents should prove any impediment to an effective working relation both as between themselves as trustees and in terms of their communication with the three children as the beneficiaries of the education fund.  The parties will need to take specific advice as to the provenance of the funding of the &#163;500,000 which will go into the education fund; that is not a matter at this stage which requires any further input from me.</span></p>

I have reached this conclusion on the basis of the provision I have already made in respect of the size of the education fund and in the light of H&#8217;s prospects of winding down into full retirement in due course.  That reduced sum will represent the &#8216;roofing allowance&#8217; to be paid directly to W for their benefit.  I have every confidence that H can be relied upon to negotiate with the children directly in relation to any additional costs they may incur during any second degree which may not be covered by student loans or earnings generated in vacation periods.</span></p>

Principally, in relation to needs, I am satisfied that the net effect of my order will meet the needs of each of these parties as they move into the next (retirement) stage of their lives.  Although W is considerably younger than H, her future income needs have to be considered in the light of the fact that he is nearing the end of his working life and there is very little in this case in terms of pension provision available to either party.  Each will share to an extent in the mandate run-offs, whatever these may yield over the next few years.</span></p>

That share will be 50% after adjustment has been made for the various balance sheet events which have been provided for on the extraction schedule.  The French property will be transferred into her effective ownership and control once the means has been agreed for the repayment of the mortgage and the balancing adjustment to H.  Both parties will be left with sufficient resources to acquire a home of their own which will not be encumbered by any debt.  If W chooses to retain the French property as a vehicle for investment and income generation, that must be a matter for her.  I accept that she has a number of decisions to make in relation to where she puts down roots in future and these will be decisions she will take once both parties know what The Manor Farm has achieved in terms of a gross sale price.</span></p>

Regardless of these notional assumptions, I am satisfied that each of these parties will have a fund of up to &#163;1 million which, in my view, will enable each to acquire a comfortable home for themselves and their children in Surrey or elsewhere outside central London.  The balance of the capital available to them (which in W&#8217;s case will be about &#163;1.8 million and in H&#8217;s some &#163;265,000 less because of the ring-fencing of her inherited wealth) will need to be invested to produce an income stream upon which (with their respective shares of the mandate run-offs) they will live in terms of their future income needs.  I was taken through their respective budgetary presentations.  Budgets are to some extent aspirational on whatever basis they are drawn.  I am confident that each of H and W will be left with sufficient resources to meet their needs and those needs will necessarily fall to be considered by them individually in terms of the decisions each makes about their respective housing needs going forward.  Whether W will be able to afford to maintain and run the French property on the basis of the rental income yield which she anticipates receiving will be a matter for her.  She will need to think about these decisions carefully once she knows what cash will be available from the sale of The Manor Farm and the liquidation of the Trust.  She may well decide to &#8216;downscale&#8217; in terms of the English home she buys in order to retain the French property.  That will be a matter for her at the end of the day.  H will be in a position to acquire an unencumbered home equivalent in value to the sort of property he showed me in his &#8216;comparable&#8217; property particulars.  I am satisfied he will have sufficient space in his new home to accommodate the children whenever they spend time with him during holiday and other periods. </span></p>
