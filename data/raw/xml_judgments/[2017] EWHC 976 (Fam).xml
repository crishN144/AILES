Before I&#160;turn to the appeal itself, it is important that I&#160;set out the nature of the mother&#8217;s case before the regional court at first instance.  Absent from the documents which were before me when this case started was the decision of the regional court and the reasons given by the judge.  It seemed to me that it would be helpful to have these reasons since they may have included reference to the matters which now form the basis of the mother&#8217;s defence.  If they did it seemed to me that they would have been possibly ruled upon; and if they did not it seemed to me that that was significant evidence of omission.</span></p>

In July&#160;2016 he was removed to a foreign country, foreign culture, and made to live among foreigners with whom, due to language barrier, he cannot communicate well enough.  The minor was suddenly removed from the community he knew all his life.  The participant in the proceedings did not take under [into] account the minor&#8217;s feelings, his attachment to places and people with whom he was growing up.  All the plans concerning his education, instead of starting attending school which is located near his father&#8217;s place of residence with his nursery friends, he was removed to a place where he could only count on his mother.&#8221;</span></p>

When the father visited England in September&#160;2016 not only did the mother allow him to take SL out all day on two consecutive days, she also allowed him to take out the daughter of a friend of hers at the same time.
