There was either a single impact with greater force than would be occasioned by an accidental fall from a carer&#8217;s arms or 2 separate incidents of shaking and impact. On the evidence I cannot say one is more likely than the other. If it were a single impact that was a deliberate act, it required greater force than an accidental drop from a carer&#8217;s arms. If it were a combination of shaking and an impact the impact may have been accidental (such as by dropping CC) but the shaking could not have been, it was deliberate.</p>

And all this when his ultimate position was that he admitted causing the physical injuries through culpable accident albeit I have gone further to find he inflicted them. FC has engaged in a deliberate and cynical attempt to conceal the true facts and has, at almost every turn, sought to evade and minimise his responsibility.</p>

	      <p class="Indented" style="margin-left:0.39in">&#8220;There is only one rule of law, namely that the occurrence of the fact in issue must be proved to have been more probable than not. Common sense, not law, requires that in deciding this question, regard should be had, to whatever extent appropriate, to inherent probabilities. If a child alleges sexual abuse by a parent, it is common sense to start with the assumption that most parents do not abuse their children. But this assumption may be swiftly dispelled by other compelling evidence of the relationship between parent and child or parent and other children. It would be absurd to suggest that the tribunal must in all cases assume that serious conduct is unlikely to have occurred. In many cases, the other evidence will show that it was all too likely.&#8221;</p>

It is for the local authority to prove its case.&#160;It is not for the mother to disprove it. In particular it is not for the mother to disprove it by proving how the injuries were in fact sustained. Neither is it for the court to determine how the injuries were sustained. The court&#8217;s task is to determine whether the local authority has proved its case on the balance of probability. Where, as here, there is a degree of medical uncertainty and credible evidence of a possible alternative explanation to that contended for by the local authority, the question for the court is not &#8216;has that possible alternative explanation been proved&#8217; but rather it should ask itself, &#8216;in the light of that possible alternative explanation can the court be satisfied that the local authority has proved its case on the simple balance of probability&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

Family judges deal with increasingly difficult child cases and are much assisted in their decision-making process by professionals from other disciplines: medical, wider mental health and social work among others. The courts pay particular attention to the valuable contribution from paediatricians and child psychiatrists as well as others, but it is important to remember that the decision is that of the judge and not of the professional expert. Judges are well accustomed to assessing the conflicting evidence of experts. As Ward LJ said, judges are not expected to suspend judicial belief simply because the evidence is given by an expert. An expert is not in any special position and there is no presumption or belief in a doctor however distinguished he or she may be. It is, however, necessary for a judge to give reasons for disagreeing with experts' conclusions or recommendations. That, this judge did. A judge cannot substitute his views for the views of the experts without some evidence to support what it is he concludes.</span></p>

A clear distinction is to be drawn between the relevance and admissibility of evidence which describes the harmful circumstances in which a child is being cared for and the same evidence when it is used to suggest that a person has a propensity to commit a particular act. In other words, the evidence will be very relevant to harm or its likelihood in s 31(2) and the court&#8217;s assessment of risk in s 1(3)(e) of the 1989 Act but not necessarily to perpetration. It may be forensically unwise for the court to attach much, if any, weight to this evidence if it is directed only to the question of propensity&#8230;</p>

The ordinary process of reasoning will draw the judge to consider a number of other matters, such as the consistency of the account with known facts, with previous accounts given by the witness, with other evidence, and with the overall probabilities.  However, in a case where the facts are not likely to be primarily found in contemporaneous documents the assessment of credibility can quite properly include the impression made upon the court by the witness, with due allowance being made for the pressures that may arise from the process of giving evidence.  Indeed in family cases, where the question is not only &#8216;what happened in the past?&#8217; but also &#8216;what may happen in the future?&#8217;, a witness&#8217;s demeanour may offer important information to the court about what sort of a person the witness truly is, and consequently whether an account of past events or future intentions is likely to be reliable. </p>

However, it is not helpful for the judge to give an indication of percentages as to the likelihood that one or other of the possible perpetrators was responsible and judges should be cautious about amplifying in this way a judgment in which they have been unable to identify a speci&#64257;c perpetrator (<span style="font-style:italic">Re S-B (Children)</span> [2010] 1 FLR 1161, SC).</p>

At this stage, the correct legal approach is to survey the evidence as a whole as it relates to each individual in order to arrive at a conclusion about whether the allegation has been made out in relation to one or other on a balance of probability. Evidentially, this will involve considering the individuals separately and together and comparing the probabilities in respect of each of them. Within this context, the right question is not &#8216;who is the more likely?&#8217; but rather &#8216;does the evidence establish that this individual probably caused this injury?&#8217; In a case where there are more than two possible perpetrators, the Court of Appeal highlighted a clear danger in identifying an individual simply because they are the likeliest candidate, as this can lead to an identi&#64257;cation on evidence that falls short of a probability;</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="Indented" style="margin-left:0.39in">It is important to note that the court remains under a duty to consider the welfare of the child under ChA 1989, s 1(3) where that child has suffered injury and thereby signi&#64257;cant harm, even where it is not possible to say who the perpetrator of harm is (<span style="font-style:italic">Re S (A Child)</span>). Note that the Court of Appeal has suggested that, in the context of the requirements of the Children Act 1989, s 31(2), the terms &#8216;non-accidental&#8217; and &#8216;accidental&#8217; injury are, in addition to being tautologous and oxymoronic, unhelpful, the threshold criteria not being concerned with intent or blame but rather with an objective standard of care (<span style="font-style:italic">Re S (Split Hearing)</span> [2014] 1 FLR 1421, CA). Where the court is satis&#64257;ed that the child has suffered signi&#64257;cant harm, the threshold conditions under ChA 1989, s 31(2)(b)(i) will be met in relation to that child even though the court is unable to identify who within the pool of possible perpetrators in&#64258;icted the harm: <span style="font-style:italic">Lancashire County Council v B</span> [2000] 1 FLR 583, HL, in which helpful guidance is given as to how evidence needs to be tested to establish the threshold criteria for the purposes of s 31 where the perpetrator is uncertain. In determining whether a person is properly included in the pool of potential perpetrators, it is essential that the court weighs any lies told by that person against any evidence that points away from them having been responsible for the injuries (<span style="font-style:italic">H v City and Council of Swansea and Others</span> [2011] EWCA Civ 195). In these &#8216;uncertain perpetrator&#8217; cases, the correct approach is for the case to proceed at the welfare stage on the basis that each of the possible perpetrators is treated as such (<span style="font-style:italic">Re O and N: Re B</span> [2003] 1 FLR 1169, HL). The House of Lords held in that case that it would be grotesque if, because neither parent had been proved to be the perpetrator, the court had to proceed at the welfare stage as though the child were not at risk from either parent, even though one or other of them was the perpetrator of signi&#64257;cant harm. The judge conducting the welfare hearing should have regard to the facts found at the preliminary hearing when they leave open the possibility that a parent or carer was a perpetrator of proved harm and that conclusion should not be excluded from consideration.</p>

Such interviews should be conducted in accordance with the detailed guidance in Achieving Best Evidence in Criminal Proceedings (ABE) (latest edition 2022) although this guidance is non-statutory. The court can make findings based on ABE evidence so long as it is alive to the hearsay nature of the evidence and the age of the children at the time of interview (<span style="font-style:italic">Re M (Sexual Abuse: Evidence)</span> [2010] EWCA Civ 1030). In <span style="font-style:italic">TW v A City Council</span> [2011] 1 FLR 1597, CA, the Court of Appeal found that the inadequacies of the ABE interview were so manifest, even allowing for a broad margin of latitude to anyone conducting such an interview, that no evidential weight could be placed on it. In particular, it was not sufficient for a judge to rely primarily on the fact that a child might be able to stand up to and overcome a thoroughly unsatisfactory interview; rather, a clear analysis of all the evidence was required and the child&#8217;s interview had to be assessed in that context. In <span style="font-style:italic">Re W; Re F (Children)</span> [2015] EWCA Civ 1300, the forensic value of the ABE interviews was found to be minimal such that the trial judge had been wrong to attach any weight to them. Whether the flaws in ABE evidence are so fundamental as to render the interviews wholly unreliable is a matter for the trial judge who must analyse the process thoroughly to evaluate whether any of the allegations made in such inter views can be relied upon (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re E (A Child) (Evidence)</span> [2017] 1 FLR 1675, CA, <span style="font-style:italic">Re M-Y (Children)</span> [2019] 1 FLR 79, CA and <span style="font-style:italic">Re C (A Child) (Fact-Finding)</span> [2022] EWCA Civ 584 where the Court of Appeal dismissed a father&#8217;s appeal against findings in care proceedings where criticisms were made of ABE interviews).</p>

The enlarged head circumference and separation of skull sutures occurs when the skull compartment is gradually expanded to accommodate the fluid. The gradual accumulation of fluid is likely to occur over the course of days (or even weeks) rather than hours. A more rapid accumulation of fluid would squash the brain rather than expand the skull, leading to a rapid collapse.</p>

His vomiting was first reported to healthcare on 29 February 2024. On 01 March he was noted by the GP and paediatric registrar to have a normal fontanelle consistent with subdural collections that had not yet reached a critical size. On balance, the subdural collections were likely caused on or within a few days before the 29 February, and after the Court finds that CC was completely well, feeding and handling normally.</p>

Therefore this method of dating has limitations but he considered the likely causative event was 1-3 weeks before 8-9 March 2024 [E194] i.e. between 16 February 2024 and 1 March 2024. He deferred to Dr Oates in so far as the radiological signs are concerned [E200]. From a clinical perspective he said &#8220;I think it probable that it occurred shortly before CC developed the sleepiness and sickness on 28 February 2024&#8221; [E201].</p>

The reference to an hour is a reference to his later evidence about the clinical signs of skull fracture (see above in relation to Group 3 findings). He said that after injury the child could &#8220;return to normal and the subdural bleeding can be relatively silent and only become symptomatic as it increases in volume in the head causing sleepiness and sickness&#8221; and agreed a logical sequence was &#8220;subdural bleeding becomes chronic collection and expands in size and the sutures in the head accommodate that expansion but only up to a point and at a point, an unspecified point the raised pressure can no longer be accommodated and CC becomes symptomatic&#8221;.</p>

I particularly rely on Dr Oates&#8217; evidence that it would be vanishingly rare to see chronic subdural haematoma at 3 months which originated from birth and Mr Jalloh&#8217;s consistent analysis of the head circumference data. A fall from a carer&#8217;s arms is a possible cause but unlikely to cause the multi-focal subdural collections (Dr Oates and Mr Jalloh) or large subdural collections (Mr Jalloh) which are seen in CC. A single impact injury (as from a fall) would be unlikely to cause them and would be atypical (Dr Oates and Mr Jalloh). The absence of other injuries does not reduce the likelihood of a shaking mechanism (Dr Cartlidge). That leaves 2 alternatives: a shaking event and an impact event or a single impact event but with greater force than would be expected from a carer&#8217;s arms (Dr Oates&#8217; evidence it would require &#8220;a very significant impact injury&#8221; and Mr Jalloh&#8217;s evidence that it would need to be &#8220;of sufficient force/energy to cause significant inertial acceleration-deceleration of the brain&#8221;).</p>

His lack of recollection of someone who it turned out was the ex-partner of a person FC tried to arrange to have intercourse with the day after CC was admitted to hospital might have been from embarrassment about his behaviour. His lies about alcohol and drug use did not appear to have an innocent explanation. He has tested positive for cocaine use and chronic excessive alcohol use; he had admitted the same at least to some degree. It cannot be from embarrassment that he lied about his consumption of alcohol in the home. The lies point towards an attempt to conceal the truth about what happened at home when he was in sole charge of the children. His evidence about domestic abuse and criminal damage may have been a genuine lack of recollection, although this is really quite difficult to accept given the proximity of these incidents in 2022 and 2024, and it seems more likely an attempt to conceal his violent behaviour and perhaps that he gets angry. </p>

I have considered whether FC may have been responsible for injuring CC at the time he is reported by CA and CB to have sworn in the period 1-6 February 2024, but there is no evidence of a biphasic presentation, and the dating of the subdural collections by the medical experts does not fit.</p>

There was either a single impact with greater force than would be occasioned by an accidental fall from a carer&#8217;s arms or 2 separate incidents of shaking and impact. On the evidence I cannot say one is more likely than the other. If it were a single impact, that was a deliberate act and it required greater force than an accidental drop from a carer&#8217;s arms. If it were a combination of shaking and an impact, the impact may have been accidental (such as by dropping CC) but the shaking could not have been; it was deliberate.</p>
