Their father is aged 74. He has dual UK and Australian nationality. He has been married before and has five adult children from his first marriage. During his first marriage, he lived with his family in Australia for several years. Some of his children still live in that country. He has been involved in property management in the south west of England but alleges that he has no beneficial interest in any of the properties he manages, asserting that they are owned by his sons.</p>

The parties met in 2001 when the mother was studying in England. They started a relationship but from an early stage it was characterised by allegations of violence and abuse. The police have been contacted on a number of occasions. In 2007, the parties married and in 2008 the mother gave birth to their first child, D. In 2009, the parties separated and the mother spent a period in a refuge with D. Social services became involved as a result of ongoing allegations of domestic violence and after an incident when D fell downstairs. According to the local authority, the parties did not co-operate with social services and as a result a child protection conference was convened and D made subject of a child protection plan. The father applied for a prohibited steps order to prevent the mother removing D to China.</p>

In 2011, the mother gave birth to their second son, B. In 2013, the mother travelled to China with both boys to visit members of the extended family. The father went out to meet them and the family returned together. The parties&#8217; relationship remained volatile and in July 2014 their GP referred the family to social services. On this occasion, both boys were made subject to child protection plans. In August 2014, however, the family travelled to Australia together (according to the father with the intention of exploring the possibility of emigrating) and in December of that year the father took the children back to Australia for a holiday. The following year, the relationship finally broke down. At that point, the boys were living with their father. The mother made a complaint to the police alleging that the father had raped and assaulted her during their marriage. The father was arrested, interviewed and bailed on condition that he did not communicate with the mother save in relation to contact with the children. In the event, the police decided to take no further action in respect of these allegations. </p>

The local authority are not confident that either parent is able to manage this form of arrangement and therefore consider that the children should remain in the care of the father, with specific contact to include overnight stays with their mother.&#8221;</p>

In her conclusion, she noted that at the time of her first report she had considered that the father was able to provide the children with more consistent care as the mother was often presenting as obstructive and agitated. She now reported, however, that the father&#8217;s presentation &#8220;had changed dramatically with him becoming increasingly irrational and fixed on past and present issues which has impacted on his ability to keep the children as his central focus&#8221;. She therefore recommended that the children should reside with their mother with contact, including overnight stays, with the father. </p>

As a result, he was arrested by the police, interviewed and bailed. He then spent just under 4 weeks in Australia, during which time the children stayed with the mother. Following his return to this country, the father was charged with harassment. As a result of these developments, it was agreed that the final hearing of the various applications under the Children Act, listed for 11th May, should be adjourned until 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July. At that hearing, I made a lengthy order including (a) an interim child arrangements order under which the children would live with their mother (b) an order that the mother make the children available to spend time with the father under a detailed schedule including four nights per fortnight in term time and for greater periods in school holidays and half-term holidays; (c) a series of undertakings including by each party not to remove the children from the jurisdiction until the conclusion of these proceedings; and (d) directions for a further hearing in February 2017 to determine the mother&#8217;s application for permission to remove the children temporarily to China. (The father had by this point indicated that he did not intend to proceed at this stage with his application to take the children to Australia.) </p>

In November 2017, he returned to Australia for a further month. At a hearing at the Crown Court in December 2016, he pleaded guilty to harassment of the mother on two occasions but was acquitted of the offence of stalking. He was conditionally discharged for 12 months. In the hearing before me, the father&#8217;s evidence about what had happened at this hearing was opaque. I shall consider this matter later in the judgment. </p>

Following an allegation by the father that B had told him that the mother had hit him, CAFCASS referred the family to social services again. Having spoken to both parents, social services decided to take no further action. In the week leading up to the hearing before me in February, there was a further dispute when the father had kept the children back from school without telling the mother on the pretext that there were concerns about an outbreak of scarlet fever, and subsequently cancelled an arrangement she had made for a sleepover without consulting her.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The order of July 2016 left open two issues &#8211; the final child arrangements and the mother&#8217;s application for permission to take the children to China for a holiday. In the event, although there have been ongoing disagreements between the parties as to the child arrangements in the intervening months, there was a measure of agreement between them at the hearing before me. Neither party sought to argue for a substantive change in the arrangements. On behalf of the mother, Mr. Naish put forward a proposal, set out in a detailed schedule appended to his final submissions, which effectively provided for the current arrangements to continue. Although the father had issued a further application shortly prior to the hearing, his counsel Mr. Hames conceded in closing submissions that the order should continue, subject to two conditions (a) that the mother is to liaise with him prior to any additional contact taking place and (b) the children are not to be dropped off with him for additional contact unless he has agreed to it. In the period between the conclusion of the hearing and the delivery of this judgment, however, the mother has filed a further application for a prohibited steps order seeking to prevent the father from collecting the boys from school at any time unless agreed with her in advance. It seems, therefore, that there are in practice ongoing issues about child arrangements notwithstanding the apparent agreement pronounced in the course of submissions. I shall consider what steps to take in the light of these developments at the end of the judgment.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">"The overriding consideration for the court in deciding whether to allow a parent to take a child to a non-Hague Convention country is whether the making of that order would be in the best interests of the child. Where (as in most cases) there is some risk of abduction and an obvious detriment to the child if that risk were to materialise, the court has to be positively satisfied that the advantages to the child of her visiting that country outweigh the risks to her welfare which the visit will entail. This will therefore routinely involve the court in investigating what safeguards can be put in place to minimise the risk of retention and to secure the child's return if that transpires. Those safeguards should be capable of having a real and tangible effect in the jurisdiction in which they are to operate and be capable of being easily accessed by the UK-based parent. Although, in common with Black LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Re M (Removal from Jurisdiction: Adjournment)</span>, we do not say that no application of this category can proceed in the absence of expert evidence, we consider that there is a need in most cases for the effectiveness of any suggested safeguard to be established by competent and complete expert evidence which deals specifically and in detail with that issue. If in doubt the court should err on the side of caution and refuse to make the order. If the judge decides to proceed in the absence of expert evidence, then very clear reasons are required to justify such a course."</p>

She said that she would also be unhappy with the Chinese educational system which she feels is too pressurised and geared towards exams and does not prepare children properly for life. She acknowledges that she does not own her own property in the UK and only lives in rented accommodation, and, furthermore, that she has no substantial assets in this country and is currently reliant on state benefits. It is her plan, however, to apply for full-time teaching posts in due course, although she is unable to follow up this plan because of the arrangements for childcare.

She said that the letter &#8220;reflects the fact that I would therefore leave the UK if he and the children were no longer living in the UK.&#8221; The mother denies that she has any current plans to work in the Far East. The father does not accept this denial and asserts that she has a good friend in China called Mary who runs an international school and that he strongly suspects she will obtain a job from her if she returns there.</p>

He argues that, given the conflict and hostility that exist between them, he can see no reason why she would want to return to this country. He asserts that the UK does not have anything to offer her. She does not have a secure home here, nor any secure employment. Nearly all members of her extended family are living China. He claims that she refuses to engage with him or communicate with him concerning the boys and adds that &#8220;she appears to despise me.&#8221; He says that she has repeatedly told him that she does not respect him and wishes to have nothing to do with him. He contends that, if she stays in this country, it is likely that she will continue to be scrutinised by the local authority. He draws attention to the fact that, when he separated from the mother in 2009, she returned home to China to live with their parents, leaving D in his care. He cites this as an illustration of her close emotional connection with China.</p>

She said that she is constantly receiving messages from him, some of which have a sexual content. She said she did not think that the father would ever stop behaving in this fashion. Cross-examined by Mr Hames on behalf of the father, she said that, in behaving like this, the father was not putting the children&#8217;s interests first. He loved himself more than the boys. An example, she pointed to a threat which she said he had uttered to stop paying for the children&#8217;s private school fees. The mother said that, if the father could use the children against her, he would do so. She said that, although he would never cause the children physical harm, his behaviour was undoubtedly causing them emotional harm. It is clear that she feels very strongly under pressure from him, but she insisted that she did not want to escape, adding that he was still the boys&#8217; father and she would continue to facilitate and encourage contact. She agreed in cross-examination that if they did not see their father it would have devastating consequences for them.</p>

She also produced other photographs of her father&#8217;s bank statements and other documents to illustrate that he would be able to provide financial support. It seems that, prior to giving evidence before me, she had not offered any sum by way of security for the children&#8217;s visit to China, but in the course of her evidence she was asked questions about this, in particular by Miss Ingham on behalf of the Guardian, and the following morning returned to court stating that her father had offered to pay the sum of &#163;10,000 by way of security. Asked why her father could not travel to England to see the boys, the mother said that he was now in his 70s and not able to travel because he has a heart problem. It would be a bigger burden for him to travel here than for her to visit China with the boys.</p>

She was also cross examined about her financial position. She confirmed that she is currently living in a six-month short hold tenancy. She said that she is currently working in voluntary roles and said that she had made an effort to get full-time employment but at present wanted to spend more time with the boys. She added that if she was in a full-time job, the father had said that she would have to pay him maintenance for the boys. She alleged that the father owns over twelve properties in the local area and that he was concealing the truth about his financial position. I remind myself that the divorce proceedings are still ongoing and it seems probable that there will be a hotly-contested financial remedies dispute.</p>

I found this part of her evidence wholly implausible. Although it is not a first language, her English is fluent and I think it extremely unlikely that she would have made such an error. Furthermore, her oral evidence on this point was contrary to her explanation given in her later statement quoted above that the letter had been sent at a time when she was unaware that she could prevent the father taking the children to Australia and &#8220;reflects the fact that I would therefore leave the UK if he and the children were no longer living in the UK&#8221;.</p>

Cross-examined by Miss Ingham, he said that he had &#8220;forgotten&#8221; to tell the guardian that he had pleaded guilty to the offences of harassment. I found his evidence on this issue wholly implausible. He undoubtedly pleaded guilty to two offences of harassment for which he was conditionally discharged.

He accepted that he had told the guardian that he had concerns about the mother&#8217;s mental health, and about the lack of attachment between the mother and the children, and about allegations of physical abuse by the mother on the children. He also accepted that he had alleged that the mother had been engaging in sex work from home. He said that he had subsequently withdrawn this allegation after receiving the enquiry agent&#8217;s report but had previously been genuinely concerned about the boys&#8217; welfare. Through his answers to Mr Naish on these topics, and his evidence overall, I formed a clear view that this father continues to want to control the mother&#8217;s life.</p>

When he returned to resume his evidence on the following day, he produced a document purporting to demonstrate the transfer of this sum to the mother&#8217;s account from a joint account in the name of the father and one of his sons. He also produced a document which he said was evidence of the deposit put down by the mother on the property in Sanyo in China. Cross-examined by Mr Naish he stated that the sum of &#163;14,000 had in fact belonged to his son in Australia. The purpose of the transfer had been to buy a property in China which the whole family could use. He accepted that the rest of the purchase price of the property had been paid by a loan raised by mortgage but said he did not know the details about that.</p>

She denied that she and Mary had ever taught at the same college. She did not know why Mary was in the photograph produced by the father. Her explanation for the transfer of money to her account at the start of the marriage was that she and the father were then running properties in in the south-west of England, some of which were empty and needed furniture. They therefore decided to buy the furniture in China and ship it back to England. In the event, however, they had decided not to bring furniture here but had used the money to buy pictures instead. She insisted that none of the money provided by the father had been used to buy the property in Sanya. That property had been bought by her parents and put in her name as a wedding gift. She accepted that the property had been purchased and indeed that the father had been present when she chose the property. She reiterated that it had been given to her by her parents so that she would have a home to go to if the marriage broke down. It was not intended as any form of investment. Her evidence was that the plan had been for the father to pay the mortgage instalments but that the payments had not been made so that after two years the property had been rented out and thereafter managed by her father and brother who had paid the mortgage instalments. She said that she did not know what had subsequently happened to the mortgage and that the property was nothing to do with her anymore. On this issue, I again found the mother&#8217;s evidence unconvincing.</p>

Such proceedings would take the form of a hearing de novo of the child custody issues with a fresh determination being made according to Chinese law and practice. Ms Huang explained that the principal aim of the Chinese courts when deciding child custody and related matters is the protection and promotion of the child&#8217;s health and well-being. She identified other principles applied by the Chinese courts by reference to an opinion issued by the Supreme People&#8217;s Court. She added, however, that, although British judgments and/or orders will not be recognised and enforced by the Chinese courts, they may be entered as evidence in the Chinese proceedings.</p>

In practice, this would entail a full redetermination of the child custody matters in China, adjudicated according to Chinese law.

As a result, both the mother and the father have the right to start proceedings in China in relation to the children. By default, litigation in China will be conducted in the Chinese language and with the application of Chinese law. It will be possible for the parties to request that the court apply English law, but Ms Huang advised that the Chinese courts were most unlikely to agree to such an application. She further advised that the mother will be able to apply to the Chinese courts with respect to the children on the basis of her Chinese citizenship, regardless of the fact that she is habitually resident in the UK. If she were to abandon her Chinese citizenship, however, she will be able to apply to the Chinese courts in respect of the children only after successfully completing one year of uninterrupted residency on which to found jurisdiction. Furthermore, China does not have any legal mechanism to apply for or issue urgent or emergency orders in family law cases.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to the various questions asked by the parties concerning nationality and citizenship, Ms Huang advised, first, that the ability for a Chinese citizen to hold more than one nationality is explicitly precluded by Chinese domestic law. Should she renounce or be stripped of her Chinese citizenship, and thereafter travel to China on her British passport, the mother will be subject to Chinese laws and regulations governing foreign aliens present on, or seeking entry to, Chinese territory. In particular, she would be required to conduct herself in accordance with the rules governing her visa category and remain in China no longer than for the permitted visa period. Were she to overstay her visa, she would be subject to legal and administrative action. It is not possible to abandon &#8220;nationality&#8221;; abandonment of &#8220;citizenship&#8221; would not alter the individual&#8217;s ethnic designation under Chinese law. Ms Huang advised that it is possible to reapply for Chinese citizenship after successfully abandoning it, although the failure rate for such re-acquisition is extremely high. She therefore advises that in practice, abandonment of Chinese citizenship should be considered a permanent decision. A person who abandons her Chinese citizenship loses all rights and privileges afforded to a citizen, including the right to remain indefinitely on Chinese territory without the need for a visa or residence permit.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The guardian has prepared two reports in these proceedings. Much of the information in the reports concerns the child arrangement issues which, subject to further submissions as explained below, have now been resolved. In the circumstances, I do not think it necessary to set out that information in any detail. Suffice it to say that the guardian confirms the high level of antagonism between the parties and the impact of that antagonism on the children. She concludes that the children&#8217;s awareness of the ongoing conflict between their parents is having an impact on their emotional well-being and stability. She advises in her last report that the children appear settled in their mother&#8217;s care and she feels that the mother demonstrated good insight into their needs and experiences. Although she has struggled on one occasion to manage B&#8217;s behaviour, overall the children appear to be provided with consistent routines and boundaries. Equally, the Guardian concludes that the children clearly have a good relationship with their father and enjoy contact with him. She reports that D would like slightly more contact. The guardian expresses the view, however, that the father remains focused on the conflict between the parties whereas, in contrast, the mother has largely disengaged from this and recognises the impact on the children. The guardian therefore believes that the current child arrangement should continue.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The guardian&#8217;s reports contain relatively little analysis of the issues concerning the proposed visit to China. In her first report, she noted that the children&#8217;s Chinese heritage is an essential component of their identity. She observed that they were well settled in their school and local area. She thought there was little evidence to suggest that the mother is planning to move permanently to China and in the circumstances, she considered it appropriate for the children to be able to explore their heritage and identity by visiting that country. She accepted that, were the mother to retain the children in China, this would be detrimental to the children and have a significant impact upon their relationship with the father.</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;It remains my view that the children would benefit from a holiday in China in order to explore their heritage and culture. Due to the level of animosity between the parents which includes frequent allegations made against [the mother], the court may feel there is a risk that she may seek to relocate to China with the children. This may be considered a way to remove herself from the conflict. This would have a negative impact upon the children&#8217;s stability and relationship with their father. In my view, the risk of absconding is finely balanced against the benefits of the proposed holiday. However, I was reassured by [the mother&#8217;s] view of this conflict and her lack of engagement with it. She has been consistent in this view for around a year. In my view, she no longer focuses on the conflict and instead prioritises the children&#8217;s needs. I was further reassured by the statements from her sister and father. I feel there is little evidence to suggest that she plans to relocate to China.&#8221;</p>

She recommended that the visit be postponed until 2018. She thought waiting a year would help the boys manage the stresses better. She acknowledged that the father was a very significant figure in the boys&#8217; lives and the consequences for the boys of not being returned would be serious. She thought, however, that the likelihood of the children not being returned was low and outweighed by the benefits to the boys of seeing their father and engaging with their Chinese heritage. She conceded that, if the likelihood of the children not being returned was anything other than low, the balance would come down the other way.</p>

She remains very concerned, however, about the impact of these proceedings on the boys who she described as being caught between their parents. If there were further proceedings, their anxieties would escalate. The events of the previous week had merely demonstrated that the father continued to push the boundaries at every opportunity. She therefore proposed that the court makes an order under section 91(14) to prohibit any further applications without the court&#8217;s permission.</p>

He submitted that the father&#8217;s evidence was strikingly dishonest in a number of respects and that the court should conclude that he lacks all credibility as a witness. He relied on the fact that the father has, over a prolonged period, demonstrated controlling behaviour towards the mother and the children and showed an unrelenting hostility towards the mother coupled with a tendency to denigrate her. He submitted that the father lacks genuine respect for the boys&#8217; Chinese heritage.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Naish anticipated a submission on behalf the father that the mother&#8217;s evidence lacked credibility in certain respects but contended that overall her evidence was credible &#8211; in particular, her clear evidence that she recognised the boys needed to have a good relationship with the father. He submitted that this evidence was corroborated by the way in which she has behaved, for example by permitting him to have additional contact with the boys, notwithstanding his wholly unacceptable behaviour towards her. Mr Naish submitted that, even if the court concluded that the mother&#8217;s evidence had been untruthful in some respects, the court should apply the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Lucas</span> principle and recognise that the reason for any untruthful statements was likely to be a wish to avoid giving an adverse impression, rather than fundamental dishonesty. In respect of the evidence as to the Sanya property, Mr Naish submitted that this issue only arose during the course of the hearing when the father produced documents and that the mother did not have opportunity to obtain evidence from her family to support her contention as to the provision of funds and the current position. Mr Naish added that, in any event, this issue is a red herring. Even if it is her property, it is unlikely that the mother would wish to live there as it is located 1500 kilometres from the family home. Mr Naish submits that the evidence concerning the mother&#8217;s relationship with Mary is tenuous and apparently based on a photograph which is capable of many different interpretations. As for the letter sent by the mother in February 2015, he submits that the fact that she may have been contemplating working abroad then, at a point when it was anticipated that the children will be living with the father in Australia, does not mean that she now intends to move to the Far East.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So far as the risk is concerned, Mr Naish invited the court to accept the mother&#8217;s position that the father has no genuine belief that she would not return the children to this country but is merely advancing the argument as a means of extending his control over her. Mr Naish characterised the arguments advanced on behalf the father on this issue as unattractive &#8211; namely that the worse the father behaved, the greater the mother&#8217;s incentive to abscond, and the less well off the mother the less financially able she is to put up a bond as security and therefore the harder it would be for her to persuade the court to permit her to go. Mr Naish urged the court to be wary of discriminating against a parent who has been the victim of controlling behaviour and is of limited means. In any event, he submitted that the mother&#8217;s ties to this country are in fact very strong and there is no real prospect that she would wish to relocate to China. First and foremost, there is a recognition of the boys&#8217; need for a relationship with her father. Mr Naish submits that, if the court accepts this, it is compelling evidence that she would return. In addition, there is evidence of her relationship with a local man, the fact that she has been settled here for many years, her expressed preference for the British educational system, and the fact that her nephew is now studying in this country. It is submitted that this constellation of factors amounts to compelling evidence that the mother has no intention of remaining in China.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is accepted on behalf of the mother that the consequences of a breach will be extremely serious, although it is not accepted that the father will be without a remedy. It is submitted that the reality is that he has demonstrated that he has access to funds whenever they are needed &#8211; be it for school fees or legal representation or trips to Australia &#8211; and therefore would be able to afford to pursue remedies in China if necessary. Furthermore, the mother now puts forward an offer of a bond of up to &#163;10,000 by way of security. Mr Naish submits that this is a significant offer representing as it does most of the father&#8217;s savings. The mother&#8217;s preference would be to travel on her Chinese passport because she believes that, if she travels on a British passport and applies for a visa, her Chinese passport will then be cancelled. She is reluctant to do this in case she needed to travel there without the boys at short notice, for example if her father becomes ill. However, if the court considers it a necessary precaution, the mother is prepared to do this and deposit the Chinese passport with the court.</p>

The proceedings have been ongoing for nearly two years and the proposed trip has already been postponed for some time. He submitted that the guardian was wrong to suggest that the period of twelve months would be sufficient to enable the boys to become more settled.

The mother will be relaxed. They will enjoy the company of their maternal grandfather and family they will experience the culture of their mother&#8217;s homeland. Travel broadens the mind and will provide a vivid insight into their background. On the other hand, Mr Hames identified a number of disadvantages. The children do not speak Chinese. They will miss having face-to-face contact with the father. There is likely to be some anxiety about the newness of the temporary environment. In addition, the father has concerns about the accommodation proposed by the mother.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The principal argument advanced by the father against the trip, however, is the risk that the children will not be returned. Mr Hames characterised the risk as moderate &#8211; not high but not low and certainly more than minimal. The magnitude of the risk flows from a number of factors. The mother has no extended family here, other than her newly-arrived nephew. Although she gave evidence about a new relationship, Mr Hames points out that the details were only disclosed in the witness box. The mother has no financial attachment here &#8211; no property or assets and no permanent employment. On the other hand, her family in China have means &#8211; the father owns two properties. As a qualified teacher, she has skills that are readily transferable to China. It is the father&#8217;s case that her friend Mary may have offered her a job in China. Mr Hames submitted that the mother&#8217;s evidence about Mary was vague and that she was seeking to downplay the teaching opportunities available to her in China. Mr Hames submitted that the mother&#8217;s letter of February 2015 demonstrated that she was willing to relocate to China at that stage.</p>

He further submitted that her apparent ignorance as to what has happened to the property, and her disclaimer of any interest in the property, are implausible. It is his case that the mother knows that she still owns the property and that the reason for her failure to be candid about it was that she realised that it might adversely affect her application.</p>

They will be stranded in a country where they would not be able to speak the language of most of the local population. Most importantly, their relationship with their father would be destroyed. Mr Hames submits that given the father&#8217;s age and circumstances, they would be put beyond his effective reach. Drawing on Ms Huang&#8217;s report, Mr Hames submitted that there are no effective safeguards which can be put in place to prevent the children being retained in China if the mother so chooses. The offer of &#163;10,000 by way of security was too little too late.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In support of the guardian&#8217;s application for an order under s91(14), Miss Ingham submitted that it has become clear to the guardian that the children have not been shielded from the parental conflict over the course of many years and have been heavily involved since 2014.  This conflict has been unremitting and played out in every available forum with applications by each parent for the involvement of the court and other agencies. This has directly impacted upon the children, for example through witnessing their father being arrested or being questioned themselves by social workers. Such behaviour has continued in conjunction with the court proceedings. Within the court arena, there have been ongoing proceedings for nearly two years with various applications being made by each parent. This has led to the children not knowing which parent they were going to live with and what time they would then spend with the other, but also at times it has been uncertain for them as to which country they would be living in. Miss Ingham pointed out that, during a relative period of calm in the court proceedings since last July, there have nonetheless been allegations of physical harm made against the mother by the father in October 2016 necessitating a further referral to the local authority as well as the criminal proceedings resulting in the conviction of the father for harassment of the mother. Added to all of this, there has been recent uncertainty over whether the children could remain in their current school. Miss Ingham submitted that it is hard to see any element of the children&#8217;s lives which could be said to have been free of care or any period of time over the last three years during which they could just enjoy their childhood. The guardian is greatly concerned about the impact of these anxieties upon the children, in particular D.</p>

It would however be of considerable benefit to them if they are able to be told that their current living arrangements are not going to change for a considerable period of time. Although there is no history of repeated applications to the court, the extraordinary and unrelenting fashion in which the parental problems have impacted on every area of the children&#8217;s lives over the past three years puts this case into a bracket which goes well beyond the &#8220;normal&#8221; level of animosity to be expected in any private law dispute.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Both parties oppose the making of a s.91(14) order. On behalf of the mother, Mr Naish submitted that a section 91(14) order restricting the mother from applying to the court would be unjustified on the grounds that applications to the court have been generated as a result of the father&#8217;s desire to exercise control. For his part, the father offers an undertaking that he will not make any further application to vary the existing child arrangements order for six months. But he opposes any order under section 91 (14). Mr Hames submitted that such an order is inappropriate for a number of reasons. First, no application for it was made prior to the hearing. It was only raised by the guardian at the conclusion of the evidence. Consequently, it has not been the focus of this hearing which has centred around the temporary relocation application. Mr Hames therefore submitted that it would be procedurally unfair for this court to make such an order at this stage. He further submitted that the father had not pursued any unreasonable application nor is there any history of repeated and meritorious applications. It is submitted that there is no proper evidential basis for any finding that the father will bring further unwarranted proceedings. Furthermore, there may be a need for both parties to approach the court for a prohibited steps orders or specific issue orders. Mr Hames reminded the court that <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re P</span> emphasises that s.91(14) order should be the exception not the rule. He contends that, quite apart from procedural unfairness of making such an order at this hearing, the welfare of the children and the overall circumstances do not justify it at this stage.</p>

Although the opinion of the guardian, echoing the observations of the social worker in the s.7 report, is that the father remains fixated about the dispute whereas the mother has to some extent moved on, my overall conclusion from their oral evidence was that each party harbours a strong sense of grievance towards the other. There is clear evidence that the father has persisted in his relentlessly controlling behaviour towards the mother, but I also detected a high level of bitterness in the mother&#8217;s attitude towards the father. Unless the parties modify their behaviour towards each other, it is likely that the children will suffer significant emotional harm which could in turn lead to further social services intervention. </p>

I find that he does have a genuine concern that the children would not be returned. Plainly a crucial factor in my analysis is my assessment of the mother&#8217;s evidence. As indicated above, I did not find her to be a wholly satisfactory witness and I conclude that she has been less than candid about a number of aspects of evidence. I did not accept her explanation concerning the letter of February 2015. Her claim that she intended to say &#8220;with Japan&#8221; instead of &#8220;in Japan&#8221; was, to my mind, an obvious fabrication. Of course, the fact that she has lied about this does not mean that she has lied about everything. Looking at the possible explanation for this lie, I have considered the point that she is merely anxious that the court will think that the fact that she was willing to move to the Far East in 2015 indicates that she has a similar intention now when in fact she does not. I have concluded that I cannot dismiss this fabrication in that way. I am left with the strong feeling that she does indeed have a plan of some sort to work in China. In this context, I found evidence concerning her friend Mary, and her dismissive responses to suggestions concerning Mary&#8217;s business venture, somewhat unconvincing.</p>

In addition, her apparent lack of knowledge as to whether or not she retained interest in the Sanya property was implausible, given her overall evidence and in particular her evidence as to her parlous financial circumstances. I simply do not believe that she does not have a clear understanding as to the position about the property. I conclude that she does retain an interest in the property which was, as she said, purchased for the specific purpose of providing a home for her in the event of her marriage breaking down.</p>

I do not accept that the mother&#8217;s offers to travel on her British passport and to renounce her Chinese citizenship are a sufficient safeguard. It would be open to her to withdraw any renunciation of citizenship and, although Ms Huang advised that re-acquisition of citizenship in such circumstances was difficult, I do not consider it would be impossible for the mother to re-acquire it, particularly if she was able to argue that she had only renounced it at the court&#8217;s insistence. China is not a signatory to any Hague Convention. There are no bilateral arrangements between China and the UK. The Chinese court would not make a mirror order or otherwise give effect to any English order. At most, it would admit the order in evidence in the course of any proceedings brought by the father seeking to recover the children, but such proceedings would amount to a de novo assessment of child arrangements. Whether or not the father has any financial resources &#8211; a matter of very considerable dispute between the parties &#8211; I accept that it would be difficult for him to access the court in China. It would not be completely impossible for the father to secure the return of the children, but this could only be achieved by initiating proceedings in China. The process would undoubtedly be difficult and there is no guarantee that the Chinese court would order the children&#8217;s return. Indeed, given the history of the family, there is a significant prospect that a Chinese court would refuse to do so.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Turning to the third factor &#8211; the consequences for the boys of being retained in China &#8211; I accept the evidence of the guardian that they would be devastating. Apart from the company of each other and their mother, they will be deprived of everything in their lives to date &#8211; friends, home environment, school, the culture in which they have been brought up, and, above all else, the relationship with their father. Notwithstanding his at times deplorable behaviour, their relationship with their father has been strong and beneficial to the boys. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the light of this assessment of the risk of the children not being returned, and the consequences for them if that occurs, I turn to the overall welfare analysis, applying section 1 of the Children Act. I accept that it is ordinarily in the interests of children to have an opportunity to meet all members of their family and to explore their background. In this case, it is manifestly in the interests of these boys to get to know their maternal family in China and have an opportunity to learn more about their Chinese heritage. In other circumstances, it would definitely be in the interests of the boys to be taken for a holiday in China. But in the light of my assessment of the risk that the children may not be returned to China, the lack of sufficient safeguards to ensure that they would be returned, and the dire consequences if they are not returned, I conclude that it is not in their interests to be taken to China at this stage. I therefore refuse the mother&#8217;s application for permission to take the boys to China for a holiday.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn briefly to the other applications. I was minded to endorse the agreement concerning child arrangements as set out in the schedule to Mr Naish&#8217;s closing submissions. In the light of the ongoing dispute as set out in the mother&#8217;s latest application filed since the conclusion of the hearing, however, I am not persuaded to give such an endorsement at this point. I want to hear argument concerning these developments before deciding whether the proposed order is indeed in the children&#8217;s best interest. It may be that the evidence concerning the matters that the mother now wishes to raise will justify a re-evaluation of the division of parenting time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, so far as s.91(14) is concerned, I recognise the strength of the guardian&#8217;s arguments. I have concluded, however, that there is force in the submission that the focus of the hearing before me was on the relocation application and that this court may not have the evidential basis to decide whether to make such an order at this stage. The guardian is rightly concerned about the children&#8217;s heightened anxieties, but in my view those anxieties spring not so much from the ongoing proceedings but rather from the persistent and probably chronic difficulties between the parents themselves. There has not been the history of a number of unmeritorious applications to the court which is usually, although not invariably, found in cases where the court makes a s.91(14) order.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On balance, I have decided that it would not be appropriate to make a s.91(14) order at this point. I will, however, adopt a course which goes some way to meet the guardian&#8217;s concerns, I will direct that upon issue any further application for orders under s.8 of the Children Act concerning these children should immediately be allocated to me or, if I am not available, to the Designated Family Judge for the area to determine what course to take. It is, of course, always open to the court in appropriate circumstances to make summary orders if it concludes that such an approach is in the interests of the children and I can foresee circumstances in which a court in this case would take such a course. Furthermore, by ensuring that the further application comes before me, or the DFJ, the question of whether a s.91(14) order should be made can be reviewed if the court concludes that the overall circumstances justify such an order. </p>
