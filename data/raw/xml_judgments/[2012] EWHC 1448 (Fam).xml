	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Between 13 February and 21 February 2006 I heard an application for ancillary relief by a wife, Mrs Beverley Charman; (&#8220;the wife&#8221;) against her former husband John Charman (&#8220;the husband)&#8221;. It was in a very real sense a &#8220;big money case&#8221;, as these cases are sometimes rather unattractively described, the assets exceeding &#163;100million. The hearing eventually resulted in my making an award to the wife worth in excess of &#163;40m made up of real property and cash. I think that award still stands as the highest award made in a post divorce contested hearing </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">For the purposes of the hearing enormous quantities of documents were assembled on both sides as a result of the conventional disclosure process governed by the Family Proceeding Rules 1991. All the proceedings before me were, as usual, heard in private and the oral evidence was transcribed as indeed, of course, eventually was the judgment. The judgment generated an appeal to the Court of Appeal which was dismissed. The hearing in the Court of Appeal was, again as usual, in public.  Both my first instance judgment and the judgment of the Court of Appeal are reported in the law reports.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">One of the issues which impacted on my determination of the wife&#8217;s claim was the extent of the husband&#8217;s potential tax liabilities. In particular the extent of his income and capital tax liabilities in relation to his interests in Axis Speciality Limited. That in itself depended significantly upon the date when the husband gave up residence in the UK and took up residence in Bermuda. There was  considerable evidence about that during the hearing.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">That potential tax liability has now become more of a reality because the applicants to this application (HMRC) have issued assessments for about &#163;11.5m of unpaid tax for the years 2001 -2008. The husband disputes the liability and to that end has appealed the assessments. The appeal process is very much under way and a directions hearing leading to final hearing was heard the day after I heard argument on this application. A final hearing date for the tax appeal has not been fixed yet.</p>

In particular they would be helpful to the rebuttal of any case advanced by the husband if it differs from his case previously advanced before me. In other words, specifically, he wants to be able to use the transcripts and documents for the purposes of cross examining the husband especially if he seems to be presenting a case which is factually different to the one relied on by him now in his appeal. HMRC would especially like a sight of the report of the accountants instructed by the husband in the divorce proceedings which was directed to giving an opinion about this precise potential tax liability.</p>

I gave evidence during my divorce in private and was protected by the cloak of privilege and the parties&#8217; duty of confidentiality.  For that to be lifted now, with no justification, with no wrongdoing having been proven on my part by HMRC and without even a final assessment upon me would be entirely unfair.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;These proceedings were conducted in private. All first instance judgments, interlocutory and final, were handed down in private. The fact that leave was given for the final judgment to be reported in a non-anonymised form does not derogate from that fact. Nor do the two trips the parties made to the Court of Appeal. Although (i) the contents of the judgment are in the public domain and (ii) the proceedings in the Court of Appeal were conducted in open court, that does not mean that any of the evidence, submissions and unpublished judgments have lost their confidential nature. That much is clear from paragraph 105 of Thorpe LJ&#8217;s judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Clibbery v Allan </span>(supra). See also paragraph 76 of the judgment of Stanley Burnton LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Lykiardopulo </span>(supra) and paragraph 33 of the judgment of Thorpe LJ in the same case&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..the facts of the case fall well short of those in <span style="font-style:italic">R v R </span>(supra) and <span style="font-style:italic">A v A; B v B</span> (supra). While it may be appropriate for the court to exercise its jurisdiction in a very rare case to pass on to a third party highly personal information and documentation that has been produced under compulsion, this is patently not such a case. Indeed, absent a clear finding by the court of tax evasion it is hard to see when the sort of disclosure sought by HMRC would ever be an appropriate exercise of the court&#8217;s discretion&#8221;. </p>

False presentations by respondents in ancillary proceedings have two repercussions, both seriously contrary to the public interest: (a) either the judge remains deceived, in which the case the award is likely to be inaptly low, or he perceives the deception, whereupon he may draw necessarily broad inferences of hidden wealth which, depending on their scale, could make the award inaptly high or indeed leave it still inaptly low; and (b) applicants are seldom minded to compromise their claims on the basis of presentations which they believe to be materially false and their stance, if justified by the court&#8217;s findings, will often be upheld in relation to costs. Yet the family justice system depends upon the compromise of all but a few applications for ancillary relief.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;It is, however, relevant that the finding of tax evasion resulted from an inference drawn, albeit confidently, from the use of an off-shore company which, as if by magic, held the funds necessary for the purchase of the matrimonial home and from an absurd account of the company&#8217;s ownership given by the husband without (as it happens) any prior notice give to him in court of his privilege to remain silent against self-incrimination. The finding was therefore of the most general character. No document in any of the bundles and no line of transcript of any of the protracted oral evidence would establish evasion, save cumulatively and inferentially; still less would it help the Revenue to identify it with the necessary particularity. The solicitors&#8217; file to which I referred in judgment provided damning evidence that the husband was the effective purchaser of the home but did not represent direct evidence of tax evasion. It is also, in my view, relevant that the evasion took place at least 9 years ago and that, aware in November 1995 that I could release the material to the Revenue, I did not do so. I also feel reluctant to accede to an application for permission to trawl through every line of the proceedings which has been prompted by some private grudge and is made long after the case has been concluded, the substantial award to the wife has been met and the husband (who, I am told, has remarried and gone to live in South Africa) has reordered his affairs.&#8221;</p>

In order to achieve compliance with disclosure by the party under the obligation to do so, the party seeking the disclosure is required by the court only to use that information for the purposes of the proceedings. It is the protection provided by the court in cases of compulsion. Ancillary relief applications are appropriately heard in private in accordance with the 1991 Rules, see above. The public may not, without leave of the court, hear the evidence given in these applications. It would make a nonsense of the use of an implied undertaking if information about the means of a party, in some cases sensitive information, could be made public as soon as the substantive hearing commenced. Information disclosed under the compulsion of ancillary relief proceedings is, in my judgment, protected by the implied undertaking, before, during and after the proceedings are completed. Munby&#160;J, in his judgment, did not suggest to the contrary. He also pointed out that the 1926 Act (as amended in 1968) protects ancillary relief proceedings from press publication. This may be the case but we heard no argument on it.</p>

At the completion of that process the judge determines outcome applying the law to such facts as have been admitted or have been found proved. The determination of an ancillary relief application proceeds on a very different basis. First it is to be noted that litigants may not bring into the proceedings such material as they think fit. All parties are under a duty of full and frank disclosure, clearly recognised well before the advent of the statutory powers for equitable redistribution of assets on divorce. The duty was succinctly stated by Sachs&#160;J in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">JPC v JAF</span> reported at first instance in <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1955] P 228" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1955">[1955] P 228</ref> when he said:</p>

Whether that disclosure is by affidavit of facts, by affidavits of documents or by evidence on oath (not least when that evidence is led by those representing the husband) the obligation of the husband is to be full, frank and clear in that disclosure.</p>

Once the statutory duty is engaged by the issue of an application for relief under ss&#160;22A&#8211;24A then both parties are under the duty of full, frank and clear disclosure. A breach of that duty forces the court to draw inferences, inferences which will inevitably be adverse to the party in breach of the duty.

The scheme which the legislature enacted by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/23" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections&#160;23</ref>, 24 and 25 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> of 1973 was a scheme under which the court would be bound, before deciding whether to exercise its powers under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/23" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections&#160;23</ref> and 24, and, if so, in what manner to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including, inter alia, the particular matters specified in paragraphs&#160;(a) and (b) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section&#160;25(1)</ref>. It follows that, in proceedings in which parties invoke the exercise of the court&#8217;s powers under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/23" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections&#160;23</ref> and 24, they must provide the court with information about all the circumstances of the case, including, inter alia, the particular matters so specified. Unless they do so, directly or indirectly, and ensure that the information provided is correct, complete and up to date, the court is not equipped to exercise, and cannot therefore lawfully and properly exercise, its discretion in the manner ordained by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section&#160;25(1)</ref>.&#8217;</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.5in">&#8216;It may be thought desirable to express the duty as an implied undertaking to the court. But whether it is so expressed or not, it is in my judgment a duty that is owed to the court and which can be enforced by the court &#8230; Breach of the duty amounts to a contempt of court, which may be trivial or serious depending upon the circumstances. The court has the power wholly or partially to release the recipient from the duty, or undertaking, and to permit use to be made of the documents nevertheless.&#8217;</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Paraphrasing the law is always risky but I think the effect of it can be shortly stated thus. As a general rule documents and other evidence produced in ancillary relief proceedings (now called financial remedy proceedings) are not disclosable to third parties outside the proceedings save that exceptionally and rarely and for very good reason they can be disclosed with the leave of the court. The fact that the evidence may be relevant or useful is not by itself a good enough reason to undermine the rule.</p>
