	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> On 12 October 2019 the children&#8217;s father NY abducted his three children from England to Algeria. The children&#8217;s mother, PR started wardship proceedings in respect of them four days later and following hearings before other judges on 2 December 2019 the case came before me for the first time. Between December 2019 and March 2022 this court has been engaged in seeking to ensure the three children&#8217;s return from Algeria. For much of that period the parents have also engaged in fierce litigation in Algeria to which country the mother travelled in March 2020 and in which the mother has sought to regain custody of the children and to return with them to England. The father sought to retain the children in his custody. Eventually, in March of this year the mother returned to England with PY who is now 13 and DY who is now 7. Since their return, they have been living in a hostel; the family home, having been repossessed by the local authority during the mother&#8217;s absence in Algeria.  JY now 14 remains in Algeria, with the father. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In March I had set down a two-day hearing on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of June 2022 to consider the father&#8217;s application for a stay of the wardship proceedings on the basis of forum non-conveniens, as both of the parties and all of the children were at that time in Algeria and had been there for nearly 2 years. However, when the mother was able to return to England with the two youngest children, and having regard to the father&#8217;s position that he also (ideally) wished to return to England with JY I vacated the jurisdictional hearing and directed that it converted to a fact-finding enquiry into the mother&#8217;s allegations of domestic abuse which encompassed coercive and controlling behaviour, physical and emotional abuse of the mother and physical and emotional abuse of the children, including both the original abduction and subsequent allegations of re-abduction made by the mother against the father. Although some findings had already been reached in relation to the abduction and it seemed probable, whatever the findings, that PY and DY would remain with the mother in England and JY with the father in Algeria I concluded that the outcome of a fact finding was important both in terms of considering the nature of arrangements for the children in the future (including travel abroad) and in terms of their history and that 3 days was a proportionate and necessary use of court time.</p>

She rightly referred me to the Guidance of Macur LJ <span style="font-style:italic">Fact-finding hearings on domestic abuse and private law children proceedings guidance for Judges and Magistrates dated 5 May 2022, </span>and in particular paragraphs 13-15. These paragraphs highlight the principles of relevance, purpose and proportionality and in particular guidance that the court <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;only needs to determine allegations of such behaviour to the extent that it is relevant and necessary to determine issues as to a child&#8217;s future welfare.

At the outset of the hearing, I explored with the parties how best the court and the parties might direct their focus to ensure that the core of the allegations were addressed without going into the details of every particular incident.  As a result of that process, and bearing in mind the Court of Appeal&#8217;s recent guidance in Re H-N and K-v-K on the benefits of focusing on the nature of the relationship between the adults I indicated that focussing on the following was likely to achieve that goal;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to several of the discrete allegations of violence against the children in respect of which JY and PY could potentially have given evidence, and which had not been articulated in the statements until the mother&#8217;s full statement filed on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May I concluded it would be difficult to fully explore them given the very limited evidence from the children on them, in particular from JY. The children had been spoken to in October 2019 and had made some comments of relevance and PY had spoken to the Guardian more recently in which she had said both the mother and father had hit her. No party had sought to obtain more detailed statements from the children, no Re W analysis had been requested or undertaken and no party sought to question the Guardian on the children&#8217;s accounts of abuse so it seemed appropriate to focus primarily on the mothers allegations of the father&#8217;s behaviour to her with the abductions and the father&#8217;s behaviour to the children being a secondary focus.  I considered this to be appropriate, in part because the father&#8217;s emotional abuse of the children was established to a significant degree in any event by his abduction of the children in October 2019 and his repeated failures to return the children to the mother or to England. By the time this hearing commenced the father had been found to be in contempt of court by Morgan J on 7 counts spanning the period October 2019 to December 2020. Sentencing had been adjourned with Morgan J expressing the view that whether the father returned with JY for this hearing and prior to sentencing being likely to be a relevant factor. The father of course has not returned. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Over the course of the 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of June, I heard oral evidence from the mother and from the father. Neither called any supporting witnesses. No party suggested that any of the children should give evidence. On 16 June, the father was unable to join the CVP or teams to link as there was an Internet issue in Algeria connected with high school exams. I refused Ms Gartland&#8217;s application to adjourn the commencement of the hearing until the morning of 17 June. The father&#8217;s inability to participate remotely is a by-product of his refusal or failure to return to England; he has been stating he would return since at least October 2020. Most recently, Ms Justice Morgan found him to be in contempt of court in relation to failures to comply with orders to return the children to this jurisdiction, and she adjourned sentencing until after this hearing making reference to the fact that whether or not the father returned with JY would likely bear upon the sentence eventually imposed. The father continues to maintain that he cannot leave Algeria whilst there is litigation on going there because he fears that the mother will take advantage of his absence and create a forensic situation which will place him in difficulties if he were then to return to Algeria. That seems somewhat ironic given that his failures to return to England with the children over the previous two years have created a situation where he faces a sentence of imprisonment of up to 2 years for contempt of court and potential criminal proceedings; all of which probably would have gone away had he returned the children when first required so to do, or on one of the many subsequent occasions when he has been given the opportunity to do so. The mother has always made clear that she would not pursue the contempt proceedings were the children to be returned. Given that I was satisfied that the father could have returned to this jurisdiction had he wished to do so and that his reliance on Algerian forensic difficulties is really no more than a smokescreen to mask his refusal to return I directed that the hearing commence, even if that meant the father <marker name="tab"/> missing the mother&#8217;s oral evidence. Adjourning would in any event, have resulted in the hearing being vacated until late autumn given my availability. The father joined the hearing on 17 June and gave evidence on CVP, which for the most part worked satisfactorily.</p>

It is difficult therefore to separate the pattern from the specific events said to establish the pattern. In this case every one of the mother's allegations is denied by the father. The court cannot make findings about a pattern of behaviour without evaluating the evidence in relation to specific incidents that allegedly contributed to that pattern. The difficulty is in identifying a limited number of incidents that would, if proved, establish a pattern of behaviour. Some specific instances of behaviour will not constitute abuse themselves and may appear to be relatively trivial if looked at in isolation but are in fact important evidence of a pattern of abuse, or the effects of abuse, when set alongside other findings. For example, there is evidence in this case of the mother texting the father to ask if she can use the toilet in his bedroom. Arguably, she did so because she was conditioned by him to ask his permission to perform many of her activities of daily living. How does the court keep a finding of fact hearing within proportionate and manageable limits without filtering out what might be highly relevant evidence of coercion or control?</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I observe that whilst findings may not amount to coercive behaviour either because they do not constitute assault, threat, humiliation or intimidation or that they were not intended to harm punish or frighten the victim they may still be emotionally abusive and relevant to future decision making. Patterns of behaviour or acts of behaviour may not primarily be designed to make the victim subordinate or dependent and may thus not amount to controlling behaviour but may still amount to abuse and, even if not abuse, may amount to self-centred, dictatorial or unsupportive behaviour (not an exhaustive list) which may be relevant to answering the ultimate question of what is in the child&#8217;s welfare. One particular reason for avoiding criminal concepts in the family court is that it may tend to promote a focusing on the label attached to the behaviour and whether the criminal act has been proved, which self-evidently is inappropriate for a family court determining matters on the balance of probabilities but also may promote a binary approach to behaviour as being relevant if proved but irrelevant if not proved. Much behaviour may still be relevant in welfare terms even if it is not &#8216;criminal&#8217; or does not fall within the definition of &#8216;domestic abuse&#8217; because the family court is always looking at the substance of the behaviour and its impact on the child or other parent and what effect that has on the formulation of what order will best promote the child&#8217;s welfare. It is also important to note that in evaluating patterns of behaviour and their motivation one should seek to place any pattern identified within the overall context of the multitude of facets of behaviour which a relationship will consist of as this may assist in identifying the intention of the perpetrator, if any, in conducting that pattern. This may inform the determination of whether it might amount to coercive or controlling behaviour as being intended to have the effects required by the definition, whether it is unintentional but still amounts to abusive behaviour or whether seen in a holistic context it is perhaps simply a manifestation of, for instance, selfishness which does not amount to abuse.   </p>

A witness who has been found to be unreliable or dishonest is likely to find their evidence is given less weight than that of a witness who has been found to be generally reliable and honest. In cases where the court finds itself largely reliant on evidence emanating from only two individuals &#8211; as if often the reality in domestic abuse cases &#8211; the outcome may be heavily influenced by the fact that the court finds one party to be generally honest and/or reliable and the other dishonest and/or unreliable. Of course in reaching that conclusion as to credibility the court will be considering a wide canvas including the consistency of the accounts over time, the internal consistency or coherence of the evidence, consistency with other evidence documentary or otherwise, inherent probability as well as demeanour.   </p>

See the <span style="font-style:italic">Gestmin</span> case.  Evidence may be honestly and sincerely given but be false. The passage of time and the repeating of allegations in court and discussion outside court can undoubtedly result in memory creep. Inconsistency in accounts separated in time does not necessarily mean the accounts are not honestly given. Reliance on demeanour also requires some care; some witnesses are confident liars others are hesitant truth tellers. However, demeanour in a broader sense can still be of great assistance to a judge; the evidence of a witness who appears reflective, objective, self-critical, who confines themselves to the facts is likely to be given more weight than that of the witness who is argumentative, subjective, partial, dogmatic.

These reasons may well hold good in many cases, but most definitely not all.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have given 2 substantive judgments prior to this at times when the father was not fully engaged in the proceedings and one further judgment in December 2020 when he was. In December 2019 I gave a judgment ordering the return of the children from Algeria; the fact that they had lived all their lives in England, had been in the primary care of their mother prior to their abduction together with identified health issues concerning JY and DY made it abundantly clear that their welfare would best be served by returning to England and to the care of their mother. Indeed, both the father&#8217;s brothers who had sought to assist in communications and negotiations with the father in the preceding weeks supported this course. The father was well aware of the proceedings and his brothers in England had been trying to persuade him to engage with the proceedings and to return but were unsuccessful. Subsequent to that judgment the father filed an email and statement in which he set out the essence of his case.  However, he still did not participate in the proceedings. Although I was satisfied that he had been validly served and in July 2020 I gave a further judgment in which I concluded that the children had been habitually resident in England at the time the proceedings were commenced; the father&#8217;s evidence supported this conclusion as well as the mother&#8217;s and the independent evidence from schools and social services. Given the father&#8217;s non-engagement and the children&#8217;s presence in Algeria it was not possible to ascertain their wishes and feelings but I concluded on the basis of the evidence from social services, from the children&#8217;s schools and from the mother that the children had been settled and happy to be in the mother&#8217;s care. Given the father&#8217;s non-engagement I provided for children to return and to be placed in the care of the mother. Subsequently, the father instructed his solicitors and at a hearing on 16 October 2020 the father agreed to return the children; the quid pro quo being that the order directing that they were to live with the mother was suspended until a further hearing before me following their return. The plan provided for the father and children to return first and for the mother to return on the next available repatriations flight. The children did not return as expected; the father said that he did not board the plane with children because the mother was not on that flight and he feared that she would continue Algerian litigation to his disadvantage. At another hearing, further arrangements were made for the children to return, but by 18 December 2020 the father had still not returned them and no real explanation was offered (see paragraph 4 of my judgment of 18 December). I therefore lifted the suspension on the order providing for the children to live with their mother. Although I had written evidence from the father before me as well as updating evidence from the mother and although I heard submissions on behalf of the parties, prior to this tranche of the hearing I had not heard oral evidence from them.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As a result of the father&#8217;s failure to comply with the orders for the return of the children, the mother has long ago issued committal proceedings against the father. Those had been adjourned on several occasions and the mother had indicated that she would not pursue them were the father to return the children to the jurisdiction. However, as it became increasingly apparent that the likelihood of the father returning to the jurisdiction voluntarily was limited the committal proceedings were listed for determination before Mrs Justice Morgan. Over 3 days she heard evidence from the parents and at the conclusion she found the father to be in contempt of court on seven counts. I&#8217;ve not seen the transcript or a note of her judgment, but it is self-evident that she did not accept the father&#8217;s explanation for not returning the children and was satisfied to the criminal standard that the father had wilfully failed to comply with the orders.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother gave evidence first. The father was not in attendance during her evidence, and so participation directions which may have been necessary were not in practice needed when she gave her evidence. She was softly spoken, measured and calm in her evidence.  She appeared to have a good memory for dates and when recalling details of events appeared to do so spontaneously and consistent with the narrative being a lived experience rather than a script. In cross-examination she was not asked in much detail about the various allegations of assault, in part because of the approach I had outlined but I think also in part because the father&#8217;s overall position was one of complete denial of her allegations. As it turned out this was perhaps to the father&#8217;s advantage because when the mother did descend into detail in relation to allegations the detail appeared to have a ring of truth about it, to be consistent with earlier accounts and to be delivered with an emotional connection as when she described the first significant occasion of violence in 2005.  It did highlight one of the disadvantages of evidence in chief being limited to confirming the contents of a witness statement in particular where the response is general denial and cross-examination does not engage with the detail of an allegation because it is denied in its entirety. On the few occasions where she did describe alleged assaults in more detail as a result of cross-examination the descriptions were more compelling in their detail, the spontaneity of the narrative delivered and the apparent reliving of emotions than any written statement could convey. However of course the converse is also sometimes true where in the testing of the detail the allegation is shown to be exaggerated or fabricated. Her description of how JY accused her of sexual impropriety in February 2021 and her response to this was I thought compelling. In the main, the mother remained composed but there were times when she was either on the edge of tears or in tears, in particular when talking about her relationship with the children and how it had suffered during their separation. She was also tearful when she explained how guilty she had felt when she was unable to stand up to the father when he was disciplining the children and she went upstairs when he told her to. Throughout her evidence she was focused on the children and ensuring what was best for them. Rarely talking about herself she largely confined herself to providing facts rather than her opinions and was measured in the way she delivered her facts. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother was reflective and able to acknowledge aspects in which her own behavior might have fallen short. She accepted that she did tap PY and JY as a form of punishment and I wondered whether she was minimising this although it also seems probable that the mother has not influenced PY given what PY said. If she wanted PY to come onside &#8211; PY&#8217;s account might have been expected to be far more supportive of the mother than it was. The mother in general talked about trying to shield the children from the acrimony in the house and I think it likely she has shielded them on a day to day basis from her feelings about the father&#8217;s behaviour. This is in contrast to the father who has very clearly spoken to the children (although he denies it now) as he recounts in his statements how he quizzed them about the mother&#8217;s activities; this must have occurred in Algeria after the abduction and is the alternative explanation for the extent to which the children became hostile to and distant from their mother. It endures with JY &#8211; he only speaking of his mother as &#8220;IT&#8221;.  However, she also accepted that she had assaulted the father in front of the children when he was supposed to be handing the children over to her in January 2021, 2022 and did not. She was appropriately contrite about this and frankly accepted that she had lost her temper in the face of what she clearly perceived as the father having obstructed the handover such that she left only with DY, despite the fact that she had got an order from the Algerian courts requiring the father to hand over all three children to her. Notwithstanding her description of what the father had done to her she appeared able to also hold in her mind the possibility that there had been good in the father and good times in the marriage, and she was still able to accept the possible benefits to the children of having a relationship of some sort with their father. In the immediate aftermath of the separation, she had promoted contact and accepted that they missed him and loved him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Her description of her married life seemed genuine and rather sad. She described feeling lonely in the marriage and her life clearly revolved around caring for the children and the house. As it happened when the father went into the witness box her account seemed, if anything to be an understatement given the dreadful picture painted by the father of his attitude towards her, his endless criticisms, and belittling of her efforts. Her description of how she felt obliged to stay, both because of her vulnerability in immigration terms (she being a joint applicant with the father on his asylum application), and as the mother of young children without recourse to public funds in England and the cultural or religious ties which bound her to the husband all left her in a difficult position. In another, what I considered to be heartfelt comment, she said that despite the nature of the marriage and them leading largely separate lives with her being fearful that if she complained she would receive the Talaq, might be returned to Algeria and be separated from her children she did not want separate housing except towards the very end, because she thought she should stay with him for the children and that maybe he would change</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The principal issue identified by the father in terms of the mother&#8217;s credibility was of course in relation to the relationship with Alan and the very late disclosure of the fact that the mother had undergone a religious ceremony of marriage with him in January of this year. She had not referred to it in her statements, or in conversations with the Guardian and it emerged only in her evidence in chief. However, although she had not disclosed it, nor had she denied it. It therefore amounts to a suppression of potentially relevant information; it might potentially have been relevant to the circumstances of the separation (although until his most recent statement the father had not said he was aware of anything prior to 11/12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October) and certainly in terms of understanding for instance, the children&#8217;s attitude. Clearly the commencement of a new relationship might have some relevance to their attitude to the mother and the father. In the context of the father&#8217;s case that PY voluntarily left the mother&#8217;s care in February 2022 the fact that the mother may have undergone a religious ceremony of marriage shortly prior to that could be relevant. In her closing submissions Ms Gartland laid considerable weight on the issue of the impact of the marriage on the mother&#8217;s credibility suggesting it went to the heart of her credibility and to the case itself. She rightly identified the coincidence of the father believing that the mother was engaged in an adulterous affair with a named individual but her not at the time being in such a relationship with the mother belatedly accepting that she had now married that same named individual. That is a coincidence, which strains probability. It would potentially be of considerably more significance, had the father identified the relationship as having some involvement in the separation, but neither he nor the mother said it was an issue for either of them at that time. The father&#8217;s late change of evidence in relation to the timing of his alleged discovery made it potentially far more relevant although (for reasons set out elsewhere) I reject his evidence that it was a feature of his thinking at any time before he abducted the children to Algeria. In any event, if the mother&#8217;s non-disclosure of this information can be said to amount to dishonesty, is it of significance either in <span style="font-weight:bold">Lucas</span> terms or more generally in relation to the reliability of her evidence. It does not appear to me to satisfy the criteria for corroboration of any material fact. It might potentially be relevant to the father&#8217;s theory that the mother fabricated the evidence of his violence to her and the children in order to exclude him from the home and her life as part of a plan to pursue her relationship with Alan, but I am satisfied that the reason why it was not disclosed was not because she was seeking to cover up this plan, but rather because of the potential repercussions from the father and her family and the children of her confirming that in fact a relationship with Alan did exist; particularly given the precarious position the mother was in in Algeria at the time. Given that I accept the truth of her evidence in relation to how that relationship developed after she travelled to Algeria and following Alan&#8217;s support over a very difficult period of her life and that the marriage has not been consummated the reality is very different from the father&#8217;s suspicion. Although the non-disclosure of that marriage can be relied upon by Miss Gartland to question the mother&#8217;s true credibility, given my conclusions as to the reasons for its nondisclosure and my more general conclusions as to the mother&#8217;s overall credibility it is of relatively limited impact overall.</p>

She appears to be reliable in terms of the consistency of her recollection and how it matches other evidence; I considered that she was broadly doing her best to give an honest account of events over the course of the marriage and after the separation, and she was sincere and child-centered in her thinking and her actions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father's character came across fairly clearly in his evidence. He is very animated and very assertive in his demeanour. As Ms Gartland noted in support of her submissions as to his credibility he was polite to me and (since October 2020) had engaged with the court process.  In the main he was polite to counsel although he had a tendency to speak over counsel and occasionally me. This I think was not rudeness but rather is a product of the strength of his feelings and his assertiveness and his need both to be heard but also listened to.  He finds it difficult to rein himself in as his nature is excitable and spontaneous; the words spill out and he can become over-bearing and relentless finding it very difficult to maintain his composure or any degree of moderation. At times he seemed to be unable to restrain his words and the vehemence of his delivery. I have little difficulty imagining him at home compared to the relatively passive and moderate mother, being over-bearing and being capable of becoming angry when defied; the possibility of that continuing to develop into a loss of temper when stressed or frustrated is not hard to imagine.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Listening to his evidence was at times exhausting as he proceeded at such pace and intensity. I'm left in no doubt that if he is capable of expressing himself in that way within the environs of a court hearing with a judge and counsel who he at least notionally respects he would be much more intense, assertive, and animated in a domestic environment. The difference in the domestic environment, and in particular in his interactions with the mother is that he clearly has no respect for the mother at all, and he regards himself as having all the authority in their relationship. With those very significant contextual differences,  I'm left in no doubt that his way of expressing himself to the mother in the context of the home on an issue where he considered he had authority would convert to domineering, overbearing and potentially abusive attitudes. There were several occasions during the father's evidence where it felt as if he was very close to losing control he became so animated and in the confines of his home and in exchanges with the mother, one could well see how they could tip over into him losing his temper and potentially becoming verbally or physically abusive.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although Ms Gartland can place some weight on the submission that the court should give some credit to him for his engagement with the court and his respect to the court in giving his evidence that is significantly undermined by other matters relevant to his attitudes to the court. Although he maintained in his typically emphatic terms that he had complete respect for the court the unfortunate reality is that he has stoutly refused over a very prolonged period  to comply with court orders, has made agreements on several occasions in the face of the court, which he has subsequently backed out of and had consistently held out to the court a position of wishing and intending to return to England which he has never fulfilled. The inevitable inference which leads on from this is that in fact the father has no respect at all for the English court; he is both in contempt legally, but I think he also holds this court in contempt. One of his constant refrains was that the English court or system places no weight on the mother&#8217;s infidelity &#8211; (although, as I have concluded she has not committed adultery and is now divorced from the father he has no objective ground for complaint), and he gave the clear impression that not only is he in contempt of court, but he holds the court and the system in contempt because they are not aligned with his attitudes. That being so, his apparent engagement with the court and his politeness in court could be seen more as an attempt to manipulate the court rather than being respectful to it.  Given that the father is clearly an intelligent man it seems to me far more likely that the father&#8217;s position is one adopted deliberately and after some thought, rather than the product of distorted thinking, although that remains a possibility</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">His credibility generally is undermined by a host of issues. His being in contempt of court is perhaps the most obvious. If he is prepared to defy Court orders and to give evidence on oath, which is rejected by a contempt of court to the criminal standard, what else is he prepared to do to achieve his ends? His abduction of the children is of course potentially a criminal offence, but more importantly, a profoundly harmful act in terms of the children&#8217;s welfare; dislocating them from their familiar lives and separating them from their primary carer. All done to feed the father&#8217;s needs and to satisfy his need to be in charge regardless of the cost to his children or the mother or indeed his family and to some extent his own objective interests in being able to remain in England. That objectively his actions have been so contrary to his own interests illustrates how subjective his thinking has become, all focussed on satisfying his need to justify his actions and to maintain his position of authority with the children. That of course has implications for the reliability, honesty and sincerity of his evidence.</p>

The father is absolutely convinced of the rightfulness of the positions he adopts. He expresses himself in absolute terms, his statements are absolutely 100% correct. Even if they directly contradict each other. He absolutely 100% wouldn't hit his children, hasn't hit his wife and they are absolutely 100% lies. I don't think this is just a figure of speech. It actually reflects the intensity with which the father believes his positions. The father is right and the mother is wrong.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his first statement he had said he discovered the mother&#8217;s alleged adultery with Alan and her online sexual activities the day before he took the children to Algeria ; between the 11th and 12th of October. In his most recent statement, he said that it was in early September when he became aware of the mother&#8217;s infidelities. Given that he had said in respect of each of those statements that they were 100% true, and yet they were flatly contradictory of each other, relating to an absolutely critical period of time clearly at least one of them was at best a mistake or at worst a lie. As he opted to prefer the early September date the issue then arose of whether he had confronted the mother at any stage with this or not, and given his obvious strength of feeling on the issue it was difficult to envisage how he could not have raised it with the mother, if he had been aware of it. His character is excitable, passionate, spontaneous, and he is very sensitive about his position, his pride, his rights and them being respected. His initial response when asked whether he had raised it with the mother at any stage was to say that he had been investigating and seeking to establish what the position was. Given his investigations appeared to be no more than looking at the Facebook account, which he says was the source of the  information and speaking to the children, which he initially says occurred between the 11th and 12th of  October  it was hard to understand what investigating he had been doing. When pressed further, he alleged that he had spoken to the mother about it on the telephone after he had removed the children.  The clear impression that I got of his evidence in this regard was that he was improvising on the hoof when he realised that his evidence was that he had never mentioned the adultery to the mother before he left and that the separation according to both his account and the mothers had taken placed after he said he had discovered the adultery and yet it was on neither his account or the mothers a feature of the separation. He was clearly not simply mistaken in his recollection but was being dishonest about the circumstances in which &#8216;adultery&#8217; became a feature of the case. Of course the significance of the issue of adultery goes to the justification the father offered to the Algerian courts (and later to this court) for the abduction. I suspect that the adultery is also the justification the father has used in his own mind to persuade himself of the rightness of his actions.  His capacity for unreliable evidence was frequently illustrated; another example was his confident assertion that he had not returned to England in November 2020 because the mother had not been on the flight as arranged. But the court order specifically provided for him to return first; specifically arranged to avoid the mother returning and the father then remaining in Algeria. His evidence about why JY had now allegedly gone to XXX was littered with inconsistencies and changes of tack. On occasion he said he did most of the care for the children, but he also said he was only with them 3 hours a day and in any event if he was doing most of it why was the house so poorly kept, the children so poorly cared for? These inconsistencies were lost on the father. The father said he refused to give the Talaq when the mother asked because &#8220;she gave no reason&#8221;, having moments before said the marriage was intolerable. It was clear he was to be the one who decided when the Talaq was to be delivered not the mother. On the one hand he said PY came into his care in XXX, a moment later he went to XXX and collected her from a bus-stop. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Another obvious example of a lie is to be found in the father's application to the Algerian courts. He gave in effect two reasons for having brought the children to Algeria. Firstly, was removing the children from exposure to the consequences of the mother's infidelity and secondly, the family had long been planning on relocating permanently to Algeria and the mother had belatedly refused to go ahead with. In his evidence, he said that at the last minute she refused to go ahead with it. However, in none of his recent evidence, whether written or oral, did he make any reference to this alleged plan to relocate and it was only when at the conclusion of his evidence I raised the topic that he said  anything at all about it. When pressed, (relatively gently) he said that there had been no discussion with the children, no plans made with the schools, his employers, housing or in any other way, leaving it as an oral agreement between he and the mother which had not been subject to any degree of implementation. This of course was not the impression given in the documents filed with the Algerian court, or indeed his first statement with this court. Given how long he and the mother had fought to remain in England, remaining here as illegal over stayers for a period of time and given that they had obtained work, housing, healthcare and the children were settled in school the suggestion that they were agreed that they would relocate to Algeria seemed an extraordinary one. In any event, there was not a scintilla of evidence to support the father's assertion. The mother did not accept it. There was nothing from the children at any stage which remotely suggested that they had understood that the family was to relocate to Algeria. The father&#8217;s brothers in late 2019 were plainly unaware of any such suggestion they both having been in the process of helping the father to secure a 1 year tenancy on another property and pressing for the children&#8217;s return. I am satisfied that there is no foundation at all to the father's assertion that he and the mother had planned to relocate the family permanently to Algeria, which the mother had backed out of at the last minute. The most likely explanation for this story is that it was an after the event fabrication used to provide justification for the father having brought the children to Algeria. If there was a plan which the mother had frustrated the father was after all only implementing what had previously been agreed. That was the position he put to the Algerian court and, to some degree to me following the filing of the father's evidence in early 2020. I reject that evidence. The fact is that this was a frank lie to the Algerian Court and to this court, put forward by the father to justify his abduction of the children. It seems not only to have a significant impact on his credibility generally but also to further undermine his evidence of the other limb that the father relied on in the Algerian courts to justify his abduction of the children.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Other than the examples of dishonesty the father&#8217;s evidence was inconsistent and contradictory in many areas. His reasons for removing the children tended to vary as his evidence went along. At one time he would say it was to protect the children from their mother&#8217;s infidelities and sexualised behaviours. On another occasion he would say it was because he was surrounded by solicitors by the council and that he had no choice but to leave as he lost his job, his house and his children in one day - all of which of course were untrue. However, they were all relevant to his feeling he was, not in control of the situation, which is something he plainly was accustomed to be.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although the father says he accepts that removing the children was wrong he swiftly minimised his responsibility by saying what he did was less harmful than the mother&#8217;s adultery and that he had to remove them from that harmful situation. In reality, he demonstrated no real acceptance of the impact of his actions on the children or any real acceptance that what he had done was wrong. I was left with the impression that he considered it within his rights as their father and as the mother&#8217;s husband to have done this because he considered it was the right thing to do because his position as head of the household had been disrespected by the mother in her asking him to leave and saying that she wanted a divorce. There is no genuine acceptance of him doing anything wrong; I doubt from listening to the father over the course of several hours whether he is capable of genuine reflection on any matter we are concerned with. His pride and arrogance and his contempt for the mother combine to enable him to satisfy himself that all he did was right and proper in pursuit of his rights and status and that all blame for what has occurred falls squarely on the mother&#8217;s shoulders. When asked how the mother might have felt about something his answer focused on how he felt and to blame her. The father said he is pursuing a criminal complaint in Algeria because &#8220;she broke and destroyed the family&#8221; The irony of this assertion was absolutely lost on the father; his arrogance and self-righteousness know absolutely no objective bounds. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> However, they do explain his attitude to the mother as a wife and mother which was shocking to listen to. Whilst I&#8217;m prepared to accept that his views have developed in the years since the separation and as his hostility to the mother has grown as she has fought back against the abduction of the children, his lack of respect for her as the mother of his children and his criticism of her was hard to listen to. His criticism of her was essentially unbounded and permeated all she did. He demonstrated no empathy or compassion for her even when she might have been struggling with young children in difficult conditions. Rather he considered what did she have to complain about?  He identified no redeeming features or qualities in the mother.  She was effectively useless and it was his role as her husband and father of the children to pull her up for her deficiencies, to advise her on how to do better and to admonish or discipline her to encourage her to perform better. The mother says that the father was verbally abusive to her, calling her a dog and a bitch and being critical of her family. Curiously one of the father&#8217;s frequent complaints was that the mother was slovenly in her housekeeping and so the reference to a dog or a bitch in that context could be a natural extension of this criticism. The father denies ever using abusive language in any context. However, his all-pervasive criticism of every aspect of the mother's care for the house, for the children and for him was not something that he seemed to recognise as amounting to abuse in any way at all. He regarded it as his right and duty as a husband to criticise the mother&#8217;s domestic skills and to correct her where she fell below the standards he set for her if she did not mend her ways. It was certainly not in his contemplation, despite being at home with the mother and children prior to 2015, that he should contribute to the care of the children or the house even if the mother was struggling.  He regarded it as entirely appropriate to respond by giving her the silent treatment or on two occasions to announce the Talaq in order to get her to pull her socks up. Whilst his evidence may have been given in concentrated form in the court arena and this may have sounded more offensive than it might have had it been given in more diluted form separated over hours, days, months and years the inescapable fact is that the father had little, if any, respect for the mother at the time and by his own account. Her status was, not one of a respected equal in a partnership raising their children, but was more akin to a domestic servant, there to care for the children, care for the house and to meet the father's needs. In that context, it is easier to understand the father's lack of remorse in terms of the impact of the abduction on the mother; if a person is not worthy of respect why would one regret doing something which upsets them? It is of course not a giant leap of attitude from contempt for a person to other behaviours which are more overtly abusive; name-calling, shouted insults, throwing of items to pushing to hitting to strangling. A continuum of abuse on which, by the father&#8217;s own evidence, he places himself well along. </p>

The weight to be attributed to his evidence is limited in any comparison with the mother&#8217;s and save where there are rare aspects of evidence which corroborate his account I prefer the mother&#8217;s evidence. </p>

Ultimately the court is not undertaking a compartmentalised assessment of individual facts but the court is standing back and undertaking a broad panoramic survey of the totality of the landscape before it. Some of that landscape may be in shadow, some may be clearly and abundantly lit, some may be obscured by the mist of forensic uncertainty but can the court discern a clear picture on the balance of probabilities of the relationship between the parties informing and informed by individual incidents? In this case the answer is unhesitatingly yes. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My evaluation of their evidence and of them as witnesses of course, brings into account the content of their evidence and how that marries up with other aspects of the evidence that is available to the court. There is some limited evidence from the schools, the police and social services generated in or before 2019. The father submits that the absence of any reference in any of the material prior to 24 September 2019 to domestic abuse undermines the mother&#8217;s case. Why, he asks rhetorically, if the marriage was so bad and he was so violent did the mother not report it? Was it only reported later in pursuit of the mother&#8217;s plan to replace the father with Alan? It is true that the limited contemporaneous documents from health visitors do not record anything negative about the father. However, it is well established that many victims of domestic abuse feel unable to disclose such abuse for a considerable period of time if they are ever able to. The more vulnerable the alleged victim, the harder it may be for them to approach the authorities. In this case, the mother was from a traditional Muslim background, for a long period of time her immigration status was that of an over stayer, she was financially dependent on the father. She is plainly in a category of alleged victim that would find it difficult to report abuse.</p>

Although there may also have been happier times and although the concentration in the forensic process on the negatives tends to magnify those aspects and to minimise the more positive aspects I&#8217;m satisfied on the balance of probabilities, that this was properly characterised as a domestically abusive relationship in which the father was both controlling of the mother in his criticism and discipline, and that he acted coercively to punish and frighten the mother, in particular by pronouncing the Talaq but also by his other behaviours.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother&#8217;s description of the violence used by the father is, I&#8217;m satisfied broadly accurate, and that on a significant number of occasions the father&#8217;s displeasure at the mother&#8217;s perceived failings progressed to anger, verbal abuse, and physical assaults. The father&#8217;s inability to contain himself and his strength of feeling over issues supports that conclusion and his lack of insight into the impact of his behaviours on anybody save himself support the conclusion that these incidents of violence would have occurred regardless of whether the mother was heavily pregnant and regardless of whether the children were in sight. I therefore accept the core of the mother&#8217;s case, both of coercive and controlling behaviour and of physical and emotional abuse. Controlling and coercive behaviour do not necessarily mean that every aspect of a victim&#8217;s life is controlled by the abuser and in this case it is clear that the mother did have some degree of financial control in that she received child benefit and had some access to the father&#8217;s finances. The father paying the mother a significant sum of money supports her case that it was some sort of recompense for the second Talaq, but it also illustrates that she did have access to finances, which were not entirely within the father&#8217;s control. Having said that, it is equally clear that the mother would have been cautious as to how she deployed funds at as she must have been in so many other ways around the father given that she knew that many aspects of her conduct would be the target of the father&#8217;s irritation, anger, criticism or punishment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However love has many facets; it is not one-dimensional. Love does not act to exclude negative feelings or actions. One can both love in some respects, but also dislike or hate. People who love others are very often those who cause them the greatest harm. The father has caused his children significant harm by abducting them; yet he loves them.  The children were reluctant to talk to social workers in 2019; this may have been a result of loyalty to their father-I have little doubt that the father made clear he expected their obedience and support. However, the clear message which emerges from what the children did say to social services was that their father hits them. Yes, the mother may have hit them as well. The extent to which JY has become alienated from his mother (and I use the expression advisedly) demonstrates beyond any real doubt the extent to which the father imposes his views on his children. Prior to their abduction all of the children appear to have had a warm and positive relationship with their mother. With JY it has been fractured, if not completely destroyed. Who knows whether beneath the veneer of contempt that he now holds his mother in lies a deeper and more nuanced set of feelings for her. Buried deep they may be, but I think it likely, given his age that they still exist. At present, however, they must be kept very firmly locked away. The father cannot hold any positive thought about the mother in his mind, and I have little doubt that any expression of anything positive about the mother would meet with dismissal, if not more.</p>

Given that I am satisfied that the mother is in general terms a reliable historian and given that the father&#8217;s own evidence supports the conclusion that he has treated the mother in a most abusive way during their relationship, that he has abducted the children giving no thought to the consequences for them in terms of harm but only thinking about his own pride and desire to punish the mother, it is not a difficult conclusion to reach on the balance of probabilities that he behaved abusively to his children both in terms of the indirect impact on them of his abuse of the mother but also more directly in the form of excessive chastisement whether by physical assaults or by harsh punishments such as the use of chilli. </p>

Further thought will have to be given to that. JY is an innocent in this as much as PY, DY and the mother. The father bears sole responsibility for the destruction wrought on this family over the last 3 years and indeed long before that. It is hard to know the extent to which cultural, religious, psychological and environmental factors have shaped the father down the years and some of his behaviours may be a product of deep lying issues but their ultimate expression has been abusive of the mother and the children; those he ought to have held dearest and protected the most are those he has harmed the most.
