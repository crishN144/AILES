Her friendly and agreeable manner and her willingness to agree to any suggestion that is put to her could give a superficial impression that she understands and approves. However, during my assessment she demonstrated no ability to understand and remember what her assets are, what her care and general living needs might be and how they might be met, and she had no concept of the absolute value of money. She is not able to understand how the Court of Protection and her niece could operate on her behalf and in her best interests. Because of her delusional ideas (for example, that David Cameron has proposed marriage to her), her inability to understand the actions of others (for example, fellow patients who stole from her or induced her to pay more than the real value of items) and her extreme suggestibility (I believe that I could have induced her to make over all her assets to me in return for helping her to meet with a celebrity), I consider that A is extremely vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.</span></p>

As a consequence of this impairment A is unable to understand, retain and use information relevant to decision-making concerning her property and affairs. I also do not consider that she has capacity to make a valid will since she is unable to recall the assets that comprise her estate, to appreciate the claims of those who might reasonably expect to benefit from her testamentary bounty, and is vulnerable both to extreme suggestibility and to the effects of insane delusions upon dispositions that she might make.&#8221;</span></p>
