Mr Warshaw QC, appearing with Ms Proudman for W, responded that if only H had taken that view the matter could have been dealt with in half a day before a district judge.  Whilst that time estimate might have been optimistic, it illustrated how this litigation has lost focus.</p>

She says that her primary reason was H&#8217;s intolerable behaviour and that her daughter&#8217;s unhappiness in her new school was only a secondary motive.  She could not move back into her former home because that had been rented out.  Her middle two children remained living with H in his home and attending school locally.  The parties continued to spend weekends together, normally at H&#8217;s home, and during the school holidays W returned to his home.

There was no satisfactory explanation for this development.  Nevertheless, it seemed to me that H was not unduly prejudiced if he could hear but not see W and I particularly bore in mind that if this had been an in-person hearing, W would in all probability have been screened from H.  I therefore acceded to W&#8217;s request that H be not permitted to visually observe her evidence.

Just a few days before the final hearing began, W served a long statement from the witness containing a whole raft of new allegations.  I refused to admit that statement or to allow evidence to be given of its contents as it was thoroughly unfair to H as he had been deprived of the opportunity to call evidence in reply.  I gave W the opportunity of applying to adjourn that part of the evidence if she so wished, but no such application was made.  Accordingly, the evidence of that witness was confined to those matters which had been raised in W&#8217;s section 25 statement in November 2021.</p>

The main challenge in the assessment that she was asked to do, namely to cast light on W&#8217;s state of mind when the PNA was signed, was the lack of information.  Working with one party alone, and she never spoke to H, made her reliant on that party&#8217;s account.  Her assessment of W was carried out on the basis that everything that W said was correct.  It is for me as judge to determine whether in fact her account is accurate.  </p>

H&#8217;s argument that it put W into a far better position than she had been before the parties were married is valid but only insofar as it goes.  True it is that W having signed the agreement had the benefit of (a) her main property with its mortgage of &#163;83,000 paid off and (b) the small home that she purchased in 2013 mortgage free when H had discharged the mortgage of &#163;53,000.  That meant that she had a rental income from that property of some &#163;7,000pa gross of expenses and tax which she had not had before.</p>

Once her working days were over, W would have been left with her rental income, her state pension and a pension from employment of some &#163;6,000pa net.  This was not an adequate provision for someone who had been for the best part of 8 years (summer 2012-March 2020) the wife of a relatively prosperous professional person and did not enable her to meet her needs at much more than a near-subsistence level.</p>

This may be of particular significance in applications for variation orders and interim variation orders or other cases where there is a risk of the costs becoming disproportionate to the amounts in dispute. The court will take a broad view of conduct for the purposes of this rule and will generally conclude that to refuse openly to negotiate reasonably and responsibly will amount to conduct in respect of which the court will consider making an order for costs. This includes in a &#8216;needs&#8217; case where the applicant litigates unreasonably resulting in the costs incurred by each party becoming disproportionate to the award made by the court. Where an order for costs is made at an interim stage the court will not usually allow any resulting liability to be reckoned as a debt in the computation of the assets. </span></p>
