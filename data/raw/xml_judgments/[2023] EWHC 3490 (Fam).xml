There is a dispute about the extent to which the mother was living with the father at that point, or whether she was living with her parents in the West Midlands. However, it is common ground that she spent much of her time during the last few months of her first pregnancy with her parents. A was born in December 2009. The father says that thereafter he, the mother and A lived together as a family in London. The mother says that she spent most of her time with her parents. In any event, the father undertook a master&#8217;s degree at the London University and the mother became pregnant again and J was born early in 2012. Again, the mother spent the later stages of her pregnancy and the first few months of J&#8217;s life with her parents.</span></p>

Ms Hamade considered that relocation might be addressed under 8/2022 Articles 35 and 36, and she emphasised that provisions of the new laws were intended to cater for expatriate residents in Abu Dhabi and were therefore not intended to result in the application of Sharia law. She referred to foreign lawyers, from the United States and United Kingdom, being engaged as case managers but recognised that there were, as yet, no foreign judges, or indeed non-Islamic judges, appointed to the Abu Dhabi Family Court. Given the novelty of this jurisdiction, she was not yet aware of any relocation decisions that had been made after a contested hearing.</span></p>

There have been no relevant published decisions under the new law as yet and it is an area of law in practice that will have to be developed by the Abu Dhabi court.

Although he made repeated references in his evidence to wanting to have discussions and negotiations with the mother, I was left with the impression that these discussions were to be with the view to converting her to his point of view, rather than seeking to find any middle common ground. I also found his explanation as to his behaviour in relation to his job, the family home and property and finances more generally to be unconvincing and I am concerned that he may have sought to use the disparity in their respective financial positions to apply pressure to the mother.

If such a case is promptly brought to the attention of a court in this country, the judge may feel that it is in the best interests of the infant that these disturbing factors should be eliminated from his life as speedily as possible. A full investigation of the merits of the case in an English court may be incompatible with achieving this. The judge may well be persuaded that it would be better for the child that those merits should be investigated in a court in his native country than that he should spend in this country the period which must necessarily elapse before all the evidence can be assembled for adjudication here. Anyone who has had experience of the exercise of this delicate jurisdiction knows what complications can result from a child developing roots in new soil, and what conflicts this can occasion in the child&#8217;s own life. Such roots can grow rapidly. An order that the child should be returned forthwith to the country from which he has been removed in the expectation that any dispute about his custody will be satisfactorily resolved in the courts of that country may well be regarded as being in the best interests of the child."</p>

The absence of a relocation jurisdiction must do more than give the judge pause &#8230; it may be a decisive factor. On the other hand, if it appears that the mother would not be able to make a good case for relocation, that factor might not be decisive.

When coupled with attempts to put all the UK properties on the market at once, this is a matter that causes me significant concern. Whilst I recognise that the father is now seeking to take a more constructive approach to finances, it seems to me that his actions in this regard have contributed greatly to the instability that the children would now face if I were to order a return.</span></p>

They will be returning to their former school but in many other ways their lives will have changed significantly from the life that they were living up until December last year. So far as the return to school is concerned, I note from the father&#8217;s second witness statement that the UAE did not resume &#8220;in person&#8221; lessons until the second half, or indeed the third quarter, of 2022.

When asked by Ms Renton if she intended to return with the children if I made an order for their return, she came close to tears and had to take some time to compose herself. I have not the slightest doubt that this was a wholly genuine reaction on her part and although she would accompany the children in those circumstances, she would find this an upsetting and difficult step to take. The mother has not filed psychiatric evidence of any condition and I am not asked to find that this is such an extreme case. Nonetheless, I consider I am entitled to take into account, in my overall assessment of the children&#8217;s welfare, the likely effect on the children&#8217;s primary carer and it seems to me self-evident from the mother&#8217;s reaction that she will find a return to the UAE and to Abu Dhabi very difficult.</span></p>

Nonetheless, I note that it has been possible for the father to maintain contact with the children here, both through regular video contact and indeed through trips as well and if the father gets a job soon (as he suggests that he will), then he will be likely to have access to funds to continue to visit the children in this country; although I accept that would not be of the frequency of every six weeks suggested at one point by Mr Gration in cross-examination.</span></p>

Nonetheless, the evidence from both experts is that this is untested and there is some uncertainty as to how it will operate in practice, in particular where relocation is opposed by one parent. To the extent I need to do so, I prefer Ms Hamade&#8217;s evidence as to how the Abu Dhabi court would be likely to fill in the blanks, as it were, as to how its best interests jurisdiction should operate. I prefer her approach as she is a practitioner with day to day experience of the Abu Dhabi courts while Mr Awad is primarily a US academic.</span></p>
