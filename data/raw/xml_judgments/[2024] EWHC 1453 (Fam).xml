The children are both boys: G aged 13 and H aged 7. The applicant is the children&#8217;s father (&#8220;the father&#8221;), the respondent is their mother (&#8220;the mother&#8221;). She opposes the application. Both parties are Ghanian nationals. They married in Ghana in 2009. The children were born there. The parties separated in 2016 when the mother was pregnant with H. By a series of court orders in Ghana, by the beginning of 2023 the child arrangements were that G and H would live with the mother but spend alternate weekends and half of the school vacations with the father provided that his work commitments allowed him to be available to look after them. The most recent Ghanaian child arrangements court order was made in October 2020. The court ordered that the children should remain in their then current schools and that there should be no change of school by a parent without the consent of the other.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother works in the finance sector and had a well-paid job in Ghana. After the separation, she and the children lived with the maternal grandparents who would look after the children when the mother travelled abroad on business. In 2022 the mother was given the opportunity to take a significant role with her company in England. She wished to take that opportunity and to relocate with the children to England. The mother and children had previously visited England and had always returned to Ghana without incident. In February 2023, unaware of the mother&#8217;s plans to relocate with the children to England, the father again consented to the mother taking the children to England for a short visit, returning on 1 March 2023. The mother did not return the children as agreed. She enrolled them in fee-paying schools in England and informed the father that they would be staying.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father made an application in the Ghanaian court for an order for return of the children but it appears that the Ghanaian court decided that it did not have jurisdiction so to order. The mother obtained legal advice from a Ghanaian lawyer about the father&#8217;s application for return, which advice she has chosen to disclose in these proceedings. The father also appears to have applied to enforce the existing child arrangements orders by way of the mother&#8217;s committal. He was advised that enforcement would be difficult given that the mother was living in England. Then, on 24 January 2024, the father made the application in this jurisdiction with which this court is concerned. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother has made allegations of domestic abuse against the father which he denies. At the pre-trial review on 30 April 2024 Hayden J refused to order a finding of fact hearing as the mother had requested. That decision was made after the receipt of the welfare report. Following further evidence from the father in response to evidence from the mother for which Hayden J gave permission, the mother renewed her application for a finding of fact hearing at the outset of the hearing before me. I refused the application and said that I would give my full reasons in this judgment. My reasons are:</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">I have regard to the guidance within FPR PD12J, and within the Court of Appeal decisions of <span style="font-style:italic">Re H-N</span> [2021] EWCA Civ 478 and <span style="font-style:italic">K v K</span> [2022] EWCA Civ 468, and within the <span style="font-style:italic">Fact Finding Hearings and Domestic Abuse in Private Law Children Proceedings &#8211; Guidance for Judges and Magistrates</span>, from Macur LJ dated 5 May 2022, all of which are pertinent to the present case. They indicate that the court should consider the relevance of the allegations to the issues the court has to determine, and the necessity and proportionality of holding a finding of fact hearing. The parties have been separated since 2016. They have worked with child arrangement orders which have been made, sometimes by agreement of the parties, by the Ghanaian courts. The issue for this court is whether the children should be returned to Ghana not whether they should live with the father or spend more or less time with him. On her own case the mother came to England, bringing the children with her, because of a work opportunity, not because of the alleged abuse. The court can take into account her allegations, and the father&#8217;s denials, without making specific findings of fact about the allegations. The bulk of the allegations concern events which occurred several years ago, some even before the marriage in 2009. The allegations are of limited relevance to the issues this court has to determine which concern the children&#8217;s welfare and a separate finding of fact hearing is not necessary in order for the court to make its determinations.</p>

Delay is generally against the best interests of the children who are the subject of proceedings. In this case the children have had the uncertainty of whether they will remain in England or return to Ghana hanging over them for months. It is in their best interests for the decision on their father&#8217;s application to be made rather than to be put off to a date in the future which might be several weeks, even several months away.</p>

At the beginning of the hearing before me I asked her Counsel what the mother&#8217;s position was. I was told that she would stay in England if the children were returned. I decided that it was necessary to hear oral evidence from the mother on this particular issue. It is an issue of considerable importance, it had not been addressed in written evidence, and Mr Basi on behalf of the father, did not accept that the mother would not return with the children and wished to challenge her on that assertion made through her Counsel.

The mother refers to communication from a pastor that appears to confirm that the father accepted abusive behaviour within the marriage (but there is no evidence of an acceptance of abuse to the extent alleged by the mother). The father denies the allegations of domestic abuse before or during the marriage or after separation. He refers to police documentation showing that the mother made but did not then pursue allegations of abuse against him, for example in March 2015. He says that he has had to make repeated applications in the courts in Ghana to secure his relationship with his sons. He says the mother changed G&#8217;s school a number of times which was against his best interests and that he, the father, had to secure an injunction to prevent the mother from doing so again. In fact, the relevant Ghanaian court order prevents either parent from changing the children&#8217;s schools without the consent of the other. This order was in force when the mother relocated the children to England and enrolled them in schools here without the father&#8217;s consent. The relevant order in Ghana records four different schools in a three year period for G.</p>

No such recording appears on the other child arrangements orders. By inference these orders were not by consent, but I cannot be certain of that.

It is said on behalf of the mother that the fact that Ghanaian court orders have been made by consent is evidence that the mother has submitted to the will of the father but (i) the orders regarding contact after the initial agreed order in 2016 are not recorded as having been by consent, (ii) the father denies that they were by consent, and (iii) the parties have had legal representation at the hearings so that, even if the orders have been made by consent, that would be equally consistent with the mother being content that the children were safe in the father&#8217;s care.</p>

She advises the mother that an application may be made to the Ghanaian court for permission to vary the child arrangements orders to allow the mother to relocate the children to England. Indeed the advice seems to be that the Ghanaian court would be likely to find that it would be in the best interests of the children to remain in England with the mother. It is clear from the advice that the Ghanaian court would take a view of all the circumstances and make decisions that accord with the best interests of the children. This advice and the Ghanaian court orders show that the mother has access to the courts in Ghana and can afford legal advice and representation in that jurisdiction.</p>

There is no other evidence available to me on that issue &#8211; I only have what the mother told me orally at the hearing. When questioned at court, the mother initially said that she did not know where the children would live in Ghana if they returned without her but, when pressed, she accepted that they had previously lived with her parents. That is where the children would go but she said that her parents were old and she could not leave the boys with them in the long term. The mother is paying approximately &#163;40,000 a year in school fees for the boys.

A child may be deeply unhappy about being recruited to one side in a parental battle.

It would be wrong to say that the future of every child who is within the jurisdiction of our courts should be decided according to a conception of child welfare which exactly corresponds to that which is current here. In a world which values difference, one culture is not inevitably to be preferred to another &#8230; Once upon a time, it may have been assumed that there was only one way of bringing up children. Nowadays we know that there are many routes to a healthy and well adjusted adulthood. We are not so arrogant as to think that we know best.";</p>

		      <content>
			<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">"In a case where the choice lies between deciding the question here or deciding it in a foreign country, differences between the legal systems cannot be irrelevant. But their relevance will depend upon the facts of the individual case. If there is a genuine issue between the parents as to whether it is in the best interests of the child to live in this country or elsewhere, it must be relevant whether that issue is capable of being tried in the courts of the country to which he is to be returned. If those courts have no choice but to do as the father wishes, so that the mother cannot ask them to decide, with an open mind, whether the child will be better off living here or there, then our courts must ask themselves whether it will be in the interests of the child to enable that dispute to be heard. The absence of a relocation jurisdiction must do more than give the judge pause (as Hughes J put it in this case); it may be a decisive factor. On the other hand, if it appears that the mother would not be able to make a good case for relocation, that factor might not be decisive. There are also bound to be many cases where the connection of the child and all the family with the other country is so strong that any difference between the legal systems here and there should carry little weight."</p>

			<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">She returned to the relevance of differences in the respective legal systems under the heading of "Human Rights". She first noted, at [42], that "the unchallenged evidence before the trial judge was that the law in Saudi Arabia treats fathers and mothers differently and in significant respects the mother is in a less favourable position than the father". Interestingly, given her decision that the principles of the 1980 Convention did not apply, she considered, at [43]-[45], the potential relevance of article 20 which is not incorporated into our domestic law but which provides:</p>

		    <level>
		      <content>
			<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">She noted that the "importance of article 20 is that it asks whether what might happen in the foreign country would be permitted under those fundamental principles were it to happen here". Were it "incorporated, we would be entitled, though not obliged, to decline to return a child on that ground alone".</p>

			<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">"If we were, therefore, to be applying the spirit of the Hague Convention in a non-Convention case, there would be no reason not to apply the whole of the Hague Convention, including article 20. Any discrimination in the foreign country which was contrary to article 14 of the Convention on Human Rights would allow, but not require, the court to refuse to return the child. This consideration serves to reinforce the view that the legal system in the foreign country cannot be irrelevant to the issue of summary return."</p>

		      <content>
			<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">I would also emphasise that Baroness Hale was, equally clearly, not suggesting that there would not be cases in which the effect on the parent and/or the children caused by differences in legal systems, including the approach to welfare, would be sufficiently contrary to the children's welfare that a summary return order should not be made and, indeed, a return order should not be made after a full welfare inquiry. The impact on the welfare outcome would depend on the weight properly to be accorded to this factor in the circumstances of the particular case.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">p.264F: "To take a child from his native land, to remove him to another country where, maybe, his native tongue is not spoken, to divorce him from the social customs and contacts to which he has been accustomed, to interrupt his education in his native land and subject him to a foreign system of education, are all acts (offered here as examples and of course not as a complete catalogue of possible relevant factors) which are likely to be psychologically disturbing to the child, particularly at a time when his family life is also disrupted. If such a case is promptly brought to the attention of a court in this country, the judge may feel that it is in the best interests of the infant that these disturbing factors should be eliminated from his life as speedily as possible. A full investigation of the merits of the case in an English court may be incompatible with achieving this. The judge may well be persuaded that it would be better for the child that those merits should be investigated in a court in his native country than that he should spend in this country the period which must necessarily elapse before all the evidence can be assembled for adjudication here. Anyone who has had experience of the exercise of this delicate jurisdiction knows what complications can result from a child developing roots in new soil, and what conflicts this can occasion in the child's own life. Such roots can grow rapidly. An order that the child should be returned forthwith to the country from which he has been removed in the expectation that any dispute about his custody will be satisfactorily resolved in the courts of that country may well be regarded as being in the best interests of the child."</p>

I do not in any way dissent from those strictures, but it would, in my judgment, be wrong to suppose that in making orders in relation to children in this jurisdiction the court is in any way concerned with penalising any adult for his conduct. That conduct may well be a consideration to be taken into account, but, whether the court makes a summary order or an order after investigating the merits, the cardinal rule applies that the welfare of the infant must always be the paramount consideration."</p>

I do not believe that the mother has coached him, or H, to say certain things to Ms Baker or to anyone else. However, I do find that G&#8217;s stated reasons for wishing to stay in England have been influenced by his mother. She is obviously keen for him to push himself at school and in his activities: G is sometimes reluctant to return home to her at weekends because she makes him work hard. His letter to me focused on his wish to improve himself, specifically in relation to his sporting activities. He talked to Ms Baker about the opportunities his schooling here gives him. These sentiments are not borne of a sense of feeling at home in England but rather a wish to better himself Furthermore, the report from his school to Ms Baker suggests that he has had many more struggles at school and with settling into life in England than his currently expressed wishes and feelings would indicate. However, I accept G&#8217;s expressed wishes and feelings are sincere. G has been described as a little immature emotionally, but he is of an age when his wishes and feelings carry significant weight. I accept that he would feel angry and upset if the court ordered his return to Ghana against his wishes.</p>

Parental hostility has, I am sure, had a harmful effect on the children. However, that will not be resolved simply by their remaining in England. Difficult issues will remain about how the children spend time with their father, how they will get to see their grandparents, how long they should spend in Ghana during school holidays, how their father might visit England, and how travel to and from Ghana might be financed. Notwithstanding the mother&#8217;s assertion that she would facilitate the children seeing their father, the fact is that her actions to date have prevented the children seeing him face to face for fifteen months. </p>

The allegations centre on behaviour before and during the marriage and not after the separation in 2016. One allegation &#8211; that the father&#8217;s abuse caused a third child to be born with a congenital heart defect &#8211; is based on what is very likely to be entirely speculative assumption by the mother about causation. Some of the mother&#8217;s complaints contain no detail at all and are bare allegations. From the perspective of the children&#8217;s welfare what is important is that there is parental hostility but that the hostility did not prevent effective arrangements for the children being adopted in Ghana. G is adversely affected by the hostility between his parents and he appears to blame his father for that hostility. He believes that his father &#8220;hates&#8221; his mother. However, the mother&#8217;s unilateral decision to remove the children to England has had an adverse effect on the parents&#8217; relationship, and therefore on the children.</p>

He has been most affected by the father&#8217;s comment that he would take &#8220;extreme&#8221; measures to secure the return of the children to Ghana. That is a product of the mother&#8217;s clandestine relocation of the children and the father&#8217;s determination to have them returned.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Despite the submissions made on the mother&#8217;s behalf, I conclude that the mother&#8217;s relocation of the children to England was indeed clandestine. She did it behind the father&#8217;s back, without his consent, and without seeking the permission of the court. Even after receiving legal advice in May 2023 that she could apply to the Ghanaian court for permission to relocate the children to England and that the court would consider the best interests of the children and would be likely to find that their best interests lay with them remaining with their mother, she has continued to defy the existing court orders in Ghana regarding schooling and child arrangements. She has not made any court applications. She has known for a year or more that she has been in breach of Ghanaian court orders. On her own evidence she was making preparations for moving the children to England for many months before February 2023. She brought the children to England in 2022 as part of the preparatory steps. They did not mention anything to their father about schools in England. The mother did not mention anything to him about her work opportunity in England. She ensured that everything was kept from him and I infer that she co-opted the children into keeping secrets from their father. It is not the role of this court to &#8220;punish&#8221; the mother for her past actions. The children&#8217;s best interests are my paramount consideration. However, the circumstances of the children&#8217;s relocation to England are relevant to the impact on them of that relocation and their possible return to Ghana, and the mother&#8217;s ability to work with the father and the courts in the best interests of the children in the future.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have concerns that if the children are to remain in England, then they will not only see their father much less than they would do were they to live in Ghana, but that arrangements for them to spend time with him will be fraught with difficulty because of parental hostility, the father&#8217;s difficulty obtaining access to the court here, and the challenges of making practical arrangements, in particular because of the imbalance in parental financial resources: the father would be reliant on the mother to pay expenses associated with him spending time with the children. Parental hostility did not materially interfere with child arrangements in Ghana but the father is resentful of the mother having relocated the children to England and of her having done so in the manner in which she did. He feels that he has been largely cut out of the children&#8217;s lives by the mother&#8217;s secretive and unilateral actions. Parental relations are under great strain and will affect arrangements for the father to spend time with the children if they were to remain in England. The children are currently wards of court but if wardship were discharged as being no longer justified, then the father would not have the benefit of public funding for representation in relation to any future applications for contact. </p>

The mother would be able to apply to relocate the children to England. The mother told me that the courts in Ghana move very slowly and that it would take a long time before any application for relocation would be determined. However, I note that the Ghanaian orders made in July 2016, September 2019, and March 2023, were all made within a month or so of the relevant applications. Not all the other orders record when the applications were made.

The parental hostility would be likely to deepen because of resentment caused by the father&#8217;s application leading to the separation of the children from their mother. I do take into account that G is educated at a boarding school and so his mother is not his day to day carer during term-time weekdays. Nevertheless, both children&#8217;s welfare would be adversely impacted by being separated from their mother by many thousands of miles. </p>

The mother&#8217;s legal Counsel has not suggested that she would be at risk of such a consequence of the breaches. The father would also have to undertake not to seek to remove the children from the care of the other or the mother&#8217;s parents until any first hearing in the Family Court in Ghana.</p>

As she explained her decision to remain in England even if her children were returned to Ghana, she was quite matter of fact in her manner. Her initial position was that she would not return even though she did not know where her children would live upon return. That showed a lack of concern about their welfare that I found surprising and troubling. My judgement is that the mother would not be uncaring about where the children would live but had not properly thought through her apparent decision not to return. Later in her evidence, she accepted that it was likely that they would live with her parents as they had done, albeit with the mother, prior to their relocation to England. The mother discounted the possibility of obtaining work in Ghana even though she has an established history and a high-ranking position with her current employer. She has experience and skills. She has not provided any evidence from her employer about her position were she to return to Ghana, but perhaps she does not want her employer to know that that is a possibility. It is notable that she had not put in writing her position regarding her decision not to return. That suggests to me that she has only recently adopted that position and, as already noted, has not properly thought it through. There is no evidence that the mother has adopted a settled or entrenched position that she will not return with the children if their return were ordered.</p>

She has never lived apart from them. She is and has been their main carer. On the other hand, she did contemplate leaving the children behind in Ghana rather than bringing them to England with her, she sends G to a boarding school rather than having him at home with her, and she tells me that the best way to support her children is by maintaining her current paid role in England so that they can have a good education. The fact that she is prepared to spend so much (over half) of her net income on school fees demonstrates how she prioritises their education (albeit the number of changes of school she made in Ghana was considered not to be in their best interests). She would doubtless arrange for private schooling for the children in Ghana if they returned. She would want to keep up hear high level of earnings. Hence, her assertion that she would not return to Ghana is not manifestly incredible and she has made that assertion under oath.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having considered all the evidence on this issue I find that if the court ordered the return of her sons, the mother would arrange for them to live with her parents as was previously the position. She would apply to the Ghanaian court for the children to be relocated to England. I accept that such an application might take some months to conclude. As I have noted the Ghanian court orders with which I have been provided do not indicate a culture of undue delay in the family justice system there, but a relocation application would take time to prepare and require careful consideration by the court. Such an application might well take several months before conclusion in England and Wales. Pending the outcome of that application the mother would try to maintain her job in England and so would divide her time as she could between England and Ghana. Hence, the children would probably be separated from their mother for periods of time until the Ghanaian court determined the mother&#8217;s application to relocate. Ultimately, if her application failed, I find that she would return to Ghana rather than live apart from her children for the next five years or so (the likely duration of her current working role in England). Despite her evidence to me, I find it to be more likely than not that the mother would ultimately return to Ghana were a return order made in respect of her sons and she could not secure permission to relocate them to join her in England. She would recognise the adverse impact on them of being separated from her. She would want to live in the same country with them. She has strong ties to Ghana. She has a strong relationship with her employer. She might have to take a less well-paid role upon return but her skills and experience would put her in a good position to apply for roles within her present company or with other employers. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Counsel&#8217;s advice to the mother implied that a relocation application by her in Ghana would be likely to succeed because the Ghanaian court would be likely to conclude that it was in the best interests of the children to live with their mother who is the primary carer with &#8220;custody&#8221; and the main earner in the family and so has had good reason to bring the children to live with her in England. However, I cannot assume the outcome of any application in Ghana. What I can and do conclude is that the Ghanaian court is well placed to make welfare decisions about the two children. They have done in the past and the evidence shows that they will make decisions applying the best interests principle. The Ghanian courts have made child arrangements orders whether by consent or otherwise for these children since 2016. The father has no substantial connection with England. The English courts do not have a history of making welfare decisions for these children. The father would struggle to gain effective access to the courts here in relation to child arrangements. Given the Ghanaian court&#8217;s previous involvement, the family&#8217;s close connections to Ghana, and the ease of access to the Ghanaian courts that both parties can enjoy, I conclude that the Ghanaian courts are better placed than the English courts to make determinations about the longer term living arrangements that will meet the children&#8217;s best interests.</p>

Whilst she had support from her parents from 2016 to 2023 and she has used a boarding school to help her since 2023, she has been their main carer for the past eight years. My view of the evidence is that the father has been able to care for the boys when they have spent time with him. I have no evidence that they have suffered physical, psychological, or emotional harm in his care, save for the use of physical chastisement as has been described by G. It appears that both parents use physical chastisement in Ghana but the account of the father using his knuckles is of concern. As it happens, G appears to be largely undisturbed by the use of physical chastisement against him which he regards as the norm in Ghana. I do not think the use of physical chastisement by the father renders him incapable of meeting the children&#8217;s needs. Were the children to return to Ghana and live with their maternal grandparents, supported by the mother who would visit Ghana pending a decision on a relocation application, and spending time every other weekend and during half their school vacations with their father, those arrangements would be similar to those the boys have experienced when their mother has previously travelled abroad for work purposes. For a time they may spend longer apart from her than previously, but I am satisfied that the arrangements would meet the children&#8217;s needs.</p>

Further litigation might well follow in this jurisdiction with further disputes between the parents which will adversely affect the children&#8217;s welfare.

However, if I order the return of the children to Ghana in July, then (i) if the Ghanaian courts decide it is in their best interests to remain in Ghana, there will be no further upheavals for them; or (ii) if the Ghanaian courts decide that it is in their best interests to relocate to England, the further upheaval will be minimised, with only a limited time away from their English schools (and none if the Ghanaian courts were to decide that it was in their best interests to start the new school year in England).</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having considered all the evidence and analysed the matters as set out above, I consider that it is in the children&#8217;s best interests to be returned to Ghana. Until the mother uprooted the children, they enjoyed settled lives in Ghana, regularly spending time with their father whilst living with their mother and maternal grandparents. They were educated privately. They had networks of friends. The mother took a unilateral decision clandestinely to remove the children not for their direct benefit but so that she could remain as their primary carer whilst taking up a good career opportunity in England. I do not criticise her for wanting to further her career but the fact is that her decision to take up the position in England was not motivated primarily by her children&#8217;s best interests. She relocated the children in clear breach of court orders and without the father&#8217;s consent. Since bringing the children to England she has not taken steps to ensure that they have face to face time with their father. She has not made arrangements for him to come to England to see them. I have concerns about her willingness to make arrangements for the children to spend suitable time with their father in the future. I have concerns about the father&#8217;s ability to access the courts in England to secure time with his children in the absence of agreed arrangements. The parties&#8217; relationship was already under strain but it has deteriorated because of the mother&#8217;s actions in relocating the children without consent or permission. The courts in Ghana are well placed to make determinations about the children&#8217;s welfare. Both the mother and the father would have ready access to the Ghanaian family courts. The children have closer connections with Ghana than England. Theyn would be easily able to see their father there. The factors weighing against return, including G&#8217;s express wishes, the mother&#8217;s reluctance to return herself, the length of time the children have been in England, and the disruption return will cause to their education and lives, are outweighed by the benefits to them of return and the fact that, in my judgment, the Ghanaian courts are better placed to make determinations about the children&#8217;s welfare. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Very clearly the mother ought to have applied to the Ghanaian courts for permission to relocate before taking the unilateral decision to do so, in breach of the existing (and continuing) court orders. This has caused, and will continue to cause, avoidable disruption to the children&#8217;s lives. To minimise the disruption to the children&#8217;s education I shall order return to be effected once the children have both completed their current school academic year, which I expect to be in July. The parties shall agree a date for return, failing which I shall make a decision on paper as to the date of return. Protective measures are required including undertakings by the father not to be present at the airport when the children return, not to seek to remove the children from their mother&#8217;s or maternal grandparents&#8217; care pending a first hearing in the family court in Ghana, and to withdraw his application to commit the mother to prison for contempt of court. Indeed there is time for him to withdraw that application and prove that it has been withdrawn prior to the children being returned to Ghana, and that is what I shall require him to do.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The child arrangements orders in Ghana continue in effect and so the children will spend time with the father in accordance with those orders unless or until the Ghanaian courts order otherwise. The mother is free now (and has always been free) to make an application in Ghana to relocate the children to England. She may choose to try to keep the children&#8217;s school places in England open pending the outcome of such an application, but that is a matter for her. My decision does not bind the Ghanian courts in any way. My view is that the Ghanaian courts are best placed to determine the longer term child arrangements, including whether the children should relocate to England, in their best interests. To avoid any misunderstandings, this judgment and the order of this court should be provided to the Ghanaian court.</p>
