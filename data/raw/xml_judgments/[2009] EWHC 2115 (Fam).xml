They are distant cousins.  The mother described having known the father&#8217;s family since she was a small child.  Following the marriage, the mother and father lived for a period of about six months together in Pakistan in a property owned by the father&#8217;s family.  At that time, the father&#8217;s mother was also living in the house in Pakistan.  Shortly after the marriage an application was made for a visa for the wife.  This application was turned down because the father was, at that stage, unemployed.  The father thereafter returned to the UK in January 2004, which necessitated leaving the mother in Pakistan.  The mother finally came to this country in March 2005 when her entry clearance difficulties had been resolved.  </span></p>

The father had previously bought a property in the UK which he had hoped that he and his wife would make their home.  Unfortunately, he was unable to fund the mortgage and, as he put it, &#8220;handed back the keys&#8221;.  As a result, when the wife came to live in this country, rather than living in her own home with her husband, they lived together with his parents and two brothers in a two-bedroom property.  </span></p>

A few months later, in May 2006, the father, mother and S moved to live with the father&#8217;s sister and four other family members.  They had moved out, the father told me, as there was not enough space and it was difficult with his father being ill.  His sister, however, had an empty room which they were able to occupy.  When asked about his wife&#8217;s relationships with his sisters he described them as being, &#8220;Okay, not over-friendly, no tensions&#8221;.  Significantly, he said, his sisters were happy to have S in the house.  </span></p>

His wife went with him a number of times a week.  At one stage, the father had to reduce his working pattern to four days each week in order to be more available to assist with his father.  He explained in evidence that he still worked his full hours, but over less days.  One can only admire the devotion to his father.  The father described how it could take as much as half an hour to feed him one spoonful of food.  In addition to that, he was responsible for changing his father&#8217;s nappy and bathing him because his father was more comfortable with him than anyone else.  One cannot ignore the pressure this must have put not only on the father, but also on the mother setting up home in a foreign country with one tiny child and pregnant with her second baby.  </span></p>

The father said that he encouraged her to be independent and, as he described it, &#8220;to fit into this environment&#8221;.  He said he gave her money, but they shopped together.  The problem was the language barrier.  His sisters visited the mother when she was alone, but not much as they were busy with their own children.  The mother had relatives in the UK, but she tended to speak to them on the telephone.  The only example he could think of when she left the house alone was if he was on a break and she occasionally came to meet him in the town centre.  On occasion she after Z was born she would also go to his mother&#8217;s house.</span></p>

This inevitably meant that the mother would spend long periods of time alone in their small flat with two babies.  </span></p>

Typically the brain is found to be encephalopathic; bleeding is found in the subdural space between the dura and the arachnoid subdural haemorrhages; and there are retinal haemorrhages. There may also be other pathological signs such as subarachnoid bleeding and injuries at the cranio-cervical junction. Further, there may be injuries to nerve tissue (axonal injuries) and external signs of broken bones, bruising and other obvious injuries such as extradural oedema (bruising). Determining these findings requires medical experts from a number of different disciplines interpreting often very small signs within the complex structures of an infant's brain and surrounding tissue.</span></p>

		      <p style="margin-left:1.17in"><span style="font-size:14pt">&#8220;Dr. Geddes and her colleagues, following research into almost fifty paediatric cases without head injury, proposed that the same triad of injuries could be caused by severe hypoxia (lack of oxygen in the tissues) which in turn led to brain swelling. The hypothesis was that brain swelling combined with raised intracranial pressure (ICP) could cause both subdural haemorrhages and retinal haemorrhages. Thus, it was argued that any incidents of apnoea (cessation of breathing) could set in motion a cascade of events which could cause the same injuries as seen in the triad. It will be appreciated that there are many events which could accidentally cause an episode of apnoea.</span></p>

	    </intro>
	    <subparagraph>
	      <content>
		<p style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-size:14pt">&#8216;Our observations in the present series indicate that, in the immature brain, hypoxia both alone and in combination with infection is sufficient to activate the pathophysiological cascade which culminates in altered vascular permeability and extravasation of blood within and under the dura. In the presence of brain swelling and raised intracranial pressure, vascular fragility and bleeding would be exacerbated by additional haemodynamic forces such as venous hypertension, and the effects of both sustained systemic arterial hypertension and episodic surges in blood pressure.&#8217; Thus, it was suggested that all the injuries constituting the triad could be attributed to a cause other than NAHI. We understand that this paper has been much cited in both criminal and civil trials since its publication. The criticism of Geddes III is that it is not hypoxia and/or brain swelling which causes subdural haemorrhages and retinal haemorrhages, but trauma. As an example of why the hypothesis is not correct Dr. Jaspan, giving evidence in the appeal of Rock, demonstrated that CT scans taken of Heidi's brain showed that there was little or no brain swelling at a time when subdural haemorrhages and retinal haemorrhages were shown to be present. As a result of critical papers published in the medical journals, as we have already stated, Dr. Geddes when cross-examined frankly admitted that the unified hypothesis could no longer credibly be put forward. In cross-examination she accepted that she could no longer support the hypothesis that brain swelling was the cause of subdural haemorrhages and retinal haemorrhages. She did, however, state that she believed that raised intracranial pressure (ICP) might prove to be an independent cause of both lesions. When asked by Mr. Horwell if she had published a paper on this hypothesis she said that she had not and that her research was still incomplete. It was clear from subsequent questions in cross-examination that this work was still in its early stages and that many questions remain, as yet, unresolved. In my judgment, it follows that the unified hypothesis can no longer be regarded as a credible or alternative cause of the triad of injuries. This conclusion, however, is not determinative of the four appeals before us. There are many other medical issues involved in cases of alleged NAHI. Further, there remains a body of medical opinion which does not accept that the triad is an infallible tool for diagnosis. This body of opinion, whilst recognising that the triad is consistent with NAHI, cautions against its use as a certain diagnosis in the absence of other evidence. These four appeals raise different medical issues and do not necessarily fail because the unified hypothesis has not been validated. But it does mean that the triad, itself a hypothesis, has not been undermined in the way envisaged by the authors of Geddes III&#8220;</span></p>

Those representing the mother do not submit that hypoxia is itself a trigger event, but it is suggested that the existence of what is agreed to have been an old subdural haemorrhage in Z&#8217;s brain created a vulnerable and ready area for a re-bleed which was triggered by a non-traumatic trigger with a cascade of consequences, including hypoxia, which exacerbated Z&#8217;s decline and clouded the pathology findings.  </span></p>

She said, in terms, that she would never advise the court that trauma was the probable cause absent external injury, either seen physically with the naked eye or found at post-mortem. </span></p>

The haemorrhages involved, primarily, nerve fibre layer, ganglion cell layer haemorrhage, especially posteriorly.  There were a number of microscopic foci and intra-retinal haemorrhages involving the layers extending up to the periphery of the retinas in both eyes.  Posteriorly there were so-called pre-retinal haemorrhage, especially in the left eye and there was vitreous detachment with sub-hyaloid haemorrhage present.  In the left eye a small amount of blood was present in the anterior chamber.  The haemorrhage was most extensive in the subdural location, although there was bleeding in the sheath and bleeding in the orbital tissues adjacent to the optic nerve.

Of those, approximately 4% will suffer from an Ion-Channelopathy.  Of these about 10% is made up of Short QT and another similar syndrome.  The extreme rarity of the syndrome is best  illustrated by the fact that Dr. Till, despite specialising in Ion-Channelopathies, has never seen a case of Short QT in a child and only once in an adult.  The ambulance ECG did show a short QT reading, but it is however important, Dr. Till said, when assessing  the length of the QT interval, to have a normal heart rate (sinus rhythm) as the QT intervals lengthen and shorten according to heart rate.  </span></p>

The point is well made.  I accept that any mother in this mother&#8217;s situation would struggle to remember the precise number and duration of the telephone calls made.        I also accept that it is easy forget who rang whom particularly as this couple (in common with many other couples) have a missed call ring system and arrangement between them.  What I cannot accept, however, is that either the mother or the father would have forgotten a series of increasingly frantic telephone calls made by the mother to the father after her initial cry for help.  It may well be that some of the very short calls did, indeed, go to voicemail.  I do not accept that they all did.  Not least because this father I am satisfied, is a kind and compassionate man who loves his wife.  They were in the habit of speaking to each other very frequently on the telephone.  There is a record of a telephone call lasting twenty-eight seconds immediately after the father had called his brother to get help.  I simply do not accept that, having made the call to his brother on his wife&#8217;s behalf, this father would not have rung her back or picked up her telephone call to him in order to reassure that help was on the way.  Even had he done such an inconsiderate thing, or the message had gone through to voicemail, it is, in my judgment, inconceivable that when he got call after call (from his account, going through to voicemail) he would have waited for so many calls before telling her that an ambulance was on the way.  </span></p>

Pink frothy sputum, such was seen by the paramedics when they attended at the house, may develop for a number of medical reasons.  Dr. Peters explained that there is a close association between neurogenic pulmonary oedema (&#8220;NPO&#8221;), of which the pink frothy sputum was evidence, and sudden catastrophic brain injury.  Whilst not conclusive, Dr. Peters was of the view that the pink frothy sputem  seen by the paramedic was consistent with shaking rather than choking and, indeed he observed its very colour indicated that it was not milk.  </span></p>

Given the polarisation of the experts&#8217; opinion, and the detail in which a number of these issues have been explored, I am of the view that it is important to consider a number of the aspects of this controversial topic in so much as it is suggested that they may provide alternative causes for Z&#8217;s subdural haemorrhages and retinal haemorrhages.  </span></p>

He said that his categorisation may be influenced by the fact that he tends only to deal with very serious cases.  He readily accepted that Dr. Bonshek was in the better position to comment having seen the actual eyes microscopically, as opposed to photographs with all their inherent disadvantages.  It seems to me that the shades of description matter not.  What is significant is the type, position, depth and distribution, namely that the retinal haemorrhages were bilateral through all layers both posterior and anterior and that there was haemorrhaging at the optic nerve sheath.  </span></p>

Reperfusion occurs after a relatively long period of cardio-respiratory arrest.  The surge in pressure against the damaged cells, once circulation is re-established, can render those cells more likely to bleed.  The ophthalmic experts do not accept this to be  a cause of the retinal haemorrhages, although, as explained by Professor Luthert in his report, it is one of a number of factors which could have caused some evolution of the retinal bleeding between the primary event and death.  In relation to the aetiology of the retinal haemorrhages, it was immaterial  Dr. Luthert said whether they had or had not evolved.  In the same way that re-bleeding gives the court no assistance as to  the cause of the primary event, neither does reperfusion which, after all, is one of the consequences of resuscitation, not a cause for a child requiring resuscitation in the first place.</span></p>

This does not mean, however, said Dr. Bonshek, that the presentation overall is atypical of shaken baby syndrome.

She accepted that in terms of actual experience of such an event she had none.

But even then, not only did she decline to defer, but she did not accept that Dr. Peters was better placed to comment than she.

Both Dr Cohen and Dr Squier, speculated that, as the eye is part of the central nervous system, it must therefore behave in the same way as the brain.  This hypothesis would allow reperfusion which had been put forward as one possible theory for the cause for the subdural haemorrhages, equally to explain the presence of the retinal haemorrhages.  Such comments made by Drs Cohen and Squier are significantly out of their respective areas of expertise,. Aside from that to make, (as Dr. Squier  termed it in her written material), such an &#8220;assumption&#8221; as a means of plugging a gap in their hypothesis, lacked scientific rigour and it is a matter of concern to see any expert doing such a thing.</span></p>

I am satisfied that the mother is not telling the truth in the witness box about the sequence of events and, in particular, when she said in evidence for the first time that Z had not cried once he had attempted to vomit.  </span></p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.62in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The tragedy of shaking or shaking impact injuries or deaths is that they can be the result of a momentary loss of control.  So often the consequences are wholly disproportionate to what was a fleeting loss of temper.  I am satisfied that the mother had such a loss of control that evening and, in her frustration and inability to sooth Z whilst S was having some sort of toddler tantrum, she shook, or shook and threw Z down.   </span></p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.62in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Thus, I conclude that the threshold conditions under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> are established. Z&#8217;s collapse was caused by the mother shaking him. The father was completely blameless at that time. It is to be hoped that he will reflect on this judgment and the evidence that he gave to the court about the crucial period around Z&#8217;s collapse and come to understand that, much as he may love his wife, his first priority must now be to his surviving child, S.</span></p>
