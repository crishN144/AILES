The parties married in Italy in October 1995 and have 3 children now aged 16, 14 and 13. This matter has been listed before me over 2 days to deal with certain jurisdictional questions which have arisen. Although there is a direction which provides for both parties, who have been present at the hearing, to give evidence if the court considered it helpful, the matter has in fact been dealt with on submissions from Counsel. I have read and considered a statement from each party.</span></p>

As Mrs Bailey Harris, for the husband, points out, the Borras report on which he relies for support was framed in relation to the earlier and substantially different provisions of Brussels II Art.11, which comprised two separate clauses dealing with (i) proceedings involving the same cause of action (11.1), and (ii) proceedings not involving the same cause of action (11.2). As the editors of Cheshire, North and Fawcett point out, these 2 clauses were collapsed into a unitary clause in Art 19 of Brussels IIR, and the consequence of that must be that there is a true lis pendens between the separation proceedings in Italy and the Divorce proceedings in England. </span></p>

This is therefore not a situation analogous to that posited in the Borras report where one form of relief available in a particular jurisdiction may not be available in another, and a fresh action for that relief may therefore be contemplated.</span></p>

Art 19(3) demands that the court second seised must decline jurisdiction in favour of the first court, but what does that mean? Mr Vine argues his case thus:</span></p>

I can find no support for the suggestion that, once such confirmation has been received, the question of jurisdiction in the second court remains in some way deferred. Declining and deferring are two very different concepts, and each has a clear and distinct meaning. Whilst deferral, and so stay, may be the appropriate mechanism before the court first seised has confirmed its own jurisdiction, thereafter, the declining of jurisdiction by the court second seised in mandatory, and must be absolute.</p>

What does that mean for the divorce petitions filed by the wife in this jurisdiction? There can be little doubt that, in respect of the wife&#8217;s first petition, once the Italian court rejected her jurisdictional appeal in 2010, this court was bound to dismiss that petition, jurisdiction to entertain it having been declined. In that regard, it is noticeable that the wife&#8217;s own statement, in the passage to which I referred above, appears to indicate that the only reason why she did not apply to lift the stay and have that first petition dismissed was her desire to achieve secrecy and surprise in relation to the issuing of her second petition. That first petition should have stood dismissed since the conclusion of the Italian appellate proceedings, and I shall now dismiss it.</span></p>

It was his opinion that, insofar as it was capable of being provided, first, that it amounted to a lis pendens under Article 19 and, secondly, it was capable of being joined up with, and thus giving life to, the husband's petition issued on 10th February 2009.</span></p>

I have reminded myself that, in European jurisprudence, Regulations and Articles are often to be treated as living and purposive instruments and not always to be read as tightly as one might read an English statute. Certainly, I have come to the conclusion that Article 19 must be read purposively and, in my judgment, for a court to remain seised of a matter, there must in fact be existing proceedings before it. To construe the Article in any other way is potentially to make a nonsense of it by a court being seised of a matter about which it can do nothing unless a party revives it. If one took a jurisdiction like England and Wales, where strike-outs are not the subject of time limits, it could have an entirely absurd effect. For Article 19 to bear real meaning, in my judgment, it is essential that there be proceedings which can be properly described as "existing" before the court at the relevant date.&#8217;</span></p>

His client was therefore free, he submits, to issue a fresh English divorce petition during the hiatus period in Italy, and thus become first in time for the purposes of Art 19. He relies heavily upon Ms Ceschini&#8217;s expressed view that the Italian separation order was immediately enforceable after 22 November 2012, notwithstanding her later expressed opinion that: &#8216;The separation order... was not final on 28 May 2013&#8217; [D30], because the term to appeal had not then expired.

It was the case that either party could have foreshortened the period for possible appeal by formal service of the separation order upon the other, which would have left a period of 30 days (plus the length of the summer recess if applicable) before the divorce process could begin. It may have been this provision that prompted the wife&#8217;s representative to assert to HHJ Brasse on 24 May 2013 that: &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">H has been eligible to apply for divorce in Italy since Jan but has not done so&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> [B20], in order to get her second petition issued. That assertion would have been true if either he, or the wife, had formally served the separation order immediately upon its being made.

Unlike the English strike out analogy drawn by Headley J, there was a long stop time limit, at the end of which the order would have become final the and the right of potential appeal been discharged. If, thereafter, the husband had taken no steps to issue divorce proceedings in Italy, then it might have become possible for the wife to have done so in England. In fact, in July 2013, he did formally serve the order, and immediately at the expiration of the subsequent appeal period he did issue formal divorce proceedings in Italy. In those circumstances I am satisfied that the seisin of the Italian court, established definitively in 2010 when the wife&#8217;s jurisdictional appeal failed, has not been lost along the way. Particularly, I am satisfied that it was not open to the wife, prior to the expiration of the appeal period &#8211; which she herself could have reduced &#8211; to issue a fresh petition in England, regardless of whether or not she required the permission of this court given that her first petition remained stayed.</span></p>
