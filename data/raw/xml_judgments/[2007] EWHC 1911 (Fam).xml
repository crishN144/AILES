		<p style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband was born in January 1956 and so, he is now 51 years old.  The wife was born in May 1958 and so, she is now 49 years old.  The husband is a dentist by profession, having qualified before the parties married and having already established his practice.  The parties were married in May 1981.  They have three children, the eldest of whom is T.  He is currently at Keel University where he is studying for a degree in media studies and psychology.  Apparently, he has had to take his first year examinations again.  E is at Charterhouse until the end of this academic year, when he will be going on his gap year.  L, the parties&#8217; youngest child is still at Bedales School.  She is about 15 years old and, therefore, has a number of years before she is finished with secondary education.  She will proceed to on to university.  Each of the children is fortunate enough to be the beneficiary of a settlement, set up by their grandfather, Mr F.  That settlement provides for the payment of the children&#8217;s school fees and an income for each once they attain 18.  Thus, T is currently in receipt of about &#163;20,000 per annum, which he uses to fund his educational requirements/allowance.  As I understand it, he also able to more some savings each year.  The result of the generosity of the F family means that these parties do not have to dip into their own resources in order to pay for the children&#8217;s education or to assist, as they become independent young adults.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">During the course of this marriage the parties lived, what Mr Cohen Q.C.(on behalf of the husband) has described as &#8220;a good middle class lifestyle.&#8221;  For the bulk of the marriage they were entirely reliant upon the husband&#8217;s income from his dentistry practice. They lived in a nice house called &#8220;M<span style="color:#000000">a&#241;ana&#8221;, which had four bedrooms and a study.  I have seen the photographs of the Estate Agents particulars when it was purchased in 1984 for about &#163;95,000.  It obviously was a very satisfactory family home.  </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">The case would have been a simple if these facts had been the only relevant circumstances; however this family were particularly fortunate.  I have already outlined that the children were beneficiaries of a grandchildren&#8217;s settlement set up by Mr F.  In addition, the wife was the beneficiary under a number of family trusts, which gave her a substantial entitlement.  For most of the marriage she was not in receipt of any great benefit because the trusts contained shares in the family, which ran a number of undertakers and owned crematoriums.  </span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">In 1995, that business was the subject of a hostile takeover, which resulted in a great deal of cash replacing what had otherwise been shares.  The best estimate in relation to the settlements in which the wife has an entitlement is that capital contained therein totalled some &#163;5.8m as at the date of trial.  There was an overriding power of revocation in respect of some of the trusts but it was not expected that this would be exercised.  That apart the wife was entitled to the trust income throughout her life.  Indeed, Mr Howard Q.C. on her behalf, was realistic enough to accept, that she would be entitled to the substantial trust income.  Currently it amounts to about &#163;150,000 gross per annum, netting down to about &#163;100,000 net.  It is clear that these trusts are invested primarily for capital growth, for &#163;100,000 when applied to the underlying capital base shows a return of a mere 2 per cent per annum.  My understanding is that some &#163;4.4m of the fund is invested in Blue Chip shares, whilst the remainder is in property situated in or about London.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The family&#8217;s lifestyle began to change once the trust monies were available to meet the family&#8217;s needs and outgoings.  Thus, in 1998 the parties purchased Lower Farm, near Chichester.  It cost about &#163;650,000 (plus the usual costs of acquisition).  It was funded by a mortgage (then in the region of &#163;265,000) the net proceeds of M<span style="color:#000000">a&#241;ana (being some &#163;218,000) and the balance of &#163;190,000 from the wife&#8217;s accumulated income.  </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">The wife has remained living in Lower Farm with the children when they are with her.  She has undertaken work to that property over the years and has continued to do so since these parties separated in 2001.  I was told that she had recently repaid about &#163;22,000 worth of mortgage and had spent about &#163;25,000 on upgrading the kitchen.</span></p>

Accordingly, she has not been able, or has chosen not, to save any of her income.  She was generous to the husband in the sense that she contributed about &#163;60,000 towards the purchase of an aeroplane on his behalf, he being an enthusiastic private pilot.  He continues to fly and still wishes to maintain/own the plane.</span></p>

The parties are to be congratulated, behaving in an adult manner in relation to the children.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">The District Judge had to determine the assets in the case and so far as I can ascertain, he adopted the entire presentation made on behalf of the wife.  In fact, he had the wife&#8217;s asset schedule scanned and it appears (albeit in a disjunctive fashion) in the body of his judgment.  That asset presentation shows overall family assets approaching &#163;2.3m.  There would have been an extra &#163;40,000 included if the husband had been able to obtain an updated pensions valuation for his NHS pension as at September 2006.  In round terms, the District Judge held that the parties assets were about &#163;2.3m both through the husband&#8217;s industry and (from 1995 as a result of the wife&#8217;s income generated funds.</span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">The wife&#8217;s asset Schedule was in dispute.  Indeed, the husband made his own presentation, which contained a number of figures which he sought to persuade the District Judge were correct.  For example, he did not accept that the costs of sale of the former matrimonial home should be deducted as it was the wife&#8217;s case that she wished to retain it.  He sought to include a figure for contents based on an insurance value of about &#163;100,000.  He sought to include his client&#8217;s future needs as a &#8220;debt&#8221; in the asset schedule.  The District Judge did not make any specific findings on those arguments, but his inclusion of the wife&#8217;s presentation makes it clear that he gave those arguments short shrift.  I consider he was correct so to do.</span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">However, the husband made a number of other points, from which I consider the District Judge should have made specific findings.  The first is the value of the husband&#8217;s business premises.  The valuation document presented to the Learned Judge showed three different bases upon which those premises could be valued, (i) the lowest value being some &#163;205,000 on the basis that the property was marketed for some three months; (ii) the mid-valuation on the basis that it was marketed over an extended period was some six months, being some &#163;230,000 and, (iii) the highest being &#163;250,000 on the basis that the husband were able to sell it with tenants in situ.  The differential of some &#163;45,000 may not be seen as significant in many cases, but it was an important percentage of the valuation of those premises.  Therefore, to my mind the District Judge should have made a specific finding.  In fact, he simply adopted the wife&#8217;s presentation, which assumed the greatest value.</span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">In relation to costs, I also consider that the District Judge failed to be fair to both of these parties.  By the time of trial the wife had expended some &#163;70,000 in respect of her costs and she had paid most of them.  The husband had only paid &#163;30,000.  Therefore, there was a differential between the parties of some &#163;40,000 in relation to expenditure incurred.  This could have been catered for in a number of different ways.  Perhaps the most usual, in what may now be described as old-fashioned cases, is to adopt the </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">Leadbetter</span><span style="color:#000000"> principle.  I have not always been a fan of that particular case, but in the circumstances of this divorce, it was appropriate to apply it to achieve a balanced approach.  The Learned District Judge failed so to do.  In taking that position, of course, he mis-stated the overall assets by some &#163;40,000.</span></p>

	  <paragraph eId="para_15">
	    <num>15.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">Another issue which the Learned Judge should have dealt with in greater detail was the categorisation of the value of the business premises, the good will value of the dentist practice owned by the husband as liquid assets.  The husband sought to put them into a different category, for he submitted they were not readily realisable whilst the husband sought to continue his occupation.  The District Judge dealt with this in his judgment on the basis that &#8220;the submission flew in the face of reality.&#8221;  I do not accept his assertion.  It is clear that the premises, less the mortgage of &#163;120,000 and the good will in the region of &#163;190,000 were not readily realisable as they underpinned the Husband&#8217;s ability to continue earning.  Therefore, whilst, of course, they could be sold, in reality they remained illiquid whilst he continued to earn an income.</span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">The difference in the two presentations has been set out in a clear fashion by Mr Howard, on behalf of the wife, in what he has referred to as Appendix 2A.  It shows clearly the issues that I have outlined and highlighted.  I append it to this judgment as appendix 1.  It shows the asset base set out by the District Judge as about &#163;2.3m together with the husband&#8217;s assertions which reduced it to &#163;2.094m.  In round terms the differential being &#163;195,000.</span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">The case, would have been easy if it had just been about assets of &#163;2.3m together with the husband&#8217;s net income of &#163;87,000.  I doubt that this court would have been troubled about a differential of &#163;195,000, which Mr Howard Q.C. has referred to as &#8220;nit-picking points.&#8221;  However, District Judges are now required to consider a division of the assets using the yardstick of equality as a check, are so they should make specific findings where there is a significant differential between the parties.  However, the facts which made this complex was the wife&#8217;s entitlements under trusts.  I am of the view that where such an unusual aspect is to be determined, the case should be transferred to the High Court at the earliest opportunity.  If that had been I have little doubt that a great deal of time could have been saved and that there would have been no necessity for an appeal.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">The husband sought an award on the basis that the pensions and the business assets were put in a separate category.  He submitted there should be an equal division of what might be described as the liquid assets, but that he should retain more of the illiquid assets.  He wanted a lump sum of &#163;650,000.  The Learned District Judge did not accept that argument.  He considered that the husband&#8217;s needs could be met by an equal division of all of the matrimonial assets in the case.  By so doing, he gave the wife a 50 per cent share in the husband&#8217;s business assets, which totalled some &#163;700,000.  The result was that the lump sum which the husband sought was reduced to &#163;350,000.  I have little doubt that the Learned District Judge&#8217;s mind was, to a degree, swayed by the fact that the wife had indicated that her total &#8220;mortgageability&#8221; was &#163;411,000, and she wished to retain the former matrimonial home.  Given that there was an outstanding mortgage, the Learned District Judge thought that if he awarded a lump sum of &#163;350,000 to the husband then the wife would be enabled to retain that property.</span></p>

The District Judge did not agree with this formulation.  He made a specific finding that on the balance of probabilities he could not be certain that the trustees would act in this way, for they had not made any capital distributions.  He was referred to the case of </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">Thomas v.

The reality is that he took no proper account of the wife&#8217;s income of &#163;100,000 net, which she will continue to receive until she dies.  A figure was placed before him that, on an actuarial basis, this income stream had a capital value of some &#163;2.7m.  I suspect that this actuarial calculation is uncontroversial, albeit that it is theoretically, because the wife will never seek to sell her income stream for that amount of money.  Nevertheless, I am clear that in making the order that he did, the District Judge omitted any proper consideration of the wife&#8217;s income stream.</span></p>

So far as the husband was concerned, that he could re-house himself for &#163;500,000.  That was based, as I understand it, on the evidence that the property next door to the parties&#8217; first matrimonial home, </span>M<span style="color:#000000">a&#241;ana, was on the market for sale at about &#163;500,000.  It seems to me, having been referred to the transcript of the evidence, that this was a flimsy basis upon which the District Judge could make such a finding.  That he indicated that he had ten years of experience of property prices in the area.  The husband&#8217;s case, was that he wanted to buy a property costing &#163;775,000 within the city walls of Chichester.  The District Judge found this was too high, for properties could be bought outside that particular location for &#163;500,000 odd.  I do not think it is appropriate for me to go behind any of that part of his finding.</span></p>

		      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in"><span style="color:#000000">&#8220;It may be asked how the wife can be expected to raise the sum for which the husband asks since she has no cash fund anywhere near this sum.  She has asked her bank what it would be willing to lend her in excess of the existing mortgage and the answer was &#163;411,000.  The husband counters this by saying that the wife is a tenant for life and the settlements, which have a value of &#163;5.8m and that the trustees have power in their absolute discretion to advance capital to any beneficiary and, that it is from this source that the necessary funds might come.  In support of this my attention was drawn to the Court of Appeal decision in </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">Thomas v Thomas</span><span style="color:#000000">, where it was suggested that in circumstances such as this the trustees would probably help, particularly if their was a little judicious encouragement from the court.  This observation cannot, in my judgment, be considered a proposition of law so that a court trying a case such as this must, or should assume that the trustees will come to the rescue of a party who is in need of funds to satisfy an ancillary relief order.  I question whether that is in fact a right interpretation of that decision.</span></p>

		      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in"><span style="color:#000000">It was also pointed out by the wife&#8217;s counsel that from a document with the papers they have a stated policy of not making capital advances and more importantly, in the eleven years since the settlements became cash rich there is no instance of their having done so.  At best it can be said that on one occasion they bought a house for the mother-in-law of one of the wife&#8217;s brothers to live in, but it was all in their own names.  On the face of it this would appear to be an unauthorised investment and in any event they have apparently now required the lady to leave and sold the house.  On another occasion they apparently lent to one or other of the grandchildren some money to buy a car.  Neither of these instances is an example of making it an advanced capital.  Although not mentioned at the hearing, it occurs to me that if this argument was to be used, an application could have been made for a direction that the wife enquires of the trustees whether they would, if asked, assist the wife.&#8221;</span></p>

The availability of unidentified resources may, for example, be inferred from a spouse's expenditure or style of living, or from his inability or unwillingness to allow the complexity of his affairs to be penetrated with the precision necessary to ascertain his actual wealth or the degree of liquidity of his assets. Another is that where a spouse enjoys access to wealth but no absolute entitlement to it (as in the case, for example, of a beneficiary under a discretionary trust or someone who is dependent on the generosity of a relative), the court will not act in direct invasion of the rights of, or usurp the discretion exercisable by, a third party. Nor will it put upon a third party undue pressure to act in a way which will enhance the means of the maintaining spouse. This does not, however, mean that the court acts in total disregard of the potential availability of wealth from sources owned or administered by others. There will be occasions when it becomes permissible for a judge deliberately to frame his orders in a form which affords judicious encouragement to third parties to provide the maintaining spouse with the means to comply with the court's view of the justice of the case. There are bound to be instances where the boundary between improper pressure and judicious encouragement proves to be a fine one and it will require attention to the particular circumstances of each case to see whether it has been crossed.&#8217;</span></p>

That is why as I have already outlined that the small points which Mr Howard Q.C. described as &#8220;nit-picking,&#8221; would not, have caused me to alter the decision of the District Judge in the exercise of his discretion.  However, I consider that this District Judge was plainly wrong on a matter of principle relating to the wife&#8217;s trust assets affected his division of the illiquid assets that had been built up by the parties during the course of the marriage, particularly the husband&#8217;s pensions, the good will relating to his practice and the business premises from which he ran it.

However, I note that Lord Nicholls stated that when exercising his discretion a judge must treat all property in the same way.  Statute requires the court to have regard to all of the circumstances of the case.  One of the circumstances is that there is a real difference between the source of those funds, between property acquired during the marriage otherwise than by inheritance or gift, sometimes called the &#8220;marital acquest&#8221; and other property.

I agree that there cannot be a hard and fast rule about whether one starts with equal sharing and departs if need or compensation supply a reason to do so or whether one starts with need and compensation and shares the balance. Much will depend upon how far future income is to be shared as well as current assets. In general, it can be assumed that the marital partnership does not stay alive for the purpose of sharing future resources unless this is justified by need or compensation. The ultimate objective is to give each party an equal start on the road to independent living.&#8221;</span></p>

I have included the value of the aeroplane, a Piper Saratoga, at &#163;120,000, because it seems to me that that was the figure that was given at the date of the trial and although there has been subsequent updated valuation which indicates that it is worth somewhat less, no permission was sought to adduce that evidence. I have not included any costs of sale in relation to that plane, for it seems to me that the evidence before the District Judge was to the effect that the husband would try and achieve a private sale so as to avoid the costs of sale.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">So far as other items in dispute are concerned, I have added the figure of &#163;6,300 in relation to a car which the husband purchased for his current partner.  I have not included a figure for the wife&#8217;s car, although I accept it could have been included on a like-for-like basis, but it does not seem to me that the value of her old vehicle makes any difference to the outcome of this case.  I have taken a broader view because (inaudible) is </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">de minimis</span><span style="color:#000000"> view in relation to assets such as this.  Indeed, my own view is that contents and cars should normally be omitted from asset schedules and should be dealt with </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">in specie. </span><span style="color:#000000"> I have included the amount for the husband&#8217;s tax for &#163;2,067 and the prospective current payment that he will have to make in relation to his tax bill in 2008.  The latter, is likely to be covered by some monies that he has put into a tax reserve account.  I have equally included a figure of &#163;20,000, which the wife said in evidence was the amount that she expected in relation to her tax.  I have dealt with the legal costs (not by a </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">Leadbetter</span><span style="color:#000000"> add back) but simply by deducting the amount of the husband&#8217;s excessive outstanding costs over those of the wife.  Therefore, dealing with those on a fair basis - like for like.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">The submission was made by Mr Cohen Q.C. on behalf of the husband, that I should take account of the undoubted uplift in the value of the wife&#8217;s trusts since the hearing before the District Judge.  He gave a number of calculations using the FTSE and (inaudible) index.  He told me that would take the value of her trusts to far in excess of &#163;6m.  I do not think it is proper in the context of this case that I try to estimate an updated figure in relation to her trusts.  It is clear that they are so much greater than the husband&#8217;s long-term illiquid assets and so the precise value makes little difference to the outcome of this case.  The current total of the husband&#8217;s illiquid assets (being his pension and business assets) is now &#163;770,000 odd.  When that is compared to the wife&#8217;s trust of course it is not a significant amount.</span></p>

Given that the wife retains the former matrimonial home that would mean he would be entitled to a lump sum (given that he was to retain a joint policy and the plane) of some &#163;625,930 (of which &#163;350,000 has already been paid on account).  This would mean an additional lump sum payable to him in the round of &#163;276,000.  An award at this level would represent an overall percentage of the parties&#8217; matrimonial assets of 65 per cent, leaving the wife with 35 per cent, plus her trust assets.  </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">I have to consider whether that in itself is a fair determination of this case overall.  Many arguments have been advanced about the expenditure which the wife has made on behalf of the family from 1995 onwards and since the separation of these parties.  Many arguments have been advanced in relation to the husband&#8217;s alleged extravagance from 2001 to 2006.  Those have been countered on the basis that he has had to live in rented accommodation and the like.  I have little doubt that to some extent the husband has found it difficult to adjust from the lifestyle to which he became accustomed in the latter part of the marriage.  He, apparently, has expended some &#163;69,000 of capital as to which &#163;14,000 odd is reflected in policies and &#163;30,000 is reflected in legal costs that were paid by him.  That means that some &#163;25,000 odd may have been spent on matters that were not strictly required.  It may be it was spent on flying.  Clearly he enjoys his plane and that is an expensive hobby.  (inaudible) he (inaudible) wished to sell the plane at one point and was dissuaded from so doing because the wife wished the proceeds of sale to be retained pending the determination of this case.</span></p>

Accordingly, I consider the further lump sum should be &#163;250,000.</span></p>
