In the alternative she sought a joint lives maintenance order for herself.  Further it was the wife&#8217;s case that the husband&#8217;s approach to the litigation had led to unnecessary costs being run up as a direct consequence of his alleged litigation misconduct and she sought to reclaim the following sums:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband for his part sought to ring fence a figure of approximately &#163;1.49m of the total assets of about &#163;4.1m. This was on the basis that that sum represented assets which were owned by him prior to the marriage. The open position of the husband was that the case should be determined in accordance with Spanish law as set out by his Spanish expert.  This arose out of his submissions that the marriage was governed, in its totality, by an Escritura de Capitulaciones Matrimoniales (CM).  The CM, the husband submitted, meant that the assets alleged by the husband to have been pre acquired by him would be excluded from consideration before the balance thereafter was divided equally. Under Spanish law the wife would receive very limited maintenance for herself and over a very limited period of time. The children would receive a much lower level of maintenance than would be considered to be appropriate under English law.  </p>

The husband accordingly asked for a little time to consult with his English lawyers who were representing him at the hearing.  He then returned to the witness box and made amended proposals which significantly improved upon his previously negligible offer to the wife and increased his offer in relation to his children such that the figure of child maintenance became agreed. </p>

It is easy to attach this case on its facts to a number of the objectives there articulated. It is very important that the judge in dealing with the case should seek to save expense. It is very important that he should seek to deal with the case in ways proportionate to the financial position of the parties. It is very important, more so today than it was when these rules were drafted, that he should allot to each case an appropriate share of the court's resources, taking into account the need to allot resources to other cases. In his general duty of case management he is required to identify the issues at an early date and particularly to regulate the extent of the disclosure of documents and expert evidence so that they are proportionate to the issues in question.</p>

Such difficulty may well mean that the appropriate order is one under CPR 44.3 (6)(a)-(c).  CPR 44.3(7) enjoins the court when considering making and order for payment of the costs of an issue to make an order under one of the sub paragraphs a &#8211; c of 44.3 (6) if practicable [16] even if in relation to a particular issue, it is appropriate to order the overall winning party to bear some of its costs or pay the overall loser some of his, the issue in question, such as quantum, may itself have contained a number of sub issues, in respect of which the proper incidence of  costs is not straightforward.  One sub issue on which the overall winner lost may have had significant monetary value but taken little time to determine; another may be one which was of a much lesser value but took more time.  Another sub issue may be one on which the overall winner won.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[21] The first question, therefore, is whether the judge was entitled to proceed on the basis that this was a case which called for an issue based costs order. In my view, this case cried out for such an order. The issues which were fought and lost by Mr&#160;Kotonou included issues which, in the judge's view, should never have been raised at all: including issues on which the allegation of representation was dismissed on the basis that the representation had simply not been made. I would have been surprised if a judge, hearing a trial of this nature, had not reached a conclusion that this was an appropriate case for an issue based order. At the least, it is impossible to hold that this judge's conclusion that that was the correct approach was flawed in principle. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[22]CPR&#160;44.3(7) requires that, where the court would otherwise consider making an order under paragraph (6)(f), it must instead, if practicable, make an order under paragraphs (6)(a) or (c) instead. Paragraph (6)(f), as I have indicated, is the power to make an issue-based costs order. Paragraph (6)(a) enables the court to make an order that one party pay a proportion of another party's costs. It is unnecessary I think to refer to paragraph (6)(c) in detail. The thinking behind rules (6)(f) and (7) is not difficult to understand. Separate assessments of the costs relating to individual issues are likely to be complex and expensive: difficult to carry out in circumstances in which there are common factors which spread over a number of issues. How should the costs of those common elements be apportioned between the separate issues? A more convenient method, while keeping in mind the issue based approach, is to assess all the costs together and then apply a proportion which reflects the fact that one party has won on some issues and has lost on the other issues. That is what the Costs Rules require. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[23]At paragraph&#160;21 of his judgment this judge recognised that it would be difficult accurately to identify the separate costs occasioned by the separate issues. That is exactly the sort of case which the rule making body had in mind when it provided in paragraph (7) that, if practicable, the court must make an order under paragraph&#160;(6)(a). The judge indicated, in the first two sentences of paragraph&#160;22 of his judgment, that he had decided to make a split order -- which in context meant an issue-based order as appeared from the last sentence of paragraph&#160;20 -- but, to translate that split into simple percentages of the overall costs. That would obviate the need for a detailed assessment of the separate costs of each issue. That, as it seems to me, is not only a proper approach: it is the approach which is positively required by the Rules. </p>

In my judgment the nature of financial remedy litigation is such that there will inevitably be aspects of the litigation where one party believes (rightly perhaps) that the other party has been unreasonable or failed to make a concession when they should have done so. That is part of the cut and thrust of litigation. Sums such as &#163;274 are de minimus in the context of total costs of over &#163;300,000 and the courts must be wary about undermining the essential premise set out in Part 28.3(6) that the court will not make an order requiring one party to pay the costs of another party.</p>

There is no requirement for the party applying for an issue based costs order to show &#8216;significant extra cost&#8217; to the other party or that the &#8220;conduct increased the other party&#8217;s costs above the natural level of costs in an identifiable way&#8221;. It goes without saying that in most cases the inevitable consequence of any conduct established under Part 28.3(6) will have been to have increased the costs above that which they would have been had there been no such conduct, it is not however an inevitable consequence.

This concern is recognised in the CPR 44.3(7) and discussed by the court <span style="font-style:italic">Kotonou</span>. The combined effect of this difficulty is that the court in making an issue based costs order should, if practical, opt for expressing its order as a proportion of the costs.

In the present case I have considered carefully making such an order but given the inability of the parties to date to take a pragmatic approach to any single issue in the case, I take the view that it would inevitably be an expensive and time consuming approach requiring a detailed assessment of the wife&#8217;s costs before the relevant percentage could be applied.</p>
