He refused the husband permission in respect of Grounds 1 and 3 which asserted respectively that the judge was wrong (a) to draw adverse inferences as to his level of income, and (b) to divide the CGT fund as he did. At the hearing before me the husband renewed orally his application for permission on Grounds 1 and 3. I refused permission on those two grounds but made clear that I would correct any mathematical errors in the calculation of the commutation lump sum  either under the slip rule or the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction.  </p>

He resides in the USA and holds a professorship at Princeton University, although he told me during the hearing that the future of this position is uncertain as he is in dispute with the university. In 2012 the husband remarried a woman who is also an architect and academic. They now have two young children. I was told in the husband&#8217;s skeleton argument, and by him orally in his submissions, that since the hearing before the trial judge the eldest of these daughters has been diagnosed with an incurable illness which is life-limiting and requires extensive care. The husband tells me that there are significant costs associated with this care and treatment regime which may increase in the future, especially if he were to lose the medical insurance provided by his employer. I will explain below that none of these changes of circumstances has been the subject of a formal application to adduce fresh evidence notwithstanding that HHJ Everall QC specifically directed that such an application should be made if the filing of such evidence were to be pursued. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Since their separation, the parties have been engaged in very lengthy and costly litigation not only in the Family Court but in the Chancery Division also. Moylan J made a final order in the financial remedy proceedings on 23 June 2011. There was  also parallel commercial litigation arising out of the division of the parties&#8217; joint architects&#8217; practice. These proceedings were not settled until 2014. Further, the wife had to bring enforcement proceedings in November 2017 following the husband&#8217;s failure to pay periodical payments for M from June 2017, though these were not pursued once the husband cleared the arrears.  </p>

Judgement was reserved. As mentioned, that main judgment was produced in writing on 29 January 2019. Clarifications were sought, predominantly by the husband&#8217;s legal team, and consequently supplemental judgments were given on 24 July 2019, 25 September 2019 and 16 October 2019. The order giving effect to the judgment was not perfected until 1 October 2019. I have to say that for an application relating merely to child maintenance to take almost two years from start to finish is an unacceptably long period of time. Further, it is my view that to take 6&#189; months to produce a reserved judgment is also an unacceptably long period of time. </p>

This right can only be taken away where a High Court judge or a Designated Family Judge refuses permission to appeal and certifies the application to be totally without merit &#8211; see r.30.3(5A). The continued existence of this right contrasts with the position in the Court of Appeal since 3 October 2016 where the decision of the single judge on the papers is final and may not be orally renewed unless the single judge permits such an oral hearing: see CPR r.52.5. In my opinion, appeals under FPR Part 30 should be aligned as soon as possible with those in the Court of Appeal. Just as in the Court of Appeal there should be complete trust reposed in the single appeal judge who determines the permission application on the papers.

These are all decisions either of the House of Lords or of the Supreme Court. The reasons for this approach are many. They include: i) The expertise of a trial judge is in determining what facts are relevant to the legal issues to be decided, and what those facts are if they are disputed. ii) The trial is not a dress rehearsal. It is the first and last night of the show. iii) Duplication of the trial judge's role on appeal is a disproportionate use of the limited resources of an appellate court, and will seldom lead to a different outcome in an individual case. iv) In making his decisions the trial judge will have regard to the whole of the sea of evidence presented to him, whereas an appellate court will only be island hopping. v) The atmosphere of the courtroom cannot, in any event, be recreated by reference to documents (including transcripts of evidence). vi) Thus even if it were possible to duplicate the role of the trial judge, it cannot in practice be done.&#8221; </p>

I asked him to give me his best example of this. He referred to the omission from his Form E of the existence of a Swiss branch of his architectural business. The wife noticed a reference in the accounts of the business to an overseas undertaking which led, months later, to the husband admitting the existence of this branch in his reply to questionnaire. This was one of a number of omissions that led the judge to form the view that the husband had been highly defensive in his disclosure obligations. The husband considered that the criticisms were unjustified as this, in common with a number of other omissions, was the result of a mistake when he filled in his Form E. He had never intended to mislead and pointed out that the existence of the Swiss branch was at all times visible on the business&#8217;s website. I have to say that I was completely unpersuaded by this argument. The husband did not hasten to correct the error; rather, the truth had to be dragged out of him by the questionnaire process.  </p>

Although the trial judge used some slightly ambiguous and contradictory language, what he intended to achieve is abundantly clear. He made a determination that the residue of the CGT fund was to be divided equally between the parties. This equal division reflected the equal sharing principle as well as their likely proprietary interests in the fund. However, the husband&#8217;s half share of the fund would not be paid to him; rather, it would instead be paid to the wife in partial satisfaction of the lump sum awarded in lieu of continuing monthly payments of child maintenance. This is plainly what the judgment intended, and it is explicitly provided for in the order giving effect to it.  </p>

This is completely untenable. The wife&#8217;s half of the CGT fund is her own property and there is no reason at all why it should be applied as a credit towards the lump sum liability. To do so would be to treat it, as well as the husband&#8217;s half, as the husband&#8217;s property; or, to put it another way, to treat the whole fund as the husband&#8217;s property. The trial judge did not make that finding, and there was no basis on which he could have done so.

What they mean is that on an application to vary a periodical payments order the court may not make a property adjustment order either in favour of a party to the marriage or a child of the family. Further, on such an application to vary the court may not make a lump sum order in favour of a party to the marriage but there is no prohibition on it doing so in favour of a child of the family. The language is completely clear. Where the application is to vary a periodical payments order in favour of a child of the family then there is power to award a lump sum. </p>

This power is subject to the restrictions imposed by s29 in respect of a child who has turned 18, but these do not apply if the child is in full time education. </p>

First, she argues that a child maintenance capitalisation is, unlike a spousal maintenance capitalisation, not watertight. The child cannot be prevented from coming back for more. Her third reason is the direct opposite of this. Here she argues that child maintenance is meant to be variable in accordance with the current circumstances prevailing referable to the child&#8217;s needs and the payer&#8217;s income and if there is a capitalisation this cannot be achieved. The second reason is in the same vein. It asks rhetorically: what is to happen if the predictions about the child&#8217;s future all turn out to be wrong? </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.04in">When the court is considering capitalisation of spousal maintenance it has to make predictions about the future. It makes predictions about the applicant&#8217;s life expectancy, lack of prospects of remarriage, and needs. It makes predictions about the respondent&#8217;s economic stability, scale of wealth and liquidity. Often these predictions turn out to be wrong. Indeed, Mr Tim Lawrence, the creator of the Duxbury programme, which is invariably used in spousal capitalisation cases, often would remark that the one thing about Duxbury about which you could be certain is that it would give the wrong result. Unpredictable things happen. The reason the insurance industry exists is because unpredictable things happen. But one is generally able to make some predictions with a reasonable degree of accuracy. To take an extreme example, I can predict with 100% confidence that the sun will rise tomorrow. Other things are much more difficult to predict, obviously.

In theory, if the court was undertaking a spousal maintenance capitalisation, but wished nonetheless to preserve the entitlement of the wife to seek further periodical payments, then <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.31</ref>(7B)(c) allows the court  to withhold  a direction preventing the wife from doing so.

However this undertaking does demonstrate the clear intention of the wife to bring matters to an end and not to seek variation. </p>

In this case the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48" uk:canonical="1991 c. 48" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Support Act 1991</ref> did not apply as the husband was habitually resident in the USA. The combination of: (1) incessant litigation, on which the trial judge found the husband thrived, (2) repeated defaults on the part of the husband with the maintenance obligation, and (3) the age of the child and the relatively short period until the maintenance liability expired, all militated strongly in favour of a capitalisation and the ending of financial links between the parties. In the overwhelming majority of cases, however, the risks and uncertainties inherent in capitalisation will lead the court, where it has jurisdiction, to make, or continue, a traditional order for periodic payments. In most cases where the court is considering a variation of a child maintenance order the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48" uk:canonical="1991 c. 48" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Support Act 1991</ref> will potentially apply in the sense that it would be open to either party to apply for a statutory assessment under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48" uk:canonical="1991 c. 48" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, replacing the order, once 12 months had expired following the making of the order. As a general principle, it would not be a proper exercise of the court&#8217;s powers to capitalise periodical maintenance and to abrogate that right. Therefore, it seems to me that capitalisation could only properly be considered where <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48" uk:canonical="1991 c. 48" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1991 Act</ref> could not apply, because, for example, one of the parents or the child is habitually resident overseas, or because the child is over 19. </p>

There is a difference of &#163;1,700 between the parties, i.e. one month's payment. In July 2018 the wife&#8217;s open offer was that the lump sum should be &#163;77,800 based on a further 14 months of periodical payments at &#163;1,700 and then a  further 36 months (for a three-year degree) at &#163;1,500 per month. It appears that the confusion has arisen because the periodical payments are payable in advance. In July 2018, there were in fact only 13 months to go until M was to start university when the periodical payments would decrease to &#163;1,500 per month from September 2019 onwards. The husband's figure of &#163;76,100 is therefore correct ((1,700 x 13) + (1,500 x 36) = 76,100). </p>

The judgment of the trial judge makes clear that the remainder of the CGT fund should be divided equally between the parties. It is therefore only 50% of the remainder of the CGT fund, in other words the husband's portion, that should be appropriated and credited against the headline figure. As explained above, the husband is completely wrong to argue that 100% of the remainder of the CGT fund should be offset.  </p>

Obviously, this has not happened because the husband has not paid the lump sum and has only paid some of the periodic maintenance. I am assuming that the wife has supported M out of her own pocket while this case has ground on. The original calculation assumed that M would leave university at the end of August 2022, that is in 20 months from now. The original order of Moylan J provided that twothirds of the monthly maintenance would go direct to M once she was in University and indeed the &#163;44,000 was calculated by the trial judge on that basis. Therefore, on the basis that the multiplicand when at University is &#163;1,500, the sum to go direct to M each month should be &#163;1,000, giving rise to the sum of &#163;20,000 to be placed in M&#8217;s name, using a multiplier of 20.  </p>

Certainly that would be the position on a first appeal to the Court of Appeal and I cannot see why any different rule should apply on a first appeal to the High Court or the County Court. Even if the father had not made a Calderbank offer he would prima facie be entitled to his costs; the existence of his offer strengthens his case considerably.

I dismissed that application and held it to be totally without merit. Williams J had ordered the renewal application to be heard alongside the main appeal. The wife was therefore drawn into that process and needlessly incurred costs in relation to it. Further, on 16 March 2020 the wife made an open offer to settle the appeal. Essentially she sought that appellant should accept the decision of the trial judge; on that basis she would not seek any costs of the appeal. The husband did not respond with an open offer of his own. Although FPR PD 28A para 4.4 does not in terms apply to an appeal governed by r.28(2), in my judgment, an obligation to negotiate to compromise any piece of family litigation, including an appeal, should be recognised.

But I cannot say that the husband&#8217;s pursuit of the substantive appeal took the case out of the norm. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Does his failure to negotiate take the case out of the norm? I have come very close to deciding that it does. However,  in the absence of any specific provision in FPR PD 28A imposing a duty to negotiate in appeal proceedings I have, with some reluctance, decided that while the failure of the husband to negotiate reinforces his liability for standard costs, it does not elevate his liability to indemnity costs. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In my judgment the husband should pay the wife&#8217;s costs on the standard basis. It is appropriate that I should summarily assess them. In my judgment for the wife to recover 75% of her actual costs is a fraction that not only reflects the criterion of reasonableness but also the key principle  of proportionality pursuant to CPR PD 44 para 6.2. I therefore award the wife her costs and assess them in the sum of &#163;18,561. </p>
