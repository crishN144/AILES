	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">When a person has been adopted as a result of an order of the Court he/she begins a new life- there is a new family and old legal relationships are severed. The birth parents no longer have parental responsibility for the child. When that child has reached the age of 18 however he or she may choose to look up his/her birth roots, to see a parent perhaps or make investigations. Copy documents can often be seen from the court adoption file. There is a natural curiosity which the adopted child may well wish to be satisfied. The choice however is that of the child, not the birth family. Some birth parents may seek to trawl for their adopted child through Facebook and other social media, but much depends on the response of the child. There is no way through the courts a birth parent can ordinarily ensure contact with an adult who was adopted as a child.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">If the adopted person lacks the mental capacity to do so then it is inevitably so much the harder for him or her to investigate his/her background and birth family. In the case of CC, whose case is before me, it is doubtful she would have the capacity ever to do so. She was separated from her Mother when very young and adopted when about 6-18 months of age [I do not have the precise date].  She was born on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 1993 and is now therefore aged 20. She has partial lissencephaply, cerebral palsy and a weakness on the left side of her body. She has epilepsy and is learning disabled. Such evidence as I have that can be disclosed at this stage reveals she has some difficulty in understanding or weighing up the possible benefits or disadvantages of seeing her birth Mother. Certainly she requires significant support and prompting regarding her everyday skills. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The main application before the court is in fact not by CC but by her birth Mother RC. There was indirect contact between CC and RC until 2010/11 at a rate of 6 or 12 monthly letters, drawings, photographs and cards organised by the adoption agency [Birmingham City Council] through the adoptive Mother. That indirect contact stopped when the adoptive parents separated. By her application dated 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2012 to the Court of Protection RC applies to reintroduce such indirect contact. I suspect [but have not been formally told] that she would of course like direct contact in due course were it feasible.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The case is highly unusual in that ordinarily a birth parent cannot by application to a court reintroduce herself to a birth child after adoption. It is only CC&#8217;s incapacity that enables an application to be made.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The application is nonetheless properly brought and RC was granted permission to bring her application on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2012 by District Judge Jackson sitting at the Court of Protection in London. The matter was then transferred to Birmingham for determination. The fact that permission to bring the application was granted of course says nothing about the prospects of success in due course.</p>

The Judge also ordered X Local Authority to file and serve a report by its clinical psychologist setting out (a) the nature and extent of CC&#8217;s disabilities and (b) an assessment of CC&#8217;s capacity to litigate and to make decisions about contact (direct and indirect) with the Applicant. The report was to be served by 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> February 2013. The Official Solicitor raised no objection to this order. </p>

All the Applicant RC knows is that she is with her adoptive Father and his new Wife and family if any. The Official Solicitor further argues that the social worker&#8217;s evidence should not be disclosed at all. The matter can still be dealt with by Mr Fullwood, the Mother&#8217;s counsel, by revealing such evidence to him and injuncting him not to discuss such evidence with Mother but permitting him and not Mother to be in court when the social worker gives her evidence; so her evidence is tested but not revealed to Mother. Unsurprisingly Mr Fullwood inter alia argues that this will not mean that there will be a fair trial.</span></p>

Secondly, if the relevance test is satisfied, it is for the party or person in possession of the document or who would be adversely affected by its disclosure or inspection to assert exemption from disclosure or inspection. Thirdly, any ensuing dispute falls to be determined ultimately by a balancing exercise, having regard to the fair trial rights of the party seeking disclosure or inspection and the privacy or confidentiality rights of the other party and any person whose rights may require protection.

That gives a detailed picture of CC&#8217;s intellectual abilities, sets out up to date psychometric tests and their results, and draws careful conclusions about CC&#8217;s wishes and feelings as to contact. If the whole of the psychological report were disclosed then it would reveal the whereabouts of CC and the psychological services with which she is engaging. In other words I do not consider anything in that report in full assists RC any further but that it potentially invades CC&#8217;s present private life. RC can of course see the redacted psychological report. A more important question however is whether she should have access to the social work evidence:</p>

There is the argument that family life between birth Mother and daughter was severed many years ago. Adulthood does <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">not</span> restore that legal relationship. RC remains the biological Mother of CC but that is all.

If the relationship was not a potential one, relevant factors included the demonstrable interest in and commitment by the father to the child. But the court did <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">not</span> agree that mere biological kinship without further legal or factual elements should be sufficient to attract the protection of Article 8. Here it is plain that there is not a close personal relationship with CC. RC does not know her. Even the contact by correspondence ended four years ago. The fact of the correspondence cannot be said to have reintroduced some sort of family life for the purposes of Article 8. By contrast CC has a right to respect for family life; to her family life is with her adoptive Father and those she knows now as &#8216;family&#8217;. Although the point was not argued before me CC also has a right to respect for her private life, to live outside her biological family. I remind myself of the case of <span style="font-style:italic">K v LBX</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2012/79" uk:canonical="[2012] EWCA Civ 79" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWCA (Civ) 79</ref>.  In that case the Court of Appeal observed that in deciding residence [admittedly a very different type of dispute] the right approach under the 2005 Act was to ascertain the best interests of the incapacitated adult on the application of the section 4 checklist.  The judge should then ask whether the resulting conclusion amounts to a violation of Article 8 rights or if that violation is, nonetheless, necessary and proportionate. In that case Black LJ pointed out that:</p>

There is a danger it contains within it an inherent conflict for elements of private life, such as the right to personal development and the right to establish relationships with other human beings in the outside world, may not always be entirely compatible with the existing family life and particularly not with family life in the sense of continuing to live within the existing family home.&#8221;</span> Whilst that case concerned whether or not a party should live with his biological family the point is clear- here CC has a right to respect for her private life too- her Article 8 rights are not confined to a relationship with her biological Mother but include a right to respect for her privacy and to develop an adult life of her own.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">Are the Article 6 rights of RC engaged? Of course she has a right to a fair trial, of her application for contact with CC. I do not think the duty to promote equality of arms necessitates her to seeing these documents personally. She has access to the redacted psychological report and that evidence can be challenged as needs be. The social work evidence can be challenged in the manner I set out below. But she is not entitled to examine the private life of this vulnerable young woman; I am satisfied that it would be disturbing for CC for her rights to be invaded- her family is under strain. I do not consider it right for her to have to be told that private information had been divulged to a party whom in reality she does not know. It is right for the Official Solicitor in my judgment to seek to avoid any distress the knowledge of disclosure might cause CC. </p>

I take the view that Mr Chisholm is right- by limiting disclosure in this way I am denying only that which it is strictly necessary to deny. I do not consider that the social work evidence could in any feasible way be redacted.</p>
