The three subject children hold Irish passports. KT and CT were born in Ireland and LT in England. CT had only lived in Ireland until her removal to England in February of this year.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The application is brought by the maternal grandparents of the children, NT and RT (hereafter the &#8216;maternal grandparents&#8217;). The maternal grandparents contend that at the time the children were removed from the jurisdiction of Ireland they had, and were exercising, inchoate custody rights in respect of the children, and that the children were habitually resident in that jurisdiction, for the purposes of Art 3 of the 1980 Convention. The mother of the children is sadly deceased in circumstances that I will come to.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In opposing the application, the paternal grandparents assert that the maternal grandparents did not have inchoate rights of custody in respect of the children at the relevant time for the purposes of Art 3 of the 1980 Convention and, accordingly, cannot bring themselves within the terms of the Convention. They further contend that the children were not habitually resident in the Republic of Ireland immediately before they were retained in the jurisdiction of England and, once again, that in those circumstances the maternal grandparents cannot bring themselves within the terms of the Convention. Finally, the paternal grandparents rely on what they say was the consent of the maternal grandparents to the removal of the children from Ireland for the purposes of Art 13a of the Convention, on the assertion that a summary return of the children would result in a grave risk of exposing the children to physical or psychological harm or otherwise placing them in an intolerable situation for the purposes of Art 13b of the Convention and on the assertion that KT objects to returning for the purposes of Art 13 of the Convention. The father, who is presently serving a sentence of imprisonment in this jurisdiction and is due for release on 10 December 2021, supports the case advanced by his parents.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The children have been joined as parties to these proceedings. On behalf of the children, the Children&#8217;s Guardian submits that on the evidence before the court the maternal grandparents had inchoate rights of custody, and that the children were habitually resident in the Republic of Ireland, immediately prior to their retention in the jurisdiction of England and Wales. The Children&#8217;s Guardian further invites the court to consider whether KT objects to returning to the jurisdiction of the Republic of Ireland for the purposes of Art 13 of the Hague Convention.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The parents were married on 4 August 2009. The relationship was a fractious one and was characterised by a number of separations and reconciliations. The maternal grandparents allege that when the mother was seven months pregnant with KT the father assaulted her and left her on their doorstep. The maternal grandparents further assert that following this incident the mother and KT resided with them in Ireland for five years. In 2011 the father applied in the court in Ireland for custody of KT but was granted contact with KT at the home of the maternal great-grandparents. The maternal grandparents allege that this litigation followed the father abducting KT from the care of the mother.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The father has been the subject of a number of criminal convictions. In 2006 the father was convicted of assault with a weapon and sentenced to four years in prison. The father was again in custody between 2012 and 2015. In June 2015, following his release from custody, the father moved to Manchester. The parents reconciled and the mother moved to Manchester with KT in July 2015 to live with the father. In January 2016, Children&#8217;s Services undertook an assessment of the family. It was confirmed that the mother had a diagnosis of severe epilepsy which was poorly controlled, resulting in between one and four epileptic fits per day. There were concerns about the mother not complying with her medication, about an allegation that the paternal grandfather had been involved in a fight using an axe, which allegation he disputes, and about the father&#8217;s previous conviction of assault.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">On 29 October 2015, KT was taken into police protection following the arrest of the mother and was ultimately placed in the care of his father when the mother received a short custodial sentence for theft in November 2015. On 27 November 2015 the father was charged with rape. A further assessment of the family was carried out by the local authority on 19 June 2016 in light of this charge. The assessment identified difficulties with the parents being evasive and dishonest with professionals, the mother having registered her pregnancy with LT late and with the father refusing to allow KT to be seen alone by the assessing social worker.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">On 8 August 2016, care proceedings were issued in respect of KT and LT and those children were made the subject of interim care orders. At the conclusion of the care proceedings in March 2017, KT and LT were made the subject of six month supervision orders and returned to the care of the mother. During the course of proceedings paternal grandparents were the subject of a fostering assessment by the local authority, the outcome of which was negative. In April 2017 the father was found not guilty of rape. The parents, who had undergone a further period of separation, reconciled in November 2017. The maternal grandparents allege that during 2017 they travelled to England because the father was being violent towards the mother and not allowing her and the children to leave. In 2018 the father was convicted of theft, robbery and dangerous driving and sentenced to three years in prison. In February 2018 the mother returned to Ireland with all three children, where they remained until the mother&#8217;s untimely death. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The father was released from prison on 10 June 2020 but was recalled on 21 September 2020. There is an issue regarding the extent to which he remained in contact with the children in Ireland whilst he was in prison. The father contends that he called the children daily from prison but there is no evidence that this is the case. By contrast, the maternal grandparents assert that the father essentially disappeared from the lives of the mother and the children whilst he was incarcerated in England.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In July 2020, the mother registered as homeless in Ireland. The maternal grandparents submit that in order to secure a permanent home the mother was required to take this formal step and reside in accommodation for the homeless. Within this context, the mother and the children moved to a Salvation Army Hub in July 2020. On 11 November 2020 the mother and the children moved to a &#8216;Family Hub&#8217; in Ireland. The correspondence from this organisation suggests that the mother cared well for the children and that the maternal grandparents provided regular support for the mother and the children whilst they were staying at the Family Hub.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Tragically, on 21 January 2021 the mother passed away. The cause of death was given as sudden death in epilepsy. The mother&#8217;s death certificate wrongly stated that she was single, when in fact she remained married to the father at the time of her death. The paternal grandparents assert that this is evidence of the maternal grandparents seeking to cut the father and the paternal family out of the lives of the children. Upon the death of the mother all three children were immediately taken into the care of the maternal grandparents in Ireland. This occurred &#8220;within minutes&#8221; of the mother&#8217;s death being discovered, according to a letter from the Family Hub. Within this context, the maternal grandparents contend that they applied for Child Benefit in relation to the children. Whilst that application is not before the court, the court does have before it a letter dated 3 November 2021 recording the cessation of the claim for Child Benefit following the retention of the children in England.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The paternal grandparents contend that they travelled to Ireland by ferry on 22 January 2021 to attend the mother&#8217;s funeral. In their statement in the Hague proceedings, the paternal grandparents stated that there were no discussions about where the children would live at this point. This is confirmed by the maternal grandparents, who assumed therefore that it was agreed that the children would continue to reside with them. The paternal grandparents returned to England shortly after the funeral. The paternal grandmother later told this court in a statement dated 9 September 2021 that the children travelled with her to England on 30 January 2021. This was not true. At a hearing on 11 October 2021, after being made aware that an order would be sought for disclosure of the relevant passenger manifests from Irish Ferries, the paternal grandparents conceded that they in fact travelled with the children to England some two weeks later, on 13 February 2021. The maternal grandmother&#8217;s statement of 9 September 2021 exhibits to it a letter from the father which states he gave his permission on 22 January 2021 for his parents to bring the children back to England. The paternal grandmother further contended in this context that it was fully understood that she would be returning the children to England.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">On 11 February 2021, three weeks after the death of the mother and following there having been no discussions at the time of the mother&#8217;s funeral about where the children would live, the maternal grandparents attended the Family Court in Ireland to seek advice regarding formal custody and guardianship of the children and proceeded to make an application to the Irish District Court Office to be appointed as Guardians for the children and for an order for custody. In the circumstances, at the time the children were retained in England, the maternal grandparents had pending applications before the court in Ireland. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The paternal grandparents assert that they returned to Ireland around 10 or 11 February 2021, primarily to deal with the question of the mother&#8217;s headstone. Within this context, and as I have noted, the paternal grandparents now accept that, contrary to the earlier assertion of the paternal grandmother, it was in fact on 13 February 2021 that the children travelled to England. There is a dispute between the parties as to both the circumstances of the children&#8217;s travel to Manchester and the duration it was intended the children would remain in this jurisdiction. The maternal grandparents contend that they agreed through relatives that the children could spend a week in Manchester with the paternal grandparents, with the children being returned ahead of the first Mass for their mother, and that the paternal grandparents wrongfully retained the children in England after the agreed return date of 20 February 2021. By contrast, the paternal grandparents contend in their statement that on or around 10 or 11 February 2021 the maternal grandparents passed a request through third parties that the paternal grandparents take the children to England. Those third parties have not provided statements to that effect in these proceedings. The paternal grandparents assert that the father also wished the children to be brought to England and provided his consent in respect of this course.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Within the foregoing context, in determining which account is the more reliable, KT&#8217;s statement to Children&#8217;s Services is instructive, namely that he had understood that he was coming to Manchester for the holidays, although he was not sure how long for. It is also instructive, in circumstances where the paternal grandparents contend that there was an agreement for the children to reside permanently with them in England, that the children were removed from Ireland without their Irish passports or their birth certificates. As I will come to, when the matter eventually came before me on a without notice basis on 14 June 2021 the paternal grandfather misled the court about the amount of time the children had been in England prior to their arrival in this jurisdiction on 13 February 2021.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">On 22 February 2021, following the children not being returned, the maternal grandparents made contact with solicitors in Ireland. The maternal grandmother also reported to the Garda and TUSLA (the Irish Children&#8217;s Services) the wrongful retention of the children in England. It is of note that when reporting the removal of the children to TUSLA shortly after that occurred the maternal grandparents gave the same explanation that they now advance before this court, namely that it had been agreed that the children would spend a week in Manchester with their paternal grandparents, who had then failed to return them.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Having been adjourned on 4 March 2021 to effect service on the father, on 12 March 2021 the Family Court in Ireland granted an order appointing the maternal grandparents as the temporary joint guardians of the children and an order conferring joint custody of the children on the maternal grandparents. Within this context the paternal grandparents seek to suggest, by reference to the Notice of Applications filed with the Irish court by the maternal grandparents, that the maternal grandparents did not, in fact, have standing under Irish law for the orders that were granted to them on 12 March 2021. The paternal grandparents have not sought to adduce any expert evidence with respect to Irish law on this point. However, the application made by the maternal grandparents for guardianship was made under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, which Act, as revised, provides as follows:</p>

At the time the orders were granted by the Irish court on 12 March 2021, the mother was deceased and the father was imprisoned in England.

It is important to note that at that hearing, and as I have alluded to, in response to questions from this court designed to ascertain whether the children were habitually resident in this jurisdiction, the paternal grandfather stated to the court that each of the children had resided in the jurisdiction of England and Wales for the duration of their respective minorities, subject to periods of holiday in the jurisdiction of the Republic of Ireland. This has now been revealed to be patently untrue. By the time the case returned to this court on 22 July 2021 it had become apparent that, contrary to the information given to the Court in June 2021 by the paternal grandfather, prior to the untimely death of the mother in January 2021 the children had lived since February 2018 with their mother in Ireland and that KT had spent a period of some five years living in Ireland at an earlier point. In light of that information, this court made clear that the orders it made to maintain the <span style="font-style:italic">status quo</span> were henceforth being made pursuant to its protective jurisdiction under Article 11 of the Hague Convention 1996.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">On 9 July 2021, an attendance note from Irish counsel indicates that Judge Flann Brennan refused to strike out the Irish proceedings at the request of the paternal grandparents on the basis of the proceedings commenced by the paternal grandparents in England. However, on 23 July 2021 the Irish proceedings returned to the Family Court in Ireland. In circumstances that are not entirely clear, the proceedings were struck out by Judge Colm Roberts on that day. Neither the order or the learned Judge&#8217;s reasons have been available to this court, albeit that Judge Roberts ordered on 23 July 2021 the disclosure of a transcript of the hearing to this court. However, again from an attendance note provided by Irish counsel acting on behalf of the maternal grandparents, it would appear that the proceedings were struck out on the technical ground that the proceedings had not been properly served on the father and on the jurisdictional ground the proceedings should properly be before the English court. The attendance note records that Judge Roberts nonetheless expressed the view as to the merits that the children&#8217;s habitual residence was in Ireland and that they may well have been removed from Ireland unlawfully, but that these were now matters for the English court to decide.</p>

Where the existence of rights of custody is disputed, the question of whether the position created by the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention equated to &#8216;rights of custody&#8217; for the person in question having regard to the meaning of the term &#8216;rights of custody&#8217; as established by the autonomous law of the 1980 Hague Convention should, ordinarily, be adjudicated upon by the court of the requesting State at the highest level, but for expediency may be dealt with by a court at a lower level, following a referral pursuant to Art 15 (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re T (Abduction: Rights of Custody) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 2 FLR 1794" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 2 FLR 1794</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re D (Abduction: Rights of Custody)</span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 1 FLR 961" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 1 FLR 961</ref>).

She asserts that the existing court orders gave her the legal right to determine where the children's residence should be. In directions ordered by Ryder J on 10 December 2007, as well as providing for the service of evidence and a Cafcass officer's report in respect of the children also advanced (see below), it was ordered that there be joint instruction of a Polish expert regarding the question of whether the father had rights of custody on which to base the proceedings, such report to be filed and served by 21 January 2008. That report has not in fact been obtained, owing apparently to difficulties in obtaining the services of a Polish lawyer. However, the parties are anxious that the matter should be disposed of promptly, as indeed is the duty of the court, and they proposed that I proceed with the hearing.</p>

I am mindful of the observations of the editors of the Family Court Practice 2007 at p 509 that where there is an issue whether the foreign law gives the applicant custody rights or not, the court should resist the temptation to make its own findings as to the foreign laws applicable and should be reluctant to allow rights of access to a child to metamorphose into rights of custody. In my view, evidence is particularly desirable, in a situation where, without it, the court is obliged to form its own conclusion upon the basis of a series of orders translated into English without the assistance of expert evidence as to the nuances of the wording, or guidance as to the nature or extent of the rights of the parties under the relevant law. That said, however, in the light of the parties' readiness to proceed and in particular the willingness of the father, as the party upon whom the burden of the issue lies, I propose to accept the parties' invitation because, in the event, the position seems to me to be susceptible of decision with reasonable confidence.&#8221;</p>

I accept that a consent to the removal of children within Art 13 does not have to include a consent to their removal on the particular day, or by the particular means or more generally in the particular circumstances, on, by or in which the other parent elects to remove them. Nevertheless a clandestine removal will usually be indicative of the absence in reality of subsistence of the consent; see, for example, the judgment of my Lord in this court in P v P (Abduction: Acquiescence) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1998] 2 FLR 835" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">[1998] 2 FLR 835</ref> at 836H&#8211;837A.&#8221;</p>

Further, and importantly, during the hearing no party, including the party who resists the existence of inchoate rights of custody, has pursued an application to adduce expert evidence with respect to the legal position in the Republic of Ireland, nor to suggest that the case should be adjourned to permit a referral to be made to the Irish court pursuant to Art 15 of the Convention. Within this context, at the hearing both sets of grandparents proceeded on the basis that the court will decide the central issue of inchoate rights of custody on the evidence currently available to it, applying the test set out in the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Re K</span>.

It is not disputed that immediately upon the tragic death of the mother, the maternal grandparents assumed the care of each of the children in Ireland. Within this context, the maternal grandparents assumed complete responsibility for the primary care of the children on 21 January 2021 in circumstances where there was no other person with legal responsibility for the children available to care for them. Until the retention of the children in England, in what I am satisfied was a blatant case of child abduction, the maternal grandparents continued to have sole responsibility for the primary care of each child. </p>

However, I heard no submissions on this point and accordingly make no determination in respect of it). The application of the maternal grandparents was advanced in the context of both the maternal grandparents and the paternal grandparents accepting that there was no discussion at the time of the mother&#8217;s funeral regarding the care of the children and the maternal grandparents therefore proceeded on the basis of no arrangement subsisting other than the children remaining in their care. Within this context, the maternal grandparents also secured and retained the official documents in respect of the children, including their Irish passports and birth certificates. </p>

It would appear to be correct that, notwithstanding his incarceration, under Irish law the father continued to have a legally recognised right to determine where the children should live and how they should be brought up and, as I have noted, that the father&#8217;s &#8220;custody rights&#8221; were not suspended by the fact of his prison sentence but merely curtailed. However, and within that context, it is equally plain, as a matter of fact, that by reason of his continued imprisonment in England he was not sharing, because he could not share, in the responsibilities entailed in the primary care of the children.</p>

On one interpretation, the father had not deliberately abandoned the children but rather was simply prevented from assuming his responsibilities by virtue of his custodial sentence. However, on balance I am prepared to accept the argument advanced by the maternal grandparents and the Children&#8217;s Guardian that the father has, by engaging in criminal activity leading to an extended period of incarceration, abandoned the children for the purposes of the test set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Re K</span>. The father&#8217;s involvement in criminal activity was not, on the evidence before the court, in any sense involuntary, and within that context the fact that he was absent from the lives of the children as a result of being convicted for that criminal activity falls properly within the concept of abandonment for the purposes of the test in <span style="font-style:italic">Re K</span>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">For reasons I will come to, I am satisfied that it is plainly the case on the evidence before the court that each of the children was habitually resident in the Republic of Ireland at the time they were retained in England by the paternal grandparents. Within this context, with respect to legal or official recognition the evidence before the court indicates that the &#8216;Family Hub&#8217; which was accommodating the mother and the children before the mother&#8217;s untimely death were satisfied that it was appropriate for the children to be placed in the care of the maternal grandparents. More importantly, through a document notifying the maternal grandparents that their claim for child benefits was being terminated, there is evidence of State recognition of the position of the maternal grandparents, the payment of State child-related benefits being one of the examples expressly contemplated by the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Re K</span>. Within this context, I accept the submission of the maternal grandparents and the Children&#8217;s Guardian that that correspondence is sufficient to evidence a degree of official recognition for the purposes of the test in <span style="font-style:italic">Re K</span>. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In addition, I am satisfied that the position of the maternal grandparents was also officially recognised in law by the fact that they had <span style="font-style:italic">locus standi</span> to issue an application for guardianship and custody of the children in the Irish court. That application was accepted by the court as validly issued and was listed for hearing, orders ultimately being made in favour of the maternal grandparents both in respect of guardianship and custody. Whilst, as I will come to, the proceedings were ultimately struck out, this does not appear to have been for reasons to do with <span style="font-style:italic">locus standi</span>. Within this context, I am not able to accept the submission of the paternal grandparents that the maternal grandparents did not in fact have standing to apply for the orders they did. That submission is based on the Notice of Application but is more properly considered by reference to the Irish statute that governs the application. Adopting the latter approach, and whilst the court must be <span style="font-style:italic">extremely</span> cautious about making findings in respect of Irish law, as I have set out above it is tolerably clear on the face of the Irish statute, and more importantly from the ultimate outcome of the maternal grandparents&#8217; application, that the maternal grandparents had <span style="font-style:italic">locus standi</span> to apply for the orders they did on the basis that, from the Irish Statute, the discretion of the Irish court to grant a guardianship order and a custody order is a wide one, including in circumstances where the child has no parent or guardian who is willing or able to exercise the rights and responsibilities of guardianship in respect of the child.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">First, the court has conclusive evidence that this is the step that was <span style="font-style:italic">in fact</span> taken by the Irish court in making orders on 12 March 2021, albeit after the children had been retained in England. It must be assumed by this court that the Irish court granted those orders on a principled basis. Second, in circumstances where the children were Irish nationals who had resided in the Republic of Ireland for a period of over three years, who were plainly habitually resident in that jurisdiction and who had been placed in the care of maternal grandparents who had been heavily involved with the children prior to the sudden death of the mother, there is in any event every reason to believe that such orders would have been granted if the case had come before the Irish court prior to the retention of the children in England. Third, for the reasons set out in the foregoing paragraph, I am not able to accept the submission of the paternal grandparents that the maternal grandparents did not in fact have standing to apply for the orders they did. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Finally in relation to the final part of the test in <span style="font-style:italic">Re K</span>, I am satisfied that the fact that the proceedings were subsequently struck out by Judge Colm Roberts on 23 July 2021 does not act to alter the conclusion that there is every reason to believe that, had the application of the maternal grandparents for guardianship and custody orders been heard by the Irish court prior to or at the time of the retention of the children in England, the Irish courts would at that time have preserved the <span style="font-style:italic">status quo</span> for the time being. Whilst it has not been possible to obtain a copy of the Irish order of 23 July 2021 or a transcript of that hearing, it is clear from the attendance note provided by the maternal grandparents&#8217; Irish counsel that the basis of the proceedings being struck out was not the merits of the application, but rather technical considerations of service and the question of jurisdiction in circumstances where the paternal grandparents had commenced proceedings in England. Within this context, it is again of note that Judge Colm Roberts appears to have observed at the hearing on 23 July 2021 that the children were likely habitually resident in Ireland and that the retention by the paternal grandparents was likely unlawful. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">For the reasons I have set out above, I am on balance satisfied that at the time the children were retained in England by the paternal grandparents on 20 February 2021 the maternal grandparents had inchoate rights of custody in respect of the children and were exercising those rights. Within the context of the need to give the term &#8220;rights of custody&#8221; in Art 3 of the 1980 Hague Convention an autonomous interpretation, I am satisfied that the foregoing conclusion also is consistent with the twin purposes of the Hague Convention, protecting the child from the harmful effects of international child abduction by recognising that he should not be peremptorily removed from their care and enabling the courts of the child&#8217;s habitual residence to determine where his long-term future should lie.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">As I have already referred to, I am further satisfied that there can be no principled basis for contending that the children were not habitually resident in the Republic of Ireland immediately prior to the retention of the children in England on 20 February 2021. As at that date, each of these Irish national children had been resident in Ireland for 3 years, CT having never lived anywhere other than that jurisdiction. They were well integrated into their maternal family and in the wider community. Within this context, it is plain on the face of the evidence before the court that each of the children had achieved some degree of integration in a social and family environment immediately prior to the paternal grandparents retaining them in England. The fact that the mother and children had moved into the &#8216;Family Hub&#8217; as the necessary precursor to securing independent accommodation does not act to change that conclusion. During that period the children remained in their community in Ireland, in the care of the mother and with regular and extensive contact with the maternal grandparents. </p>

Whilst the question of consent must be viewed in the context of the realities of the disintegration of family life, the answer to the ultimate question of whether the maternal grandparents consented to the retention of the children must be &#8216;no&#8217;. With respect to the consent purported to be given by the father, having regard to the terms of Art 13 of the Hague Convention, the father was not, at the time the children were retained in England by the paternal grandparents, &#8220;the person having care of the person of the child&#8221; and therefore I am satisfied having regard to the terms of the Convention that his consent was not operative for the purposes of Art 13a, nor has the father sought to argue that it was.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I am likewise satisfied that the paternal grandparents cannot make out the exception under Art 13b of the Convention, namely that there is a grave risk that the return of each child to the Republic of Ireland would expose that child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place them in an intolerable situation. The allegations made by the paternal grandparents to make good this contention are limited to an assertion that the maternal grandparents were irresponsible in allowing the mother to care for the children on her own in light of her epilepsy, that KT had not accessed education whilst in the care of the mother and, perhaps ironically, that the maternal grandfather is &#8220;involved in criminal activity&#8221;. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The exception under Art 13b looks to the future. The court is required to consider the situation as it would be if the child were returned forthwith to his or her home country, the answer to which question will be informed by what protective measures can be put in place to ensure that the child is not exposed to physical or psychological harm or otherwise placed in an intolerable situation. Within this context, required as I am to make a reasoned and reasonable assumption of the risk of harm at its highest and, if that risk meets the test in Art 13(b), go on to consider whether protective measures sufficient to mitigate harm can be identified, I am not satisfied that the matters advanced by the maternal grandparents even reach the threshold of Art 13b. Further, the evidence before the court indicates that there were no concerns in Ireland with the involvement of the maternal grandparents in the lives of the mother and the children, or with the care of the children by the maternal grandparents following the death of the mother. The children did not report any concerns about their life in Ireland to the Children&#8217;s Guardian. With respect to the disruption of the children caused by a return order being made, in the context of an already disrupted and difficult period in their lives, does not amount to a situation that meets the imperatives of Art 13b of the Convention. As made clear in <span style="font-style:italic">Re E (Children)(Abduction: Custody Appeal)</span> at [34]) it is important to remember that every child has to put up with a degree of discomfort and distress and that there will be a degree of psychological harm inherent in a return order being made. Within this context, the children will be returning to carers who provided them with immediate care and support following the death of their mother, supported by other agencies in doing so, which care and support was only interrupted by the wrongful retention perpetrated by the paternal grandparents. For these reasons, I am satisfied that the exception provided by Art 13b is not made out.</p>

In considering whether KT objects to being returned and has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of his or her views I of course acknowledge that he said to the Children&#8217;s Guardian that he did not want to return to Ireland. Against this however, KT was unable to articulate why this was the case.

In this regard, I again note the view of the Children&#8217;s Guardian that KT expressed a preference to remain in England with his paternal grandparents and father when he is released from prison and stated that he did not want to return to Ireland. KT did not however, recount any negative experiences from Ireland, and that it was difficult to gain a sense from KT whether his resistance to being returned that jurisdiction stems only from having become settled and familiar in his current environment. Having regard to these matters, I am on a fine balance, not satisfied that KT&#8217;s views amount to an objection for the purposes of Art 13 of the 1980 Convention.</p>
