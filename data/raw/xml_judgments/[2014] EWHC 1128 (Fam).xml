However, as much information as can be obtained about him should be included in the report and the local authority are obliged to set out if in its view any person not a party should be joined. As part of its investigation the local authority is required to obtain the views of both parents with regard to the adoption and contact post adoption, which imports an expectation that the local authority will speak to both parents irrespective of whether the father has parental responsibility. </span></p>
