I will set out all of the grounds below, but I make the initial observation that grounds of appeal, whether drafted by professional representatives or by litigants in person must be few, short and clear. The experience of the High Court, since the majority of family appeals were devolved to it, has been to struggle in case after case with diffuse, unstructured streams of consciousness purporting to represent grounds of appeal. A ground of appeal need do no more than to identify succinctly why it is said that in a given respect the judge was wrong. It does not need to give copious particulars as to why the judge was wrong, let alone to give the drafter&#8217;s opinion about the alleged wrongness.</p>

The wife works full-time for the Bank of England earning &#163;56,000 gross p.a.; the husband currently works part-time as a wine-waiter earning &#163;800 pm. The only asset of substance in the case is a 3% shareholding held by the wife in a company whose main business (which started about 40 years ago) is hotels, owned principally by her father and uncle. The wife&#8217;s shareholding, given to her prior to the parties&#8217; relationship, was agreed to be non-matrimonial. Since the separation the husband has accumulated huge personal and corporate liabilities and his business has gone into, and remains in, insolvent administration.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;I heard the evidence in December 2022 but there was insufficient time for final submissions and judgment. Neither party complied with my directions for the filing of written submissions with the result that I did not have the last of them until 21 January 2023 and had lost the time I had allocated for writing this judgment. There was then a dispute about whether the contents of the submissions on behalf of the husband constituted fresh evidence. This in turn resulted in an application to adduce fresh evidence which the wife, of course, opposed. The application was heard on 7 March 2023. Inevitably, there was then a significant delay in producing a judgment caused partly by my judicial commitments in another court. I regret the delay on my part.</p>

On 12 April 2023, the day before my draft judgment was going out, the husband issued a further application for permission to adduce further fresh evidence and seeking a stay on judgment for 2 months to allow for, potentially, even further evidence. This was followed rapidly by the wife lodging a witness statement in response.&#8221;</p>

While the wife&#8217;s shareholding was valued by the SJE at &#163;20.9m on a pure pro rata basis, as a 3% shareholder (and not a director) the wife&#8217;s position was not that of a quasi-partner. Therefore, her shares could not be valued on a pro rata basis. A 75% discount was appropriate. However, it was &#8220;unlikely in the extreme that the wife&#8217;s family would agree to a sale at that, or any significant, level of discount&#8221;.</p>

As a result, on each occasion judgment was delayed. On 7 March 2023 the judge admitted and considered the evidence on the first application. She found that it made no difference to her judgment. On the second occasion, she read the evidence <span style="font-style:italic">de bene esse</span> but excluded it as being &#8220;of no assistance&#8221;, being &#8220;entirely speculative and based on wishful thinking&#8221; and refused his application for an adjournment, as &#8220;this case .. has dragged on for long enough&#8221; and &#8220;there is no certainty that the position will be any clearer in two months&#8217; time&#8221; and further that &#8220;there is a need for finality&#8221;. The court found that &#8220;any significant award made to the husband is likely to go to his creditors&#8221; and that &#8220;no reasonable person would think that [the wife underwriting the husband&#8217;s debts] was fair in circumstances where all the debt was acquired post-separation as a result of wholly imprudent business decisions taken by the husband alone&#8221;. She found that the husband will be &#8220;less likely to be made bankrupt if he has no capital funds&#8221;. Moreover, the wife did not have the funds to pay a significant capital sum to the husband.</p>

The judge explained painstakingly why an order requiring a property to be purchased for the husband&#8217;s occupation with the children during their minority was the appropriate solution. The judge also justified with the utmost care the appropriate level of housing.</p>

The TWM order can extend to the PTA application as a whole or to individual Grounds. It is a mistake to think that such an order involves making some kind of adverse moral judgment about the appeal.

The terms of FPR 1.1(2), which give effect to the overriding objective of dealing with cases justly, are extremely important. They require cases to be heard expeditiously; proportionately (as regards the nature, importance and complexity of the issues); on a level playing field; economically; and within an appropriate allotment of the court&#8217;s time taking into account the need to allocate time to other cases. This means that where a time estimate has been provided, it is incumbent on the parties to strain every sinew to ensure that the case is concluded within that time estimate (which includes allowing time for the writing of the judgment) and that it does not spill over, as happened in this case, to a later date for submissions to be made and for the judgment be written.</p>

One consequence may well be that another case will be thrown out of the list. Another is that parties, as here, often seem to think that the delay opens the door to the adducing of further evidence. A further downside is that the evidence about facts in issue begins to fade from the judicial memory. And obviously, circumstances can change during the interregnum.</p>

If it does happen, then there must be very strict terms applied to avoid the occurrence of the events that took place in this case. Here, the husband seemed to think that the delay allowed the door to be opened for him to adduce new evidence to seek to reverse the direction in which he conceived the judicial wind was blowing.</p>

While the marriage subsisted the common law imposed a duty on a husband to support his wife. In&#160;<span style="font-style:italic">Gurasz v Gurasz</span>&#160;<ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1970] P 11" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1970">[1970] P 11</ref> Lord Denning MR said this was a feature of family life "elemental in our society". Thus in the absence of a power to dissolve a marriage the courts, both common law and Ecclesiastical, enforced that duty by making long term maintenance awards. Prior to the advent of judicial divorce in 1857 a divorce could only be obtained by a private Act of Parliament. The terms of such an Act would invariably require that the husband make some suitable, albeit moderate, provision for his former wife. So there was some kind of precedent for post-divorce alimony.&#8221; </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The moral or ethical issue arises equivalently where the award is singular but meets needs that arise long after the end of the marriage, whether for housing or income. Thus, the moral question arises where a Duxbury lump sum is awarded, for by its very nature, the award meets needs that arise decades into the future, at a time when the marriage has receded into the very depths of history. A Duxbury lump sum is calculated to fund expenditure for a period that corresponds to the recipient&#8217;s life expectancy as stated in the life tables. In that period the recipient may remarry, or even die, but there is no claw-back for the payer in either such event.</p>

When made, such an award <span style="font-style:italic">ex hypothesi</span> goes far further than meeting the recipient&#8217;s immediate housing needs, when, for example, the children of the marriage still need accommodation. That is a classically legitimate need to which tthe other party ought to contribute. But an outright award invariably meets housing needs for periods long after the children are grown-up. Again, there is no claw-back when the recipient dies. She can leave the property, the cost of which was awarded to her to meet her lifetime needs, to whoever she wants in her will.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;In&#160;<span style="font-style:italic">Miller&#160;</span>Baroness Hale at para 138 explained that the most common rationale for imposing the obligation to maintain into the future is to meet needs which the relationship has generated. Obviously this is a very sound rationale and it is for this reason that the factors of duration of marriage and the birth of children are so important. It is hard to see how a relationship has generated needs in the case of a short childless marriage, although this is not impossible. But where it can be argued that the relationship has generated hard needs why should meeting them be for longer than, say, the Scottish limit? The answer is best given by Lord Hope at para 118 where he explains why the Scottish limit is so unfair: "the career break which results from concentrating on motherhood and the family in the middle years of their lives comes at a price which in most cases is irrecoverable". For many women the marriage is the defining economic event of their whole lives and the decisions made in it may well reverberate for many years after its ending.&#8221; </p>

In my respectful opinion, it is within consideration of the needs principle that &#8220;compensation&#8221; is best considered, that concept being synonymous with the idea of a relationship-generated-disadvantage. However, the impact of that factor has to be weighed against the obvious duty of the claimant for a needs award to take all reasonable steps to mitigate her dependency. </p>

In other words, the Court of Appeal was acknowledging the significance of the rule change in 2009 and identifying the essential task for the court as being &#8211; and this in a case where the issue was whether or not there should be anonymisation &#8211; to undertake the balancing exercise mandated by the Convention. The ratio of the decision was that both the first instance and appeal judgments would be published without anonymity, in particular because, having undertaken the balancing exercise, the husband had behaved badly. The general practice favouring anonymisation was not an essential reason for the decision; on the contrary that practice was of no relevance to the specific facts of that case which in the final analysis, were decisive. Those specific facts meant that anonymisation would not be applied. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is elementary that the rule of <span style="font-style:italic">stare decisis</span> does not apply if the legislative framework in respect of which the supposedly binding earlier decision was made, has materially changed. In <span style="font-style:italic">Lykiardopulo</span> the proceedings before Baron J had been heard behind closed doors, before the momentous rule change of 27 April 2009 which allowed the press in. The new rules allowed journalists to report what they heard, unless a specific order were made either restricting that freedom or excluding them altogether from the proceedings (see my judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Xanthopoulos v Rakshina</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2022/30" uk:canonical="[2022] EWFC 30" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2022">[2022] EWFC 30</ref> at [113] &#8211; [116]). In <span style="font-style:italic">Lykiardopulo</span>, Thorpe LJ acknowledged at [28] the parties&#8217; expectations of complete secrecy based on the law and practice before February 2009, when the hearings before Baron J concluded. Given that two months later the law then changed so profoundly by allowing a section of the public (i.e. the press and latterly legal bloggers) access to the proceedings, it is impossible to see how any current binding principle can be deduced from the decision. The decision was made under a completely different legal regime as to who could attend hearings and what could be reported.</p>

On the contrary, all that was needed for the Court of Appeal to reach its decision, was for it to find (as it plainly did) that that husband had not provided clear and cogent evidence why, in the light of his conduct, the decision should be anonymised. </p>
