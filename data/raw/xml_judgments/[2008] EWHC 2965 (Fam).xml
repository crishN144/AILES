From then until August 2003 they both worked in the Netherlands, where their only child, a son, H, was born in May 2002. In August 2003 the mother&#8217;s employment took her to London, where she moved with H. The father remained in the Netherlands until February 2005 when he joined the mother and H in this country. From November 2005 until July 2007 the family lived and worked in Scotland. In August 2007 they moved to the Netherlands and H started at the American School there. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Coincidentally, on 14 May 2008 both the mother and the father started proceedings. The mother issued a divorce petition in the Principal Registry (FD08D02235) based on the English domicile of both parties. (At that time both parties were still living in the Netherlands (see below) and, as the father would have it, habitually resident there. In these circumstances he characterises the mother&#8217;s issue of a petition in this country as &#8216;forum shopping&#8217;, presumably, he says, with a view to her achieving a more favourable financial settlement.) The father, for his part, applied to the District Court of the Hague for &#8216;provisional measures&#8217;, seeking the care of H, the exclusive use of the former matrimonial home in the Netherlands and maintenance for both himself and H. An important element of the father&#8217;s case was that he did not consider it to be in H&#8217;s interest to move yet again, which would, he said, involve H moving to another school and leaving behind his new friends. The following day, 15 May 2008, and whilst unaware of the father&#8217;s application in the Netherlands, the mother applied to the Principal Registry for a residence order (FD08P00949). </p>

I need not go into all the details. In the upshot, the father conceded in a letter from his solicitors dated 10 September 2008 that the divorce should proceed in this jurisdiction. Decree nisi was pronounced by the District Judge on 6 October 2008. The ancillary relief proceedings continue; the mother had issued her Form A on 4 July 2008 and the FDR is fixed for 3 December 2008.</p>

On 13 November 2008 the mother&#8217;s solicitor appeared before the District Judge of the day who, upon production of the letter, listed the matter for &#8220;a directions hearing&#8221; before a High Court Judge with a time estimate of 30 minutes.</p>

I am told that, in the course of a conversation between counsel on 24 November 2008, Mr Michael Glaser, who appeared before me on behalf of the father, told Ms Sharon Segal, who appeared on behalf of the mother, that he would be seeking a final determination and summary dismissal of the application at the forthcoming hearing. The stance of the father&#8217;s solicitors was reinforced by a letter the next day, 25 November 2008, putting her solicitors on notice that they would be seeking costs against the mother in relation to the hearing two days later and serving on them a statement of costs.</p>

We both sit as judges, albeit in our respective national jurisdictions, seeking faithfully to implement, in the interests of the families before us, as also in the common interest of all the peoples of the European Union, the principles set out in Brussels II bis. Principle and judicial comity alike require that I should give full faith and credit to the decision of the Hague court. I have no hesitation in doing so here. If I may say so with respect, its decision on the Article 15 point in the present case is eminently understandable; indeed, I strongly suspect that, had our respective roles been reversed, I would myself have come to precisely the same conclusion on the materials available on 19 June 2008.</p>

After all, he says, a dispute about a child&#8217;s schooling does not of itself necessarily raise any issue about the child&#8217;s residence. Using English terms of art, an issue as to schooling is usually resolved by a specific issue order, not by a residence order. In the circumstances of this case, the resolution of any issue about H&#8217;s schooling is not of itself, he says, going to determine whether H continues to live in the Netherlands with his father or in this country with his mother &#8211; and even if this were to turn out to be critical in that connection that is not, of itself, he says, any reason for taking away from the court currently seised of jurisdiction in the matter &#8211; the Hague court &#8211; the responsibility of determining the issue. And the mere existence of such a dispute cannot, he says, justify re-opening the Article 15 issue, with which, in truth, it has no meaningful connection. The key point is that H remains in and habitually resident in the Netherlands. That fact gave the Hague court jurisdiction in accordance with Article 8 and, to repeat, underpinned its decision as recently as 19 June 2008 to refuse the mother&#8217;s application under Article 15.</p>

Why, he asks rhetorically, did the mother not at that stage make the application which she is now, belatedly, pursuing under Article 15(2)(c)? In fact he goes further: he says that it is an abuse of the process for the mother to seek to revive an application which she withdrew as recently as July 2008. And, he says, the court cannot and should not permit what are essentially the same proceedings to continue simultaneously in two jurisdictions, least of all in the face of Article 17 of Brussels II bis. </p>

As he points out, if I go down the route which Ms Segal invites me to travel, there will first have to be a hearing in this court to determine whether it should accede to the mother&#8217;s request that it makes an application to the Hague court under Article 15(2)(c); there will then, if that application is successful, have to be a further hearing at which the Hague court will have to decide whether or not to accede to the English court&#8217;s request; and only then would this court, if the Hague court decided to accede to its request, be able to give directions with a view to the substantive hearing of the mother&#8217;s applications for residence or contact. Such delay, he says, cannot be in H&#8217;s interests. And, he asks rhetorically, all for what? With, as it seems to me, a degree of understatement, Mr Glaser suggests that it is far from clear that the Hague court would in fact accede to any request from this court; after all, as he points out, H remains in the Netherlands and, as we have seen, the main reason why the Hague court decided as it did on 19 June 2008 was precisely that H &#8220;has his place of residence in the Netherlands.&#8221;</p>

More pertinently, perhaps, he speculates as to why it is that the mother wishes the proceedings in relation to H to be heard here rather than in the Netherlands. Does she consider the English court to be more favourable to mothers? Does she consider that the Hague court has made a wrong decision (in which case, as he points out, her remedy is to appeal)? Is it because if the proceedings were in this country it would be easier for her? None of these reasons, whatever their intrinsic merit, is of itself, he submits, a reason for transfer, given the framework of Article 15.</p>

It follows from this that the role of the English court is limited. All it can do is make an application to the Hague court under Article 15(2)(c). It is then for the Hague court to decide whether or not to exercise its powers under Article 15(1).

More particularly, it is against this background that one has to consider the circumstances in which, in a case such as this, the court of another Member State &#8211; here the English court &#8211; can properly exercise its power under Article 15(2)(c) to make an application to the court &#8211; here the Hague court &#8211; having jurisdiction where, as here, the court with jurisdiction has already addressed the Article 15 issue, albeit, as here, on an application made by one of the parties under Article 15(2)(a) (a topic which was not considered in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S-R (Jurisdiction: Contact) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 2 FLR 1741" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 2 FLR 1741</ref>).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Segal submits that there is nothing in Article 15 to prevent the English court acting under Article 15(2)(c), nor to prevent the Hague court again considering the matter under Article 15(1), merely because the Hague court has already considered the earlier application made by the mother under Article 15(2)(a). I agree with this as an abstract proposition, whilst emphasising that the circumstances in which it would be proper for the English court to take this step in a case where the foreign court has already ruled on the Article 15 issue are likely to be very few and far between. </p>

I agree. In particular, I do not think that the English court can properly exercise its powers under Article 15(2)(c) in a case where the foreign court has already considered the issue under Article 15 unless good cause &#8211; very good cause &#8211; is shown for taking what will, almost inevitably, be an unusual and often exceptional step. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mere fact that the English court may disagree with the decision of the foreign court, the mere fact that, had roles been reversed, the English court might or even would have reached a different decision, surely cannot be enough. After all, as I have pointed out, Article 15 confers the power to make the substantive decision under Article 15(1) on the court &#8220;having jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter&#8221; &#8211; in this case the Hague court &#8211; and the other court &#8211; here the English court &#8211; must not arrogate to itself a function properly within the exclusive jurisdiction of the foreign court. On the contrary, the duty of the English court under the scheme of Brussels II bis is loyally to follow the ruling of the foreign court and not to assert jurisdiction when jurisdiction is vested in the foreign court: see Article 17.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, proper regard for the requirements of Brussels II bis and a proper adherence to the essential philosophy underlying it, requires that the test to be met is a stringent one. After all, too ready a willingness on the part of the court to accede to an application such as the one currently before me can only be destructive of the system enshrined in Brussels II bis and lead to the protracted and costly battles over jurisdiction which it is the very purpose of Brussels II bis to avoid.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is not, in my judgment, enough to demonstrate that the changed circumstances might persuade the foreign court to relinquish jurisdiction under Article 15. What has to be shown, as it seems to me, is that the circumstances now are such as so entirely to change the aspect of the case as to make it highly probable that the court seised of the case will, despite having already refused an application under Article 15, now come to a different decision and relinquish the case to the court which has made the request under Article 15(2)(c). In my judgment it must be shown that the change in circumstances is likely to be decisive.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, and despite everything put so clearly and cogently before me by Ms Segal, the contrary case put by Mr Glaser is really unanswerable. In relation to two of the alleged changes in circumstances he has demonstrated convincingly, and by reference to the Hague court&#8217;s own reasoning, that they are no such thing. And in relation to the third matter &#8211; the alleged change in H&#8217;s circumstances &#8211; he has provided convincing arguments, with which I agree, as to why, even if the mother is correct, these are matters to be ventilated before the Hague court, as the court seised of the proceedings, and not matters which justify re-visiting Article 15. In substance I agree with and accept Mr Glaser&#8217;s arguments.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, and even putting the mother&#8217;s case at its highest, it falls far short of meeting the stringent test which she must meet if she is to justify this court requesting the Hague court to re-visit its decision under Article 15. The changes in the circumstances upon which she relies come nowhere near entirely changing the aspect of the case, and the prospect that the Hague court, if requested to reconsider the matter by this court, would come to any decision different from that which it reached on 19 June 2008 is, in my judgment, small &#8211; very small. So the mother fails by a large margin to satisfy the relevant test. I go further. Even if it were enough for the mother to establish that she has a reasonable prospect of persuading the Hague court to that course &#8211; and that, I repeat, is not the test &#8211; she would not, in my judgment, be able to meet even that much less stringent test.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Segal very fairly accepts that she was on notice that Mr Glaser would be seeking summary dismissal. The parties were not, in the event, confined to the 30 minutes envisaged by the District Judge and Ms Segal had, I am satisfied, more than adequate time to elaborate her submissions. The fact is that the argument on both sides was, to all intents and purposes, just as detailed as it would have been if I had adjourned matters for the further hearing envisaged by Ms Segal. And Ms Segal was not able to suggest that, were the mother given an opportunity to file evidence, she would be in a position to canvass, except perhaps in slightly more detail, any matters going beyond those which she has in fact put before me. There was, for example, no suggestion that the opportunity to file evidence would lead to the identification of any other changes in circumstances then those relied upon by Ms Segal. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">What purpose would thus have been served by adjourning the matter? In my judgment, none. This is not a case in which Ms Segal&#8217;s submissions disclosed matters, whether of fact or of law, which required further exploration or which suggested that the mother, if given more time, would be able to mount a more compelling case. On the contrary, I am satisfied that Ms Segal was able to say everything of substance that the mother, even if given more time, would have been able to say at an adjourned hearing. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The simple fact, in my judgment, is that the mother&#8217;s application, attractively though it was put by Ms Segal, is devoid of any arguable merit sufficient to justify adjourning the matter for a further hearing on evidence. It is properly a case where the court can exercise its powers of summary dismissal. It is a case where the court should exercise that power, for otherwise the court would, in my judgment, be failing in its duty under Brussels II bis. A certain robustness of approach is called for in cases such as this if the court is to avoid becoming complicit in the subverting &#8211; whether intentional or otherwise &#8211; of the Brussels II bis regime.</p>
