	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an application in relation to a nine-year-old boy, V, who was born in 2012.  The London Borough of Enfield is the applicant local authority and it is represented by Mr William Dean of counsel.  The parents of V are M &#8211; she is the mother &#8211; and F is the father.  They are both represented by their counsel, Mrs Sarah Vakil.  V is represented through his children&#8217;s guardian, Ms Bernard, and represented by his solicitor, Ms Piccos.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">This application is for a placement order in relation to V.  The local authority&#8217;s plan is for V to be adopted by his current foster carers, and it is only by his foster carers that the local authority would seek him to be adopted.  Although, in theory, a placement order would entitle the local authority to place V for adoption by any approved and matched adopters, the local authority have given a firm commitment in this case that there is no prospect of them seeking any other adopters besides his current foster carers.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The application is opposed by the parents and by the children&#8217;s guardian.  In addition, the guardian has raised an issue about changing V&#8217;s name.  If V does become adopted by his carers, they seek as part of any adoption application to change his surname so that it is the same as theirs.  The children&#8217;s guardian has suggested that if the placement order application is refused, V&#8217;s name could, nonetheless, be changed to reinforce his sense of being a part of the foster carer&#8217;s family.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">When V was born, he was an extremely unwell baby.  He was diagnosed with a complex cardiac abnormality.  His heart is malformed.  The condition is untreatable and, as a result, his life expectancy is sadly limited.  The medical opinion shared at that time was that V&#8217;s condition meant his life expectancy could only be measured in weeks or possibly months.  The issues with V&#8217;s heart had not been identified during the pregnancy and I can only imagine how painful and traumatic it must have been for V&#8217;s parents to learn the news that their new baby had such a serious condition.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">On 9 November 2012, the mother was told that V&#8217;s life expectancy was only one month.  She was asked to discuss with her husband whether the family would take V home to be cared for by them.  Sadly, the parents felt unable to do so.  On 12 November, they attended a discharge planning meeting.  At that meeting they were told that V had a 1 per cent chance of survival and they signed a Do Not Attempt Resuscitation form.  They indicated they would not be taking V home and, in effect, at that point, they relinquished V, indicating that the local authority could do as it sees fit.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 13 December 2012, the local authority applied for a care order and, on 20 December, this court made an interim care order, which was not opposed by V&#8217;s parents.  Initially, V&#8217;s parents did not feel able to take up any contact.  However, as V came to defy the medical expectations about his condition, his parents&#8217; approach to contact changed and, in January 2013, V started to have regular weekly contact with his family, including on occasions his older brother who would come along also.  V&#8217;s mother, in particular, and his brother, have been consistent with contact.  Unfortunately, his father has not attended with such regularity.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the meantime, since then, V has continued to defy those early medical expectations.  He has grown and developed significantly, despite his heart condition and despite the low levels of oxygen that are supplied to his brain.  I know that his parents hold on to the hope that something may yet change, that a new treatment or operation may arise which would improve V&#8217;s health and, if that happened, they would want to care for him.  Unfortunately, to date, medical science has been unable to provide an answer to his condition, which remains untreatable.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_11">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">There has been discussion of V being adopted by his foster carers for many years.  In 2014, V&#8217;s foster carers expressed a wish to adopt him, and the professional network at that time were of the view that, given his progress, he deserved the opportunity to be adopted.  Those plans were shared with the parents, who were opposed and preferred for him to remain in foster care until a treatment or operation can improve his prognosis.  The issue of adoption has been regularly revisited and the parents have always remained opposed.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">In 2015, the local authority&#8217;s agency decisionmaker (&#8220;ADM&#8221;) considered the issue of adoption and did not approve the plan for adoption.  The following reasons were given: that there was ongoing weekly contact between V and his mother and his sibling, W, that V is not in care due to any deficiency of parenting, but because his parents could not contemplate parenting a child with a serious health condition who would be unlikely to survive his first year of life, that V&#8217;s family and the foster carers are of different nationality and faith, the latter being particularly important because of the need to consider appropriate funeral arrangements, that the notion of adoption, with its irrevocable ending of the child&#8217;s legal relationship with the birth parents does not fulfil the threshold of &#8220;nothing else will do&#8221;, that the status quo under a care order is not significantly detrimental to his long-term or short-term care and it did not warrant an adoption and, lastly, the ADM suggested the situation would be better dealt with through a special guardianship order.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_13">
	  <num>13</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Nonetheless, the issue of adoption remained on the agenda and, in 2018, the matter was referred once more to the ADM.  I understand a different person by then was conducting that role, and a different decision was taken.  The plan for adoption was approved and the ADM gave the following reasons: that V had exceeded his life expectancy and his prognosis is much improved, that he has lived with his current carers throughout his life and sees them as parents, that his birth parents feel unable to care for him, that V deserves the same opportunity to have a permanent family as any other child, that an SGO would not suffice because it does not give V a legally permanent family, not only throughout childhood, but as an adult, that the security of adoption would ensure the focus remains on V rather than the adults around him and that the previous plan for adoption was not agreed on the basis that V was not expected to live beyond his early years; the situation has now changed and V&#8217;s care plan needs to reflect that he will live a far longer life than first anticipated.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_14">
	  <num>14</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">That ADM decision was given on 13 May 2018.  The local authority, however, did not submit its application for a placement order until 23 December 2020, more than eighteen months later.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_15">
	  <num>15</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The court was significantly troubled by this delay in issuing its application, and sought a statement from the ADM to explain it.  Initially, the court was provided with a statement from Matthew Gratton, the service manager for the Joint Service for Disabled Children.  His statement set out that the application was delayed due to concerns around domestic abuse relating to a member of G and H&#8217;s extended family who did not live with them at the family home.  He described an eighteen-month search to identify suitable training around domestic abuse to support the foster carers&#8217; understanding.  That search had limited success because no face to face work was ever arranged, although online training was.  The local authority completed a risk assessment in July 2020 and was satisfied about the issue and, subsequently, it then prepared an Annex B report which was completed in December 2020.  That statement from Mr Gratton, no doubt intended to be helpful, was not from the ADM, as had been directed.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">I intentionally required the statement from the ADM for a reason, and it is not appropriate for the local authority to reinterpret the court&#8217;s directions into what it considers may be more helpful.  In any event, Mr Gratton&#8217;s statement did not answer the second of my questions, which was as to whether the local authority was aware of its duties under section 22 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 and what will be done in future to ensure it complies.  I was particularly concerned by the delay in issuing the application because that was a substantial breach of the local authority&#8217;s mandatory duty to apply for a placement order after the ADM&#8217;s decision to approve the plan for adoption.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">I renewed the direction for a statement from the ADM and Debbie Michael then provided it.  She had not been the ADM who made the decision approving adoption for V.  Her statement provided more information about the background to V&#8217;s case and the previous ADM decisions.  She confirmed that the local authority is aware of its duties under section 22 and recognised the delay, but considered that it could not make the placement order application until completion of the domestic abuse work.  She explained that an escalation process has now been implemented, with monthly reviews, to prevent delay and to better consider resources that could be utilised much sooner in future.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">For a local authority to take more than a year and a half between an ADM decision and making a placement order application is completely unacceptable.  I am glad that the local authority is now taking steps to avoid this sort of delay arising in any other child&#8217;s case.  The local authority should have issued the application shortly after the ADM decision.  If circumstances changed, as they did, the matter needed to be re-referred to the agency decisionmaker for the decision to be reviewed at that stage, rather than simply holding off on making the application.  The time that passed while the local authority struggled to arrange the domestic abuse work and to complete its application was unacceptable and in breach of its duty under the Act.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Unfortunately, the delay meant that when V&#8217;s case was eventually brought in, it was during the Covid-19 pandemic.  The administration of the court, by then, was struggling considerably and, regrettably, the placement order application was not issued until 23 March 2021.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 28 June 2021, the foster carers lodged an application to adopt V.  At a hearing the following day, on 29 June, it was confirmed that the foster carers, having received independent legal advice, did not wish to apply for a special guardianship order for V.  The parents, in response to the applications, sought to discharge the care order as they opposed V being adopted and, at that stage, understood no alternative was being offered by the local authority.  They did, however, make it clear that they would support V remaining in the care of his foster carers under a care order.  I directed a parenting assessment by an independent social worker of the parents and timetabled the case for an issue resolution hearing or early final hearing in October 2021.</p>

At that time, the parents were in Bulgaria while the father sought medical treatment.  The parents indicated their intention was to return to England soon and to complete the parenting assessment for which they had been absent.  A further issue had been identified by the children&#8217;s guardian, which was that the local authority&#8217;s Annex A report on the foster carers was dated March 2019 and approved them for a child between the age of zero to six years old, whereas, by then, V had reached the age of eight.</p>

The foster carers attended at that hearing, which was conducted remotely.  They informed the court that they wished to adopt V, but through the agency route.  They did not wish to pursue their application for an adoption order.  They confirmed again that they did not wish to become special guardians.  They also indicated they did not wish to give evidence or participate in any further hearings.  Most importantly of all, they confirmed, and it is stated on the face of the order, that, for the avoidance of doubt, they will continue to love and care for V whether or not the local authority&#8217;s application for a placement order is successful and/or an adoption order is ultimately made.</p>

I was alerted to the need for the social worker to provide some updating information, and this was directed in a short statement.

There have been a number of ominous developments.  He now has to use oxygen at school and at home.  He now has to rely on his wheelchair during breaktimes at school, and the distance he can walk has decreased.  He has started to suffer from migraines.  V is aware about his condition and is likely to have an awareness about what these symptoms may mean.  When he suffers migraines, these are described as incredibly anxiety-inducing for him, and he becomes very distressed.

Dr Daniels has stated that it is inevitable that as V grows physically his health will deteriorate.  The medical opinion is that V is likely to drift into Eisenmenger&#8217;s syndrome over the next two to three years.

He would become V [foster family surname], which is in line with his wishes and feelings.  On the other hand, it would extinguish his legal link with his birth family.  At his age, his sense of identity is still developing.  He would become a child in a family which is not culturally or religiously the same as his birth family.  His religious heritage has been respected.

Under the care order, there has already been a discussion between the local authority and the birth parents in relation to what will happen and a plan has been set out in the November 2021 social worker&#8217;s statement.  That plan is built around V&#8217;s parents&#8217; wishes for a service their place of worship, for that place of worship to collect V&#8217;s body from the hospital or from the home and for a funeral within that religion to take place within two to four days, which would be open to everybody, and then V would be buried. </p>

He is, nonetheless, a remarkable boy and his charisma, I suspect, stands him in good stead amongst his peer group.  Nonetheless, by virtue of his condition, he is a child who is already very different and I am not sure that being a child in care, as opposed to being an adopted child, is a major point of difference compared to the day to day realities of V&#8217;s life.  </p>

It is suggested that adoption would avoid those awkward interactions.  I do not know how often they arise.  I suspect the majority of V&#8217;s appointments are regular appointments with known professionals.  I have not heard from G and H directly about this issue, but when I think about the sort of situations where this might arise, whether it is a GP receptionist or a dentist or whatever it might be, these are straightforward interactions that can be quickly set straight.  I suspect that even if he were to become an adopted person, the same enquiry is likely to be made by those people that do not know.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">When I consider V&#8217;s welfare and apply the welfare checklist under section 1 of the Children Act 1989, I am satisfied that, on balance, it is in V&#8217;s best interests to change his name.  I consider that, by doing so, the court will be able to reinforce his sense of belonging within the foster family without disassociating him from his birth family.  It may be that that raises difficult questions about his identity but, in my judgment, those difficult questions will nonetheless exist as a consequence of his life experiences, and he will need help to understand his history and his identity.  So I am going to give permission pursuant to section 33(7) of the Children Act 1989 for V&#8217;s name to be changed to V [birth surname-foster surname].</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am very grateful to the advocates for their help in this case.  Whilst I have been critical about the delay by the local authority in making the application, I would like to balance that by recognising the support and effort that the social workers have been making on the ground and the assistance that they have given to V, to G and H and the parents, and, lastly, I wish to express my very best wishes to V and to both his families for the future, and I hope that he continues to defy medical expectations long into the future.  That is my judgment.</p>
