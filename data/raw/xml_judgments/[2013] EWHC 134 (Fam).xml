In each case, the application concerns a child conceived using sperm provided by the man and born to a woman in a civil partnership. As a result of the reforms introduced in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008</ref>, legal parenthood of the children is vested in the mothers and their respective civil partners to the exclusion of the biological fathers who therefore have no right to apply for orders in respect of the children without the leave of the court. </p>

It is argued by counsel appearing before me that the outcome of this case has significant public policy implications in respect of how the law affects families created through gamete donation.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in">The two male applicants, hereafter referred to as S and T, have been in a relationship for twenty years. In 2001 S became friends with a woman, D, although they disagree about the closeness of that friendship. In 2003, when on holiday in the Netherlands, D met another woman, E, and started a relationship with her. In 2006, E moved to England to live with D. At that point, both couples, S and T, and D and E, lived within 100 yards of each other in London. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in">D and E decided that they wanted to try to have a child, and agreed to ask someone they knew to provide the sperm. Having approached D&#8217;s brother, who declined, they eventually asked S and he, having discussed the matter with T, agreed. It was decided that E would be the biological and birth mother of the child. </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in">It is a central feature of the case advanced by D and E that they made it clear to S that the arrangement was based on three terms which they summarised as &#8216;(1) no parental title (2) no parental responsibility and (3) no financial commitment&#8217;. They described these as &#8216;the three cardinal points&#8217; of the arrangement. They say that it was agreed that S would have no role in bringing up the children and that they would continue to socialise as adults. They assert there has never been a relationship between S and the children other than that of being a friend of the parents. In her statement, E states: </p>
	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:1.5in">&#8216; We wanted a known donor to make it possible for the child to find out more about its background. We were not looking for a father, we didn&#8217;t want involvement, we, that is D and I were to be the parents.&#8217;</p>

	  <num style="margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:-0.5in">6.</num>
	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in">According to S, however, that phrase was never used prior to the start of the court proceedings some years later. S now asserts that, had D or E ever expressed terms as &#8216;harsh and stark&#8217; as those, he would certainly have refused to be involved. It is S&#8217;s case that D and E promised that he would be known to the child as its father and have a role in the child&#8217;s life. He says that he was keen to be a father and that his partner, T, was equally delighted as they had always wanted to have children. According to S, it was agreed between the parties that, although D and E would be the primary parents, he would be involved in the child&#8217;s upbringing and he and T would have contact with the child. He continues: </p>
	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:1.5in">&#8216;importantly, I would be known to the child and to the rest of the world as its father, although it would not carry my name. I did not mind about the name, it was more important for me to be known to the child as its father, and to play the role perhaps as a friendly, caring and involved adult. The mothers did not request or want a financial contribution. We did not use a clinic authorised under the Human Embryology Fertilisation Act, or feel the need for a written agreement. In that respect, it seems ill-advised not to have gone into more detail about what we all expected from our relationship with the child in years to come or not to have recorded at least the key points that we had agreed in writing. But we were excited and such good friends over several years, so we thought there were no obstacles which could not be overcome. This was an informal arrangement among four close friends. In fact, in December 2007, we all went away together for a holiday in Le Touquet.&#8217;</p>

The contact took place at both their home and the mother&#8217;s home. F was introduced to S&#8217;s mother and other members of his family and subsequently to members of T&#8217;s family. According to D and E, the contact was less frequent. They say that it took place every couple of weeks and insist it was never what they described &#8216;organised&#8217; contact but rather about socialising as friends. In her statement, E asserts that S mainly enjoyed talking to D and did not really engage with F. E says that it was T who made more effort to play with the baby. In July 2009, S, T, D, E and F all met and spent the day together with other friends on &#8216;Gay Pride&#8217; day. There were also other occasions when S and T spent time with D, E and F.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in">Shortly afterwards, discussions took place between D, E, S and T about having a sibling for F. There is a conflict of evidence about the discussions. It seems that there was some suggestion that T would provide sperm but E says that she was keen for the second child to have the same biological father as F, and S duly agreed. In his statement, S says: </p>

E says that they informed him that, under the new law, D&#8217;s name could be included on the birth certificate of the new baby. The mothers&#8217; case is that they told S and T that the children would continue to have their surname and that S would not be involved in the upbringing of the child. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in">In December 2009, E became pregnant again following home insemination. At around the same time, there was the first argument between the couples. It occurred when a friend of T&#8217;s upset D by referring to her as F&#8217;s &#8216;auntie&#8217; rather than &#8216;mother&#8217;. S states that  D and E complained that he and T were interfering and trespassing on their family, and about the special treatment that they had been given at S and T&#8217;s civil partnership celebration, and said that they should not think of F as their child and that S was &#8216;just a sperm donor and not a father&#8217;. D accepts that she did describe S in those terms but says that she did so &#8216;in exasperation at T&#8217;s inability to listen to reason&#8217;. According to D, she and E reiterated the three &#8216;cardinal points&#8217; of their agreement during this conversation. Thereafter, however, relations between the couples continued as before. S continued to see F regularly, although the parties disagree about the frequency and the quality of this contact. </p>

According to the mothers, however, the nature of the visits did not change. They were still ostensibly to see D, his longstanding friend, and he paid little or no attention to F and rarely saw G who was usually asleep after his morning feed. E says that, in retrospect, she and D suspect that the pattern of visitation changed because T had taken legal advice in respect of his relationship with Z. They believe that T put S under considerable duress to change the nature of his relationship with F and G. This is, however, denied by S and T. It is S&#8217;s case that, by this stage, he and T had a strong bond with F.</p>

According to S and T, D expressed concern at the number of photographs of the children in their house. According to D, she wanted to have a private conversation with S but T intervened and became aggressive towards her, asserting: &#8216;we are the fathers, these children need fathers, they are our children, we are the fathers&#8217;. She says that T referred to her and E as &#8216;cheating lesbians who have stolen our sperm&#8217;.

The relationship that might develop will be one that is led by the children, not by any of the adults. We have always reassured S about this, and will never break our word. Unfortunately S has, unilaterally, changed the nature of the agreement and now tries to force himself into their lives to have a position that was never intended or agreed, or in fact one that he had had no interest in having&#8217;.</p>

It seems in this case, however, that difficulties between the parties arose during the course of the pregnancy. T asserts that, after X became pregnant, she told him that she did not want to acknowledge him as the child&#8217;s father, which was, he says, completely different to the arrangement agreed before the sperm donation. According to X, T started exerting pressure to increase his status and involvement before the child was born. On one occasion, he sent her a text referring to &#8216;our son&#8217; and, when she asked what he meant by this, he told her that he was referring to himself and S. X says that, despite these concerns, she and Y tried to reassure T that he did have an important role &#8216;as a known donor and role model but not as a father&#8217;. X and Y state that they were &#8216;incredibly grateful&#8217; to T for donating sperm so that they could start a family and they wanted to keep relations positive. When, during the pregnancy, T raised concerns about the baby&#8217;s heritage and expressed a wish that should be reflected in the name, X and Y agreed that the baby should have a Sri Lankan middle name. There were further discussions about whether or not T&#8217;s name should be on the birth certificate, although this was not possible as a result of the change in the law. </p>

On behalf of T, Miss Samantha King filed a skeleton argument running to some 45 pages and 130 paragraphs (this being by some distance the largest such document I have encountered on any application for leave). It traversed a range of issues including some not canvassed by Miss Reardon in the first case. The skeleton argument in the reply from Alison Russell QC was considerably shorter but the arguments deployed were much more extensive than those put forward by D and E acting in person in the first case. In addition, a range of reported authorities and other material was filed contained in four lever arch files. </p>

However, the arguments deployed in the second case were much more extensive although manifestly relevant to the first. I therefore reached the preliminary view that I should revisit my previous decision granting to S to apply for leave in respect of G and arrange a further hearing in which both applications for leave, by S in respect of G and by T in respect of Z, could be considered together. Before reaching a final conclusion on this cause, I invited the parties in the first case to attend court and make submissions on the proposal. By this stage, counsel Miss Deirdre Fottrell had been instructed (on a pro bono basis) to represent D and E. She and Miss Reardon attended court and it was agreed that they would make submissions in writing on the question of whether the order of the 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> November should be set aside. Having considered those submissions, I informed counsel that I had decided to set aside that order, and that the reason for my decision would be given later (as to which, see below). At Miss Reardon&#8217;s request, I extended the time for leave to appeal against that decision until 21 days after the reasons had been given. </p>

The latter type of case would include, for example, a case of material non-disclosure on an application for an injunction. If all that is sought is a reconsideration of the order on the basis of the same material, then that can only be done, in my judgment, in the context of an appeal. Similarly it is not, I think, open to a party to the earlier application to seek in effect to re-argue that application by relying on submissions and evidence which were available to him at the time of the earlier hearing, but which, for whatever reason, he or his legal representatives chose not to employ.&#8217;</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.5in">&#8216;There is scant authority upon rule 3.1(7) but such as exists is unanimous in holding that it cannot constitute a power in a judge to hear an appeal from himself in respect of a final order. &#8230;. Like Patten J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Ager-Hanssen</span> I would not attempt any exhaustive classification of the circumstances in which it may be proper to invoke it. &#8230;. It may well be that, in the context of essentially case management decisions, the grounds for invoking the rule will generally fall into one or other of the two categories of (i) erroneous information at the time of the original order or (ii) subsequent event destroying the basis on which it was made. The exigencies of case management may well call for a variation in planning from time to time in the light of developments. There may possibly be examples of non-procedural but continuing orders which may call for revocation or variation as they continue &#8211; an interlocutory injunction may be one. But it does not follow that wherever one or other of the two assertions mentioned (erroneous information and subsequent event) can be made, then any party can return to the trial judge and ask him to re-open any decision. In particular, it does not follow, I have no doubt, where the judge's order is a final one disposing of the case, whether in whole or in part. And it especially does not apply where the order is founded upon a settlement agreed between the parties after the most detailed and highly skilled advice. The interests of justice, and of litigants generally, require that a final order remains such unless proper grounds for appeal exist.&#8217;</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in">In reply, Miss Reardon submitted that the power to vary or set aside should not be exercised in respect of the order of 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> November, on the grounds that an order granting leave was a final, as opposed to an interim, order. It was well established that a final order could not be set aside or varied under the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction other than in limited and specified circumstances, most of them involving a discovery, after the order was made, of facts which would have been relevant to the decision: eg fraud, material non-disclosure or mistake: <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">de Lasala v de Lasala</span> (1979) FLR 223. As for the power under FPR 4.1(6), Miss Reardon submitted that the authorities cited above demonstrated that it did not apply to final orders. Furthermore, no additional evidence was being put forward on behalf of D and E, and Miss Reardon submitted that there is no binding authority for the proposition that the power to vary or revoke an order under CPR 3.1(7) or FPR 4.1(6) could be exercised merely on the basis of additional argument which was not placed before the court on the earlier occasion. Miss Reardon contended that the dicta of Dyson LJ to the contrary in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Collier v Williams</span> at paragraph 120 were both obiter and inconsistent with his earlier comments at paragraph 39-40 and she relied on the fact that the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Edward v Golding</span> at paragraph 24 specifically left the question open. She submitted that the proper course for the respondents to take, if they were dissatisfied with the decision made by the court on 22 November 2012, was to apply for permission to appeal that decision.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in">At the hearing on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> November, D and E, appearing in person, put forward only a limited range of arguments in opposition to S&#8217;s application for leave to apply for orders in respect of G. Those arguments focussed on the factual background, referring only briefly to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/42" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.42</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref>. The skeleton argument prepared by Miss Russell QC on behalf of X and Y in the second case deploys a much wider range of arguments, based not only on the facts of that case, and, as one would expect, a closer analysis of the application of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/10/9" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.10(9)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> to those facts, but also on the policy considerations underpinning the reforms effected by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref>. The filing of that skeleton therefore gave rise to the prospect that, although the facts of the two cases were not only interlinked but also in many respects similar, the outcome of the applications for leave might be different if the court accepted the policy-based arguments deployed by leading counsel for the respondents in the second case but not cited by the self-represented respondents in the first.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in">Having regard to the overriding objective of FPR, I concluded that such an outcome would be potentially unfair to D and E, and therefore to G. In those circumstances, I decided that it would be an entirely appropriate use of the power under rule 4.1(6) to set aside the order of 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> November. To my mind it was unnecessary to analyse whether the new information which would be advanced on behalf of D and E was &#8216;fact&#8217; or &#8216;argument&#8217;. It was, in my view, new material which the court had not considered at the previous hearing. </p>

Setting aside the order allowed the court to consider the two linked applications together, and apply its conclusions on the policy-based arguments to both cases. Such a course would not be unfair to S. Only a few weeks would elapse between 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> November and the re-hearing of his application for leave.

As I said earlier, I do not see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/10/9" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 10(9)</ref> as containing a test. By picking out some factors to which the court should have &#8220;particular regard&#8221;, it acknowledges by implication that there may be other factors which the court has to consider. It would be wrong, in my view, to try to list or limit these factors which will vary infinitely from case to case. One amongst them is plainly the prospects of success of the application that is proposed; leave will not be given for an application that is not arguable. I do not intend to attempt a definition of what is arguable but I would make a few observations before I leave the question of the proper approach to an application to which <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/10/9" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section10 (9)</ref> applies, whether directly or through an application to be joined as a party with a view to seeking the sort of outcome that could be the subject of a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> order.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.5in;text-indent:0.5in">The first observation is that the fact that a person has an arguable case may not necessarily be sufficient to entitle him or her to leave under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/10" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 10</ref> or to joinder as a party. I say this because <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/10/9" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 10(9)</ref> picks out other factors as requiring particular regard and I think it must follow that there may be situations in which, when the judge exercises his or her discretion, balancing all the relevant factors, the presence of an arguable case is outweighed by those other factors or, indeed, by any other factor that carries particular weight in the individual circumstances of the case&#8230;.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:1.5in;text-indent:0.5in">The second observation is that there is room, in cases concerning children, for applications or proposed applications to be checked at a very early stage and without wholesale investigation. The court has a broad discretion to conduct the case as is most appropriate given the issues involved and the evidence available, see for example <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B (Minors) (Contact)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1994] 2 FLR 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1994">[1994] 2 FLR 1</ref>, <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re C (Contact: Conduct of Hearings)</span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"/><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] 2 FLR 289" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] 2 FLR 289</ref>, and <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re N; A v G and N</span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"/><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2009/1807" uk:canonical="[2009] EWHC 1807 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] EWHC 1807 (Fam)</ref>. Accordingly, some cases can appropriately be determined on submissions alone, for example. Furthermore, it is not always necessary for findings to be made in relation to all (or sometimes any) disputed facts, perhaps because the result does not depend upon them or because there are quite sufficient undisputed facts to form the foundation of the decision that needs to be taken.&#8217;</p>

Thus, where a woman donated eggs to another, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> provided that the carrying, rather than the donating, mother would have the status of legal parent. Similarly, where a child was conceived by a married woman using sperm donated by a man other than her husband, the status of legal parent was bestowed on the husband to the exclusion of the donor. The restriction of these provisions to heterosexual couples was attributable to the importance attached to &#8220;traditional&#8221; family values, which were also reflected in the provision that imposed as a condition of every licence granted to a clinic providing treatment an obligation not to provide treatment to a woman without considering the child&#8217;s need for a father. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">The 2008 Act</ref> reflected the significant social changes of the intervening years by not only replacing this latter requirement with a need to consider the need for &#8220;supportive parenting&#8221; but also extending the provisions concerning legal parenthood following donation to same-sex couples. A distinction remains, however, between, on the one hand, married couples and civil partners, and, on the other, unmarried heterosexual couples and same-sex couples who are not civil partners. In respect of the latter, the provisions bestowing legal parenthood only apply if the couple conceive at a licensed clinic and comply with certain formalities. In the case of couples who are civil partners, however, as with married couples, the status of legal parent is bestowed on the non-birth member of the couple irrespective of whether the child was conceived at a UK licensed clinic or elsewhere.</p>

Those provisions not only confer parenthood but also expressly eliminate the legal status of the man who is the biological father in such circumstances. Miss Russell submits that the provision that no man should be treated as the father &#8216;for any purpose&#8217; affects the interpretation of every other legal enactment and private document and should be regarded as a fundamental and overriding provision.

She argues that T&#8217;s application amounts to seeking a paternal role on the presumption that Z will benefit from the building of such a relationship with his biological father in addition to the relationship he has with his two existing legal parents.

Previous cases have been heard under a different legal framework in which the applicant man was the legal father and the welfare of the child was, from the outset, the court&#8217;s paramount consideration. In contrast, under the present application, the applicants are not legally the fathers of the children and welfare is not the paramount consideration of the court and the court is considering the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/10/9" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 10(9)</ref> criteria in the context of, and in conjunction with, the provisions of, and policy underpinning, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref>.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in">Miss Russell&#8217;s submissions on these issues of policy are adopted and developed by Miss Fottrell on behalf of D and E. She submits that the legislative intention and purpose behind <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/42" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 42</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref> was to ensure that what she describes as the &#8216;lesbian de novo family&#8217; acquired legal status commensurate with the factual reality. She submits that the change in the legislation was &#8220;intended to avoid a legal hierarchy based on biology which denied legal status to both parents in a lesbian-led family&#8221;.  She submits that it is incumbent on this court to have due regard to the legislative purpose as a relevant factor when considering the application for leave and that considerable weight should be attached to that factor for public policy reasons. Granting leave would have the effect of distorting the family relationships and frustrating the legislative intention. Through his application, S is seeking to elevate the genetic relationship in a way which is contrary to the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/45" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 45</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref>.

The court is powerless to prevent him from pursuing that application, whatever the merits and consequences. Miss Fottrell submits that the court &#8216;cannot ignore the legal reality in this case&#8217;. The fact that the court cannot stop S making the application in respect of F does not strengthen the merits of his case or entitle him to be given a &#8216;legal toehold&#8217; in respect of G in a way which defeats the legislative intent.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in">In response to these submissions, Miss King deployed an extensive range of arguments, but her central submission can be simply summarised. She accepts that the effect of the reforms implemented by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/45/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss 45(1)</ref> and 48(2) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref> was to remove the status of legal parent from a man who provides sperm for the artificial insemination of a woman in a civil partnership, but submits that this does not eradicate his status as a genetic parent who may, depending on the facts and whether or not he satisfies the criteria under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/10/9" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.10(9)</ref>, be allowed by the court to apply for an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.8</ref> of the Children Act in order to play a role in the life of the child. Although parental responsibility is vested exclusively in the mothers of the children, Miss King submits, relying on dicta of McFarlane LJ in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re W (Children)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2012/999" uk:canonical="[2012] EWCA Civ 999" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWCA Civ 999</ref>, that with parental responsibility comes both authority and duty and argues that, as the legal parents to Z, part of the role assumed by X and Y involves making responsible decisions which meet the best interests of their child including permitting contact with his biological father. If they are unable to agree to do so, then, submits Miss King, the court must intervene on behalf of the child.</p>

It is worthwhile picking apart what we mean by 'natural parent' in this context.  There is a difference between natural and legal parents.  Thus, the father of a child born to unmarried parents was not legally a 'parent' until the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1987/42" uk:canonical="1987 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Reform Act 1987</ref> but he was always a natural parent.  The anonymous donor who donates his sperm or her egg under the terms of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990</ref> is the natural progenitor of the child but not his legal parent: see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37/section/27" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss 27</ref> and 28 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1990 Act</ref>.  The husband or unmarried partner of a mother who gives birth as a result of donor insemination in a licensed clinic in this country is for virtually all purposes a legal parent, but may not be any kind of natural parent: see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37/section/28" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 28</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1990 Act</ref>.  To be the legal parent of a child gives a person legal standing to bring and defend proceedings about the child and makes the child a member of that person's family, but it does not necessarily tell us much about the importance of that person to the child's welfare.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.5in">[33]   There are at least three ways in which a person may be or become a natural parent of a child, each of which may be a very significant factor in the child's welfare, depending upon the circumstances of the particular case.  The first is genetic parenthood: the provision of the gametes which produce the child.  This can be of deep significance on many levels. For the parent, perhaps particularly for a father, the knowledge that this is 'his' child can bring a very special sense of love for and commitment to that child which will be of great benefit to the child (see, for example, the psychiatric evidence in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re C (MA) (an infant)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1966] 1 WLR 646" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1966">[1966] 1 WLR 646</ref>).  For the child, he reaps the benefit not only of that love and commitment, but also of knowing his own origins and lineage, which is an important component in finding an individual sense of self as one grows up.  The knowledge of that genetic link may also be an important (although certainly not an essential) component in the love and commitment felt by the wider family, perhaps especially grandparents, from which the child has so much to gain.</p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.5in">[34]   The second is gestational parenthood: the conceiving and bearing of the child.  The mother who bears the child is legally the child's mother, whereas the mother who provided the egg is not: 1990 Act, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37/section/27" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 27</ref>.  While this may be partly for reasons of certainty and convenience, it also recognises a deeper truth: that the process of carrying a child and giving him birth (which may well be followed by breast-feeding for some months) brings with it, in the vast majority of cases, a very special relationship between mother and child, a relationship which is different from any other.</p>

	  </subparagraph>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.5in">[35]   The third is social and psychological parenthood: the relationship which develops through the child demanding and the parent providing for the child's needs, initially at the most basic level of feeding, nurturing, comforting and loving, and later at the more sophisticated level of guiding, socialising, educating and protecting.  The phrase 'psychological parent' gained most currency from the influential work of Goldstein, Freud and Solnit, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (Free Press, 1973), who defined it thus: 'A psychological parent is one who, on a continuous, day-to-day basis, through interaction, companionship, interplay, and mutuality, fulfils the child's psychological needs for a parent, as well as the child's physical needs. The psychological parent may be a biological, adoptive, foster or common law parent.'</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.5in">[36]   Of course, in the great majority of cases, the natural mother combines all three.  She is the genetic, gestational and psychological parent. Her contribution to the welfare of the child is unique.  The natural father combines genetic and psychological parenthood.  His contribution is also unique.  In these days when more parents share the tasks of child rearing and breadwinning, his contribution is often much closer to that of the mother than it used to be; but there are still families which divide their tasks on more traditional lines, in which case his contribution will be different and its importance will often increase with the age of the child.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in">Miss King submits that social and psychological relationships amounting to parenthood can and often do co-exist with legal parenthood. In some circumstances, a legal parent may not have a day to day relationship with a child whereas a person with a significant social or psychological relationship may be a stable and constant presence whilst lacking the status of a legal parent. Miss King submits that to contend for the notion that a biological father has an inherently higher test to meet than would others who are not legal parents to the subject child is to ignore the fact that leave to apply is only ever required when the applicant is not the legal parent. No person is absolutely excluded from seeking redress, although, save in certain defined circumstances, an application for redress cannot be made without the court&#8217;s leave. Miss King reminds me that this is the position faced by biological fathers without parental responsibility in other circumstances(see <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re H (illegitimate Children: Father: Parental Rights) (No 2) </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">[</span>1991] 1 FLR 214), and also by step-parents (<span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re H (Shared  Residence: Parental responsibility)</span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"/><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 2 FLR 883" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 2 FLR 883</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re A (Joint residence/Parental responsibility)</span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"/><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 2 FLR 1593" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 2 FLR 1593</ref>) and same-sex partners who have no biological relationship with the subject child but are playing the role of the parent <span style="font-style:italic">(</span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">G v F (Contact and Shared Residence: Application for Leave</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"/><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"/><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1998] 2 FLR 799" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">[1998] 2 FLR 799</ref>).

Moreover, the Court has considered that intended family life may, exceptionally, fall within the ambit of Article 8, notably in cases in which the fact that family life has not yet fully been established was not attributable to the applicant &#8230;. In particular, where the circumstances warrant it, &#8220;family life&#8221; must extend to the potential relationship which may develop between a child born out of wedlock and the natural father. Relevant factors which may determine the real existence in practice of close personal ties in these cases include the nature of the relationship between the natural parents and a demonstrable interest in and commitment by the father to the child both before and after the birth &#8230;.</span></p>

It has been the Convention organs&#8217; traditional approach to accept that close relationships short of &#8220;family life&#8221; would generally fall within the scope of &#8220;private life&#8221;&#8230;.&#8217;</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in">Ultimately, the cases advanced on behalf of the applicants focus on the facts. Central to the case advanced on behalf of the applicants is the argument that each case is fact specific. They submit that the policy considerations underpinning <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref> do not entitle or oblige the court to refuse an application for leave in every case.  In some cases, it will be appropriate to grant a genetic or psychological parent leave to apply for contact, in others not. In support of this submission, Miss King relies on the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">A v B and C (Lesbian Co-Parents: Role of Father)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2012/285" uk:canonical="[2012] EWCA Civ 285" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWCA Civ 285</ref> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2012] 2 FLR 607" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] 2 FLR 607</ref>.

As a result, Black LJ concluded that &#8216;this is an area of law in which generalise guidance is not possible&#8217;. Miss King acknowledges that <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">A v B and C</span> was a case in which the biological father was entitled to apply for contact as of right and the court was thus applying the paramountcy principle. She submits, however, that the observations of the Court of Appeal support the argument that the court should adopt a fact-specific approach to the application for leave in this case, rather than attaching any significant weight to the policy considerations identified by the respondents.</p>

It is a serious and necessary application. She submits that he is the only person who can offer the children something which all three adults thought was important when they decided to take steps to conceive: a relationship with their other biological parent, and a knowledge of their biological identity, their background and their wider paternal family. It is his case that it is plainly in both children&#8217;s short, medium and long-term best interests that they should grow up knowing and having a relationship with their father, albeit that their primary home will continue to be with their two mothers.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in">As for his connection with the child, Miss Reardon relies on the fact that S is G&#8217;s biological father and the biological and legal father of his sister, whilst acknowledging that the reported authorities make it clear that neither the legal status of parenthood, nor biological parenthood, is determinative when it comes to issues concerning the care and upbringing of children. It is S&#8217;s case that it was envisaged that he would have a significant connection with both children. There was no formal or written agreement, and there is considerable dispute about what words were actually used on both sides. He is clear that it was never agreed that he would have no parental title or role, as the respondents now allege. As quoted above, he says in his statement: &#8216;had E or D ever expressed terms as harsh and stark as these, I would certainly have refused to be involved&#8217;. Miss Reardon rightly says that this is not an issue which can be resolved at this stage in the proceedings, and submits that, in the context of the application for leave, the court should proceed on the basis that the applicant&#8217;s version of events is or may well be correct. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in">What is not disputed, however, is that after F was born, S saw her, and subsequently G, regularly. The children met a number of members of their paternal family, including S&#8217;s mother, siblings, nephews and nieces. They have also met a number of members of T&#8217;s family. Miss Reardon cites what she describes as a significant inconsistency in the respondents&#8217; case as it is now put. They say now that they were uncomfortable with the applicant&#8217;s regular presence in their home and in the children&#8217;s lives; but not only did they acquiesce in this for a period of some 2 &#189; years, they also proceeded with a second pregnancy with S, without, even on their case, any significant attempt to re-negotiate the arrangements. Furthermore, the change in the law did not lead D and E to seek a different arrangement for contact with G. Miss Reardon submits that, even on the respondents&#8217; own case, the difference in legal parentage, to the extent that they understood it, does not seem to have assumed particular significance in terms of the situation on the ground and their expectations of the applicant&#8217;s role. </p>

Furthermore, Miss Reardon points out that, in the present cases, many of the arguments put forward by all the respondents are in fact welfare arguments. These are arguments which can be put into the balance at a substantive hearing. On behalf of S, it is contended that it cannot be right that the respondents should be entitled to rely on these assertions, on welfare grounds, without a full investigation of their merits and without the applicant also being entitled to put forward his arguments as to why an ongoing relationship with him would be in the child&#8217;s interests. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in">Miss Reardon relies, of course, on the fact that S has also made an application for contact and parental responsibility in respect of his daughter F, now four years old. Because of the date of F&#8217;s conception, S is not only her biological father but also her legal parent, and he does not require leave to apply for orders in respect of her. Miss Reardon submits that the fact that there are already ongoing substantive proceedings in respect of F is a powerful, if not compelling, argument in favour of granting leave to the applicant to apply in respect of G. Miss Reardon points out that D and E accept in their evidence that they consider the two children to be &#8216;full siblings&#8217;, not just in a psychological context (the same two mothers) but also in terms of their biological parentage. That the two children should be biological full siblings is something that was important to the respondents. They specifically wanted the applicant to father their second child because he had fathered their first. Furthermore, these children are very close in age. There has been no distinction between the children in terms of their contact with the applicant. These children will, the respondents accept, be brought up knowing the truth of their biological parentage. Miss Reardon contends that these factors add considerable force to the argument that, when the time comes for the court to consider the exact role in which the applicant should play in F&#8217;s life, it would be wholly artificial, and not in the interests of either child, for G to be excluded from that process. To proceed with the application in respect of F, but to exclude G from that application, flies in the face of common sense, particularly as it seems unlikely that the respondents will suggest that the issue of contact should be approached in a different way for each child because of their differing legal parentage. </p>

He amended his application to include a prohibited steps order to prevent the mothers from removing the children permanently from the jurisdiction.  It is, says Miss Fottrell, highly significant that S has applied for residence of the child in order to gain parental responsibility.  Furthermore, the contact sought is regular and unsupervised. Miss Fottrell argues that the applicant has taken an entirely disproportionate and worrying approach in his applications.  He is seeking to make applications that are completely undermining of the autonomy of the family unit.  She submits that his aim is to achieve recognition of himself as the father of the children.

She  contends that, in so far as S has sought to characterise his relationship with the child as being that of a father, and the time that he has spent with the child as being &#8216;contact&#8217;, he has exaggerated his relationship both as to the quality of it and its nature. D and E have full and busy lives in which they spend considerable amount of time with friends. Their children are always present. It is in that context that the applicant has seen and been in the presence of the child. He has never cared for the child.  He has no role in his daily life.  He is not part of the child&#8217;s family in any sense.  To the child and the outside world the applicant is no more than a family friend. So far as quantity of contact is concerned, although S saw the children fairly regularly at an earlier stage, he has only seen them twice in the past 12 months. As a matter of fact, therefore, the applicant&#8217;s connection with the child, which was limited in any event, has waned.</span></p>

She points to evidence, summarised above and which counsel characterises as &#8220;compelling&#8221;, of the stress and anxiety caused to them and by implication to the family unit by the application   There is, she continues, a high degree of disharmony and resentment between the parties.  The continuation of the application will increase the emotional tensions and their impact on the respondent, which would not be beneficial to the child.  The hostility significantly reduces the prospects of the applicant succeeding in any of his applications.  That in itself can be reason to refuse leave, as per <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re A (A Minor) (Contact; Leave to Apply)</span> [1995] 3 FCR per Douglas Brown J in which leave was refused to a grandmother owing to the long standing serious disharmony in the relationship between her and a child&#8217;s parents. Rather than respect the mother&#8217;s desire to maintain their family form as initially agreed, S has undermined the family and has sought to force a legal recognition of himself as an &#8216;additional&#8217; parent. It is thus submitted on behalf of D and E that, while the application is presented as a benign attempt to offer himself as an additional parent, the court must have regard to the fact that it will take away from the status of the lesbian-led family which will impact ultimately on G.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in">D and E do not accept that S&#8217;s application for leave to apply for an order in respect of G is strengthened by reason of the fact he is pursuing as of right an order in respect of F. Miss Fottrell submits that the fact that the respondents are unable to prevent the applicant from seeking orders in respect of F, notwithstanding the disruptive and disturbing effect of those applications on the family unit, is not a reason to permit him to pursue similar applications in respect of G. As a result of changes to the law, the legal status of the applicant in respect of G is different from his legal status in respect of F.  That is the consequence of the application of the statute and it is submitted that it cannot be overridden by what Miss Fottrell describes as a simplistic assertion that the children should be treated the same when as a matter of law they are in starkly different positions. Furthermore, while the applicant does not occupy any more central a role in F&#8217;s than he does in G&#8217;s life, he has, it is submitted, spent more time with F in the context of the his friendship with D.  In contrast he has spent very little time with G who is, it is submitted, a stranger to him.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in">Finally, considering the merits of the application, Miss Fottrell submits that it is important to note that the respondents have agreed to twice yearly contact between the child and the applicant, a level which is, she asserts, consistent with that occurring in similar cases.  This demonstrates that they are willing to contemplate some limited contact. The mothers having conceded the principle of contact, the quantum should be left to their discretion. In those circumstances, the court should refrain from allowing S to intrude into the family&#8217;s lives through the proposed application. </p>

Miss King contends that this will be the only application that the court is asked to determine.  &#8216;Any suggestion that this is a precursor to, or a Trojan horse, for a residence order application is strenuously denied&#8217;. Having said that, Miss King points out that, had T sought to apply for leave to apply for residence order, in order to acquire parental responsibility, he could have done so. However, respectful of the status of X and Y and aware of their anxieties and the &#8216;totemic significance&#8217; of parental responsibility to them, T has elected not to make that application. In Miss King&#8217;s phrase, &#8216;he is not challenging the respondents&#8217; place in Z&#8217;s life, merely seeking the continuation of one for himself&#8217;.</p>

Prior to the birth of Z, it had been agreed between X, Y and T that there would be some contact between T and the child, although the parties are not <span style="font-style:italic">ad idem</span> as to the level of contact that was anticipated. Miss King relies on the frequency of contact that actually took place in the first 18 months of Z&#8217;s life and submits that that was a reflection of the agreed role that he would play during Z&#8217;s childhood and an indication of the fact that he was to be a &#8216;social parent&#8217; to Z, involved in his life, known to be his biological father, present for major events such as birthdays, and occupying a significant role in his life. Miss King submits that the fact that contact took place on over 50 occasions in the first 18 months of Z&#8217;s life, is a material consideration for the court in determining whether to grant him leave to apply for contact at this stage. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in">Central to Miss King&#8217;s argument is the assertion made by X and Y that it was their intention that T would be a role model for Z. Miss King submits that this phrase indicates that it was acknowledged that the connection between T and Z would be significant. Miss King submits that it is significant that X and Y chose a friend to donate sperm to enable them to conceive a child. At the time of the conception, it was understood that his role would be far more than merely a sperm donor. Miss King submits that, by now using the phrase &#8220;sperm donor&#8221; to describe T, by saying that he is a &#8220;stranger&#8221; to Z, and denying that he is a positive role model, X and Y are distorting the facts and showing a lack of respect for T&#8217;s role. Miss King submits that, on the facts of the case, T is neither an unknown donor nor a known donor. His role has been greater than either of those terms suggests.</p>

She submits that an evaluation of the merits of this case is difficult without an exploration of the facts to allow for an informed and case-specific evaluation of where Z&#8217;s welfare lies. To reject the leave application would be to deprive Z of a proper examination of the issues raised and facts relied on by the respective parties. In so far as an applicant for leave is required to demonstrate &#8216;an arguable case&#8217; or &#8216;a good arguable case&#8217;, Miss King submits that T&#8217;s case manifestly satisfies this requirement. </p>

Beginning with the nature of the proposed application, Miss Russell points out that it is the express intention of T that he wishes to instigate a contact regime with a view to enabling him to build a parent-child relationship with Z. She argues that, even if X and Y had agreed to such a role, it is not possible for such an agreement to be enforced or for the court to grant an order bestowing a paternal role on the applicant. At most, any agreement that may be made by the parties at an earlier stage is only evidence as to their intent as to what informal arrangement would be entered into. It is the case advanced by X and Y that they entered into a known donation arrangement with T anticipating that he would provide the child with a sense of his identity and a positive male role model. Miss Russell submits that the nature of his proposed application, namely to allow T to build a relationship with the child, is inappropriate in that it seeks to develop a parental relationship which will threaten the respondents and is entirely inconsistent not only with their autonomy as the nuclear family but also the provision of the statutory framework that Parliament has set down for the regulation of familial relationships when children are conceived by sperm donation.</p>

Had they wished to conceive children as actively involved fathers, they could either have arranged a surrogacy or adopted&#8217;. </p>

She argues that the court will need to have a soundly based reason for finding that the introduction of T in a significant parental role was in the child&#8217;s interests, consistent with a legislative framework and that any disruption was proportionate to his needs and his right to privacy and family life. She urges that T&#8217;s application and evidence does not demonstrate such proportionality. Although there was a period of time when T had regular visits to Z, Miss Russell points out that as a matter of fact, there has been no contact since March 2012. Furthermore, she contends that T&#8217;s assertion that Z demonstrated a &#8216;definite and obvious bond&#8217; at the last contact visit betrays his lack of knowledge of the child.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in">Turning to the likelihood of the application disrupting Z&#8217;s life such as to cause him harm, X and Y are very concerned that allowing the application to proceed will significantly disrupt his life such as to cause him harm. Their concerns are based on their experience of T&#8217;s behaviour since Z&#8217;s conception and throughout his life, as described in the passages from their statements quoted above. T&#8217;s inability to respect X and Y as Z&#8217;s parents has been the cause of the difficulties between the parties and illustrates his continued refusal to accept the reality of the position in law. Miss Russell acknowledges that X and Y have made significant efforts to appease T&#8217;s increasing demands but submits that this was for the purposes for avoiding disputes and argues that the court should not view those efforts to avoid legal proceedings either as evidence of their willingness for such contact to take place, nor hold it against them as amounting to a reason for granting permission to apply. Miss Russell adds, however, &#8216;ironically, had T conducted himself differently, it is likely that the respondents would have felt able to facilitate a more significant level of contact than has proved possible.&#8217; </p>

Miss Russell observes that protecting the primary family unit, and the position of the non-birth mother, from disruption has been a concern in previous sperm donor dispute cases where it was a consideration relating to the child&#8217;s welfare. In relation to this leave application, where the court is explicitly required by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/10/9" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 10(9)</ref> to consider the potential disruption of the application to the child&#8217;s life, more significant weight should be attached to this factor at this stage where welfare is not the paramount consideration.</p>

As a result of choices made by the respondents, both S and T had regular and frequent contact with G and Z respectively. D and E chose S, an old friend of D&#8217;s, who lived 100 yards or so away, to provide sperm to enable them to conceive a child. They involved him in preparations before the birth. They invited him to see the new baby, F, immediately after birth and thereafter on a regular basis. When they decided to try for another child, they asked him to provide sperm again. They wanted their second child to have the identical genetic background to their first. Again, they involved S in the preparations before the birth and allowed him regular and frequent contact thereafter. I acknowledge that D and E say that, in some respects, they were acting under a degree of pressure when they involved S in those preparations and arranged the regular and frequent contact with the children, but the fact remains that, for whatever reason, they did involve him in this preparation and did allow him contact. Equally, D and E challenge the quality of the contact S had with F and, in particular, G, saying that, when he visited the home, it was mainly to pay a social call on his old friend D. S does not accept their evidence on these points. Irrespective of the truth about these issues, which can only be resolved after a substantive fact-finding hearing, it is clear, on either version and irrespective of the legal position, that S was not as a matter of fact a stranger to the children. Furthermore, although again no finding on the point can be made without a substantive hearing, it is in my judgment arguable that the relationship that D and E allowed S to develop with the children was linked in some way to their biological relationship. </p>

In their case, it is also significant that they expressly wanted T to be a role model for Z. They could, of course, have chosen any of their relations or other friends to be a role model, but the fact is that they chose T, the biological father of their child, for that purpose.

This illustrates the true effect of the reforms implemented in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/42/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 42 (1)</ref>, 45 (1) and 48 (2) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref>. D and E, and X and Y, have been granted full and inclusive parental responsibility for G and Z, to the exclusion of the biological fathers. They consciously exercised that responsibility by allowing S and T regular contact with the children. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">The 2008 Act</ref> empowered them to take this course. It did not deny them the right to do so. No doubt there will be some lesbian couples who, after having children by artificial insemination, not only allowed the biological fathers to have contact with the children but also encouraged them to play a full parental role and be recognised as fathers. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">The 2008 Act</ref> denies the biological father the status of <span style="font-style:italic">legal</span> parent, but it does not prevent the lesbian couple, in whom legal parenthood is vested, from encouraging or enabling the biological father to become a <span style="font-style:italic">psychological </span>parent. On the contrary, it empowers the lesbian couple to take that course as the persons in whom parental responsibility is vested.</p>

I accept Miss King&#8217;s submissions that the potential importance of genetic and psychological parenthood is not automatically extinguished by the removal of the status of legal parenthood, and that social and psychological relationships amounting to parenthood can and often do co-exist with legal parenthood. She is correct that no other person is absolutely excluded from seeking redress and I accept her submission that biological fathers who are deprived of legal parenthood by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref> should be treated no differently. Had Parliament intended that a person in a position of the applicants in this case should be entirely stripped of legal remedies, it would have expressly provided that a person in the position of S and T in these circumstances would be disqualified even from seeking the court&#8217;s leave.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in">In this case, S applies not only for contact but also for &#8216;parental responsibility/joint residence&#8217;. He seeks a parental responsibility order in respect of F but, as he is not the legal father of G, he is unable to apply for such an order in his case, and thus can only acquire parental responsibility for G if he is granted a residence order. Miss Reardon describes this as a &#8216;serious and necessary&#8217; application because S is the only person who can offer both G and F something which all three adults thought was important when they decided to take steps to conceive, namely a relationship with their other biological parent, and a knowledge of their other biological identity, background and wider paternal family. To my mind, however, there is considerable force in Miss Fottrell&#8217;s submission that the application for residence is disproportionate and that the effect of the application, intentionally or otherwise, maybe to undermine the autonomy of the family unit. I do not, however, consider that the same concerns arise if he is given leave to apply for a contact order.</p>

I am not in a position to resolve the significant factual disputes between the parties, in particular whether the three conditions which D and E assert were made clear from the outset, were ever mentioned. That factual dispute could only be resolved at a substantive hearing. Even if those three conditions were mentioned, however, the conduct of all the parties before and after the birth of F, and before and after the birth of G, indicates that it was agreed that S would have some connection with the children and some role in their lives. As a matter of fact, S had regular contact, even though the quality of that contact is in dispute. I am not persuaded that the interruption in contact in the last year or so has materially weakened the connection between S and G.</p>

This court will endeavour to manage the case in a way that ensures that the risk of harm to Z is minimised.

Miss Fottrell argued that the mothers having conceded the principle of contact in this case, the court should respect their autonomy by leaving the decision as to the quantum of an arrangement for contact to be determined by the mothers in their exercise of their parental responsibility. I have considered that argument carefully but ultimately concluded that it should not preclude the court from granting S leave to make an application for contact, although it may in due course curtail the scope of those proceedings. </p>

So far as the nature of the proposed application is concerned, T&#8217;s application is only for contact and on his behalf Miss King insists that he does not wish to use this application as a way of challenging the respondents&#8217; place in Z&#8217;s life. On behalf of X and Y, this assertion is challenged by Miss Russell who goes so far as to accuse both T and S of conduct amounting to bad faith. It is of course possible that, after the court has conducted an analysis of the substantive issues in the case, it may conclude that, applying welfare principles, it is not in Z&#8217;s interests to have contact at the level sought by T or, even, any contact at all. It may be that the court concludes that such contact would be disruptive and harmful to the child. But in my judgment that is not a reason for not allowing T to apply for some form of contact.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in">So far as T&#8217;s connection with Z is concerned, Miss King is right to say that there are many factual issues on this point which cannot be resolved without a full hearing. On any view, however, the level of contact which X and Y allowed T to have with Z in the first 18 months of Z&#8217;s life, amounting to over 50 visits, was relatively high, and sufficient in my mind by itself to demonstrate a significant connection between T and Z, in addition to the biological link, which includes links to Z&#8217;s racial and cultural heritage. To my mind, it is also highly significant that X and Y accept that they intended that T would be a role model for Z. On the facts of this case I accept Miss King&#8217;s submissions that T was more than a mere &#8216;known donor&#8217;. I am not persuaded that the interruption in contact in the past ten months significantly affects the connection between T and Z for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/10/9" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 10(9)</ref>. Even if, as Miss Russell submits, T is exaggerating when he speaks of a &#8216;definite and obvious bond&#8217; with Z, I conclude that overall there is evidence of a connection between T and Z and that this is a strong argument for at least permitting the application for contact to be made. </p>

I accept Miss Russell&#8217;s submission that protecting the primary family unit, and the position of the non-birth mother, from disruption is a relevant factor under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/10/9" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 10(9)</ref>.

On the other hand, to my mind there is considerable force in Miss Russell&#8217;s submission that the level of contact sought by T &#8211; unsupervised contact on alternate weekends &#8211; is wholly unrealistic.

Decisions on whether there should be contact, and if so the frequency of that contact, will be determined applying the decisions of s.1 of the Children Act. The respondents will continue to deploy a number of the arguments that have been raised at this hearing concerning their autonomy as parents, the integrity of their family units, the risk of disruption to those units and consequential harm to the children.

All parties have much to reflect on as a result of this hearing. Both D and E, and X and Y, may care to reflect on the fact that they chose S and T respectively to enable them to conceive children. In the case of D and E, they repeated that choice when they decided to have a second child. In the case of X and Y, they specifically wanted T to be a role model for their son. It was always part of the plans in both cases that there should be some contact between the children and their biological fathers. Equally, both S and T should reflect on the fact that the primary family unit for these children is with their mothers and this court will, when considering their substantive applications, look very carefully to ensure that any risk of harm to the children is avoided. These mothers understandably feel very vulnerable by the challenge to their family units. Notwithstanding the great social changes that have facilitated the creation of these new types of family, mothers in the position of D and E, and X and Y, understandably continue to feel vulnerable, and this court will take that vulnerability into account when considering the applications for contact.</p>
