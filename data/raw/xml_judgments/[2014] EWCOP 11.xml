Authorisation for the deprivation of DD&#8217;s liberty and for the use of restraint (even for a short time) is sought, as is permission to intrude, by force if necessary, into the privacy and sanctity of her home.  Steps to promote her physical health and well-being, it is argued, require a physically invasive medical procedure, to be conducted under general anaesthetic. I am acutely aware of the unusually onerous responsibility which falls upon me sitting as a Judge of the Court of Protection in determining this application.  </p>

A sequence of incidents of escalating seriousness caused Child 1 to be removed, and he was placed with his paternal grandparents where he remains.  DD has not taken up contact with Child 1 for many years.  During the public law proceedings, DD was assessed by Dr. Lindsey as having a mild learning disability and demonstrating impairment in three key areas (&#8220;the triad&#8221;) of autism (see &#167;49 below).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-weight:bold">Child 2</span>: DD was soon pregnant again.  Professionals from adult services (Learning Disability Team) working with the couple suspected the pregnancy, although DD and BC denied it, did not engage with professionals, and rejected advice. They ignored efforts to support them.  Towards the end of the pregnancy, DD visited the local hospital with a urinary tract infection; the midwife services were alerted.  An ante-natal check at that time confirmed the pregnancy and revealed that the unborn baby was in the breech position.  DD was persuaded that the baby would need to be delivered by caesarean section; she was however determined that the operation should not take place before the due date.  The due date arrived and the caesarean section was performed.  Given the concerns about the mother&#8217;s care of her first child, Child 2 (female) was the subject of an Emergency Protection Order at birth, and removed from the parents.  Public law proceedings followed.  The parents were legally represented (though no finding of incapacity was sought or made, it appears: see &#167;66 below).  The parents were assessed comprehensively, but ultimately with negative outcomes.  They denied that they had learning difficulties and wished for any social work record which asserted this to be destroyed. The parents missed contact sessions with Child 2 and did not attend the final hearing of the application. During these proceedings, DD displayed some delusional beliefs.  She identified a well-known actor as her father and an equally well-known opera singer (who is actually younger than DD) as her mother; she said that she had been born in New Zealand and kidnapped by the adults who raised her.  The mother would take a photograph of the opera singer to contact with Child 2 and show it to her daughter &#8211; &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">this is your grandmother</span>&#8221;.  Child 2 was subsequently adopted.</p>

In June 2010, on a home visit, DD was found cradling a baby born in her home; the baby was believed to be 5-10 days old.  Child 3 (male) was at that point seriously dehydrated and undernourished (it appears that the parents had sought to feed him with cup-a-soup), with lesions on his head believed to be caused by Bar-B-Q tongs which (from information provided by DD and BC at the time) BC had used to assist in the delivery (DD denies this).    Following Child 3&#8217;s birth, DD became mentally and physically unwell.  She was diagnosed as suffering from a delusional disorder (she was commenced on oral anti-psychotic medication); she suffered a seriously distended bladder which required catheterisation.  Child 3 was admitted to hospital for treatment, where he was discovered to have a hole in his heart.  </p>

On a routine visit to DD&#8217;s and BC&#8217;s home in July 2011, DD was observed to be very unwell; she was fitting, and unconscious.  It later transpired that she had suffered an intracerebral embolism causing fitting (status epilepticus), probably brought about by the pregnancy.  BC was unable to say for how long DD had been in this dire state.  DD was admitted to hospital as an emergency; her fitting could not be controlled, and she was therefore given general anaesthetic and ventilated on the intensive care unit.  Monitoring of the unborn baby revealed evidence of foetal bradycardia (slowing of the heart and consequent distress).  In order to treat the patient (DD) and relieve the foetal distress, an emergency caesarean section was therefore performed.  DD suffered significant post-partum haemorrhage, and required a 2 unit blood transfusion.  Child 4 (female) was born very prematurely at 29 weeks. </p>

The pregnancy was once again concealed from the professional agencies (including social workers from the adult and child services) which were endeavouring to work with the parents.  The parents withdrew from engagement with professionals, and on occasions refused entry to their home.  In mid-July, an unannounced visit by child care social workers was made to the home; BC declined their request to enter.  Following protracted negotiations (involving discussion of police attendance to obtain access to DD), BC relented.  On entering the property, DD was seen attempting to breast feed a baby (Child 5: female), swaddled in a dirty pillow case soiled with blood. The home was dirty; there was no sign of baby clothes, blankets, bottles, nappies or anything suggesting preparation for a child.    DD was evasive when asked where the afterbirth was; there was concern that it may not have been delivered.  DD looked unwell.  BC handed Child 5 to the social workers, and gave permission to have her examined in hospital.  </p>

She remains fixed in her beliefs and is unable to use the Relevant Information she is presented with to consider those fixed beliefs.  Due to those fixed beliefs, she is unable to apply the Relevant Information to herself.  She is fixed and rigid in her statements that she will have the baby at home and is unable to use the Relevant Information regarding potential risks, to weigh that decision.  This rigidity is caused by her ASD.  The concrete thinking that she demonstrates prevents her from accepting that there is a possibility that the risks she is told about could apply to her.  Her previous baby was born at home with no medical intervention, therefore to her this shows she is at no risk in a future delivery.  When the consultant obstetrician tried to convey that he was concerned for her health and wellbeing, [DD] demonstrated her inability to apply that information to herself with her response: &#8220;my brother says I am fit and fine &#8211; he rang me when I had [Child 3] &#8211; I&#8217;m a twin, he&#8217;s abroad and he&#8217;s coming to get me with my mother.

I confess that I have found this surprising. If I may say so, they have not absorbed the full force of Baroness Hale's judgment in Aintree and the emphasis placed on a 'holistic' evaluation when assessing both 'wishes and feelings' and 'best interests'. They have, in my view, whilst providing great assistance to this court in ensuring that it has the best available medical evidence before it, focused in a rather concrete manner on individual sentences or remarks. To regard the evidence I have heard as merely indicating that TH does not like hospitals as was submitted, simply does not do justice to the subtlety, ambit and integrity of the evidence which, in my judgment, has clearly illuminated TH's wishes and feelings in the way I have set out.</span></p>

In due course the clarity, cogency and force that they are found to have will have a direct impact on the weight they are to be given. 'Wishes' and 'best interests' should never be conflated, they are entirely separate matters which may ultimately weigh on different sides of the balance sheet.&#8221;</span></p>

Key among those risks is the risk of intra-abdominal injury from adhesions caused during the operation, but Mr A assesses this (from his own clinical experience) at 0.1%.  There is also the greater risk of wound infection, and inevitable additional abdominal pain.  Post-operative recovery is slower and more difficult.  Operative treatment now will cause additional scarring on the uterus, thus making subsequent pregnancies potentially more at risk from scar rupture; in short, if this infant is delivered by caesarean section, there are enhanced risks to DD for any future pregnancy (a vaginal delivery becomes less advisable with each delivery).  </p>
