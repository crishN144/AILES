KW subsequently moved to Priory Court Nursing Home in Lancashire where she resided between January and July 2009.

The balance sheet approach was a careful and measured assessment which Mr Read could not be persuaded in cross-examination should be re-evaluated with greater emphasis on direct family contact.</span></p>

There is however no doubt that were it not for her intervention this case would not have come to court.  There was clear evidence of a breakdown in communication and trust between the local authority, the care home and DW.  Against that should be set the very obvious care and affection from DW to her sister and her wish to do everything possible to maintain her quality of life, care and accommodation.  Nonetheless it was difficult not to draw a conclusion that a relocation of KW to London would significantly be in the interests of DW with no cogent evidence from her of the added benefits to KW.  </span></p>

There are abject failures from which no doubt lessons will be learnt.  It may be, with hindsight, KW should not initially have been moved to R H and that there should have been more detailed discussion with family members and a wider search for an appropriate placement.  KW requires 24 hour care and support within a service staffed by a consistent team that has knowledge and experience of supporting adults with a learning disability associated with physical health issues and emotional difficulties that lead to potential challenging behaviour (ISWF128).  She requires a consistently provided care plan that includes appropriate behavioural support designed to enhance her independence and ensure her own emotional wellbeing and safety.</span></p>

In addition she has expressed a consistent view that she wishes to remain at R H and the local authority have agreed with Mr Read&#8217;s recommendation that the need for a longer term placement will be considered at each review.  The difficult issue is that of contact.  DW&#8217;s submissions are that the benefits of regular contact between her and her sister are such so as to adjust the balance sheet making the current placement at R H not in KW&#8217;s best interests.  There is no doubt that family contact and continued contact with DW are considered important matters by both the Social Work Team and the ISW.  However I am not persuaded that this requires further weight to be given to the issue of contact so as to cause an adjustment in the balance sheet.  There is one further practical difficulty with regard to DW&#8217;s contention namely that a placement or indeed a geographic location of a potential placement has not been identified.  To me this is the answer to the Section 37 Care Act point raised on behalf of DW.  I accept the submissions of the Second Respondent that without a geographic area being identified it is impossible for the court to make a declaration with regard for example that it is in KW&#8217;s best interests to live in London.  I entirely agree that to make declarations based on a move to London or a move to an area geographically closer to DW run the risk of the court straying into the making of hypothetical decisions.  There is no available option currently before the court (or indeed the likelihood of a further option in the foreseeable future) such as to permit the court to consider such declaration.
