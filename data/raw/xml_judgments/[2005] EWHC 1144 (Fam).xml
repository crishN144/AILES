	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">E was born in 1972. From a very early age she suffered from neglect and emotional abuse. She was taken into care by the local authority. Whilst in care she met Judy, who at that time was employed as a play therapist at a children's hospital which E attended. From 1984 to 1989 E was placed at a Rudolph Steiner school. In 1987, following the breakdown of her previous foster placement, E was placed with Judy and her then husband as foster carers. From 1989 until 1999 E was placed by the local authority in a residential establishment. In 1999 she was removed by Judy who took her to live in her own home. She remained there until her current package of care was set up, following extensive negotiations with the local authority, initially by Judy and subsequently from February 2002 by the Official Solicitor. E now lives in her own house, supported by a large round-the-clock care support team. I have not been told exactly how the team is funded and managed, but as I understand it the funding comes from the local social services and health authorities under the community care legislation - the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/11-12/29" uk:canonical="1948 (11 &amp; 12 Geo. 6) c. 29" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">National Assistance Act 1948</ref>, the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1970/44" uk:canonical="1970 c. 44" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970</ref> and the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/19" uk:canonical="1990 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990</ref>. Although she does not live in E's house, Judy continues to play what is on any view a central role in E's life. </p>

DID, in the view of the Official Solicitor's expert, Dr Milne, is an extremely controversial diagnosis which is probably best considered to be a disorder of personality rather than a mental illness. </p>

In E's case there are four personalities in addition to E herself: "Sandra", "Andrew", "Margaret" and "Susan". As can be seen on the Channel Four film, when E is in a dissociative state she switches between herself and her other "personalities", each apparently interacting with the other(s). Thus, for example, the film shows "Andrew" trying to kiss Judy and "Sandra" trying to stop "Andrew" behaving in this way by slapping him - each of these roles being simultaneously played out, often with different facial expressions and in different tones of voice, by E herself. </p>

In November 2002 Mr Boulton contacted a professional colleague, David Modell, an independent filmmaker and photographer whose principal occupation for the last four years has been making documentary films for Channel Four. Mr Modell had a number of telephone conversations with Judy during November and December 2002 and met E and her care team on 19 December 2002.

With E's approval a compilation of the material he had shot was shown by Mr Modell in April 2003 to Kevin Sutcliffe, commissioning editor at Channel Four. Mr Sutcliffe indicated that he would support the project and take the first steps toward commissioning the documentary. At subsequent meetings between Mr Modell, Mr Sutcliffe and Jan Tomalin, head of legal and compliance at Channel Four, it was agreed to draw up a production protocol for what they recognised was "clearly going to be a very sensitive film" and also to engage a psychiatric consultant to offer advice during the filming and editing process. In due course Dr Judith Trowell, a Consultant Child &amp; Adolescent Psychotherapist at the Tavistock Clinic, was appointed as psychiatric consultant for the production. As it happens she was aware of E, having assessed her as a teenager in the late 1980s. </p>

As recently as 11 September 2003 she had assessed E as part of the preparation for the ongoing community care case. Dr Milne responded on 30 September 2003. On 3 October 2003 Mr Modell wrote to the local authority. On 13 October 2003 the Official Solicitor's solicitors, responding to the letter from Mr Modell, wrote to Steve Boulton Productions. Referring to the advice they had received from Dr Milne, they expressed the Official Solicitor's view that E's participation in the documentary was not in her best interests and that filming should therefore immediately cease. They sought confirmation within 24 hours that filming would cease, failing which they would have no option but to consider legal action. </p>

They are both of the opinion that E is able to give informed consent to the filming and broadcast of the programme and that the filming and broadcast of such a documentary would be in her best interests. In addition, Graeme Farquharson, a Psychodynamic Psychotherapist, who regularly advises on issues relating to E's care, is also . fully aware of the filming. He has expressed no concern either about E's capacity to consent or her welfare." </p>

During the course of the editing Mr Modell decided to make no mention of the ongoing dispute between the local authority and E's care team, though he was conscious that this was bound to cause conflict with Judy who was, he says, desperate that her views about social services should be broadcast. He also showed a rough version to Dr Trowell who again reassured him, saying that, as far as she could see, the film was sensitively made, correct and not harmful to E. </p>

Dr Sinason said that she was entirely satisfied that E had benefited from the process of making the film and that it was in her best interest. She said that in her view E clearly consented to it having been made and to the intended broadcast. According to Mr Modell the general response by the group to the viewing was very positive. A number of mainly minor points were raised, one being the unhappiness of Judy and some other members of the group that no reference was being made to the dispute with the local authority. The only substantive issue related to a scene towards the end of the film showing Judy and E which both of them wanted changing. There were no other parts of the film that E said she did not like or asked to be changed. </p>

Judy asked that some of one of the final scenes in the film should be cut and was supported in this by E. Mr Modell agreed to make further cuts in this part of the film. On 2 March 2005 E, Judy, Dr Sinason, Mr Farquharson and two other members of the care team viewed the last three scenes in the film to see that the agreed changes had been made. Ms Ann Whitla Syz was also present. She is a Child Psychotherapist who assists in the supervision of Judy's clinical work as a Trainee Child Psychotherapist. She has no professional responsibility for E and was present to ensure that Judy's work as a trainee Child Psychotherapist would not be compromised by the contents of the film. </p>

The injunction sought, which was intended to have effect during E's. lifetime, was in wide terms and would have prevented both the broadcast of the film and the publication of the story. Unhappily, and because, as the Official Solicitor tells me, the court misplaced the papers, the proceedings were not in fact issued until 19 May 2005, the very day when the interim application came on before Kirkwood J. That application had been fixed on the basis of a belief that the feature article in the Sunday Times magazine due to be published on 5 June 2005 would have to go to press by around 20 May 2005. Kirkwood J was unable to hear the matter - and in any event some of the urgency had gone because it appeared that the Sunday Times was not going to press with the story that week. The matter came on for hearing before me on 25 May 2005. Ms Fenella Morris appeared for the Official Solicitor and Ms Jenni Richards for the local authority.

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">"[35] Article 8 thus protects two very different kinds of private life: both the private life lived privately and kept hidden from the outside world and also the private&#183; life lived in company with other human beings and shared with the outside world. For, as the Strasbourg jurisprudence recognises, the ability to lead one's own personal life as one chooses, the ability to develop one's personality, indeed one's very psychological and moral integrity, are dependent upon being able to interact and develop relationships with other human beings&#183; and with the world at large. And central to one's psychological and moral integrity, to one's feelings of self-worth, is the knowledge of one's childhood, development and history. So amongst the rights protected by Art 8, as it seems to me, is the right, as a human being, to share with others - and, if one so chooses, with the world at large - one's own story, the story of one's childhood, development and history ... </p>

Art 8 thus embraces both the right to maintain one's privacy and, if this is what one prefers, not merely the right to waive that privacy but also the right to share what would otherwise be private with others or, indeed, with the world at large.

The court cannot exercise the inherent jurisdiction and, unless E herself wishes to apply for an injunction (and she does not), it follows that the court equally cannot grant any injunction. As Mr Nicol correctly submits, the court in a case such as this only has jurisdiction to make an order if it has first decided that E lacks capacity to take a definitive decision on her own behalf.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">But the fact, if fact it be, that E lacks the relevant capacity does not mean that her wishes and feelings simply fall out of account. As Mr Nicol correctly says, even if the court concludes that E lacks capacity it must nonetheless pay close regard to her undoubted wish for the broadcast to proceed. If it is elementary that the inherent jurisdiction is exercised by reference to the incompetent adult's best interests, it is equally elementary that in determining where such an adult's best interests truly lie it is necessary, just as in the case of a child, to have regard to his wishes and feelings insofar as he is able to express them: consider <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1 (3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/4/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4(6)</ref>(a) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>.

So the task of the court, assuming E lacks capacity, is to form a view as to whether her best interests require, as she would wish, that an injunction is <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>granted or whether, as the Official Solicitor would have it, her best interests require that an injunction <span style="font-style:italic">is </span>granted.

There is no conflict between her wish to tell her story, her best interests and the media's wish to broadcast and publish. It is only if there is a conflict between E's best interests and the plans of the media that one moves on to the third and final stage of the inquiry. But at this stage E's best interests are not determinative. There is a balancing exercise. The court is no longer exercising its inherent jurisdiction in relation to E but rather its ordinary jurisdiction under the Convention as between claimant and defendant. Accordingly it has to balance the competing interests: E's interest under Article 8 (as ascertained by the court), and therefore her right under Article 8 to keep her private life private, and the defendants' rights under Article 10. </p>

As to what degree of likelihood makes the prospects of success "sufficiently favourable", the general approach should be that courts will be exceedingly slow to make interim restraint orders where the applicant has not satisfied the court he will probably ("more likely than not") succeed at the trial. In general, that should be the threshold an applicant must cross before the court embarks on exercising its discretion, duly taking into account the relevant jurisprudence on article 10 and any countervailing Convention rights. But there will be cases where it is necessary for a court to depart from this general approach and a lesser degree of likelihood will suffice as a prerequisite. Circumstances where this may be so include those mentioned above: where the potential adverse consequences of disclosure are particularly grave, or where a short-lived injunction is needed to enable the court to hear and give proper consideration to an application for interim relief pending the trial or any relevant appeal." </p>

He&#183; tells me that since the information he obtained was very similar to that obtained by Dr Milne he did not consider it appropriate to file further evidence. I do not find this explanation particularly compelling. If there was factual evidence underpinning Dr Milne's concerns about the impact of the film on the future of the care package it would have been of great assistance to the court to hear it from the Official Solicitor, as the person acting as E's litigation friend not merely in the present proceedings but also in relation to her community care needs (see further my observations in paragraph [109] below). The Official Solicitor has not even interviewed E since the film was completed with a view to ascertaining and reporting to the court on her wishes and feelings. He tells me that a visit to see E had been arranged for 19 May 2005 (but did not take place because of the hearing before Kirkwood J) and that further efforts to arrange to arrange a visit have met with resistance. I accept all that, but the fact remains that the present proceedings were launched without the Official Solicitor having himself first ascertained E's wishes and feelings in relation to the completed film and in circumstances where, in the event, I have not had the benefit of material which is usually of great assistance.

I have been further reassured in this because during the later stages of filming and particularly the editing and viewing stages our relationship with Judy became very fraught. Over the months between November 2004 to March 2005 Judy regularly threatened to withdraw from the film, concerned about how she might be portrayed. This intention was never mirrored by E, who throughout this period, and, indeed, from the start of the production was forthright and unambiguous in her desire for the film to be made and broadcast. </p>

That is no longer relevant to the issue of capacity. The question of capacity, as I have said, is always issue specific. The process of filming has now concluded, as has the editing of the film. The only question today is whether E has capacity to consent to the broadcast of the film in the form in which she saw it in March 2005. That was not a question addressed by Dr Milne in her first report. Importantly, however, she did make clear that E's capacity in relation to filming was not consistent and had improved when she saw her in February 2004. </p>

Asked specifically by the Official Solicitor's solicitor in a letter dated 12 May 2005 whether E has capacity to consent to the film being broadcast, Dr Milne replied in her letter dated 13 May 2005, referring to how E had presented in 2004, that "she did not appear to understand the possible negative consequences of broadcast, both in terms of how she may be viewed by others but also the possible effect that the broadcast may have on the extremely protracted negotiations about her care package." </p>

	      <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:1in">"This is clearly not straightforward (both in regard to P and generally to those with learning disabilities). I am not a specialist in this field, but I understand that modem practice considers capacity on a "decision-specific" basis. It would be true to say that P does not have unfailingly evident capacity to consent, but it is equally true that it is not evident that that capacity is entirely absent. It is the working style of the project to be as open as possible with P to ensure that she is fully appraised regarding matters which concern her, including the politics surrounding the project. In a context of safety and trust, this is done sensitively, offering (in "bite-size chunks") as much complexity as can be managed, and in regularly revisiting key matters at moments of stability and engagement. This approach derives from three sources - 1) a belief that it is right and proper that P be apprised of everything which affects her life; 2) the knowledge that historically the approach of institutional care has often been one of benign paternalism, making decisions on behalf of individuals without involving them or seeking their view, frequently with disastrous results; and 3) by this means, facilitating the emergence of personal agency and encouraging it where it exists. It is in this spirit of openness that the subject of a film has been approached with P and it is my view that, with regard to this decision, she had (and has) sufficient understanding for it to be meaningful."</p>

	      <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:1in">"As someone with a Dissociative Identity Disorder in the context of a Learning Disability, E's self-presentation can be disconcerting to some (at least initially) - now lucid, now dissociated, now 'distracted', now lucid ... To those who know E well, this kind of rhythm is familiar and it is entirely possible to get far beyond a surface impression of incompetence: her&#183; capacity for reflection and judgment is far greater than imagined or perceived by many professionals who pass through E's life, usually with one or two brief meetings. Such workers, usually concerned with assessment! review/ comment - and there have been very many of these over the years - will usually encounter a E who is quite reasonably guarded. Given circumstances where she .feels safe (psychologically and physically), with people whom she trusts, and where complex ideas can be approached at a manageable pace in appropriate language, E can be relied upon to express her thoughts clearly on what is best for her. With regard to the filming, she was enthusiastic from the earliest explorations of the idea. She quickly established a good rapport with the film-maker. (This is significant. In her early life, E had much experience of neglectful and abusive adults and she has well developed antennae for discerning those who might 'do her harm' .) Thus she engaged with the process, asked questions about it, received answers and explanations and was well able to 'tell off the director if she felt something or other was not right. Thus, haste was made extremely slowly; in an openly collaborative style. It was clear that if there was disquiet about the film-making, any sense of exploitation or misrepresentation, then she would withdraw from it." </p>

In particular Dr Milne is concerned that the current negotiations will be "considerably hampered if not irreparably damaged" if the details of how E lives and is cared for come into the public domain and that the vulnerable adult abuse investigation may be compromised. </p>

He did so in a further report dated 18 May 2005. He differed from Dr Milne's assessment of the possible impact of the film on the ongoing negotiations for the care package and on the ongoing vulnerable adult abuse investigation. He described the film as "a fair representation of brief moments in [E's] life" and said that as such, whilst it might lead the local authority to question the nature of the care being provided by Judy, that was likely to be of benefit rather than harm to E, for "if there was concern about the strategies shown on the film, then it can only be to [E's] benefit that these are examined by people with the skills to do so" and the film "could be of benefit to her in the sense that it could inform, in a positive way, this assessment." In relation to possible adverse comments, whether about E or Judy, or possible criticisms from members of her family, Professor Holland's view was that they were "unlikely to be of a nature or severity that could cause harm. I believe that [E] is aware of the possibility of such criticisms and this issue, by itself, does not in my view argue against showing the film." He was unable to see how the film would harm the vulnerable adult abuse investigation: "if anything, it might help inform the investigation." Overall, as I understand what he is saying, Professor Holland remains of the view that transmission of the film is unlikely to cause E harm and that, given her wishes in the matter, it is in her best interests that it be shown. </p>

At no time was she distressed by what she was watching. Rather, she took a certain (appropriate) pride in this representation of her. (Remember that in recent months there have been TV films about women with DID - one dramatisation, one documentary - so there was/is a wider context for her television appearance. It is not freakish, abusive or disabling.) Moreover, there was a quality of her having a chance to 'put her side of (her) story'. Very often, when people have endured severe abuse or trauma, they speak of their lives having been stolen and much of their later efforts is to re-claim their lives. One of the functions of the film is to sweep away the cloak of secrecy which has surrounded E's life. She is already 'out in the world' in very significant ways and she knows the range of responses she can expect to encounter there - a television film has nothing new to put to her in that regard. These responses simply need to be managed (and are managed) as part of her external reality. </p>

It would tell her that her story is unfit for portrayal; and it would lock her forever into this secretive 'bubble' where she can never bear witness to what has happened to her. All of these would be significant contributors to constraining and undermining the very real psychological, emotional and social development which she has achieved in recent years."</p>

It runs for a little under 50 minutes. It contains scenes both in E's home and in public (for example in a supermarket and at airports) both in this country and in Greece. It shows a number of scenes of E in a dissociative state, switching between herself and her other "personalities". To a layman who has never seen this before it is disturbing. The film shows E taking medication. It also contains scenes where E's sister, K, describes in distressing detail the starvation, and the physical, sexual and emotional abuse, which she says they and their other siblings suffered at home during their early years. There are scenes featuring Judy, some showing her in what some viewers might think of as an 'odd' light. Although this is not the real theme of the film there is implied criticism of the local authority's handling of the case many years ago when the children were much younger. There is no criticism of what the local authority is currently doing - as we have seen, Mr Modell was not prepared on this topic to go along with Judy's agenda - although there is, albeit in passing, reference to the fact that the care team consists of about 20 people and that the annual cost to the local social services and health authorities of the care package is of the order of &#163;500,000. </p>

It is, in my view, a serious attempt to explore E's predicament and to explain it to the public in an educative and informative way. The 'tone' of the film is neither prurient nor exploitative. It takes E seriously as a human being in her own right, showing her in a dignified and thinking light. Although much of what it shows is, on any view, unusual and, as I have said, is in some respects disturbing, the film does not put E on show, nor does it, as it were, invite the audience to mock or ridicule or laugh at her or treat her as a freak. On the contrary it seeks to inform the viewer and invites the viewer to understand her, sympathise with her and empathise with her. It is, if one chooses to use such terminology, a responsible piece of serious documentary film, not a cheap piece of sensational journalism. The purpose of the film is education, not entertainment. It raises issues of public importance. It is, on the face of it, a valuable contribution to an important public debate on issues which too often are swept under the carpet in fear or embarrassment. </p>

I have in mind, in particular, though not of course ignoring the evidence of Ms Syz and Dr Banks, the evidence of Mr Farquharson and Dr Sinason. They, of all the experts, are the people who have known E most intensively and over the longest continuous periods. And Dr Sinason, Mr Farquharson, Ms Syz and Dr Banks all had the advantage of being able to observe E's reaction to viewing the film.

As I have already observed, the Official Solicitor has filed no ,evidence on these matters - indeed no evidence at all - and, as Mr Nicol fairly observed, both the local authority's evidence and Dr Milne's report are short on detailed factual evidence to support the rather general case being made. Moreover, I think I am entitled to assume that public authorities will do their duty and will not allow themselves to be deflected by adverse media comment or other pressures.

I have in mind in particular the emphasis that Professor Holland appropriately places on E's own wishes and feelings, the distress which Dr Milne, Dr Sinason and Mr Farquharson all agree E will suffer if the film is not shown, and what in my judgment are the other very important and compelling points made by Dr Sinason, Mr Farquharson and Dr Banks.

But on the other side one would have to put, not merely E's (albeit on this hypothesis incompetent) wishes and feelings and the distress she will undoubtedly suffer if the film is not shown, but also the various public interest arguments identified, for example, by Mr Modell and Professor Holland. It would also be necessary to consider the purpose and character of the film itself, as I have sought to do in paragraphs [98][99] above.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The first relates to the way in which Channel Four went about the filming, something about which both the local authority, and more particularly the Official Solicitor, make strong complaint. Ms Morris complains that neither the film makers nor Judy consulted with the local authority responsible, as she puts it, for E's care, nor with the Official Solicitor whom Judy knew was representing E in relation to her community care needs. The film makers, she says, continued to proceed as though the Official Solicitor was not involved, and as if there was no local authority responsible for E, even after they had made their responsibilities clear. They showed the film to&#183; E several times without, as Ms Morris puts it, any consultation with those responsible for her as to the effect the film might have on her. Ms Morris asserts that "there is a public interest in film-makers not going about making films as they did in this case". She submits that "there is a positive obligation on the court under Article 8 not to establish a precedent which allows film-makers or other media to benefit from commencing filming children or incapable adults without notice to or consultation with those concerned with their care". </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">"In this case it is apparent from the correspondence, in particular the solicitors' letters, that the film company and Channel 4 are at pains to assert their democratic right to interview and film children provided that they obtain their individual consent. There appears to be a complete lack of understanding on their part of the position of the director of social services who has a responsible statutory duty to protect young people in his area. It appears to me that the problems in this case have principally arisen from the fact that the film company took the deliberate decision not to alert or to inform the social services of their proposed operations. They approached these children without parental consent or knowledge and indeed without the knowledge of anybody whose duty it was to seek to afford a degree of supervisory assistance to the children. Undoubtedly misunderstandings occurred as a result."</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">As a matter of history many of Ms Morris's complaints are simply not borne out as a matter of fact. It is to be noted that, even now, the local authority has still not commenced any proceedings under the inherent jurisdiction with a view to regulating E's care. The local authority's formal role in the matter is, essentially, as a provider of community care services to E under the community care legislation (though in saying this I do not overlook its responsibilities ~o E under the Department of Health's <span style="font-style:italic">No Secrets). </span>Prior to the commencement of the present proceedings the Official Solicitor's only formal role was as litigation friend in relation to E's community care needs. Judy's role may be self-appointed but she is not a mere busybody. And as I pointed out during the course of argument, the doctrine of necessity as explained in <span style="font-style:italic">In re F (Mental Patient: Sterilisation) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1990] 2 AC 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1990">[1990] 2 AC 1</ref> clothes Judy, unless and until she is replaced, with authority to act in E's best interests insofar as she lacks the capacity to take her own decisions: see the analysis in <span style="font-style:italic">Re </span>S <span style="font-style:italic">(Adult Patient) (Inherent Jurisdiction: Family Life) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2002/2278" uk:canonical="[2002] EWHC 2278 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] EWHC 2278 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 1 FLR 292" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 1 FLR 292</ref>, at paras [20]-[22]. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mr Modell consulted throughout with Judy, which is not to say that he was not also appropriately sensitive to the fact that her 'agenda' might not always be consistent with E's welfare. He consulted throughout with members of E's care team, critically with both Mr Farquharson and Dr Sinason, and reacted, appropriately as it seems to me, to any concerns they expressed. He was careful to employ Dr Trowell as psychiatric consultant to the programme. Although reserving formal editorial control he deferred in reality to E's wishes and to the expert opinions of the professional members of her care team, whilst at the same time not being prepared to go along with Judy's separate agenda when it conflicted with what E and the other members of her care team wanted. Mr Nicol submits on his behalf that there has throughout been proper compliance with the relevant regulatory code - the ITC Programme Code - and Ms Morris was unable to gainsay him. Nor did her attempt to demonstrate that Part <span style="font-style:italic">N </span>of the <span style="font-style:italic">Guidelines for Treatment </span>published by The International Society for the Study of Dissociation had been breached fare any better, for both E's therapeutic carers, and indeed Dr Trowell, are, as Mr Nicol points out, of the view that broadcasting the film will not in the circumstances be detrimental to E. </p>

And a very similar approach might well be called for in a situation where a local authority had assumed some kind of formal responsibility for an incapable adult, for example by taking proceedings under the inherent jurisdiction as in <span style="font-style:italic">Re </span>S <span style="font-style:italic">(Adult Patient) (Inherent Jurisdiction: Family Life) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2002/2278" uk:canonical="[2002] EWHC 2278 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] EWHC 2278 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 1 FLR 292" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 1 FLR 292</ref> (and as the local authority is now planning to do here) or under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> or, when it comes into force, under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>. But I do not agree with Ms Morris that one can, as it were, extrapolate from that to the more sweeping proposition for which she seems to be contending, that the media, whether the print media or the broadcast media, must first consult with the relevant local authority or with the Official Solicitor before seeking to interview or film a vulnerable adult, or even an adult who is in receipt of care and support under the community care legislation. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The second matter relates to the way in which the present application was brought before the court. As I have already related, by the time this matter came on for hearing before me on 25 May 2005 it was extremely urgent; a decision was needed by the following morning. This court is very familiar with and, irrespective of the adverse impact it may have on the personal convenience of the judges, willingly shoulders the burdens, however great, of dealing with urgent cases. But the urgency in this case was avoidable. The Official Solicitor has been involved since August 2003. The film was seen by his solicitors and counsel and a member of his staff on 11 March 2005. He was told on 15 April 2005 that the film was to be broadcast on 8 June 2005. Yet it was not until 13 May 2005 that he launched the proceedings. This delay was unacceptable. In another Division it might have led to the summary dismissal of his application on that ground alone. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_122">
	  <num>122.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">As I understand it a number of factors contributed to this delay. The first is that on 11 March 2005 the Official Solicitor was suddenly and unexpectedly faced with the need to change solicitors, and it took until 23 March 2005 for all the papers to be received from the previous solicitors. Secondly, there was delay in obtaining funding from the Legal Services Commission. (The Official Solicitor is no longer able to fund cases such as this - practice in the 'medical' cases is different - out of his own budget but seeks public funding from the Commission.) The Commission was apparently not prepared to grant authority to bring proceedings against the defendants without a comprehensive report from the Official Solicitor's solicitors and counsel's advice. Finally, it is said that the local authority did not respond immediately to certain requests for information from the Official Solicitor. The consequence, as I understand it, is that it was not until 5 May 2005 that the papers required by the Commission were sent to it and not until 9 May 2005 that authority was given by the Commission. Whilst I can sympathise with the difficulties in which the Official Solicitor found himself, the events as I have described them can be of no comfort either to the defendants or to the court; indeed it can only be a matter of great concern to the court that the interests of vulnerable people for whom the Official Solicitor acts are potentially being prejudiced by funding difficulties. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The consequence was that I had to announce my decision on the morning of 26 May 2005 in circumstances where it was quite impossible for me to formulate any but the most exiguous reasons in the short time which was all I had been allowed since 6.45 pm the previous evening; a difficulty only compounded by the fact that, even after the hearing had finished the night before, I still needed time to reflect before coming to a decision. That, and the state of the lists on 26 and 27 May 2005, meant in turn that, if the Official Solicitor was to have any sensible chance of getting to the Court of Appeal before the film was broadcast on 8 June 2005, I would have to spend a Bank Holiday weekend, as I have done, preparing this judgment. That, I emphasise, is a task I will always willingly undertake if the circumstances require it. But in the present case the circumstances that required it were, as I have said, avoidable. They could - and should - have been avoided. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The final matter is this. The task of preparing this judgment has been made more time consuming by the absence of any chronology. I have accordingly had to piece together myself the narrative in paragraphs [2]-[34] above. In <span style="font-style:italic">CF v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2004/111" uk:canonical="[2004] EWHC 111 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWHC 111 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] 2 FLR 517" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] 2 FLR 517</ref>, at paras [214]-[215], I expressed certain views as to the procedure to be adopted in this Division in cases brought under CPR Part 8. I indicated that there should at the very least be lodged with the court the documents referred to in para 3.1 of the <span style="font-style:italic">Practice Direction (Family Proceedings: Court Bundles) </span>(10 March 2000) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] 1 WLR 737" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] 1 WLR 737</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] 1 FLR 536" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] 1 FLR 536</ref>, that is: a summary of the background to the hearing; a statement of the issue or issues to be determined; a summary of the order or directions sought by each party; a chronology; and skeleton arguments. Given that that was itself a case in which the Official Solicitor was involved it is all the more depressing to have to complain, as I do, about the failure to lodge a chronology. Urgency can be no excuse: if no sooner, there was plenty of time to prepare a proper chronology between the hearings on 19 and 25 May 2005. </p>
