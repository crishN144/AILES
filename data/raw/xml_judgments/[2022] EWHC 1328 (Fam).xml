At a short hearing yesterday, I directed that she be served by process server at her last known address yesterday afternoon, after the mother had refused to provide an email address for the papers to be sent to her.   Personal service was not effected as the process server was unable to gain access to the mother&#8217;s property and was unwilling to throw confidential documents over a locked gate.  However, an email address for the mother having been ascertained, the solicitors for the Trust provided the papers to the mother in electronic form this morning and notified her that this hearing was taking place at 2pm this afternoon.  The mother has not attended.  Given the urgency of this matter, for reasons I shall come to, I am satisfied that it is appropriate to proceed in the mother&#8217;s absence.</p>

The administration of a general anaesthetic is opposed by the mother, albeit she does appear to oppose the taking of a biopsy itself.  The biopsy is scheduled for tomorrow.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The background can be stated shortly.  ZY was referred to the regional sarcoma service on the 27 April 2022.  He has a four year history of an enlarging mass at the front of his right ankle. ZY&#8217;s case was discussed at a multidisciplinary new patient meeting on the 29 April 2022 and again on the 6 May 2022.  ZY&#8217;s MRI scan dated 22 April 2022 was reported as showing a 4.6 x 4 x 3cm soft tissue tumour situated between the skin of the front of his ankle and the lower end of his tibia.  The features were suspicious for it being a malignant soft tissue sarcoma, which is a rare type of tumour.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In circumstances where the index of ZY&#8217;s tumour gives rise to a strong clinical suspicion of malignancy, Dr P considers that there is an urgent need for the tumour to be the subject of a biopsy.  Specifically, an image-guided core needle biopsy is required to establish a tissue diagnosis, which will then guide further treatment.  That urgency is grounded in the need to establish quickly whether the tumour is malignant and, if so, to commence treatment to maximise the chances of successful treatment by way of chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy.  Within this context, and having regard to the NHS treatment protocol, the clinicians are required to ensure that these investigations are carried out within two weeks of referral.  </p>

Thereafter, the needle biopsy system cuts a 2 cm fragment to obtain a specimen. This stage may be painful, depending on the nature of the lesion. This operation is repeated at least 5 to 6 times to ensure enough molecular / genetic testing material. </p>

Dr P provides the following opinion with respect to a biopsy under general anaesthetic:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;In order to plan treatment, it is essential that we establish a tissue diagnosis and in order to do this, he requires a test called a core needle biopsy. This involves inserting a large, hollow needle several times through the skin, into the tumour and obtaining multiple cores of tissue from it. To carry this out safely it is essential to have a still patient so that the biopsy can be accurately performed. In view of ZY&#8217;s age of seven years, we have recommended that this procedure be performed under general anaesthetic. This is standard practice for biopsies in children of this age and would be considered best practice in any recognised sarcoma centre. In our opinion, it would not be safe to perform this test under local anaesthetic. If ZY were to move during the procedure there would be a high risk of contaminating the surrounding tissues with tumour cells which could make definitive treatment more complex. There would be a strong possibility that the procedure would have to be abandoned, further delaying the diagnosis. It may also be distressing for ZY.&#8221; </p>

Mr Osborne further noted during his oral submissions the general nature and low level of the risks that are attendant on a general anaesthetic and that ZY underwent pre-assessment testing on 11 May 2022, which did not reveal any contraindications to the use of a general anaesthetic.</p>

However, by reference to those decisions, in <span style="font-style:italic">Re E and Another (Minors: Blood Transfusion)</span> the Court of Appeal further reminded judges that the court must focus on the matters relevant in the case before it.  Within this context, and acknowledging the starting point being the strong, but rebuttable, presumption that it is in a person's best interests to stay alive, the Court of Appeal observed at [52] that:</p>

But, approached carefully, these are more matters of form than substance. What is important is that the court identifies the factors that really matter in the case before it, gives each of them proper weight, and balances them out to make the choice that is right for the individual at the heart of the decision. If this process is properly carried out so as to arrive at a sound welfare decision, the court will not be acting incompatibly with rights arising under Arts 2, 3 and 8 (and, here, 9) of the European Convention on Human Rights.&#8221;</p>

This means that the court will not be bound to follow the evaluation provided by the medical witnesses in the case, albeit that that evaluation will often carry significant weight.  It also means that the weight to be accorded to the wishes and feelings of the child must be considered in accordance with their age and understanding, the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re E and Another (Minors: Blood Transfusion)</span> pointing out that there is a significant difference between a young child and a child who is Gillick competent with respect to the treatment proposed.  In this case, ZY is 7 years old, with no suggestion that he is Gillick competent with respect to the question of whether his biopsy should take place under a general anaesthetic or not.</p>

That that is the appropriate starting point in this case is underlined by the fact that, if found to be an usual form of malignant osteosarcoma, ZY&#8217;s tumour will represent a significant risk to his life.  Within that context, I am satisfied that it is in ZY&#8217;s best interests to take all steps that are reasonable in order to protect his life from the impact of what is potentially an aggressive and fatal disease.  In this regard, the medical evidence before the court is clear that an image-guided core needle biopsy offers the best chance of a successful biopsy and a reliable diagnosis, upon which successful treatment of tumour is dependent.  It is further clear that it is in ZY&#8217;s best interests for that step to be undertaken urgently.</p>

In particular, that not to use a general anaesthetic would significantly increase the potential for pain and distress for ZY during the procedure, would significantly increase the risk of the biopsy not producing diagnostic results with a delay in achieving a diagnosis and correct treatment and, perhaps most seriously, would significantly increase the risk of the biopsy itself resulting in the further distribution of cancerous cells to organs that are not yet affected, leading to further complications and making definitive treatment of a malignant cancer more complex.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within this context, I am satisfied that the risks of not using a general anaesthetic to facilitate the needle biopsy significantly outweigh the risks of doing so.  The evidence before the court makes clear that the use of a light general anaesthetic on ZY caries with it no greater risk to him than is ordinarily attendant on the use of a general anaesthetic in a child of ZY&#8217;s age.  Within this context, I am satisfied that those general risks are significantly outweighed by the benefits to ZY of the biopsy being undertaken under a general anaesthetic, namely the increased chance of a successful biopsy being undertaken and a reduction in the risk that the biopsy itself may result in spreading cancerous cells elsewhere in ZY&#8217;s body.</p>

It is the case that the mother does not object to the biopsy being carried out but, rather, to it being carried out under general anaesthetic. However, the rationale for that step is clear on the evidence before the court.  In any event, I am satisfied that those objections cannot outweigh the manifest advantages for ZY&#8217;s welfare of an effective biopsy being undertaken of his tumour.

However, once again I am conscious that this matter is urgent in that the longer it takes to obtain a definitive diagnosis in respect of ZY&#8217;s tumour the more difficult it will be to treat that tumour if it transpires it is malignant, not least because ZY&#8217;s treating clinicians consider that there is a significant chance that the tumour is a rare form of osteosarcoma.  Within this context, and in particular having regard to the fact that ZY is seven years old, I consider that it is not in ZY&#8217;s best interests to adjourn this matter in order that his views can be canvassed.</p>
