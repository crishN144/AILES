There was a period of about a week in August 2023 when G had to be restrained to receive NG feeds, with up to four staff being required on some occasions.  I have been shown a chronology of &#8220;unplanned clinical holds&#8221; which have been necessary in G&#8217;s treatment and in order to prevent her from harming herself.

In August 2023, Dr H assessed G as not being &#8220;Gillick competent&#8221; in respect of NG feeding, and the restraint necessary on some occasions to ensure NG feeding. The treatment and restraint was consented to by G&#8217; mother and father, and they also agreed to the administration of medication and to G engaging with therapeutic support. Tragically, G has on occasions expressed that she does not want to live and it is thought that the resistance to the NG tube is a means of communicating this.</span></p>

This is because she is not detained under section 2 or section 3 of the Mental Health Act 1983. I take the view that, although this technical issue is correctly raised, it would be incorrect to regard this case as being subject to different principles simply because it technically falls outside of the Code.  In my judgement, the Trust is correct in contending that it is, in effect, bound by the Code, even though strictly speaking G is not detained pursuant to the Mental Health Act 1983. In my judgement, the Code is properly to be seen as guidance for registered medical practitioners and members of other professions in relation to the medical treatment of patients suffering from mental disorder. </span></p>

G did not respond to this but the Guardian considered it notable that G did not seek to reject or convey resistance to this. The Guardian reports that, unfortunately, there has been limited progress since G&#8217;s admission to the Unit in terms of her ability to tolerate food or feed intake.  However, G was described by Dr H as presenting as &#8220;less distressed&#8221; when receiving a feed than she was when she first arrived on the ward. The Guardian reports that G continues to present with low mood and there have been attempts at self-harm. Very sadly, G&#8217;s relationship with her family has become strained and her verbal communication with them has been sporadic and, at times, hostile. It is clear that the parents welcomed the prospect of the court make a declaration in respect of G&#8217;s treatment as this would potentially lessen the extent to which G holds her parents responsible.</span></p>

However, practitioners must be satisfied that it is appropriate to rely on parental consent. This is important because court decisions relating to parental consent have emphasised that there are limits to both the types of decisions that can be made by those with parental responsibility on behalf of their child, and the circumstances in which these decisions can be made. For example, when making decisions on behalf of their child, parents must act in their child&#8217;s best interests. The limits to what a parent can consent to on behalf of their child is relevant to whether a deprivation of liberty has arisen (see paragraphs 19.44 &#8211; 19.48). This guidance uses the term &#8216;scope of parental responsibility&#8217; to highlight the need to establish whether the particular decision can be authorised by parental consent or not. Those cases in which parental consent is sufficient are described as falling within the scope of parental responsibility.</span></p>

The naso-gastric tube may need to be in place for several weeks in order to restore the child to a safe BMI (body mass index). The care team conclude that as this is a particularly invasive form of treatment and the girl is likely to resist the insertion of the tube, it would not be appropriate to rely on parental consent to authorise this intervention. Accordingly, even though a person with parental responsibility consents, the child is not admitted and treated informally under section 131(1) of the Act. If the child meets the relevant criteria, she could be admitted to hospital for assessment (section 2) or for treatment (section 3) under the Act.

The Code came into force in 2015. Ms Holland submits to the court that practitioners must be guided by the developing case law in this area. I agree; it is, it seems to me, clear that the Code must follow case law. Case law will be developed with the basis of legal analysis following expert evidence.  Parliament produces statutes.  Judges interpret statutes where that is necessary.  The Common Law is derived from judicial precedents, to which the long established and understood doctrine of precedent applies.  These are basic truisms. It is a fundamental principle of our doctrine of precedent that the Common Law in England and Wales is developed by Judgments of the High Court and above.  Of course when delivering a Judgment, judges will always take into account the expert evidence that is placed before them. I am not in any doubt that it is judges, and not those writing the Code, that state the law.  Indeed, I cannot see how any student of jurisprudence could suggest that a Code of Practice could be superior to judicial precedent.  From time to time the Code will be developed and updated, based upon judicial precedent. I agree with the submission that there should be no tension between the Code and the common law authorities. However, if there is, the matter must be referred to the court for the judge to decide.</span></p>

In fact, the only case where the Court has found a legal requirement to come to Court in respect of treatment of a child, where both parents consent, is Heilbron J in Re D, the case of a "non-therapeutic" sterilisation of an 11 year old.  In all other contexts, including where the parental decision will lead to the child's life ending, the Court has imposed no such requirement. There are a range of cases where there does have to be Court approval, but this is where there is a clinical disagreement; possible alternative treatment of the medical condition in issue; or the decision is, in the opinion of clinicians, finely balanced. These are fact specific instances rather than examples of any special category of treatment where the Court's role is required simply because of the nature of the treatment&#8221;.</span></p>

This enables clinicians lawfully to carry out the treatment plan. In those circumstances, no court authorisation is required. NG Tube feeding, even if contrary to the non-Gillick competent child&#8217;s wishes, does not fall within a special category that requires court authorisation. The primary purpose of the tube feeding is to preserve life. Rather than being a case where it will have long-term physiological consequences, I agree with the submission made on behalf of the Trust that the opposite is in fact true, to the extent that without tube feeding the child might (probably would) die.  I agree with the submission made by the Trust that the guidance in the Code that there are limits on the decisions which can be taken by parents in relation to treatment of their children under the age of 16 is erroneous. Where there is consensus of the clinical team and parents, the parents are able to provide their consent.</span></p>

It is possible to analyse the case as finding that the mother was able to "authorise" the State, through the hospital, to deprive the child of his liberty. However, in my view, that introduces an extra and unnecessary level of complication into the analysis. It is simpler, and more in keeping with the domestic caselaw, to see </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Nielsen</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'"> as being about the child's deprivation of liberty falling within the scope of parental responsibility.</span><marker name="tab"/><br/><br/><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">49.</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'"> The power of parents to exercise custody over their children, or in modern parlance, to deprive children of their liberty, has long been accepted by the common law, see Hewer v Bryant. That power in respect of under 16 year olds has not been removed by statute. There can be no doubt that in respect of very young children, as Lord Kerr phrased it, they can be restrained to a point where Storck (a) is met, whether in the family setting or in school or any other setting.</span><marker name="tab"/><br/><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">50.</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'"> The contrast with the statutory position of children aged 16 and over is set out by Lady Hale in Re D at [26].

However, the position is different for a child under 16 years old, both in common law and under the ECHR. It follows that the very nature of "family life" and therefore the protections under Article 8 for the parents' rights, will be different for a younger child. It is however critical to have in mind that the exercise of any parental rights in respect of a child must be for the benefit of the child. If the parent was exercising parental rights, including consenting to the deprivation of liberty, in a way which was said to be contrary to the child's best interests then such a decision would no longer fall within the zone of parental responsibility.</span><marker name="tab"/><br/><br/><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">58. </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8220;if a child under 16, such as K, plainly does not have Gillick competence to make the decision</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">as to his liberty, and his parents (or in this case his testamentary guardians) decide to deprive him of his liberty, and no third party (such as the local authority or an NHS body) consider such deprivation to be contrary to his best interest, then the parents can lawfully deprive him of his liberty&#8221;.</span></p>

It is the duty of the State to intervene where a decision is contrary to the best interests of the child, and might cause the child to suffer significant harm.  However, where, as in the instant case, the treating medical team and the parents agree, the state&#8217;s intervention is unnecessary; indeed, in my judgement, it would be inappropriate unless, for example (in what I believe would be a very rare case) a local authority or the Children&#8217;s Guardian took the view that both the hospital and the parents had &#8220;got it seriously wrong&#8221;.
