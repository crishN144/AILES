Common sense, not law, requires that in deciding this question, regard should be had, to whatever extent appropriate, to inherent probabilities. If a child alleges sexual abuse by a parent, it is common sense to start with the assumption that most parents do not abuse their children. But this assumption may be swiftly dispelled by other compelling evidence of the relationship between parent and child or parent and other children. It would be absurd to suggest that the tribunal must in all cases assume that serious conduct is unlikely to have occurred. In many cases, the other evidence will show that it was all too likely.&#8221;</p>

The court&#8217;s task is to determine whether the local authority has proved its case on the balance of probability. Where, as here, there is a degree of medical uncertainty and credible evidence of a possible alternative explanation to that contended for by the local authority, the question for the court is not &#8216;has that possible alternative explanation been proved&#8217; but rather it should ask itself, &#8216;in the light of that possible alternative explanation can the court be satisfied that the local authority has proved its case on the simple balance of probability&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

Family judges deal with increasingly difficult child cases and are much assisted in their decision-making process by professionals from other disciplines: medical, wider mental health and social work among others. The courts pay particular attention to the valuable contribution from paediatricians and child psychiatrists as well as others, but it is important to remember that the decision is that of the judge and not of the professional expert. Judges are well accustomed to assessing the conflicting evidence of experts. As Ward LJ said, judges are not expected to suspend judicial belief simply because the evidence is given by an expert. An expert is not in any special position and there is no presumption or belief in a doctor however distinguished he or she may be. It is, however, necessary for a judge to give reasons for disagreeing with experts' conclusions or recommendations. That, this judge did. A judge cannot substitute his views for the views of the experts without some evidence to support what it is he concludes.</span></p>

A clear distinction is to be drawn between the relevance and admissibility of evidence which describes the harmful circumstances in which a child is being cared for and the same evidence when it is used to suggest that a person has a propensity to commit a particular act. In other words, the evidence will be very relevant to harm or its likelihood in s 31(2) and the court&#8217;s assessment of risk in s 1(3)(e) of the 1989 Act but not necessarily to perpetration. It may be forensically unwise for the court to attach much, if any, weight to this evidence if it is directed only to the question of propensity&#8230;</p>

The ordinary process of reasoning will draw the judge to consider a number of other matters, such as the consistency of the account with known facts, with previous accounts given by the witness, with other evidence, and with the overall probabilities.  However, in a case where the facts are not likely to be primarily found in contemporaneous documents the assessment of credibility can quite properly include the impression made upon the court by the witness, with due allowance being made for the pressures that may arise from the process of giving evidence.  Indeed in family cases, where the question is not only &#8216;what happened in the past?&#8217; but also &#8216;what may happen in the future?&#8217;, a witness&#8217;s demeanour may offer important information to the court about what sort of a person the witness truly is, and consequently whether an account of past events or future intentions is likely to be reliable. </p>

	      <p class="Indented" style="margin-left:0.39in">Uncertain perpetrator cases&#8212;If the judge cannot identify a perpetrator or perpetrators, it is still important to identify the possible perpetrators by asking whether the evidence establishes that there is a &#8216;likelihood or real possibility&#8217; that a given person perpetrated the injuries in question (<span style="font-style:italic">Re S-B (Children)</span> [2010] 1 FLR 1161, SC; <span style="font-style:italic">North Yorkshire CC v SA</span> [2003] 2 FLR 849, CA).

However, it is not helpful for the judge to give an indication of percentages as to the likelihood that one or other of the possible perpetrators was responsible and judges should be cautious about amplifying in this way a judgment in which they have been unable to identify a speci&#64257;c perpetrator (<span style="font-style:italic">Re S-B (Children)</span> [2010] 1 FLR 1161, SC).</p>

In this context, the Court of Appeal stated that judges should no longer direct themselves not to &#8216;strain&#8217; to identify the perpetrator as the unvarnished test is clear: following a consideration of all the available evidence and applying the simple balance of probabilities, a judge either can, or cannot, identify a perpetrator.

At this stage, the correct legal approach is to survey the evidence as a whole as it relates to each individual in order to arrive at a conclusion about whether the allegation has been made out in relation to one or other on a balance of probability. Evidentially, this will involve considering the individuals separately and together and comparing the probabilities in respect of each of them. Within this context, the right question is not &#8216;who is the more likely?&#8217; but rather &#8216;does the evidence establish that this individual probably caused this injury?&#8217; In a case where there are more than two possible perpetrators, the Court of Appeal highlighted a clear danger in identifying an individual simply because they are the likeliest candidate, as this can lead to an identi&#64257;cation on evidence that falls short of a probability;</p>

Where the court is satis&#64257;ed that the child has suffered signi&#64257;cant harm, the threshold conditions under ChA 1989, s 31(2)(b)(i) will be met in relation to that child even though the court is unable to identify who within the pool of possible perpetrators in&#64258;icted the harm: <span style="font-style:italic">Lancashire County Council v B</span> [2000] 1 FLR 583, HL, in which helpful guidance is given as to how evidence needs to be tested to establish the threshold criteria for the purposes of s 31 where the perpetrator is uncertain. In determining whether a person is properly included in the pool of potential perpetrators, it is essential that the court weighs any lies told by that person against any evidence that points away from them having been responsible for the injuries (<span style="font-style:italic">H v City and Council of Swansea and Others</span> [2011] EWCA Civ 195). In these &#8216;uncertain perpetrator&#8217; cases, the correct approach is for the case to proceed at the welfare stage on the basis that each of the possible perpetrators is treated as such (<span style="font-style:italic">Re O and N: Re B</span> [2003] 1 FLR 1169, HL). The House of Lords held in that case that it would be grotesque if, because neither parent had been proved to be the perpetrator, the court had to proceed at the welfare stage as though the child were not at risk from either parent, even though one or other of them was the perpetrator of signi&#64257;cant harm. The judge conducting the welfare hearing should have regard to the facts found at the preliminary hearing when they leave open the possibility that a parent or carer was a perpetrator of proved harm and that conclusion should not be excluded from consideration.</p>

I bear in mind in assessing her credibility that giving evidence is stressful and the circumstances of doing so could not be much more serious than about an injury to her child which she is alleged to have potentially caused. That said, she in fact settled into giving evidence, she made concessions where it seemed appropriate and stuck to her guns on other occasions. Generally, I formed a positive impression that she was doing her best to recall what happened.</p>

In his first he said that when he &#8220;checked&#8221; C1 when he visited his parents after a call from Paternal Grandfather to return to their home &#8220;she did not seem to be in any discomfort and I felt she was moving both her arms normally&#8221; [C43/33]. By contrast, in his third statement he said &#8220;My description of C1&#8217;s presentation from 24-27 December was not accurate. She was not fine. She was clearly favouring her left arm&#8230;&#8221; [C251/5]. His reply to a question in cross-examination on this change suggested a reluctance to be forthright. He said &#8220;I think at the time of producing that [first] statement I&#8230;didn&#8217;t understand the signs of how she was&#8230;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; When pressed there was the following exchange in which I intervened as there was some inconsistency in answers (underlined):</p>

The following day, a continuation of the Father&#8217;s oral evidence, he appeared to initially row back from this saying this was not an example of him &#8220;saying untrue things to mislead the court&#8221; and he &#8220;wasn&#8217;t telling an untruth to mislead the court&#8221;. When he was cross-examined by counsel for the Guardian however he once more conceded he was &#8220;trying to manipulate the court into thinking [he] hadn&#8217;t been medically negligent and minimising the presentation of C1&#8217;s symptoms&#8221;.</p>

There is accordingly a window in which the Father could have caused injury. There was an exploration with the Mother about the Father&#8217;s behaviour in leaving the house with the Children. She said it was not uncommon on a non-working day for him to &#8220;leave the house quietly so I could catch up on sleep&#8221;; I do not consider that his actions are therefore suggestive of trying to hide an injury from the Mother.</p>

When the Mother gave evidence she said that she had initially told the police &#8220;pram suit&#8221; not pram. That would be consistent with saying it was &#8220;quite thick&#8221;, it would be an unusual turn of phrase to say a pram was &#8220;quite thick&#8221;. I find on balance the police record is wrong in this respect. In coming to this conclusion I bear in mind I have heard no direct evidence from the police about how the note was taken, including whether it was contemporaneous.</p>

I found her explanation credible: she said prior to the interview she had been in a police cell for 5 hours, the interview was at 02.00 and she &#8220;didn&#8217;t clearly remember the details that was passed along&#8221; to her, she felt it important to know the details so she later confirmed them with the Paternal Grandparents.</p>

She said she got it wrong, she was &#8220;distressed and exhausted and muddled some of the communication on that day&#8221;. What the Mother now says is consistent with the Paternal Grandfather&#8217;s evidence and I note that on the following page of the police interview transcript she said &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if [the Father] necessarily told me there and then&#8221; and when asked &#8220;When did you become aware of it within that day&#8221; she said &#8220;Erm, mid-afternoon, maybe three o&#8217;clock-ish, very roughly, perhaps&#8221;.

When the Father was cross-examined he said he &#8220;didn&#8217;t understand the significance [of this point] and the important part was whether it was lifting out or in to a pram suit&#8221;. That explanation is consistent with a message sent by the Father to his brother on 25 December 2023 in which he said &#8220;I <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">think</span> she [Paternal Grandmother] was taking her vest off&#8221; [J492]. When cross-examined on behalf of the Paternal Grandmother the Father explained that one reason why he may have misunderstood the mechanism was because the focus on 24 December 2023 was C1&#8217;s health, there was no discussion of the incident with Paternal Grandmother on 24 December 2023 and on 26 December 2023 the focus was again C1&#8217;s health and he agreed he knew Paternal Grandmother was worried about the incident (the inference being he did not want to probe further). When the Paternal Grandmother gave evidence she said the focus on 26 December 2023 was &#8220;how is it getting on&#8230;by then I&#8217;d gone in to shut down and didn&#8217;t want to talk about it as I&#8217;d get upset&#8221;.

He was asked about the failure to show this photo or the video that the Paternal Grandmother had sent him on 24 December 2023 showing C1 moving her right arm without apparent discomfort (see below and [C238]). There was a suggestion that the video has been deliberately concealed by the Father. First, there was no evidence of it being found on his phone and second he told the police he may have deleted it (police interview [J38ab]). In relation to the first point counsel for the Father makes the fair point that there is no report on how the messages that have made their way into the bundle from police disclosure came to be downloaded by the police and there is at least one error apparent on the face of the that disclosure in that in the section that is supposed to be messages between the Father and the Paternal Grandfather there is in fact a message that appears to have been sent to the Paternal Grandmother&#8217;s email account via iMessage (at [J620]).</p>

She agreed. I find this a very important piece of evidence. Her recollection of feeling the bone is the sort of memory that does not require a reconstruction of what force or movement was undertaken, it appears to be a clear, distinct recollection and it does demonstrate significant force being applied. However, when cross-examined on behalf of the Guardian she denied she was gripping the arm, she was &#8220;applying pressure with finger tips&#8221; and whilst she accepted using more force than she normally would she was not agitated or in a hurry and her demonstration of the movement in court again seemed quite benign.</p>

It was suggested the calls must have included a discussion about the police possibly becoming involved because a subsequent text message from the Father said &#8220;Let me know if the police do come and speak&#8221; [J624]. When questioned on behalf of the Father he was asked, effectively, if the calls might have been primarily about C1&#8217;s injury and the discovery of what then were thought to be healing fractures to C2 and their possible cause and he tended to agree.

She elaborated on that in the course of cross-examination describing the Father coming in at some point after the last feed and before 01.08 on 25 December 2023 offering to help. She said she told him she did not need help and to go away &#8220;you&#8217;ve had too much to drink&#8221;. She thought he was drunk because he was swaying and did not go away. She was lying on the bed and &#8220;reached down to pick up a muslin I&#8217;d dropped&#8221; when the &#8220;Father grabbed me by the right arm and held it up by the side of my head&#8221; whilst she was cradling C1 in her left arm.</p>

That is consistent with the paediatric evidence, there is no evidence of a particularly difficult night on 23-24 December 2023, the Paternal Grandparents did not identify any abnormality prior to the incident with Paternal Grandmother and unless the Paternal Grandmother was colluding with one or both parents it would be a remarkable co-incidence for the Paternal Grandmother to think she had injured the right upper arm which had in fact already been fractured by one of the parents. I do bear in mind the possibility that the reason for C1&#8217;s reported distress as the Paternal Grandmother was inserting her right arm into the pram suit was because it was exacerbating an earlier injury, this would mitigate the co-incidence but that would also be inconsistent with the reported and immediately prior presentation at the Paternal Grandparents. Further, it is unlikely the Father would have taken the Children to the Paternal Grandparents if one of the parents had known C1 had suffered a serious injury at their hands; it would open up the possibility of discovery. On balance this scenario is implausible.</p>

The first is the force that would have been required by the Paternal Grandmother&#8217;s action because whilst the mechanism is plausible the demonstrated force as seen by the experts was not. Her evidence as to force was quite muddled. She told the police of a &#8220;little push&#8221; [J35e], in her statement she said it was a pull and used more force than a &#8220;little push&#8221; and that she could feel the arm as a tiny stick [C223], she told me of feeling a &#8220;stick bone&#8221; notwithstanding that the padding on the suit was thick but then told counsel for the Guardian the movement did not involve gripping and the demonstrated movement showed modest force. The second is what might be abnormal response to injury (a lack of crying and apparently normal movement). I will consider this in more detail below.</p>

	    <p class="Number" style="text-indent:0.5in">The difficulty with scenario (c) is that it relies on the site where the Paternal Grandmother thought she had injured C1 matching the actual site of injury later perpetrated by the Father. I note there is no greater likelihood of a parent fracturing a limb by pulling it if they lost control as compared to slapping, throwing, dropping or shaking which might cause a non-limb fracture, bruising or a head injury. I also note, but discount as being barely credible, the possibility of the Father deliberately choosing to inflict injury to the same place he perceived an earlier soft tissue injury had been suffered as a way of avoiding later detection: it would have required a degree of pre-meditation (as opposed to loss of control) and whilst there are messages suggestive of some malice towards the Children (&#8220;A banshee&#8221;, &#8220;you hate it / them&#8221;, &#8220;I hate them&#8221;) there is no prior evidence of that manifesting as a physical act against a child such as an unexplained bruise or witnessed act and the context of the messages is of a parent struggling to come to terms with sleep loss. I caution myself against attaching too much weight to short messages written in haste and saying such things is quite different from acting upon them.</p>

However, her reference to feeling the &#8220;stick bone&#8221; through the padded suit points the other way and I bear in mind the report of an unusual cry immediately afterwards. I also bear in mind neither expert is able to evidence the force necessary empirically (it would be unethical to test). Dr Oates said a &#8220;highly aggressive act with overwhelming force&#8221; [E44] is not required although &#8220;significant and inappropriate force&#8221; is [E77]. Of note Dr Robinson&#8217;s evidence was that on balance Paternal Grandmother&#8217;s actions caused &#8220;a painful but minor soft tissue injury&#8221; [E103]. I am reassured of the difficulty of interpreting demonstrations by the fact that I would struggle to see how the force the Paternal Grandmother demonstrated in court could even have caused a soft-tissue injury and of course she would at least sub-consciously not be wanting to injure her solicitor when she did demonstrate it. As Dr Oates said in his oral evidence in answer to a question from the Guardian&#8217;s counsel &#8220;it is really difficult to communicate levels of force&#8221; and he added &#8220;to interpret that&#8221;. I accept that.</p>

I remind myself of the distress evidenced in the aftermath; she gave that evidence and she said that by 26 December 2023 she had &#8220;shut down&#8221;, Paternal Grandfather gave evidence of her distress [C214/11] as did CB [C193/4] and the Father. All that points to a genuinely shocking incident for the Paternal Grandmother on 24 December 2023 not an innocuous incident subsequently elevated in importance. That does not rule out the possibility of a nasty soft tissue injury caused by her but her having elevated that still further to &#8220;backfill&#8221; what must have happened. Counsel for the Guardian also pointed to the creep of evidence she gave about the force she used (from little push to pull to having used greater force). That would be consistent with Dr Robinson&#8217;s evidence:</p>

This might be mitigated by the evidence of minimal handling of C1 by CB and the family generally prior to admission on 27 December 2023. More importantly, in relation to the video taken on the afternoon of 24 December 2023 I note Dr Robinson does not rule out fracture and an unusual response which might be consistent with the findings of Farrell which might also be consistent with the ward round note from the Trauma and Orthopaedic team on 29 December 2023 where C1 was reported to be &#8220;not distressed&#8221; [I497] yet the arm was not splinted in any way until later that day [I441]. However, Dr Robinson was clear that an intermittent expected response was not within his clinical or forensic experience (i.e. immediate cry and reduced movement then abnormal response then response on examination on 27 December 2023).</p>

The only evidence of an incident that could have caused a fracture is in relation to scenario (b). The evidence that tends to undermine that first, inadequate force, is explicable having regard to the limitations of demonstration and second, unusual response, is explicable on the basis of C1 being an outlier or fitting the normal profile but with minimised reporting. Whilst scenario (c) and (e) are possible they present the marked difficulty of the injury site being the same as on 24 December 2023 and I find it implausible the Father would have the presence of mind to inflict injury at the same site knowing he could later try to blame his mother.</p>

I trusted their advice that C1 appeared to be okay and also that the hospitals were really busy so it would be best not to go. I did, however, take on board what they both said about keeping a close eye on C1 and seeking medical attention if needs be.  Paternal Grandfather and I passed that advice on to Father and Mother.</p>

However, stepping back this was a baby who had plainly suffered some injury at the hands of the Paternal Grandmother which caused her such concern as to call a neighbour and symptoms (at the very least floppiness) continued to be present on the most contemporaneous documentary evidence on 25 and 26 December 2023 yet formal medical attention was not sought until 12.49 on 27 December 2023 [I514]. There were perhaps three options open to the parents: attend at hospital, make a GP appointment or call NHS 111. The first and second options may have been difficult, perhaps as regards a GP appointment impossible but the last was always an available option. When assessing the extent of concern I am entitled to take into account the Father&#8217;s admission: he was in fact so concerned that in retrospect he accepts threshold is met by reason of the failure to seek medical attention. That, coupled with what I have said above and Dr Robinson&#8217;s evidence, leads me to conclude the parents unreasonably failed to seek medical attention from 25 to 27 December 2023; having been re-assured on 24 December 2023 they could not reasonably continue to rely on that when there was no apparent improvement.</p>

As noted above I have found the parents behaved unreasonably in failing to seek advice from 25 to 27 December 2023. I have to ask if that failure caused or was likely to have caused C1 to suffer significant harm. The harm that might arise is pain. The likelihood of that is high: even at its lowest on the police interview evidence there was ongoing floppiness, an indication of a reluctance to use the arm likely arising from pain or discomfort. This was an infant demonstrating reduced movement in a fractured arm which evidences significant harm.</p>

In cross-examination the Mother said that she considers she was a victim of domestic abuse from the Father, it was physical and verbal and it escalated after the birth of the Children. She sent a message to him consistent with that evidence (my emphasis):</p>

	    <p class="Number" style="text-indent:0.5in">Taken on its own it is difficult to see the incident on the night of 24-25 December 2023 as justifying immediate action, the Mother gave a warning she would call the police if it was repeated. However, when taken with the build up to this incident it becomes more borderline. I bear in mind it was Christmas, there were additional pressures (seeing family, the Father being around more because he was not working) and I also take into account the enormous pressure both the Mother and Father were under in dealing with two very young children. It might have been that the Mother would have followed through on the warning had there been a repeat of the Father&#8217;s actions after Christmas but these proceedings intervened. I find that the Father has minimised his behaviour (on his admission) and it is apparent the Mother has sought to do so too, the full picture only really emerging in the cross-examination of both parents. That will be a matter for a subsequent welfare analysis and reminding myself of <span style="font-style:italic">G-L-T </span>I must be careful not to elevate that to a threshold finding.</p>

There is no evidence at all of harm to the Children from domestic abuse. There were three incidents of physical violence spaced apart (one at which C1 was present), I do not downplay their significance, but I cannot be satisfied that together with the Father&#8217;s drunkenness this was sufficient to alert the Mother to a risk of significant harm to the Children such that she should have acted differently and, perhaps, separated from the Father or reported his behaviour to the police.</p>

I am satisfied this meets the threshold test. Threshold must be met as at the date of protective measures, which in this case was 29 December 2023 when the parents signed an agreement for the Children to be accommodated pursuant to section 20 Children Act 1989, but evidence after the event is relevant to its assessment at that time. The Father has demonstrated a willingness not to tell the truth about a serious matter (C1&#8217;s symptoms) in order to protect himself. That is likely to impact the care given to the Children not being that which it would be reasonable to expect giving rise to a risk of significant harm because the Children&#8217;s welfare cannot be properly or fully assessed by professionals.</p>
