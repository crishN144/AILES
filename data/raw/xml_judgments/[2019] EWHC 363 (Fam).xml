	      </authorialNote> Mr Justice Holman described this as a &#8220;tragic case&#8221;. More than five years later it remains tragic, but ever more so. When Mr Justice Holman gave his judgment, the mother had not seen her daughter for two years. Now, another five years have passed with mother and daughter being apart. Although the father allowed a few occasions of Skype contact, these came to an end in December 2015. The cruelty that is being inflicted on this woman and on this child is formidable. It is hard to imagine the daily agony that this mother must endure.  </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in">In December 2011 the mother and the father and Elsa all travelled together to Egypt. As I understand it, it was in fact the mother who paid the air fares. The purpose was to have a short holiday together in Egypt over Christmas 2011 and of course to enable Elsa to see members of her paternal family there. It is a fact that Elsa has never returned to England since that supposed short holiday period. It is the mother's case that whilst they were there and staying in an hotel, the father brought it about that Elsa was detached from her and moved to live, apparently, with the father's own mother. The mother of Elsa returned to England shortly thereafter, and a few days later so did the father. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.12in">Legal proceedings between them rapidly ensued. Elsa was made a ward of this court. Since then, there has been a series of orders made by a number of different judges requiring, in summary and in essence, that the father reveals the actual whereabouts of Elsa and also procures the return of Elsa from Egypt to England. I mention that, so far as I am aware, no order has required the return of Elsa actually into the care of her mother. </p>

As a result, there has been a series of orders requiring him to do so, and a series of orders committing him to prison for contempt of court for his failure to obey those orders. It is the fact that the father has now been detained continuously in prison since 5 January 2012. Since today is 19 December 2013, and his current release date is 24 December 2013, he has now been in prison continuously for almost two years. That is of course the equivalent of a custodial sentence of almost four years' imprisonment, after allowance for release after serving half any such sentence. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.12in">At the hearing on 27 September 2013, for the reasons which I fully explained in my publicly-available judgment of that date, I did two things. First, I sentenced the father to a further term of six months' imprisonment for his contempt of court by failing to obey the earlier orders made by Roderic Wood J on 2 July 2013. Second, I repeated, in substantially the same terms as previously, a range of orders, the essence of which was, and is, that the father must disclose the whereabouts of Elsa in Egypt and cause her return to England and Wales. The mother has sworn a recent affidavit on 9 December 2013, in which she deposes, first, that the father was properly served with that order, and second, that he has not complied with it at all. The father has himself made a statement, dated 4 December 2013, which I have read. In that statement he says in effect that he is unable to comply with the terms of my order of 27 September 2013 and indeed the earlier orders to the same effect. He does not suggest that he has in any way actually complied.&#8221;  </p>

The mother sought the imposition of a further period of imprisonment. Mr Justice Holman pointed out that the father had now served the equivalent of a sentence of four years&#8217; imprisonment, in circumstances where the maximum sentence for an individual contempt of court was two years imprisonment. At para 24 he stated: </p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>

		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in">&#8220;The reality of this case is that this man has taken a stance, at any rate for so long as he remains in prison. He asserts that he cannot comply with these orders. Judges, including myself, have been sure that he can comply and is, rather, choosing not to comply. But that is the stance which he has taken. Although successive orders are legally permissible, the reality in this case is that from day one this father has manifested an absolute determination not, under pressure of court orders, to reveal the whereabouts of his child and not to cause her return to England. That is a very grave contempt of court in the circumstances of this case, but it was no less grave at the outset than it is now. The reality is that he made very plain indeed at a very early stage that he would not comply with these orders. For that flagrant contempt he could of course have been sentenced to the maximum term. The maximum term was two years' imprisonment. It seems to me that the court has to be very cautious indeed not to subvert altogether the will and intention of Parliament, when enacting <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49/section/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 14</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49" uk:canonical="1981 c. 49" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Contempt of Court Act 1981</ref>, by now contemplating sentencing for aggregate periods that are more than double that term. It seems to me that this case has moved beyond the scope of what was described by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re W</span>, and that the man cannot be further punished.&#8221;  </p>

I do, however, very clearly remember the previous hearing and the evidence which the father gave face-to-face in the witness box on that occasion, and the impression which I formed on that occasion. I described this in particular in paragraphs 13 to 17 of my judgment of 27 September 2013. On that occasion I was satisfied so that I was sure that the father could have complied substantially with the earlier orders of Roderic Wood J made on 2 July 2013. Frankly, nothing has changed between 27 September 2013 and today, and so for the purposes of this judgment, but only for the purposes of this judgment, I will proceed on a working assumption (without making an express judicial finding) that the father could indeed, between then and now, have complied with the orders that I made on 27 </p>

On 23 August 2012 the North Cairo Court for Family Affairs awarded her custody in what has been described as the &#8220;short custody order&#8221;. That was replaced by what has been described as the &#8220;long custody order&#8221; in November 2015. These orders required Elsa to be delivered up to the mother. They reflected the principle of Egyptian law which gives the priority of custody to the mother until the child reaches 15 years of age. The Egyptian authorities in fact prosecuted the father for breach of the order for return and he was sentenced to 12 months&#8217; imprisonment in his absence. He appealed that sentence </p>

The court might find it helpful to read the statement I prepared for her ladyship which was requested for 11th April 2016 and was read by the court at the hearing on 15th April 2016. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in">Elsa is a happy, healthy and well-behaved child whose welfare is looked after by her parental Grandmother. Elsa and my mother live at their own place of residence, which is secured and paid for by my family members. I was not told any further information regarding the location of their residence or any other details that might identify that place. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in">Elsa&#8217;s education is going well. More can be achieved if the anxiety and fear imposed by Ms Button&#8217;s potential unpredictable actions and her unstable drugged mindset are alleviated. </p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in">Elsa is fluent in her mother tongue (Arabic) and no longer communicates in English, given that she lives in an Arabic speaking country where English is not used in the day to day life. She studies the English language curriculum provided at school and she attains good grades. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in">Furthermore, ever since Ms Button told Elsa in one of their skype contact about her new husband and her new child, Elsa felt like she does not have a place in her mother&#8217;s life and that her mother has people in her life of higher importance. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in">Elsa does not wish to leave her Grandmother or to be with anyone else. Given the strong bond Elsa and her grandmother formed over the years, this wish of Elsa does not come as a surprise. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in">Elsa also was very disturbed and upset when Ms Button invited to one of their skype calls individuals from Julie&#8217;s house where Elsa experienced sexual molestation and abuse. This was what pushed the child over the tipping point and made her unwilling to attend any further skype calls with Ms Button as she found those contacts to be a source of distress and emotional pain. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in">This position they took was and still is a result of their concerns for the safety of Elsa and due to their concerns of any criminal action Ms Button and her aids might attempt to kidnap Elsa out of Egypt and subject the child to an abhorrent damaging experience. </p>

I would not even find them on the phone log as my phone is very old (since 2010) and for the past two years I had to format it frequently as I cannot afford buying a replacement. </p>

The Grandmother had warned me frequently that if I keep distressing Elsa with that requests, she will not call me again.&#8221;  </p>

The conversation took place nearly two years ago on 23 February 2017. The father says that he was given the telephone number by his brother and that he then gave it to Mr Skinner.

The problem is in your hands, not in ours. The girl lives a normal life here in Egypt, she does not need anything from anyone. Your court has allowed the media to write wrong things about us. That is why I am not happy dealing with you again. You have to know that the girl will be staying permanently in Egypt and she will not be leaving Egypt. If the mother wants to see her daughter, which is her right, the court must cancel all the wrong stuff which was ordered. The mother has issued court cases against [the father] and he is now detained in your country and all the allegations are wrong and the girl will not leave Egypt. </p>
