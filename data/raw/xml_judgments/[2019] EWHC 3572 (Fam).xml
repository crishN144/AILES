The husband issued his proceedings first in time, but for reasons which I will set out later in this judgment I have treated the wife as the applicant.

They did not marry until 2005 but had remained in the interim fully engaged together in their lives and business activities.  They separated in 2016 in highly acrimonious circumstances.  I therefore treat the relationship as one of 21 years with the quality of the relationship pre-marriage being indistinguishable from that post-marriage.   </p>

I shall call their business &#8220;AM&#8221;. It has associated companies which are of no significance to this judgment. The business provided the parties with a very good but not opulent standard of living. </p>

W accepts that the division between the parties of their assets will be governed by the provisions of the Matrimonial Causes Act.  H has sought to argue that a significant part of the assets is owned by his mother (whom I shall call by her first name, &#8220;Wanda&#8221;).  A claim to ownership made by Wanda, supported by H, has been decisively rejected by Mostyn J.  H remains aggrieved by that decision but neither he nor Wanda appealed the decision and I am bound by it.   </p>

When in London he lives with her at 45AG which is her home, albeit now held jointly in her and W&#8217;s names.  There is no doubt that in the early years both H and W received significant assistance including financial assistance from Wanda.  He attributes all the success that the parties have had to the help from his mother and his own efforts.   The relationship between Wanda and W is now poor and Wanda is totally allied with H. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In or around 2014 the marriage became unhappy.  In the summer of 2016 the parties agreed to move to Miami full-time, where they were the owners of a luxury penthouse which I shall call the &#8220;Miami property&#8221; and run their business from there.  At about the same time W entered into a relationship with another man.  W moved with the children in October 2016 and H was due to follow soon afterwards. Shortly before the move H became aware of W&#8217;s infidelity.  He caused W to be removed, with the children, from the Miami property on the basis that he was the legal owner of the property.  He alleged that she had abducted the children to America.  He issued divorce proceedings the following day on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2016 and at the same time, issued but did not serve his Form A.  He also commenced proceedings in respect of the children.   </p>

She also filed a statement in the financial remedy proceedings asking that they be stayed until the conclusion of the Chancery proceedings.  Soon afterwards H sought likewise that the proceedings that he himself had issued for financial remedy orders should be adjourned until the conclusion of the Chancery proceedings.

The litigation has been on a massive scale and the allegations of H&#8217;s behaviour amounting to conduct which it is said by W that the court should have regard to are very extensive.  It should have been apparent to the parties that the time estimate provided for this hearing was inadequate. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In November 2017 contested Hague Convention/wardship proceedings came before me.  The background was that in August 2017 H had taken advantage of the fact that W had informed him that she would unavoidably be some hours late in collecting the children from H following an agreed period of summer holiday contact to H in America to remove them from Miami back to England.  In my judgment I described his behaviour as &#8220;deplorable&#8221; and that, contrary to his assertion, it was plain that the relocation of the children to Miami was consensual and that they were habitually resident in Florida.   </p>

Instead he embarked on a course of conduct seeking to achieve the removal of the children from the mother and the removal of the mother and children back to England by the making of multiple complaints about her immigration status and treatment of the children to various US authorities.  Suffice it to say that his accusations have achieved nothing other than to cause enormous upset to W and the children.   </p>

The order recited that the Chancery proceedings were stayed and Wanda was joined as second respondent to the financial remedy proceedings.  Directions were given for the hearing of an application by H for maintenance pending suit and LSPO, it being H&#8217;s case that he was being deprived of funds from the business. </p>

I struggle to see how W could have thought that the business could meet this level of outgoing but whilst W has found it possible to make the first four categories of payments (parking the dispute as whether or not in the circumstances she was liable for payment of the expenses of the Miami property), she has for a prolonged period of time not made the payments to H.  She says that the funds were not available, which H challenges.   </p>

The difference between the parties&#8217; respective valuation of the three London flats in their Forms E was minimal and expert evidence would not have assisted me.  So far as the Miami property is concerned, there was a substantial difference between the parties&#8217; guestimates of value, with H advocating for $2.25m and W for $3m.  I read the various appraisals put before me and heard argument.

It shows that in 2013 and 2014 the turnover was broadly consistent with the turnover of 2017, 2018 and 2019.  However, in each of the years 2013/2014/2015 there was a significant unadjusted operating profit whereas in 2017 and 2018 there was a loss and only a very small profit in 2019.  All this indicates a business that was in a stronger financial position in the early years than it was in the later years.

As it happens, that strategy was never put into effect and the company as it now is seems to me for all relevant purposes to be broadly the same company as it was in 2014/2015, albeit in a somewhat less healthy financial position. </p>

It was purchased by the parties with money which they had earned through the business and is subject to a substantial mortgage.  The orders of the court make it absolutely clear that W alone was, as a result of various actions by H, to be entitled to rent out the property and use the rent to meet the expenses.  H says that notwithstanding the order only he, as the legal owner, was entitled to sign rental documents.  He does not accept that he was in breach of the order, albeit that it is obvious that he was, but says that in any event W suffered no loss as he let the property for the rent that W was willing to accept when she was seeking to let out the premises.  This is yet another example of H&#8217;s view that it is either &#8220;my way&#8221; or &#8220;no way&#8221;.  He simply was not willing to let W have anything to do with the apartment and even went to the extent of having W ejected from the building.   </p>

Neither H nor W seek to live there but H would like it retained if possible.  He claims that it is worth no more than $2.25m.  He relies on an estate agent&#8217;s advice to that effect.

She is owed by the parties &#163;610,000 for money advanced to H and W by a commercial lender upon the security of the property at 45AG where she has lived for many years.  If H is right about the value of the property the debt of the parties to H&#8217;s mother could be, wholly or largely, extinguished if she was to take over the Miami property with a balancing payment made by her in the event that a valuation was carried out and showed a higher value than H anticipates. </p>

Yet, rather than that being used to pay off the mortgage on her property for which W and H had liability, only &#163;300,000 was to be used for that purpose, and of the balance over &#163;42,000 was to be paid to Wanda  for &#8220;unpaid wages and return of any loans made by Wanda against (Miami property) payments and expenses including interest accrued&#8221; and the balance of &#163;180,000 was to be paid to H alone.  This was the most blatant attempt to prejudice W financially.  True it was that the contract also provided that if a professional independent valuation produced a price of above $2m then Wanda would pay to H the difference with a 6% discount reflecting what would otherwise have been paid to an estate agent.  This was an astonishing transaction for H to seek to enter into in the midst of financial remedy proceedings.  It shows clearly his sense of priorities, with Wanda taking priority to W and the children. </p>

Thus it will be that she is provided with an income which will permit her to run her home, pay the children&#8217;s school fees and maintain an appropriate standard of living for the children.  I very much hope that H&#8217;s relationship with his children might be restored but that will be dependent on the way that he behaves.  He will do himself no favours if he continues to try and cause trouble for W with either the Florida Children&#8217;s Services or with the US Immigration Authority.
