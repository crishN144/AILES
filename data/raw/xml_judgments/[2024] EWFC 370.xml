He had formed a relationship with N, the mother of the subject children, who then already had three very young children, two of whom were twins. AB and N then had C and D so that they had the care of a total of five children aged 4 or under. They lived in the Midlands and cared for the five children with the help of N&#8217;s mother and others, in often crowded conditions, moving from place to place. Children&#8217;s services became involved in or about March 2022 due to homelessness, inconsistent parenting, alcohol abuse and financial difficulties. The children became Children in Need. By September 2022, AB decided to care for his two children alone and moved to the Northeast of England but after two  months in his sole care, the Local Authority became involved.

On 27 December 2023 he was admitted to hospital suffering from severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He tells me that he had stopped drinking two days previously and that he has not touched a drop of alcohol since then. His application to revoke the placement orders is grounded in his abstinence over the past 11 months. In essence, his case is that the care and placement orders were made because he was abusing alcohol and since he is no longer abusing alcohol and has proved his long term abstinence, the orders should be revoked such that the children should be returned to his care.</p>

A colleague, Ms Y, was able to step in. She could meet AB, listen to his evidence and then speak to Ms X&#8217;s report and give any further opinions or recommendations of her own on Day 3 of the hearing. AB, through Counsel, opposed that option for proceeding with the case. He proposed that there should be a wholly fresh analysis by Ms Y or another Guardian. Unfortunately, the Court would not have been able to accommodate another three day hearing until January to February 2025. I ruled, as a case management decision, taking into account the Art 6 rights of AB and the children, and the need to avoid delay for the children whose prospective adopters await the decision of the court on revocation, that the option of Ms Y becoming involved in this hearing should be pursued. I am very grateful to Ms Y for stepping in a short notice.</p>

They have been awaiting the outcome of AB&#8217;s application and are anxious to know the decision of the court. The children have been prepared for an adoption placement and only see AB once a month. Ms Z was firm in her view that the placement order should not be revoked. Firstly, she believed that it was too great a risk for the children&#8217;s safety and wellbeing to be returned to their father&#8217;s care. His abstinence was recent when set alongside his long-standing alcohol abuse. He did not have the support by way of therapy or a network of friends or family. It would be devastating for the children to be returned to his care only for to be removed later should AB not be able to provide their emotional, physical, and psychological needs. It has taken months to identify suitable potential adopters. The adopters are an ideal match and are awaiting the outcome of this hearing.

He frankly accepted that he had not always been fully open about the extent of his drinking. It is not uncommon for someone addicted to alcohol to deny the extent of their use and dependence. However, he has also shown some lack of candour over the past year when he says he has not been drinking. He has, by his own admission, done paid work in Scotland whilst claiming benefits and whilst, as he himself put it, unregistered. He has, I am sure minimised his past drinking when giving accounts to Ms X and to the social worker. Nevertheless, AB struck me as generally frank and sometimes blunt. His is not a world of grey, it is black and white. He told the Court that he has stopped drinking and that he would never touch a drop of alcohol again. He has told people he is an alcoholic. He knows that if he were to have one drink, he would probably have another and then another and would soon be drunk. To that extent he has insight and is open.</p>

He has not re-engaged, as he had done before the placement orders were made, with Humankind, a service that supports addicts. He has not done so despite being advised to do so by an Alcohol Team nurse after his admission on 27 December 2023.

Scalp hair strand testing of a sample taken in September was negative indicating meaning either no, or low alcohol consumption for the three months prior to that date. AB was adamant to his doctors that he has been abstinent and they have accepted that. His level of functioning has improved significantly as recorded by his treating clinicians and this suggests abstinence. Liver Function Tests have returned to normal.</p>

However, his evidence provides troubling information about the damage already caused to AB&#8217;s health. His liver cirrhosis is classified as Child-Pugh stage A. There is an estimated five-year survival rate exceeding 90%. Average life expectancy is typically between 10 and 15 years but some patients may live beyond this period and &#8220;others may experience fatal complications before reaching this point.&#8221; There is also evidence that without gastroscopy, as recommended, it cannot be known if AB has varices. There is a 10-15% chance that he does have varices and if he does then he is at risk of a major bleed which is fatal on first bleed in 10-20% of cases. Varices may well not cause any symptoms before a bleed. Thus AB is at a small risk of suffering a fatal bleed at any time. Treatment can be given but, first, a gastroscopy is required to detect any varices. AB declined Dr H&#8217;s advice in March 2024 to undergo gastroscopy within six weeks. He still has not had one since then. He tells the Court that he will undergo one.</p>

AB has not identified the core triggers for his alcohol abuse and the stress of having to care for his two children might well cause him to return to drinking and then rapidly to alcohol abuse. He would have an incentive to hide any drinking from social workers because he would know that he would be liable to lose his children again if it were known he was drinking.

At paragraph 22 he concluded that they plainly have a bearing on applications to revoke a placement order.  I agree, and would only add one very minor comment.  Paragraph 23 contains a summary of the principles derived from the judgment then under appeal.  We heard some submissions about minor aspects of that summary. In particular, subparagraph (g) suggests that a placement order might be revoked where parental/family are is merely &#8216;realistic&#8217;, when the correct test, stated above, is that revocation must be in the child&#8217;s interests.

That is as it should be, since it is the applicant who seeks to change a plan for adoption that has been approved after serious deliberation.  However, the outcome of the application will not in reality turn on the burden of proof, as the court will not be able to find that a placement order remains in the child&#8217;s interests if it no longer meets the stringent conditions that justify such a fundamental order.  As the trial judge put it in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C</span> (see paragraph 26), the question is not &#8216;why shouldn&#8217;t the placement orders remain?&#8217; but &#8216;what does the welfare of these children now require?&#8217;.  Further, once permission to apply has been granted, the principles governing that preliminary stage are no longer relevant and the court&#8217;s task is to carry out an impartial review of whether a placement order continues to be in the interests of the child.&#8221;     </p>

Her evidence was given authoritatively and persuasively but I cannot give it the weight it would have merited had she herself had more time with the family and had prepared a report.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.55in">AB&#8217;s position is that, upon revocation, the Local Authority&#8217;s care plan should be amended to one of transition to AB&#8217;s care over a period of a few weeks. This would allow a build-up of family time and a change from supervised to unsupervised time and from the community to his home, preferably at a new home in the area to where AB has indicated he wishes to move. A Family Support Worker could provide advice and guidance. The children should be assisted for a period of time by someone who speaks AB&#8217;s language and English. There is a person at the Local Authority who could do that. Relapse Prevention work could begin with the help of an interpreter. AB could make a start on learning English.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.55in">I am persuaded that on the balance of probabilities AB has abstained from alcohol since about 25 December 2023. It is a remarkable achievement. I have no doubt that part of his motivation was to give him a chance to secure the return of his children to his care. The hair strand testing, blood results, and evidence from AB&#8217;s clinicians, all support his own assertion of his abstinence.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.55in">It is fair to note that when HHJ Murray made the care and placement orders, the main concern was AB&#8217;s alcohol abuse and the neglect that had flowed from that abuse, but it does not follow from AB&#8217;s subsequent abstinence, however sustained it has been, that his history of alcohol abuse is no longer something to be taken into account. Nor is it the case that the Court can have confidence that AB will remain abstinent just because he has achieved abstinence for eleven months. The risk of relapse, and the consequences if relapse occurred, have to be assessed.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.55in">It is over a year since the placement orders were made and there have been changes other than AB&#8217;s alcohol consumption during that time. Firstly, the Court now has medical evidence of the extent of AB&#8217;s liver cirrhosis and the impact of that on his life expectancy. The Court also has evidence about the need for gastroscopy investigations and the risk of fatal complications from varices. The children have come to speak English and they cannot communicate with their father in English. They have grown in confidence. They have benefited from stability in foster care but they have been waiting now many months for adoption so that they can have a permanent family. </p>

The difficulty in accepting those assurances is that in the past year since the placement orders were made, he has not done those things. The past, it is often said, is the best predictor of the future. I have little confidence that AB will put into action all those assurances. Likewise, his assurance that he will remain abstinent cannot carry much weight given his history of abuse, the stresses he would be under if the children were returned to him, and the lack of support he has to remain sober. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.55in">AB has not engaged with professional help which has been available to him to support his abstinence and health. I am not persuaded that he would accept professional help in the future. His approach has been to tackle his issues himself, alone. During his evidence he seemed to struggle to understand why his own efforts were not considered to be sufficient and why he ought to be accepting professional help. Support from the Local Authority might be of some assistance to him as a parent for the children but I do not believe that it would reduce the risk of relapse. AB likes to go his own way and to be self-sufficient. He does not welcome what he regards as interference. He finds ways of disengaging from professional support. I find that he would be reluctant to be open with social workers as to his vulnerabilities, health, and risk of relapsing. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.55in">AB has not put any expert evidence as to the risk of relapse before the Court. In part his failure to engage in any long term therapy or relapse prevention work has precluded the admission of evidence from professionals on the risk of relapse. The burden is on him to satisfy the court that the placement orders should be revoked albeit an application like this should not be determined on the basis of where the burden of proof lies. Had he sought out support he might have been able to call on those professionals assisting him to advise the Court of the sustainability of his abstinence. I do not have such evidence. Doing the best I can and weighing all the relevant factors, I find that if the children were returned to AB&#8217;s care there would be a substantial risk that he would relapse and recommence abusing alcohol during the first year or so when they were in his care. </p>

AB accepts that if he were to relapse he would be likely to return to drinking excessively. I find that in those circumstances the children would be highly likely again to suffer neglect and harm. If they had to be removed from their father&#8217;s care again they would suffer even further emotional harm.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.55in">Aside from the risk of relapse there are other factors that weigh against revocation of the placement orders. Mr Trory for AB contended that AB&#8217;s limited life expectancy would not by itself be a ground for removing the children from his care and it cannot be a ground for maintain the placement orders. With respect, the life expectancy evidence is one part of the whole picture and cannot be ignored. It is surely of significance that the Court now has evidence that AB&#8217;s liver damage is already so severe that his life expectancy is between 10 and 15 years even if he remains abstinent for the rest of his life. He is unlikely to survive his children&#8217;s childhoods. It is also a reasonable inference that before his death he will suffer symptoms of liver cirrhosis and require interventions. His health would have an adverse impact on his ability to care for the children and their experience of him as their parent, even if he were to remain abstinent.</p>

It would be contrary to the best interests of the children to revoke the placement orders. It is in their best interests that the orders should remain in force. This outcome will lead to the severing of family ties for the children which must be a last resort. I am satisfied that the continuation of the placement orders is a proportionate interference with the Article 8 rights of the children and AB.</p>

AB is unrealistic. His abstinence is to his very great credit and demonstrates a keen motivation to turn his life around and to be reunited with his children. But he has not taken other steps as advised by professionals to secure the continuation of his abstinence. He has not undergone gastroscopy to check for the need treatment for varices even though such treatment could save his life. He has not engaged with relapse prevention work nor has he re-engaged with AA. He has not built a support network. He is not in accommodation that is suitable for the children. He has not learned sufficient English to enable him to communicate with his children. The Court has assurances from AB that he will take steps to remedy these problems but the evidence is that he has failed to do so thus far. </p>

The Local Authority and Guardian oppose such an order being made. I shall not make such an order. The prospective adopters have said that they are open to meeting AB but hesitant about agreeing to post adoption contact. Currently, family time is not going so well that it is necessary to insist that it continues post adoption irrespective of the potential impact on the adoption and the stability of the children in their new family. The potential adopters are agreeable to letter box contact which would provide the children and AB with information about each other and maintain the children&#8217;s awareness of their biological family. It is unknown how AB will respond to the refusal of his application to revoke the placement orders. I hope that the prospective adopters will meet AB and that the meeting goes well and that post adoption contact can be agreed but I do not believe that I should not tie the hands of the adopters in this respect.
