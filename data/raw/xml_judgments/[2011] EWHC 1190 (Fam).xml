	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">There is an issue between the parties as to the reason for leaving London at this time.  The wife says that it was prompted by the husband's desire to be out of the country for three years so as to reset the clock of his non-domiciled tax status and enable the family to live in London uninterrupted once schools were required.  The husband says that they left simply because they wanted to.  I find that tax planning was a major reason for leaving London.  This is effectively reflected in a later e-mail from the husband to an immigration solicitor in January 2009, referring to "the 3 years away that I needed to restart my non-domiciliation from zero years."  In this family, other priorities tend to take second place to tax considerations.</span></p>

In March 2008, they visited London to arrange a first school place for their daughter.  They spent the summer (and also the following Christmas) in Switzerland, staying in the husband's family chalet in Gstaad, which is shared with his mother and other members of his family.  In July 2008 their second daughter was born in Milan.</span></p>

The furniture was then taken out of storage and a certain amount of redecoration was undertaken by the wife.

It was clearly stated that the child would return to school in London in April 2010, and that the missed term&#8217;s fees would be paid anyhow.  The letter making this request to the school was approved by the husband.  In Switzerland, the husband submitted an application to an international school in Gstaad.  This explicitly referred to the child attending for the first term of 2010 only.  Both schools have confirmed that their understanding was always that the child would return to continue her education in London in the following term.</span></p>

In his evidence in chief, he said that at the time when he approved a draft of the letter to the London school at the end of November 2009, "it was not really clear if the move was permanent or not".  Under cross-examination, he was vague and evasive, as if dreading the consequences of being clear about anything.  On the particular question of his response to the wife's non-return in April 2010, he volunteered that he had repeatedly telephoned her to ask when she would be back, but was met by a series of explanations and excuses.  His evidence did not satisfy me that this was so.  The suggestion emerged for the first time in the witness box.  It does not appear in either of his affidavits, and nor was any such suggestion put to the wife, who gave evidence first.  Given the complete absence of corroboration or circumstantial support, it would have taken a far more convincing witness than the husband to persuade me that these conversations had taken place.</span></p>

Such a person is of course only </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">present</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'"> in one place at a time, but the relevant concept is residence and not presence.  It makes no sense to regard a person who travels between two homes on a regular and frequent basis as oscillating in perpetual succession between being resident at one and then at the other.  This does not accurately reflect ordinary use of language, nor provide any valuable certainty, while any consequences in terms of civil status or tax status can readily be catered for.  In particular, since simple residence is not a basis for jurisdiction, simultaneous residence in more than one member state cannot lead to jurisdictional conflict.</span></p>

I do not consider that the absence in Switzerland alters that conclusion, any more than her other absences can have done.  Mr Scott did not suggest that a month in Crete plus a month in Switzerland over the summer holidays of 2009 would amount to a change of residence from London to those places, even though both are familiar family holiday homes.  However, he did argue that absence for a school term has a different quality, even if it was on a temporary basis.  I agree with that, and in the case of many families it might well amount to a change of residence.  In the case of this particular family, I do not so find.  It was not in reality a change of residence for the wife, but a temporary presence in Switzerland for the benefit of the husband's relationship with their children.  The context is important here, and I prefer the argument of the wife that the family&#8217;s way of life makes her absence from London of less significance than it would be in many cases.  Her constant return trips to London are also a factor.  The period in Switzerland amounted in all to no more than a couple of months of temporary absence, continually interrupted by flights back home.  Looking at the matter overall, this relatively short period did not prevent that the wife from being regarded as being resident in London for the year before she presented her petition.</span></p>

I do not accept the husband&#8217;s explicit charge that the wife was &#8216;forum-shopping&#8217;.  Throughout its existence, this family's connection with this country has been stronger than its connection with anywhere else, and in particular with the husband's chosen forum in Greece.  If the wife failed to establish jurisdiction on the basis of her present petition, she would simply issue a fresh petition on undoubtedly firm jurisdictional foundations.  The husband's petition in Greece does not qualify under any basis provided by BIIR.  He would have had to persuade the Greek court to act on the basis of local law, if such were possible, and a further forum battle would no doubt have followed.  If the husband had succeeded in his opposition to the presentation of the wife's current petition, I suspect that it would have turned out to be a Pyrrhic victory, in the truest sense of the word. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">These parties have not hesitated to litigate about every conceivable issue.  In addition to the issues of jurisdiction and child abduction, the case has constantly been before the court since April 2010.  There have been arguments about chattels, occupation and non-molestation orders, freezing orders, interim financial orders, and litigation funding.  There have been several hearings about the children, and even though a shared residence order is now in place, a two-day hearing about the precise arrangements is listed for June 2011.  Having been informed of the issues between the parents, I strongly urged them to have discussions with a view to reaching one of a number of fairly obvious solutions for their own benefit and that of their children.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">Persistent failure to reach agreement has generated an absurd level of legal costs.  I directed the parties to provide schedules of expenditure to date.  The wife's costs now amount to &#163;425,000, of which &#163;114,000 remains unpaid.  The husband's costs amount to &#163;500,000, of which &#163;63,000 remains unpaid.  The overall bill to the family, now standing at &#163;925,000, will no doubt top &#163;1 million if next month&#8217;s hearing about the children goes ahead.  It should be recalled that this level of expense has been incurred without a basis of jurisdiction having been established, or a page being filed in relation to the ultimate financial orders that will be required.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">The case is evidently not proceeding in accordance with the overriding objective that it should be dealt with expeditiously and by saving expense, and it is also being allotted a disproportionate share of the court's resources.  I shall direct that at every future hearing of whatever kind each party shall provide the court with an updated schedule of costs of the kind presented at this hearing.  It is just possible that continuous reminders of the irreplaceable loss of money that could be better spent will have some effect on the parties' thinking.</span></p>

The court is entitled to adjourn proceedings on its own initiative to enable alternative processes to be explored.  I would expect that this option will be very much in the mind of judges conducting any future hearings.</span></p>
