I accept that evidence. After they were separated, she says, she was compelled to start her own, informal, forensic investigations into the matrimonial assets and the history of property transactions, details of which I set out below.</span></p>

She suggests that H removed himself with little or no explanation as to his reasons and ultimate intentions. W says that she did not finally realise that the marriage was over until July 2021 when H convened a conference call with the 2 children. H accepted that he first told W that he wanted a divorce in July 2021. H says that this was a difficult marriage throughout its course. He describes a &#8220;tumultuous relationship&#8221; before they were married which did not improve afterwards. Essentially, he says many of his financial decisions were taken in order to keep W, who was domineering, contented and to avoid recrimination. He left, he said, following a serious incident in the course of which he was attacked by W and she tried &#8220;to grab my stoma bag&#8221;. W disagrees. W admits that they had &#8220;ups and downs&#8221; and a separation in 2011 but did not want the marriage to end. To some extent, she blames the difficulties on H&#8217;s excessive consumption of alcohol and difficulties with H&#8217;s mother. On her case, one day in May 2021 H went out, saying that he was visiting a priest at his parents&#8217; house but left the FMH never to return. It seems likely that the argument in May 2021 which H says led him to move out of the house (whatever the events, as to which I am unable to make any findings) resulted from a lack of communication. It seems likely that H had already by then decided to leave the marriage, a decision which he did not communicate to W for some months. </span></p>

By May 2021 matters were sufficiently strained between the parties that H called the Police to inform them that he intended to attend at the FMH in order to collect some belongings. W says that on one occasion he attended with a stranger to her as a sort of chaperone. The parties dispute which documents H removed and which documents he left behind. The financial information was, essentially, in the knowledge of H. It seems to me that W&#8217;s evident distrust and suspicion within these proceedings should be seen against that context. I consider this further below.</span></p>

In Miller v Miller; McFarlane v McFarlane <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2006/24" uk:canonical="[2006] UKHL 24" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] UKHL 24</ref>:- "This 'equal sharing' principle derives from the basic concept of equality permeating a marriage as understood today. Marriage, it is often said, is a partnership of equals&#8230;The parties commit themselves to sharing their lives. They live and work together. When their partnership ends each is entitled to an equal share of the assets of the partnership, unless there is a good reason to the contrary. Fairness requires no less. But I emphasise the qualifying phrase: 'unless there is good reason to the contrary'. The yardstick of equality is to be applied as an aid, not a rule.</span></p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Thirdly, he created a loan instrument dated 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> August 2010 which retrospectively purported to create repayment obligations to his parents in respect of monies lent, even on his case before the marriage (when he purchased Property 2) and in 2008 (for the purchase of the FMH). Using that document, which was not one of the &#8220;disputed loan documents&#8221; and, as I find, was located by W soon before the hearing, H was able to register a restriction in respect of Property 2. It seems likely that this was done at a time when the marriage was in difficulty in order to discourage W from making a claim upon it. He said: &#8220;This was put in place to protect the position when I left the FMH &#8230; the document was drafted in haste &#8230; it doesn't follow the flow of funds but was to protect my parents&#8217; loans&#8221;. Again, that explanation is unfortunate. H then insisted that he tried to register a restriction soon after the date of the agreement but there were delays within HMLR. It does not really matter much but I think that, too, is wrong. Probably, H was the master of the timings as it suited him. W knew nothing of any of this. The sums said to have been loaned to H (eg &#163;65,000 towards the purchase of the FMH) in the 2010 instrument were inconsistent with his and his parents&#8217; later case (that &#163;45,000 was lent by his sister and mother). At trial, W introduced these documents with my permission. She was criticised for late disclosure but I accept her explanation. I do so because plainly these documents cast doubt on H&#8217;s and H&#8217;s parents&#8217; case in the preliminary issues. Given the age of some of the loans, W&#8217;s challenge to them was entirely unsurprising. W&#8217;s decision to settle the preliminary issues was plainly pragmatic but arguably may, actually, have been generous to the other parties.</p>

When HMRC questioned him in correspondence about rental income attributed to his sons, he quickly paid money into their bank accounts over a few short months in 2019 (page 608) having paid no rent to them beforehand. That money was later withdrawn to pay for family holidays in Dubai and Mauritius. The shuffling of monies between accounts was therefore solely for the sake of appearances. If the money was genuinely the children&#8217;s, to have used it for a family holiday would have been a clear breach of trust. When questioned about this, H answered &#8220;A couple of thousand pounds between parents and their children is neither here nor there&#8221;. I disagree.</p>

However, such returns are incapable of creating property rights in a third party. In any event, W says, and I accept, that H filed her returns on her behalf and she did not pay real attention to the detail. That is not a startling proposition given the nature of the relationship, H&#8217;s job, the complexity of the family&#8217;s property holdings and H&#8217;s somewhat expedient approach to income tax. </p>

That seems to be correct although the precise sum so used is unknown. It may have been as little as 25% of &#163;11,250 (see page 617). Some &#163;44,000 was raised by way of re-mortgage but not all was spent on the purchase of Property 1. Strictly, at the point of purchase, the children&#8217;s share under a deed of trust was 12.5% each. Did that payment create a resulting trust and, if so, in what proportions? At the time, H held Property 3 upon trust for himself and the children. I conclude that H treated the funds from the re-mortgage of Property 3 as his and did not have regard to the issue of trusts or tracing. As a matter of law, the remortgage monies would have first attached to his interest in the net proceeds and, to the extent that he resorted to the children&#8217;s (then) 25% share he may have committed a breach of trust by paying away trust monies in such circumstances. </p>

That is an untenable basis for the disposition of an interest in land. While it may support a common understanding, the children would be wholly unable to show that they relied on that understanding to their detriment, an essential ingredient in a constructive trust. </p>

That may or may not be the case. No doubt they have wrongly reduced their income tax liabilities through this device in the past. On H&#8217;s own case this applies equally to the North Hyde Road property (see below). That is simply a consequence of the inaccurate information provided to HMRC.</p>

As such it is clearly non-matrimonial in principle. W relies upon the fact (i) that it was re-mortgaged and the proceeds used for refurbishment of the FMH and the acquisition of other properties and (ii) that the rental income was declared to HMRC as the income of H and W, equally. Legally, the fact that remortgage monies may have been applied elsewhere and effectively gifted away does not affect the treatment of the balance of the net proceeds of sale. This remains non matrimonial albeit it has diminished over time. I have already indicated my disapproval of the treatment of rental income for tax purposes. Inaccurate tax returns are of no relevance in the absence of deeds of transfer or trust or the existence of grounds from which to infer or impute a constructive trust.</p>

However, that valuation has been deflated by payments made to YY Company (a company incorporated in the BVI and seemingly beneficially owned by ZZ, a long-standing friend of H) totalling &#163;145,000 by Company 1 Ltd. The explanation for those payments, H says is this: &#8220;YY Company is a consultancy&#8221; which he employed to support his business in March 2021 as he anticipated taking time off work during and after treatment. H trusted ZZ to service his clients without poaching them. &#8220;We agreed a fixed fee retainer. It is an overseas company. I worked with ZZ at Y Firm. He was the year above me at university. He is my relative&#8217;s best friend. We have a strong relationship. The arrangement is likely to come to an end soon.&#8221;  A contract was produced (at page 876). I find it a strange contract. It stipulates that YY Company will be paid an hourly rate to be agreed (clause 10), invoiced weekly or monthly with hours supported by timesheets. By clause 8 &#8220;hours of work for each assignment&#8221; were to be agreed. I have no evidence of the agreed rates or hours nor have I seen any timesheets. Those clauses are inconsistent with &#8220;a fixed fee retainer&#8221;. It does also stipulate (clause 9) for a monthly retainer in the sum of &#163;5,000 plus VAT but that is in addition to clause 10. If it was intended that YY Company be paid for the basic retainer regardless plus billed time then it is an extraordinarily generous arrangement given that the annual retainer exceeds Company 1 Ltd.&#8217;s profits in the year to April 2020 (page 214 at paragraph 70). It does not give the appearance of an arm&#8217;s length, commercial arrangement. To make matters worse, in cross examination H said this: &#8220;It was on an ad hoc retainer basis, at &#163;200 per day&#8221;. I did not receive any evidence as to the charge out rates of YY Company or ZZ or their staff but I am quite sure that &#163;200 per day is an unrealistic and arbitrary figure for an overseas-based (as H described it) tax consultancy services. It does not make sense without further explanation and documentation. Furthermore, suspiciously, the first payment to YY Company was not made for many months. None of this was satisfactorily explained. H also accepted that the YY Company payments will cease &#8220;soon&#8221; without saying when or why. No evidence was produced from YY Company or ZZ. Whilst YY Company was not joined as an intervener and fraud is not alleged by W, I am simply not persuaded that YY Company was contractually due those monies. I also think it unlikely that H would continue trading through Company 1 Ltd since March 2021 using the services of sub-contractors to such an extent that it made his company consistently loss-making and will eventually threaten its solvency. This is an example where my concerns about H&#8217;s evidence mean that I should look for corroboration in the documents before accepting his evidence. The YY Company invoices prove nothing. There is no other corroboration so I reject his evidence. The payments to YY Company were not, in my judgment, payments made to a third party in the ordinary course of trading for good consideration. How should I treat what I consider to be overpayments made to YY Company? Some &#163;145,000 was paid to it in total. Company 1 Ltd.&#8217;s profit before tax for the year to 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2021 was &#163;118,590. In the following two years, to 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2022 and 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2023, it posted losses of about &#163;20,000 in each year. In consequence of those losses, shareholders&#8217; funds have been depleted to &#163;93,112 as at April 2023. The monies paid to YY Company totalling &#163;145,000 will, in my view, probably be paid back to Company 1 Ltd shortly but corporation tax will be applied at 25%, at the rate applicable in this tax year. On that basis &#163;108,750 should be added to the shareholders&#8217; funds which I round down to &#163;200,000. H&#8217;s shareholding in Company 1 Ltd is therefore re-valued to &#163;200,000. By way of a cross-check, I should consider how this will affect Company 1 Ltd&#8217;s profits. Even adding back the &#163;145,000 as additional profit since the start of the 2021-2022 tax year, the company&#8217;s pre-tax profits will still have declined significantly - by well over 50% - when compared to 2020-2021. That is still consistent with H&#8217;s case as to his diminished earning capacity but at a level where the company is ticking along. </p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-weight:bold">The proceeds of the critical illness policies including any money owed to H by the Family X is matrimonial property.</span> Reasons: Neither counsel is able to point to direct authority on this point. In <span style="font-style:italic">Miller v McFarlane</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2006/24" uk:canonical="[2006] UKHL 24" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] UKHL 24</ref>, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead distinguished between inheritances and gifts acquired during the marriage and property which is the product of the parties&#8217; common endeavour. The proceeds from these policies do not sit easily in either camp. The premiums for each policy were generated from household income and, indeed, each party has the benefit of such a policy (although W says that she has or is about to cancel hers on the grounds of expense). The first policy was taken out in 2003 in circumstances where H had just taken on a significant mortgage with a relative. He described the purpose of the first policy as &#8220;for mortgage protection and income protection&#8221;. The second policy was taken out in 2015 or 2016 because H was thinking of leaving his employment and he wanted to replace an equivalent policy provided by his then employer. Personal injury damages in simple terms may consist of (a) damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenity (&#8220;PSLA&#8221;), (b) damages for past loss of earnings and other out-of-pocket expenses and care costs and (c) damages for future loss of earnings. Such damages are not assets comprising the product of the parties&#8217; joint marital endeavour during the marriage but brought into the marriage unilaterally by one of the parties as a consequence of their injuries and are therefore akin to an external donation. It would be logical to distinguish between damages for past loss of earnings, care provided by the other spouse and past out-of-pocket expenses in the period that the marriage subsists on the one hand (which may well be matrimonial and subject to the sharing principle) as against general damages for PSLA or future loss of earnings (which do not seem capable of being categorised as matrimonial property) on the other. Indeed, the husband&#8217;s earning capacity was held not to be capable of being a matrimonial asset to which the sharing principle applies in <span style="font-style:italic">Waggott v Waggott</span> where Moylan LJ stated: &#8220;The sharing principle applies to marital assets, being the property of the party generated during the marriage otherwise than by external donation (<span style="font-style:italic">Charman v Charman (No 4)</span>. An earning capacity is not property and &#8230; it results in the generation of property after the marriage.&#8221; I accept, of course, that had H&#8217;s policies paid out at a different time then there would have been little difficulty characterising the proceeds as non-matrimonial. I also accept the submissions of Ms Murray KC that the primary function for these policies was to protect against loss of future income arising from ill health and that that the proceeds should be available for other uses, eg medical treatment and care costs. However, the proceeds cannot be neatly characterised as a substitute for future income. In <span style="font-style:italic">Wagstaff v Wagstaff</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1992] 1 WLR 320" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1992">[1992] 1 WLR 320</ref>, it was held that (a) the <span style="color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">damages award resulting from a clinical negligence claim formed part of the matrimonial assets including damages for PSLA but (b) the fact that it has been received may indicate that one party to the marriage has specific needs which must be taken into account as part of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> analysis and may weigh heavily in the balance and (c) there is no presumption that those needs will outweigh the needs of the other spouse.</span> Per Butler-Sloss LJ: &#8220;The reasons for the availability of the capital in the hands of one spouse, together with the size of the award, are relevant factors in all the circumstances of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref>.  But the capital sum awarded is not sacrosanct nor any part of it secured against the application of the other spouse.  &#8230; any calculations made in respect of the capital of the parties should reflect a substantial discount for the fact that the money was received as damages.  In general, the reasons for the availability of the capital by way of damages must temper the extent of, and in some instances may exclude the sharing of, such capital with the other spouse.  It is important to stress yet again that each case must be considered on its own facts.&#8221; <span style="color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">And in his judgment, Lord Donaldson, MR, said: &#8220;</span>&#8230; compensation is a financial asset which, like money earned by one spouse by working excessively long hours or in disagreeable circumstances, is (subject to human selfishness) available to the whole family before the breakdown of the marriage and, like any other asset whether financial or otherwise, has to be taken into account when the court comes to exercise its powers in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>.  In so far as it represents compensation for loss of amenity, as contrasted with pain and suffering, there might be a need to spend it on acquiring a replacement amenity, but this would be a financial need within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25(2)</ref>(b).&#8221; In my view, I should adopt the <span style="font-style:italic">Wagstaff v Wagstaff</span> approach to the insurance monies. What I describe above as the logical approach (which otherwise would have guided me) is simply not consistent with <span style="font-style:italic">Wagstaff</span> where PSLA damages were held to be matrimonial. It is a function of the timing of H&#8217;s unfortunate diagnosis that the proceeds are in the arena today. In my view, <span style="font-style:italic">Wagstaff </span>offers the correct approach. I shall return to this below. </p>

The property at page 541 in the bundle is likely the bare minimum which H would contemplate for himself. The cheaper of those two properties appears to have two double bedrooms and one box room/ study. As such its suitability is questionable. Nevertheless I think, doing the best I can, I would assess the housing need as somewhere between the two but nearer to the higher-priced property so, say, &#163;675,000. The SDLT liability on that price would amount to &#163;21,250. Conveyancing would be approximately &#163;1,200. Removal costs would be additional. </span></p>

Mortgage lenders will generally not be prepared to lend where part of the deposit is funded by third parties. I certainly do not factor in that possibility as a resource to which she can probably appeal. In the same way, I do not factor into H&#8217;s resources monies previously lent to him by family members and now repaid. Every family has different priorities and financial arrangements. One particular feature, which is apparent sitting in this jurisdiction, is that parents seek to play an even hand between their children and balance any money advanced during the parents&#8217; lifetimes. It is an easy accusation to make that soft loans do not need to be repaid. The reality is that whilst repayment may be postponed they are seldom forgotten or forgiven and are often a source of family discontent and, once, repaid are gratefully received and reapplied.</span></p>

This uplift is in lieu of spousal maintenance. Counsel for W makes 2 points here: W&#8217;s net income is still insufficient to discharge 50% of the CMI whilst meeting outgoings; the house may not sell by July 2024 whereafter she would be liable for 100% of the CMI. The answer to these points is as follows: in January 2024, H will pay both the CMI plus agreed maintenance; W is then effectively liable for 50% of the CMI for 6 months; the August 2024 redemption date is a back-stop; in reality, she will be able to decide sooner whether she can re-mortgage or whether she needs to sell; any sale can be timed to coincide with the end of Child B&#8217;s school term and, in reality, GCSE pupils leave school after their GCSE exams have finished; I am sure that W would be able to postpone repayment of family debts for a little while if necessary to cover any cash flow problems. </span></p>

The answer is this: neither child is a party to this application; however, H has explained his position under oath; he acknowledged that there is no deed of trust which postpones the vesting of assets in the children at a later age than 18; the beneficial interests in property and bank credits belong absolutely to each of the children once they attain their majority; Child A has already attained his majority. </span></p>
