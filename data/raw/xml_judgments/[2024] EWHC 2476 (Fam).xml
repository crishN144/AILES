The Local Authority, making this application for a Deprivation of Liberty Declaration, is represented by Ms&#160;Proctor.  The social worker attending, who gave evidence, is C.  I also heard from the Head of Service, D, and I will return to her evidence shortly.  The mother is E, she has not attended.  She has played no part in these proceedings, and that is consistent with her absence in A's life presently.

Section 22(1) defines a child who is looked after by the local authority as a child in the care of the local authority or a child provided with accommodation by the local authority in the exercise of any of its functions, save from those under ss. 17, 23B and 24 B of the 1989 Act. Within this context, s.20 of the 1989 Act places a duty on local authorities to provide accommodation to a child in need who appears to it to require accommodation and s. 22A of the 1989 Act places a duty on the local authority to provide children in care with accommodation.&#160; Within this context, pursuant to s. 22G of the 1989 Act, local authorities are subject to an overarching duty to ensure sufficient accommodation is available to accommodate children with different needs.&#160; This is otherwise known as the &#8220;sufficiency duty&#8221;.</span></p>

She gave evidence about how she has in the past, herself, been the manager of a registered children's home.  She is the &#8216;responsible person&#8217; for the Local Authority, and she gave clear evidence to the Court to suggest that the costs that local authorities must meet in providing accommodation, the like of which is required for A, is regularly between &#163;13,000 and &#163;16,000 per week; that is per child.

Bearing in mind that the written application for deprivation of liberty from this Local Authority was for 12 months of provision, (although I recognise in oral evidence that has now been lowered to six months), that would give rise to a cost of just shy of &#163;1 million per annum to provide accommodation for one child.  That is, on any view, a breathtaking sum of money.  His current accommodation costs &#163;13,580 per week. The proposed accommodation will cost &#163;12,000 per week. In the financial year 2021/22 the local authority spent &#163;7.5m on residential placements excluding foster care. This year they are forecasting a total spend of &#163;16.5m. The projected costs this year have increased by 116%.  Again, these are breathtaking figures.  The witness also identified for me that the problem is right across the board because of the lack of available foster carers to provide care for children, meaning that Local Authorities have to fall back on residential care. She readily accepted that there would be some children currently in residential care who would be suitable for foster care, were there any available.  The problems also extend to those that are leaving the care sector by reason of their age and the lack of suitable provision for them, such that they are presently paying &#163;4,500 per week to provide accommodation for one adult who has recently ceased to be a looked after child by age.  </span></p>

She said the alternatives are to take money from another part of the Local Authority, or simply to be &#8220;bankrupt&#8221;.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">On the central point of law upon which this appeal turns my conclusion is that where a local authority places a child under CA 1989, Part III in an unregistered children's home, that placement is outside the statutory scheme established by CA 1989, s 22C and the regulations. The Supreme Court determined in&#160;Re T&#160;that the High Court nevertheless has jurisdiction, in an appropriate case, to authorise that restrictions may be placed on the liberty of a young person placed in such a placement where imperative conditions of necessity justify doing so.</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">We have found that the scheme does not allow unregistered placements, but does not expressly prohibit them. In those circumstances, as in&#160;Re T, where conditions of imperative necessity require, the common law steps in and allows the High Court to exercise its inherent jurisdiction. That exercise of the inherent jurisdiction is not in breach of Art 5 and nor does it cut across the statutory scheme. As it is not the High Court that is making the placement, the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction is not part of the statutory scheme at all. In this respect, the situation is exactly as it was in&#160;Re T&#160;where the Supreme Court did not feel the need to read any words into the statute.&#8221;</span></p>

As a Designated Family Judge in Liverpool, I see time and time again, children and young people wrapped up in the pernicious activities of organised criminals, who seek to exploit children for their own selfish financial gain and are prepared to expose those children to a risk of the most grave of outcomes, catastrophic injury or even death.  </span></p>

This Local Authority must be given the tools to try and stabilize A's situation as quickly as possible, to try to extricate him from the clutches of organised criminals and hopefully to provide the therapeutic support and treatment that clearly he needs on a number of different levels, in light of the various risks that he faces, and that is before one considers the potential for  further  exposure to the criminal justice system if this sort of conduct continues.</span></p>

First of all, the behaviours of A are so entrenched and have been going on for such a lengthy period of time that in my judgment, it is highly unlikely that there will be any meaningful improvement in his behaviour in anything less than six months.  The danger of running it for 12 months is that that is too long to start off with, bearing in mind that there has been no prior consultation with A, and that the length of time may be such a crushing blow for him that he is completely demotivated.  By the same token, the suggestion that the order should simply be made for two months would be likely, in my judgment, to lead him to think that here is another short-term elastoplast fix by the Local Authority that never achieves anything for him, and may simply seek to run the clock down on the basis that his expectation then would be that there would be no deprivation of liberty thereafter. If one was then imposed, that may again demotivate him, he having expected there to be no further provision.  The right balance, in my judgment, is six months.  </span></p>

I intend to make a final deprivation of liberty declaration that will run for a period of six months from today.  That is the judgment of the Court. </span></p>
