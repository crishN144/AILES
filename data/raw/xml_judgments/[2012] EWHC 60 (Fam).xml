	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The background to this application reveals the existence of a phenomenon which is by no means uncommon.  The Applicant, whom I shall refer to as the husband, is English and the Respondent, whom I shall refer to as the wife, is American.  They were married in the presence of witnesses only in Connecticut on 29 April 1999.  However, they wished there to be a larger ceremony at which their family and friends could attend.  Rather than arranging for some kind of ceremony of blessing, they in fact went through a second ceremony of marriage on 30 May 1999 at a hotel in England which was attended by family and friends and, no doubt, followed by a wedding party.  That second ceremony resulted in the parties&#8217; marriage being registered at the General Register Office of England and Wales.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">As I have said this phenomenon is not uncommon.  Quite often parties marry abroad but wish to have a grander ceremony here and therefore go through a second actual marriage ceremony.  It is highly undesirable because the second marriage ceremony must result in false representations being made to the Registrar of Marriages.  Formal representations need to be made to the Registrar of Marriages, I believe to be verified on oath, that neither of the parties is already married and of course it is a fact that, by the words of the ceremony itself, the parties have to declare that they know of no lawful impediment why they should not be married.  That must have happened here and those representations must have been false because of course, at the relevant time, they were already married to each other.  They are not false representations with any social consequence as they affect only themselves, but nonetheless the marriage laws of this country are there to be obeyed and it is highly regrettable that in this case - and I believe it is likely to have happened in other cases &#8211; false representations should have been made in order to satisfy the social wishes of the parties.  Better, I suggest, it would have been for them to have arranged for a non-legal, non-formal ceremony of blessing of their prior union in Connecticut on 29 April 1999.</span></p>

According to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>, only a marriage (not a ceremony) can be declared a nullity.  Here there is only one marriage which was created by the first ceremony.  A decree of nullity would be clearly inappropriate because the parties were undoubtedly lawfully married and the marriage was therefore valid.  The American ceremony on 29 April 1999 and the American decree of divorce on 24 June 2004 both complied with the necessary formalities validly to alter the parties&#8217; marital status.  By contrast, the English ceremony was &#8216;a nothing&#8217; because it did not affect their status.&#8221;</span></p>

Questionable ceremonies should I think be addressed on a case by case basis taking account of the various factors and features mentioned above, including particularly but not exhaustively: (a) whether the ceremony or event set out or purported to be a lawful marriage; (b) whether it bore all or enough of the hallmarks of marriage; (c) whether the three key participants, most especially the officiating official, believed, intended and understood the ceremony as giving rise to the status of lawful marriage; and (d) the reasonable perceptions, understandings and beliefs of those in attendance.  In most if not all reasonably foreseeable situations, a review of these and similar certain considerations should enable a decision to be satisfactorily reached.&#8221;</span></p>
