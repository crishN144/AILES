	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During the course of public law care proceedings, which were being heard by HHJ Wright in the Family Court in Sheffield, counsel for the Mother raised serious questions concerning the probity and reliability of a Consultant Clinical Psychologist, Dr Ben Harper who had been instructed in the proceedings and who had provided a report for the Court.  The criticisms made against him arose in consequence of the Mother covertly recording her assessment sessions.  It was contended that Dr Harper&#8217;s report significantly misquoted and adversely misrepresented the Mother.  HHJ Wright transferred the case to the High Court on this single issue, on the grounds of its &#8216;complexity&#8217;.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2014 HHJ Coe QC approved an agreed threshold criteria document, thus finding the subject children had suffered &#8216;significant harm&#8217; as contemplated by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.31(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.   The children are three boys: with respective dates of birth 28.11.07, 19.08.11 and 19.04.13.  The essence of the findings were that the father was in a Detention Centre awaiting deportation to Nigeria and thus unable to advance himself as a carer for his children and the Mother&#8217;s long standing and significant mental health issues.  The Court found, in particular, that the Mother had experienced severe depressive episodes including psychosis and fulfilled the criteria as suffering Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  It is noted that on the 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2013 the Mother was detained, initially pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">S.2</ref> and thereafter to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">S.3</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> June I endorsed a previous direction that a verbatim transcript of the recordings should be obtained and that they should be filed within these proceedings.  I also directed that a Schedule of Findings should be prepared by the Mother&#8217;s legal team and made provision for Dr Harper to intervene within the proceedings should he wish to do so.  Given the pressing need for a resolution of these children&#8217;s circumstances I certified the matter as suitable for vacation business and listed the matter before me on the 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August in the Royal Courts of Justice.  It is unnecessary for me to burden this judgment with the intervening case management history.  Suffice it to say, Dr Harper accepted the invitation and has been represented at this hearing by leading counsel, Ms Fenella Morris QC. </p>

This appears to have resulted in submissions that the Family Division should also apply a "heightened civil standard", equivalent to the criminal standard ("in serious cases such as the present, the difference between the two standards is, in truth, largely illusory", per Lord Bingham CJ in B v Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Constabulary <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 1 WLR 340" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 1 WLR 340</ref>, 354), in local authority applications for care orders.

In our judgment this approach is mistaken. The standard of proof to be applied in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> cases is the balance of probabilities and the approach to these difficult cases was laid down by Lord Nicholls in In re H (Minors) (Sexual Abuse: Standard of Proof) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1996] AC 563" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">[1996] AC 563</ref>. That test has not been varied nor adjusted by the dicta of Lord Bingham of Cornhill CJ or Lord Steyn who were considering applications made under a different statute. There would appear to be no good reason to leap across a division, on the one hand, between crime and preventative measures taken to restrain defendants for the benefit of the community and, on the other hand, wholly different considerations of child protection and child welfare nor to apply the reasoning in McCann's case <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 1 AC 787" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 1 AC 787</ref> to public, or indeed to private, law cases concerning children. The strict rules of evidence applicable in a criminal trial which is adversarial in nature is to be contrasted with the partly inquisitorial approach of the court dealing with children cases in which the rules of evidence are considerably relaxed. In our judgment therefore&#8230;the principles set out by Lord Nicholls should continue to be followed by the judiciary trying family cases and by magistrates sitting in the family proceedings courts."</span></p>

Lord Nicholls was not laying down any rule of law. There is only one rule of law, namely that the occurrence of the fact in issue must be proved to have been more probable than not. Common sense, not law, requires that in deciding this question, regard should be had, to whatever extent appropriate, to inherent probabilities. If a child alleges sexual abuse by a parent, it is common sense to start with the assumption that most parents do not abuse their children. But this assumption may be swiftly dispelled by other compelling evidence of the relationship between parent and child or parent and other children. It would be absurd to suggest that the tribunal must in all cases assume that serious conduct is unlikely to have occurred. In many cases, the other evidence will show that it was all too likely. If, for example, it is clear that a child was assaulted by one or other of two people, it would make no sense to start one's reasoning by saying that assaulting children is a serious matter and therefore neither of them is likely to have done so. The fact is that one of them did and the question for the tribunal is simply whether it is more probable that one rather than the other was the perpetrator.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have read this paragraph a number of times.  It seems to me to do Dr Harper no credit at all.  It is crafted in a way that seems designed to minimise the extent of the very significant failing it represents.  When pursued in cross examination it was revealed that extensive parts of the report which purport, by the conventional grammatical use of quotation marks, to be direct quotations from the Mother, are in fact nothing of the kind.  They are a collection of recollections and impressions compressed into phrases created by Dr Harper and attributed to the Mother.  They convey to the reader of the report only one impression, namely that they represent the authentic voice of Mother herself.  The quotations are also italicised and drafted in full sentences in the idiom of the Mother rather than in the formal argot of psychology which characterises the remainder of the report. Within the context of the evaluative exercise that the Court is involved in, during care proceedings, the accurately reported phrases and observations of the parties themselves are inevitably afforded much greater forensic weight than e.g. opinion evidence, hearsay or summary by a third party.  It is very likely that a Judge reading such &#8216;quotations&#8217; in the report of an experienced expert witness will at least start with the strong presumption that they have been accurately and fairly recorded.  It is, to my mind inconceivable that a witness of Dr Harper&#8217;s experience, which I have taken care to set out in some detail above, would not have appreciated this.  Indeed, it strikes me that it would be obvious to any lay party or member of the public.  Moreover, I find the concession in the statement, where mention is made of &#8216;a number of sentences&#8217; is a complete distortion of the reality of the document.  The report is heavy with apparent reference to direct speech when, in truth, almost none of it is.  Thus, the material supporting the ultimate conclusion appears much stronger than it actually is.  Given the forensic experience of Dr Harper and his extremely impressive academic background I cannot accept that he would have failed to appreciate the profound consequences of such distorted reporting.  </p>

I very much regret to say that the purported quotations in that report i.e. presented as if they were the words of the child himself are also nothing of the kind.  Dr Harper used the same approach there.  They are in fact a jumble of phrases extracted from jottings and / or perceived recollection.  Dr Harper voluntarily submitted his notes to scrutiny, they can properly be characterised as minimal.

His evidence may also have shown an overconfidence in his own professional judgment and ability that was indifferent to the correct assessment process.&#8221;</span></p>

The Mother had been led to believe that her meeting with Dr Harper was to provide her with advice on how best to manage the eldest child&#8217;s challenging behaviour.  On Dr Harper&#8217;s account he had decided to change the agenda and look at what he has referred to as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;the inconsistencies of the Mother&#8217;s various narrative accounts&#8217;</span>.  He had, to my mind, settled on the view, for reasons that I will come to below, that this was the key issue in this case.  The undoubtedly discrepant histories of her own childhood and relationships recorded from the Mother are, as Ms Morris QC (on behalf of Dr Harper) describes them, &#8216;polar opposites&#8217; and &#8216;at a 180 degrees to each other&#8217;.  Essentially, there is both a light and benign version of these issues alongside a dark and abusive account.  In any event what is clear is that the Mother finds discussion of both these areas to be highly unsettling and distressing.  That she would do so was anticipated by Dr Harper but nonetheless so important was this issue to him that he forced it through in circumstances which were, in my judgement, insensitive to the Mother.  Of course it follows from this comment that I have accepted his account of the 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April, at least in part.  In fairness I should record that Dr Harper offered the Mother a further appointment which she did not take up.</p>

I simply fail to see how this range of challenging and difficult material could have been covered to the extent that Dr Harper purports in such a limited time.  It would have involved rapid fire question and answer on each topic.  Given the circumstances and the nature of the material, such a process would have also required a degree of brutality or at least gross insensitivity.  The subject matters ranged across e.g. domestic abuse, childhood experiences, sexual issues.   Having listened to Dr Harper in the witness box he does not strike me for a moment as a man capable of such crassness.  His work has been widely respected.  I do consider that there was an enthusiastic effort by him to cover some of the material that day.  I entirely accept his evidence that his notes are genuine and not fabricated, as Ms Lee contends, but I find on the balance of probabilities that some, though not necessarily all, of the material which is not corroborated by the notes was most likely drawn from other sources and incorporated into the report again as if it were direct speech from the Mother to Dr Harper.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is one further issue that requires to be addressed.  Dr Harper recounted in his report that he had completed the Impact of Events Scale Revised Trauma Assessment.  In fact the Mother had disengaged from the start.  The assessment could hardly be said to have been &#8216;completed&#8217;.  This Dr Harper acknowledged.  It is right to say that Dr Harper also goes on to state that the Mother &#8216;would not fully engage in the assessment&#8217; even when its importance was emphasised to her.  That did not wholly accord with his evidence either though I agree with Mr Cohen it is a &#8216;lesser failing&#8217;.  It&#8217;s significance is that it casts some light on how the conventional academic and forensic discipline came to break down here.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The overall impression is of an expert who is overreaching his material, in the sense that whilst much of it is rooted in genuine reliable secure evidence, it is represented in such a way that it is designed to give it its maximum forensic impact.  That involves a manipulation of material which is wholly unacceptable and, at very least, falls far below the standard that any Court is entitled to expect of any expert witness.  It simply cannot be reconciled with those duties which I have pointedly set out above at para 10 and 11.   Moreover, it is manifestly unfair to the Mother, who it should be emphasised is battling to achieve the care of her children whilst trying to manage life with diagnosed PTSD.  Ipso facto this is a case of unique gravity and importance.   Common law principles of fairness and justice demand, as do Articles 6 &amp; 8 of the ECHR, a process in which both the children and the parents can properly participate in a real sense which respects their autonomy.  Dr Harper&#8217;s professional failure here compromised the fairness of the process for both Mother and children.  These are fundamental principles emphasised in <span style="font-weight:bold">Re B-S <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/1146" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 1146" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA (Civ) 1146</ref></span> and <span style="font-weight:bold">Re A <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2015/11" uk:canonical="[2015] EWFC 11" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWFC 11</ref>.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Rowley, on behalf of the Local Authority, submits that Dr Harper&#8217;s central thesis is probably correct.  He summarises it succinctly thus:</p>

		    <p class="ColorfulGrid-Accent11" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">&#8220;Dr Harper&#8217;s concern about the mother&#8217;s inability to provide a consistent narrative about her relationship history and childhood experiences is again objectively valid. It cannot be sensibly argued that the mother has done anything other than provide wildly divergent accounts of such experiences. Whether this is, indeed, impression management or the consequences of her PTSD it robs the psychological professional of a baseline for diagnosis and thus prognosis and treatment recommendations. This makes it, as Dr Harper concludes, difficult (to say the least) for measurement and management of risk.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Rowley may very well be right.  He goes on to suggest that notwithstanding the significant criticisms made of Dr Harper, his report should be allowed to stand, with the Judge who hears the case entitled to give it such weight, if any, as he thinks fit.  I disagree.  These are such fundamental failures of methodology that I do not consider any Judge could fairly rely on the conclusions.   Furthermore, there is an inevitable risk that were I not to order that a new expert be instructed  the Judge might at the conclusion of the hearing find a lacuna in the evidence in consequence of his being unable to rely on Dr Harper&#8217;s opinion.  That would result in further delay for the children in a case where I have been told the final hearing is now unlikely to be effective in any event.  The delay in this case in already unacceptable, the harm caused to the children because of it is the responsibility of the professionals not, I emphasise, the Mother.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I should say that my conclusions here are predicated substantially on my evaluation of Dr Harper&#8217;s evidence and the available written material.   I have found myself unable to place a great deal of weight on the Mother&#8217;s own evidence even where my findings are essentially in her favour.  I agree with Ms Morris, who advances the point sensitively and elegantly, when she says that the issue in the Mother&#8217;s evidence is &#8216;reliability&#8217; not &#8216;credibility&#8217;.  Her reliability is sadly compromised by her inconsistent accounts which may well be, as Dr Harper has postulated, a facet of her psychological distress.
