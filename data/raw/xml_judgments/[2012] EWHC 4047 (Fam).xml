	      <p style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-size:14pt">"There are three main requirements in relation to documents in respect of which it is claimed that they are privileged from production.  First, the documents for which privilege is claimed must be listed in Part 2 of the list.  However, this is to identify the documents: it is not necessary to specify the provenance, makers or the date of such documents.  Form N265 provides that the documents should be listed and numbered.  It is not the usual practice to individually number every document covered by legal professional privilege, although in certain cases this may be the appropriate course, particularly where there is an issue as to whether privilege is being properly claimed.</span></p>

Thirdly, the ground of privilege and the grounds giving rise to the claim for privilege must be clearly stated.  In particular, the wording must not be so wide that it is impossible to be sure it contains no description of documents which came into existence in circumstances not attracting privilege.  It is not enough to state that the documents are privileged; the factual basis of the grounds giving rise to that claim must be set out".  </span></p>

I, like Mr. Justice Kwan, am not persuaded by that argument.  In my view the footnote in the </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt">White Book</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> and the structure of the Civil Procedure Rules demonstrate why.  The footnote specifically refers to it being sufficient for documents in respect of which privilege is claimed to be identified by, and I repeat, the following descriptive example:  'Correspondence between the defendant and his solicitors for the purposes of obtaining legal advice'.   I do not, in general terms, consider that the direction which is sought by the wife is dissimilar in its scope to that broad example.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">What I propose to order is that the first respondent shall list the documents which fall within the category of communications as set out in the letter of 8</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> August, 2011.  I make it clear - and the wording of the order will have to reflect this - that the communications can be listed by category - so, for example, communications passing between the husband and any of the named companies identified in the letter - with the dates within which those communications were made.   So far as the nature of the communication is concerned, in my view the claim for privilege should, in essence, follow the practice as set out in the CPR so that insofar as a claim for privilege is made in respect of any document or class of documents, or a part of a document, then it must be stated in writing that there is such a right and the grounds on which that right is claimed.  The grounds on which the right is claimed must be sufficient to enable the wife to determine whether the right might, or can, be challenged.  I specifically do not propose to set out in my order the information required to enable that to be sufficiently stated.  I do not include within the order a requirement to show the writer's analysis and/or the purpose for which the documents were created.   I simply require, as I say, sufficient elaboration of the grounds to enable the wife, as advised, to determine whether or not the claim for privilege should, or can, be challenged.</span></p>
