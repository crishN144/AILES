	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This appeal concerns transparency in committal proceedings in the Court of Protection. The Appellant is Dr Philip Esper who is the Defendant in committal proceedings in the Court of Protection in which his relative, AB, is the protected party. During the course of the Court of Protection proceedings the Court made an order restricting the Appellant&#8217;s contact with AB and attached a penal notice to that order. The Respondent to this appeal made an application to commit the Appellant to prison for contempt of court by way of breaches of the order restricting contact. The Appellant admitted three such breaches and on 1 March 2023 the Court recorded findings of contempt of court. On 7 June 2023 DJ Beckley decided that no sanction should be imposed for the contempt of court. The transcript of his judgment shows that the reasons he gave for not imposing a penalty were,</p>

There is no challenge to the decision to hear the contempt proceedings in public. Furthermore, there is no appeal against DJ Beckley&#8217;s refusal to recuse himself after a recusal application was made on 7 June 2023 on behalf of the Appellant. In his skeleton argument for the appeal, Mr O&#8217;Brien on behalf of the Appellant states that the appeal is brought against DJ Beckley&#8217;s decisions:</p>

That order remains in force. However, as is standard form, the Transparency Order expressly excludes any committal proceedings from its ambit. In the current committal proceedings, DJ Beckley has made a further order which applies to the committal proceedings, and which prevents the reporting of the names and some other specific details of AB and two of his relatives identified in his order, but which he did not extend to prevent the identification of Dr Esper. That decision not to prevent the disclosure of Dr Esper&#8217;s identity is the decision central to this appeal.</p>

Previously, there were differences between the sets of rules but the Lord Chief Justice's Practice Direction: Committal for Contempt of Court - Open Court, March 2015 (PD 2015) covered all committal proceedings to which those sets of rules applied.  Examination of the transparency provisions within the relevant rules and practice directions during this appeal has revealed some anomalies and inconsistencies:</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In <span style="font-style:italic">Sunderland City Council v Macpherson</span> (above) I wrestled with trying to reconcile PD 2015 with the new COPR r21.8. There is an apparent conflict between the mandatory requirement in PD 2015 paragraph 13 that a defendant who has committed a contempt of court must be named and their name published, and COPR r21.8(5) which requires the court not to disclose the identity of a party (which would include a defendant) if the two tests of necessity within that rule are met. In <span style="font-style:italic">EBK</span> (above) Mostyn J held that &#8220;if a defendant in proceedings governed by FPR Part 37 or COPR Part 21 is found to have committed a contempt then that defendant must be named in open court&#8221; [101]. He rested his conclusion on the mandatory nature of the wording of PD 2015 paragraph 13. At [100] he noted that this obligation will arise once the defendant has been found guilty of contempt. Before then, in the Court of Protection, the court may afford the defendant anonymity by applying COPR r21.8(5) and considering the balance of Art 8 and Art 10 rights.</p>

Further, in relation to defendants who have been found in contempt of court, I do not agree that PD 2015 takes precedence over the COPR Part 21 such that publication of the name of the defendant is mandatory even if the necessity conditions of COPR r21.8(5) are met. In my view, where they are incompatible, COPR r21.8(5) prevails over PD 2015. COPR r21.8(5) applies to all parties and witnesses in committal proceedings in the Court of Protection, and at all stages &#8211; before and after any findings of contempt and/or the making of any committal order. I shall seek to explain those conclusions in the following paragraphs.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">PD 2015 paragraph 13 refers to two different stages of contempt proceedings: (i) a finding that a person has committed a contempt of court, and (ii) the making of a committal order. As set out above, the COPR (in line with the CPR and FPR) make it clear that a committal order is the passing of an immediate or suspended sentence of imprisonment. As in the present case, a defendant might be found to have committed a contempt of court but not be made subject to a committal order. PD 2015 Paragraph 13(1) sets out what the court must do in all cases where it &#8220;finds that a person has committed a contempt of court.&#8221; The first requirement is for the court to state in public the name of the defendant. The second is to state in public the nature of the contempt &#8220;in respect of which the committal order &#8230; is being made.&#8221; That would not appear to apply where no committal order has been made. The third is to state publicly &#8220;the punishment being imposed&#8221;. If there is no punishment being imposed, then there is no punishment to pronounce publicly. The fourth is to provide the details referred to in the first three requirements to the media and for publication on the judiciary website. </p>

Do the first and fourth requirements of 13(1) of the Practice Direction apply even to a defendant found to have been in contempt but against whom no committal order is made? If so, then their name must be given in open court, provided to the media and published on the judiciary website. On the face of it, PD 2015 paragraph 13(1) does apply to all defendants found to have been in contempt, but Mr O&#8217;Brien contends that, read as a whole, PD 2015 does not require the court to state publicly, and publish, the name of a contemnor who has not received a committal order. </p>

As to the apparent internal inconsistency within PD 2015 (see paragraph 17 above), I am satisfied that, without straining the meaning of the words, it is possible to read paragraph 13 as imposing the requirements to name the defendant in public and to publish their name when they have been found to be in contempt of court, whether or not they have been made subject to a committal order. The explanation in paragraph 13(2) underlines that the court should never withhold the name of a defendant it has made subject to a committal order, but it does not follow that the first and fourth requirements of paragraph 13(1) do not apply when no committal order is made. I reject Mr O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s submission to the contrary. However, the resolution of the internal inconsistency does not resolve the external inconsistency between PD 2015 paragraph 13 and COPR r21.8(5).</p>

As Mr Tankel for the Respondent ICB has observed, paradoxically at a time when there were different regimes for transparency within committal proceedings under the CPR, the FPR, and the COPR, PD 2015 treated them as if they were the same. Now that the three sets of rules are the same, the amended PD 2015 implies that they are different.</p>

The rule was introduced in the full knowledge of PD 2015 and should be taken to modify or override it where they are incompatible. Furthermore, the new COPR Part 21 was introduced by statutory instrument with the express intention of achieving consistency with CPR Part 81 and the FPR Part 37. To give precedence to PD 2015 would be to undermine that intention. Accordingly, the conflict between COPR r21.8(5) and PD 2015 must be resolved by giving precedence to the COPR.

Insofar as PD 2015 indicates that there is no power to order non-disclosure of the defendant&#8217;s name, it should yield to COPR r21.8(5) which requires non-disclosure of the defendant&#8217;s name if and only if the two tests of necessity set out in that rule are met.

This is the reason it is so important not to forget why proceedings are required to be subjected to the full glare of a public hearing. It is necessary because the public nature of the proceedings deters inappropriate behaviour on the part of the court. It also maintains the public's confidence in the administration of justice. It enables the public to know that justice is being administered impartially. It can result in evidence becoming available which would not become available if the proceedings were conducted &#8230; with one or more of the parties' or witnesses' identity concealed.

There will be an even greater importance in ensuring freedom of expression about proceedings concerning conduct in contempt of court. There would be less importance given to protecting the private life of a person whose conduct has been in contempt of court. Those made subject to court orders with penal orders attached have been warned that they may be sent to prison if they breach those orders. They must be taken to know that the courts pass sentences of imprisonment in public (or do so save in the most exceptional circumstances) and so if a court sentences a contemnor to prison (whether an immediate or suspended sentence) their names will be made public. It would be going too far to say that they have waived any right to a private or family life by being in contempt of court, but their claim to protection of their anonymity is very much weakened. </p>

Hence, if, and only if, the tests within r 21.8(5) are met, the court will order the non-disclosure of the identity of a party or witness. If so, the court can make ancillary orders to protect their identities from being disclosed, as permitted by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49" uk:canonical="1981 c. 49" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Contempt of Court Act 1981</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s11</ref>.

What may be necessary before a finding of contempt, might not be necessary after such a finding has been made. At each committal hearing the court will have to consider whether any r21.8(5) orders must be continued &#8211; do the two necessity tests continue to apply?

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">An issue of importance arises in respect of the listing of committal proceedings and the reporting of public lists. Whether or not the committal hearing is listed in public or in private, PD 2015 requires the full name of the defendant to appear on the list. As Professor Kitzinger informed the court, the Open Justice project routinely reproduces the public court lists of COP cases on its web page or via Twitter. Thus, the names of defendants to committal proceedings in the Court of Protection will be published and then re-produced online prior even to the first time a judge hears the case. Accordingly, were a judge to determine that COPR r21.8(5) did require an order for the non-disclosure of the defendant, it may well be too late if Open Justice, or any other person, has published the court list. Furthermore, applying <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s12</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref>, the fact of publication of the defendant&#8217;s as it has appeared on the list, would be a matter that ought to be taken into account when deciding whether to order a derogation from the principle of open justice.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Given that PD 2015 should yield to COPR r21.8(5), my view is that COPR r21.8(5) must allow the Court of Protection to make a non-disclosure order regarding the identity of the defendant or any party or witness in committal proceedings in the Court of Protection, even before the first hearing, and regardless of the mandatory terms of paragraph 13 of PD 2015.  Hence, ancillary directions may be given at the same time, under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s11</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49" uk:canonical="1981 c. 49" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Contempt of Court Act 1981</ref>.  If the tests under COPR r21.8(5) are met then the court must order the non-disclosure of the defendant&#8217;s name in the court list, notwithstanding the mandatory terms of paragraphs 5 and 11 of PD 2015 to the contrary. Not only should the court rules take precedence over the practice direction, but it is necessary in order to give effect to the overriding objective to interpret COPR r21.8(5) as allowing the court to order the non-disclosure of the defendant&#8217;s name in the court list. If not, then by the time the court comes to consider the application of COPR r21.8(5) at the first hearing, the horse will have already bolted.</p>

In the absence of any order to the contrary, the defendant&#8217;s full name must appear in the list. Court listing offices need to be fully aware of that requirement. However, if the court is satisfied that the necessity tests in r21.8(5) are met, then it must direct that the defendant&#8217;s name shall be anonymised in the court list. The press should be notified and may make representations at the first hearing.</p>

COP PD 4A only applies if a hearing in public is the result of a court order under COP R r4.3 and so does not apply to committal hearings which are heard in public unless otherwise ordered. The court in committal proceedings in the Court of Protection cannot therefore rely on an existing Transparency Order or use COP PD 4A to restrict reporting. COPR r21.8(5) appears to be the only basis for ordering non-disclosure of the identity of the defendant, other party, or witness in a committal application. It applies at all stages of a committal application in the Court of Protection.  If the court is considering making a r21.8(5) order, other than in relation to the anonymisation of the defendant in the public list for the first hearing, it should adopt the procedure at paragraphs 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 12 of PD 2015.</p>

These rules apply when proceedings, including contempt proceedings, have been heard in private. Committal proceedings will almost always be held in public, for reasons discussed in this judgment. However, contempt proceedings may be heard in private (provided the relevant parts of PD 2015 and COPR r21.8 are followed) in which case the court must then comply with both COPR r4.2 and r21.8(5) in relation to the non-disclosure of the identity of a party or witness. If so, then COPR r 4.2 is more widely drawn than 21.8(5) and the point I was seeking to make in <span style="font-style:italic">Macpherson</span> was that in contempt proceedings held in private, COPR r21.8(5) circumscribes the court&#8217;s powers under COPR r4.2. </p>

Perhaps I did not express myself sufficiently clearly because at [98] of <span style="font-style:italic">EBK </span>Mostyn J reached a different but equally wrong conclusion about [38] of my judgment.  I did not conclude that COPR r21.8(5) could not apply to a defendant in committal proceedings as Mr O&#8217;Brien submits, nor did I doubt that it could apply to protect the interests of P, as Mostyn J supposed. Rather, the issue I sought to raise was that COPR r21.8(5) only allows the court to order the non-disclosure of the identity of a party or witness in order to protect the interests of that party or witness. So, as I said at [38], COPR r21.8(5) &#8220;does not appear to allow the court to restrict the disclosure of the identity of the Defendant if necessary to secure the administration of justice and to protect the interest of P.&#8221; It would allow the restriction of disclosure of the defendant&#8217;s identity if necessary to secure the administration of justice and to protect the interests of the defendant. It would allow anonymity to be afforded to P if necessary to secure the administration of justice and to protect the interests of P. But a defendant cannot contend that he should be afforded anonymity in order to protect the interests of P. The person afforded anonymity must be the person whose interests are being protected.</p>

As I have explained earlier, COPR r21.8(11) requires the court to give a judgment in committal proceedings in public but, where no committal order has been made, that judgment does not have to be published on the judiciary website.  As I have explained in detail above, COPR r21.8(5) required the Judge to order the non-disclosure of Dr Esper&#8217;s identity if and only if the two necessity tests in that rule were met. It was not for the Judge to exercise a discretion to permit or prevent Dr Esper&#8217;s identity being disclosed &#8211; his identity would be disclosed unless those tests were met, in which case the court was obliged to order that it should not be disclosed.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Judge examined the circumstances of the case and determined that COPR r21.8(5) did not apply to require the non-disclosure of Dr Esper&#8217;s name. He took into account that Dr Esper had been found guilty of contempt of court but had not been made subject to a committal order. The Judge had a detailed knowledge of the proceedings in the Court of Protection. As he had noted at the hearing on 1 March 2023, a transcript of which I also have, the contact arrangements had taken a long time to conclude and were of great importance in protecting AB&#8217;s best interests given the very difficult history of the case. The breaches by Dr Esper were not inconsequential. He had previously entered AB&#8217;s room when he ought not to have done and, DJ Beckley records, there had been serious consequences. The breaches did amount to contempt of court and they were, DJ Beckley found, deliberate and serious. The reasons he did not proceed to make a committal order were as set out above and were to do with the perceived absence of any purpose in passing a prison sentence in all the circumstances, including the time that had elapsed since the breaches had taken place.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">DJ Beckley identified the correct rule, COPR r21.8(5) and applied the correct first test under that rule. Both tests have to be met in order for there to be a non-disclosure order. There is no doubt that DJ Beckley was entitled in the circumstances to find that the first test in COPR r21.8(5) was not met and therefore that the order should not be made. Indeed, it would have been extremely surprising had he found that one or both tests were met. In the circumstances, he could not order the non-disclosure of Dr Esper&#8217;s identity. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">DJ Beckley rightly gave a reasoned judgment in public, albeit a short one. He was not required to publish a transcript of the judgment on the judiciary website, but he was free to do so in his discretion. Upon doing so he was required to disclose the identity of the Defendant for the reasons already given. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second decision that is challenged is the decision to permit the publication of Dr Esper&#8217;s name while restricting the identification of AB, and two other relatives of AB who are respondents in the Court of Protection proceedings. It is suggested by the way the challenge is mounted in this appeal, that DJ Beckley was inconsistent by deciding to direct that the names of AB&#8217;s other relatives, who were regarded as parties to the committal proceedings, should not be named. There is no appeal against DJ Beckley&#8217;s orders in respect to the non-disclosure of the identities of those persons, or of AB. For the reasons set out above, the considerations for the court when deciding whether the two necessity tests in COPR r21.8(5) are met in respect of parties other than the defendant, or witnesses, will be different from those that apply to the defendant. There is no logical inconsistency in the decisions made by DJ Beckley. Again, it would have been surprising if he had not found that the tests were not met in respect to AB, and he was clearly entitled to find that they were met in relation to AB&#8217;s relatives other than the Defendant. Grounds 2 and 3(a) are not made out.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, I shall briefly address the appellant&#8217;s case that DJ Beckley conducted the proceedings and his decision-making unfairly having refused to recuse himself as the Appellant had invited him to do. There is no appeal against the non-recusal decision and I proceed on the basis that it was the correct decision to make. Indeed, having read the transcript of the proceedings on 7 June 2023 as well as the judgment, I am quite satisfied that DJ Beckley was perfectly right not to recuse himself. Having made that decision, it is problematic for the Appellant to suggest that in some way the Judge was biased against him or unfair in his decision-making regarding anonymity. In any event, the transcript shows no sign of judicial animosity or ongoing ill-will to the Defendant. Ground 3(b) is not made out.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">DJ Beckley expressly permitted reporting of Dr Esper&#8217;s age and profession. For the reasons already given, DJ Beckley was right to not to make an order for the non-disclosure of Dr Esper&#8217;s identity under COPR r21.8(5). However, where a COPR r21.8(5) order is made directing the non-disclosure of the identity of P, it might be possible to make ancillary directions under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s11</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49" uk:canonical="1981 c. 49" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Contempt of Court Act 1981</ref> preventing the reporting of identifying features in order to protect the identity of P. Here, the Defendant&#8217;s profession might be information that could lead to AB&#8217;s identification but, on the other hand, his profession is a matter of public interest. Having decided that Dr Esper should be named, it seems to me that the judge was entitled to decide that it was not necessary to protect AB to restrict the reporting of Dr Esper&#8217;s profession. Disclosure of Dr Esper&#8217;s age would not be likely to lead to the identification of AB. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do regard the appeal herein as giving rise to an important point in relation to interpretation of the COPR and PD 2015. Accordingly, I give permission to appeal on the grounds that there is a compelling reason that the appeal be heard. However, given the tests to be applied on an appeal of this kind, I have no hesitation in dismissing the appeal. The Judge&#8217;s decisions were ones he was entitled to make, indeed it was not open to him to make an order for non-disclosure of Dr Esper&#8217;s identity given the strict tests of necessity under COPR r21.8(5) and the fundamental importance of open justice, including in relation to committal proceedings. I therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>
