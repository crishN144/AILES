The applicant local authority argue that his family cannot meet his needs to a good enough standard and that he must sadly be separated from them under care and placement orders which plan a future adoption. His family do not agree with this suggestion. His mother, [the Mother], argues that she can care for him whether immediately or possibly following a further process of updated assessment. His father, [the Father], accepts that he is not placed to care for [the Child] within his timescales but wants to remain part of his life and supports either [the Mother] or his own mother as carers for [the Child]. [the PGM] is [the Father]&#8217;s mother. She would support [the Mother] to be the main carer for [the Child] but would offer herself as an alternative special guardian if this were not possible. [the Child]&#8217;s guardian has reached the conclusion that [the Child]&#8217;s needs can only be met in the manner suggested by the applicant. She supports the application for care and placement orders.</span></p>

They love him very much and want the very best for him. I have found them to be entirely genuine in their motivations and their desire to keep him within his family. At no point in my assessment did I doubt this to be the case. I was very impressed by their commitment to him and the manner in which they engaged with, what must have been a very challenging final hearing, given their respective histories and the issues which were being considered. They were throughout polite and courteous to all and in their evidence demonstrated the love and commitment I have referred to above. That they could maintain this level of composure and engagement in such circumstances was a real credit to each of them.</span></p>

I heard evidence from the allocated social worker, an independent social worker who assessed both [the Mother] and [the Father] and from a special guardianship assessor who carried out the assessment of [the PGM]. I also heard evidence from [the Mother], [the Father] and [the PGM] and also from [the MGM] who is [the Mother]&#8217;s mother. Lastly, I heard from [the Child]&#8217;s guardian. I also received final submissions from counsel for each of the parties. The case was always listed on the basis that judgment would have to be reserved (I sense to avoid delay in finding a listing which could additionally accommodate the same) and this is my judgment. In addition to the above I have also had regard to the documents contained within the final hearing bundle and to some additional but limited documents relied upon by the parties but not found within the bundle. The bundle is over 2000 pages in length. I will not be referring to every document placed before me or every piece of evidence given to me within this judgment. Rather I will highlight the key evidence that has led me to the conclusions I have reached. I have though born in mind all of the evidence in reaching my conclusions. I do not intend to weigh this judgment down with a detailed account of the proceedings. I will refer to aspects of this in my background summary below. However, I bear in mind those documents found within section B of the bundle.</span></p>

Her parents separated when she was aged three and post separation both her father and brother sexually abused her. Her home life with her mother was &#8216;chaotic with lots of drama&#8217; and her mother appears not to have been physically and emotionally available as might be expected. [the Mother] describes a feeling of not being loved as a child. It appears her father had his own issues with drink and/or drugs and was sexually abusive both to [the Mother] and to the brother referenced above. The sexual abuse continued from age 5/6 through to age 13 when her mother had a breakdown and [the Mother] was placed into care. She remained in care until 18 although there were periods of absconding. After being removed [the Mother] experienced some improvement in her relationship with her mother but this has been quite variable with significant periods of further breakdown in the relationship.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">[the Mother] has used cannabis since she was aged about 16 and has relied upon this to manage her emotions. She was still using cannabis at the time of [the Child]&#8217;s birth and there are various hair strand test results within the papers. She now claims to be abstinent although this is a relatively new development within the last month or so. [the Mother] records drinking alcohol on a daily basis between 16 and 19 at a relatively high level. [the Mother] accepts she has poor mental health and fundamentally accepts the report of Dr Shaun Parsons in which he concludes [the Mother] has a number of significant personality difficulties with emotionally unstable and impulsive sensation-seeking personality traits. Alongside this she shows a severely insecure adult attachment style with elements of both anxious avoidant and anxious dependent attachments structures. At initial assessment he noted [the Mother] was experiencing a period of relative stability within a residential unit (the Orchards) but he was concerned that once in an uncontrolled environment she would like return to being a highly emotionally inconsistent parent preoccupied with the high levels of emotional distress and loneliness that she feels. The expert was concerned that [the Mother]&#8217;s had a tendency to prioritise a relationship with a partner over the need to be self-protective as to her own welfare or that of a child in her care and that this might create additional risks into the future.  His conclusions flowing from this was that she posed a significant risk of neglect and emotional harm to a child in her care and a further risk of significant harm by exposing a child to and failing to protect a child from a risky partner. He recommended as essential a process of therapy with a focus on addressing child-based trauma. This would include both CBT and EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing Therapy). In follow up questions he expressed the view that this work might be capable of being undertaken whilst caring for [the Child] and whilst in a structured and controlled environment such as the Orchards. However, it would be a concern for the work to commence in the community whilst caring for [the Child] as there would be a risk of emotional harm to him as the mother was seeking to engage with the stress of the therapy. There was also the additional risk of poor engagement with the therapy were this to be the case.</span></p>

As detailed to the ISW his childhood involved physical abuse at the hands of his father and a sense of not being afforded the same affection as given to his sister. He recounted significant emotional dysregulation through childhood which involved screaming and having to be restrained. His anger increased as he progressed into his teenage years with uncontrollable outbursts and occasions when he would forget what had happened. He would break things and fought with his siblings and on occasion hit his mother. He left home aged 22 but has shown a tendency to rebound to the family home on a regular basis. During these proceedings he has both left and returned to live with his mother and siblings. [the Father] reporting regular drinking from age 13 to about 17 at a high level. He has smoked cannabis since age 13/14 although he has recently reduced the level of consumption. He can recognise that his anger and anxiety improve when he reduces his consumption.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">Dr Parsons also met with [the Father]. He noted there had been improvements in [the Father]&#8217;s emotional regulation and attention with consequent reduction in impulsivity. However, he continued to have significant unstable personality traits and remained vulnerable to acting in ways that are damaging both to himself and others without considering the potential for such harm. When stressed or tired he continued to be at risk of emotional dysregulation which may be associated with verbal aggression and acting out behaviours.

He is likely to remain an inconsistent parent due to these characteristics but there have been improvements in this regard. He is at moderate/high risk of engaging in verbal aggression and potentially abusive behaviour with the obvious emotional/physical risks for any child in his care.

He was paranoid about [the Mother] cheating on him. After separating from [the Mother], he formed a relationship with one of her friends but this was equally problematic as she flirted with other men and cheated on him.</span></p>

Whilst there was evidence of positive engagement there was also long standing poor mental health and trauma which was only just starting to be addressed. Change had to be established and sustained to give appropriate confidence. This was not about basic caring skills but about the impact on [the Mother] when her mental health deteriorates. The improved relationship with [the MGM] was noted but this was comparatively early days in that regard. At the time of the assessment the relationship was &#8216;rocky&#8217; and she was avoiding her mother. At that time, she had relapsed and was using cannabis again. She had re-established a relationship with a friend who was felt to pose risks to [the Mother]. The realistic timelines if a decision was not made now would likely be years not months and would be under a care order with uncertainty as to outcome. [the Mother]&#8217;s mental health has been seen to improve in a nurturing environment. But it has also been seen to rapidly deteriorate when [the Mother] was subjected to a more independent environment. Matters might be different if we were at the end of the therapeutic journey with a period of sustained stability but that was not where we are.</span></p>

This suggested a further 6/7 months of work before one would be considering a further assessment. Allowing for this and further evidence one would be delaying matters for a year. This was not about a parenting assessment as basic care is not really in issue. It would be more about a psychological update in the light of sustained change post therapy.</span></p>

[the Mother] needed to show she could live independently and not resort to inappropriate coping strategies or return to negative relationships. There needed to be a demonstrated maintenance of stability. Cannabis abstinence needed to be evidenced over a sustained period. Ultimately [the Mother] was not able to do it when care stepped down at Serenity House and as a result care at a 24/7 level had to be reinstated.

Whilst therapy could be supported by [the Mother]&#8217;s mother and brother it was clear there was no certain outcome to this process. This is a case with a multiplicity of issues including child trauma and it is known this can be very difficult with a risk of disengagement. In February the mother made it very clear she was struggling when meeting with the ISW. The current therapy is easing the mother into more difficult territory. We need confidence as to a stable placement but what we have doesn&#8217;t give us this confidence. The relationship with [the MGM] was previously non-existent. This is too high risk. It could work for a limited period but then fall apart leaving us back at square one. If the current progress suggested a positive outcome within [the Child]&#8217;s timescales, then she would support this. But it sadly does not.</span></p>

The key issues in this case are not about parenting per se but rather as to the stabilisation of a number of key issues which unresolved impact on parenting. Properly addressed and established on a sustained basis they would remove the need for further parenting assessment. If not established and sustained they will mean there is no purpose in a parenting assessment. This means the C2 raised by [the Mother] is now focused on the need for a further psychological assessment. I am unclear why it is proposed this be undertaken by a psychologist new to the case. In my judgment, if available and if ordered, this should be in the form of an update piece of work from Dr Parsons. There is no sense and good reason not to import a new expert Into the case. That being said I am willing to assume Dr Parsons would be available to report within a similar time frame to the other named clinicians (being around 4 weeks after a letter of instruction).</span></p>

Rather such an assessment should await the conclusion of the CBT and be timetabled no earlier than a point at which it was judged one can form a view as to the benefits that had been gained from EMDR. I do not have clarity in this regard but judge this would likely be no earlier than half way through the process and might be after the conclusion of the same. It would only be at that point that a proper assessment of progress, engagement and prognosis/sustainability could be obtained.

I have allowed for a short period of reflection between the conclusion of the CBT and commencement of EMDR. Although the applicant have agreed funding of the latter in principle, they will want some update from the therapist before moving to the next stage at least. It may the therapist would recommend a short period to breath between courses. One would then have to factor in the timetable for the updating assessment which might add a further 4 weeks to this timetable and additionally updating final evidence (to include a revised ADM decision if appropriate) from all parties. My best assessment is that this would lead to the earliest date for a resolution hearing being between 30-34 weeks from today (whether this is an effective EFH at which final orders are agreed or a final hearing determining a contested case). The reality which cannot be ignored is that the adjournment application is likely to delay a final outcome in this case by about 8 months or so.</span></p>

But we do not know how [the Mother] will respond when the challenges of therapy increase and the issues she is asked to confront develop. [the Mother]&#8217;s circumstances are complex as described by Dr Parsons and her outcomes are not assisted by there being a multiplicity of issues requiring consideration (drug use, poor mental health, childhood trauma, sexual abuse, domestic violence). I am confident [the Mother] understands the nature of this challenge but it is such as to cause the court to be cautious in in evaluation of prospects of success. At this time, I consider the best that can be said is that there are some important seeds of optimism. [the Mother] has worked hard and built an important relationship with the therapist. She is committed and motivated and she is trying hard in respect of supporting features (her drug use and improvement in relationships). However, it will be over the next 6 months that we discover whether she can maintain such progress to a successful outcome. The true test of success may likely be in the period of a year or so after as you moves on to apply the strategies and skills she may have developed.

Dr Parsons recommended the same in September 2022 but this was delayed until February 2023. It is argued that but for this delay the court might be closer to the conclusion of such work and thus better placed to gauge [the Mother]&#8217;s position. There is obvious force in this contention. However, I must acknowledge that there is no obligation on the applicant to provide such therapy. Local Authority budgets are strained and it is frankly relatively rare for authorities to fund therapy during proceedings. Viewed in this way the decision to fund support and continue the same deserves credit. But one must also reflect on the duty upon parents to proactively seek support. This is of course challenging and many parents can find it very difficult to obtain such support through the NHS. Yet it was as long ago as February 2018 that Dr Parsons in previous proceedings identified the need for the work now being undertaken. There has been 5 years in which to pursue this work. Sadly, in that time [the Mother] continued her use of cannabis, maintained an abusive relationship with [the Father] and fell pregnant for a second time. This decision making was in the light of the available evidence. There is therefore a balance of competing views to be borne in mind.</span></p>

Notwithstanding the positive drug tests to date I consider there is room for her case as to not using in the units to be a truthful one. There is plainly a difficulty in being overly forensic with such results when the same are based on periods of a month in time and apply average hair growth rates. I found [the Mother]&#8217;s evidence persuasive in this regard and the evidence of some success in the Orchards supports her contention. As to Serenity House, [the Mother] came to be under increasing observation and I am not satisfied the evidence demonstrates she was using during that time. I am also willing to accept she has recently stopped using. On the evidence this is since early July. It is a period of about a month. This is not a sufficient period to draw any firm conclusions given the long-standing dependence and her previous relapse after a sustained period of abstinence, but it is positive and she deserves credit for this. But these are early days. I am somewhat cautious as to the evidence of relative ease in stopping. The reality is that there will likely come a point when [the Mother] is significantly challenged by her surrounding circumstances and it will be at that time that her commitment to abstinence will be proven. In my assessment there would be real value to a successful test at the end of the therapeutic journey. This would provide meaningful evidence of her capacity to deal with challenging circumstances without seeking to self-sooth by using cannabis. So, I give her credit but I consider it is very early days to draw any meaningful longer-term conclusions in this regard.</span></p>

In my assessment it flies in the face of the guidance of Dr Parsons. He plainly felt one needed to approach this issue with caution and argued for this to only happen when there was a structured, and it seems to me professional support, around [the Mother]. This advice, as with much of Dr Parsons views in this case has been shown to be correct with hindsight. One can see from Serenity House how the step-down process was too much for [the Mother] and matters quickly deteriorated. I do not see how one could safely conclude that [the Mother] would be better placed at home with her mother and caring for [the Child] whilst she entered the more challenging stages of her therapy. I consider the risks of the same are too high to consider. Living at home [the Mother] needs to be entirely focused on her own improvement. Furthermore, I do not judge the evidence supports the notion of [the MGM] being a sufficient support during this period. Whilst matters might be different coming out of therapy, what she can offer is plainly limited where [the Mother] is expected to progress her therapy, maintain abstinence and care for [the Child]. In reaching this conclusion I have regard to the evidence, which I accept, of [the Child] being a highly active child with current sleep issues and potentially requiring attuned parenting. Whilst in the process of therapy [the Mother] needs to be primarily attuned to her own needs.</span></p>

It is therefore concerning that these four adults in the home could not jointly make efforts to create a presentable environment for assessment. Their failure to do so suggests they have each in their own ways been focused on their own needs and not on the bigger picture. It is important to remember that these adults are not in their early 20&#8217;s. The &#8216;children&#8217; are all well into adulthood with all being in their 30&#8217;s or 40&#8217;s.</span></p>

There is a high likelihood that any property found may be temporary in nature and may be of poor quality. There is the potential for similar issues to arise as occurred in Croydon leading to his rebounding into his mother&#8217;s home. Having reviewed all the evidence, I have real reservations as to how the occupation of the property will in fact be managed in time to come. There is good evidence of [the PGM] feeling emotionally committed to offering a home to all of her children as they have needed it. It is clear that whilst she has expressed an intention to require [the Father] to leave, she does not accept the risks are at the level suggested by the applicant. The reality is that this loyalty to her children has obvious positive elements to it. But this case concerns [the Child] and I am considering the potential for his needs to be prioritised.

She told me she would tell the applicant and [the Child] could be placed into foster care. In my assessment this would be a disaster for [the Child] having spent so long within these proceedings.</span></p>

It runs the very high likelihood of severing his relationship with his mother, father and wider family. He is currently benefitting from these relationships via contact and the ending of the same will be detrimental to him. However, this impact is not purely in the here and now. The Court also has to reflect on the longer-term implications for [the Child] as he comes to understand and digest the reality of his adopted life. This will likely bring some level of emotional baggage including some contemplation over why he was adopted and what this might suggest (wrongly of course) as to his parents wish to care for him. He is also likely to speculate as to what biological family life would have meant for him and what he has given up. Current social media life means discovering one&#8217;s family connections is much easier than it once was. There is the risk of investigation and unmanaged disclosure of information. The central concern is that [the Child] will embed a sense of loss as to what might have been. This has the potential to undermine any placement and disrupt his future life. I recognise this will be a challenge for any adoptive carer. I am entitled to assume such carers will enter this situation with their eyes open and given this may be better placed to address these issues in a considered fashion than rather than in a wholly responsive manner. This at least increases the prospects of the issues not becoming overly destabilising.</span></p>

The risks out of this relate to the detailed matters set out above. The parents&#8217; dysfunctional relationship; their drug use; their challenging upbringings and resultant disrupted mental health. In this analysis I have highlighted that certain aspects of the above are less prevalent on the current information whereas others remain to be resolved. But on the evidence before me it is clear that risks remain. It is not clear to me this is actively in dispute. The risks remain whilst [the Mother] progresses her therapy. Risks arise out of unmanaged time with her father whilst his anger management issues are not resolved. Risks remain should [the Mother] be caring for [the Child] and her mental health deteriorates or she relapses as to cannabis use. This will leave her unfocused on [the Child] and at risk of falling into a cycle of poor mental health and problematic coping strategies as identified by Dr Parsons. A separate risk relates to the possibility of [the Child] returning to the care of his family only for that to then fracture and for him to have to return into care. As I have noted above this would be very damaging for [the Child] and wholly contradictory to his welfare. Such a process of return to care may remove any opportunity [the Child] has for establishing permanence within his childhood. In my judgment a secure placement is imperative.</span></p>

Clearly, [the Child] has a range of family members ([the Mother], [the Father], [the PGM] and [the MGM]) who have appeared before me and strongly resist the notion of him being adopted. These relationships, particularly [the Mother] and [the Father]&#8217;s, have value for [the Child] and absent placement have real prospects of continuing. This is not a case in which one has reasonable doubt as to the commitment of family members to the child in question. My sense of the family is that each and all would continue to commit to [the Child] through contact. However, there is a distinction to be drawn between all family members and those that can provide a home for [the Child] in which he can develop.

It would plainly benefit from being the least interventionist option. I fully appreciate [the Mother] is open to any form of support and so I also note her willingness to accept local authority continuing involvement. Having heard [the Mother] give evidence and having heard from those who have engaged with her I consider it likely she would be open to social work intervention. She does not take a confrontational approach and appears to me to be willing to work with professionals &#8211; see her relationship with the therapist.

The risk arising out of the same is that [the Mother]&#8217;s mental health will deteriorate and she will become emotionally unavailable for [the Child] on a consistent basis.

An additional benefit is that [the PGM] does not have the same challenges faced by [the Mother]. Her mental health is settled and whilst she smokes, she does not have an illicit drug dependency.

The applicant references her age ([the PGM] is 62) and what this may say about her ability to meet [the Child]&#8217;s needs throughout his childhood.

The timetable for such a process is well outside of [the Child]&#8217;s needs. I remind myself he has already been in proceedings for over 13 months and I judge [the Mother]&#8217;s option would not be in a position to be properly assessed within 2 years of the case commencing. This is outside of [the Child]&#8217;s timescales as found above. It is further complicated by the real lack of any certainty as to how things will progress. There are some grounds for optimism but the position is highly uncertain. Any consideration of delay of this nature would have to have a high level of justification for it to be accepted. I do not find that to be the case on the assessment above. The next 6 months will be increasingly challenging and it remains to be seen how the placement with her mother and her abstinence from drugs hold up in the face of such challenges. The court regularly receives expert guidance as to the need for sustained abstinent in cases of long-term dependency. A period of around 1-month is at the earliest stages of progress.</span></p>

It is clear to me that she is very much conflicted as to her responsibility to her children and her duties to [the Child]. History is a good predictor of future action and [the PGM] has shown an inability (or over willingness) to allow her home to act as a sanctuary for all her children notwithstanding the impact this has had on the state of the home and on the assessment carried out. I consider this betrays a deeper difficulty in accepting that her children have to independently manage their own lives. For her to have three adult children living in the property and two either sleeping on the sofa or floor at this time in her life aptly demonstrates how she approaches such issues. I heard as to the future plans of both her daughter and [the Father] but I was little convinced that either had significance concrete basis. The reality is of a deeply difficult housing market in London and there is a very real likelihood that neither will successfully find a way into independent living given their failure to do so at this point in their lives. I very much doubt [the PGM] would in fact turn either away were they demanding her support. Were this concern to materialise (as I believe it would) then [the Child] would be subject to care in a crowded property which was unsuitable to meet his needs. It would also take place in the context of [the PGM] having other responsibilities and pressures on her time and commitment. [the Child] cannot afford for his primary carer to be distracted by such issues and responsibilities.

Given this attitude I judge there is an enhanced likelihood that she will make a home available for [the Father] should he need it. For reasons which [the Father] himself appeared to accept this would place [the Child] at risk. It was concerning that when questioned [the PGM] could not detail any of the events involving [the Father] that might concern the Court. She appeared somewhat passive in her approach and was unable to fairly detail an event in which it appears [the Father] assaulted his sister leading to him serving a custodial sentence. This took place not so long ago and was a significant event. Yet [the PGM] talked in terms of a piece of fence in some way accidentally striking her daughter. I was left with the sense she minimises the issues around her children and [the Father] in particular. Her passivity can also be seen in the failure to make her home presentable for the assessment and/or to demand of the occupants support in ensuring this was the case.
