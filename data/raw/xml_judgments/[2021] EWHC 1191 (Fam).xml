Those children are represented through their Children&#8217;s Guardian, Ms Angela Rumble, by Ms Nazmun Ismail of counsel.  The children are believed currently to be in Pakistan. The applications before the court with respect to the children comprise an application in wardship, an application for summary return orders under the inherent jurisdiction and an application for care orders under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.31</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  Those applications are brought by Manchester City Council, represented by Ms Louise Harvey of counsel.  The mother of the children is D (hereafter &#8216;the mother&#8217;), represented by Ms Hilary Lennox of counsel.  The mother has declined to attend the hearing today.  She is believed currently to be in Pakistan. The father of the children is T (hereafter &#8216;the father&#8217;), represented by Mr Damian Sanders of counsel.  The father has not attended this hearing and is believed currently to be in Italy.  Both parents are Pakistani nationals.  It is understood that both parents also hold Italian passports.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On 14 December 2020 I gave judgment on the application of the local authority for summary return orders under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court. At the conclusion of that judgment I made an order requiring the mother to return each of the children to the jurisdiction of England and Wales from the jurisdiction of Pakistan within 14 days of the date of that order.  In addition, I made a passport order with a view to securing the passports of the children when they re-entered the United Kingdom.  Both the mother and the father attended that hearing, the mother by video link from Pakistan and the father by video link from Germany.  Both parents were therefore on notice that the order had been made, both by hearing the order pronounced by the court and, in respect of the mother, by being sent subsequently a sealed copy of the order of the court.  The parents have to date failed to comply with the order for summary return from Pakistan.   </p>

The local authority however, submits that the children should remain wards of this court for the remainder of their minority in case it becomes possible later to secure their return to this jurisdiction.  Whilst each parent has provided their respective counsel with limited instructions, it is clear that neither opposes the application of the local authority for permission to withdraw the care proceedings.  On behalf of the mother, Ms Lennox further submits that it would be wrong in the circumstances of this case for the court to continue to ward the children and, in any event, wrong to ward them for the period contended for by the local authority.

The father was assessed to continue to pose a significant risk to the children in the circumstances I have outlined in the foregoing paragraphs. The assessment of the mother however, was positive.  In the circumstances, the local authority&#8217;s care plan approaching the conclusion of the care proceedings was for the three children to remain in their mother&#8217;s care under a court order, the nature of which was to be determined at the final hearing, the local authority contending that the order should be a supervision order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.31(1)</ref>(b) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.

A care order represents a serious intervention by the state in the life of the child and in the lives of the parents in terms of their respective ECHR, article 8 rights.

The mother at the very least in any event proved herself willing to co-operate with the father in the abduction of the children and to allow him to be with the children whilst the family did so, notwithstanding his history of domestic abuse, the impact of that on the welfare of the children, and the existence of an exclusion order designed to protect the children and the mother, albeit again accepting that the removal of the children in the company of the father was not strictly a breach of the order itself.   </p>

Those proceedings had been ongoing for some time and were nearing conclusion.  Indeed, they had come at that point in time to the conclusion that the children should continue to reside with their mother.  Both parents understandably rely on the fact that the recommendation in those proceedings was that the children should remain in the care of their mother.  Thus, the argument goes, there is no difficulty in concluding at this point in time that the children should be allowed to remain in the care of their mother in Pakistan, notwithstanding that the mother&#8217;s conduct in taking the children to that jurisdiction in breach of the court orders in place in respect of them was reprehensible.   </p>

On that date and in express contrast to the outcome of the local authority&#8217;s assessments, I am satisfied mother failed to act in a manner commensurate with the assessed risk presented by the father, failed to demonstrate her ability to remain separated from him, and failed to act to prioritise the welfare of the children when she colluded with the father to abduct the children during the course of the proceedings from the jurisdiction.   </p>

As I have summarised in the introduction to this judgment, the allegations concerned questions of serious domestic violence over an extended period of time extended to allegations of sexual abuse, physical abuse and financial control and coercion.  The father to his credit, it is clear from those proceedings and indeed evidence today, showed some insight by way of limited admissions regarding his conduct and the effect of that conduct on the children.   </p>

I am further satisfied by virtue of her conduct on 3 November and thereafter that, notwithstanding the assessment of the mother, she demonstrated a marked lack of insight into the risks presented by the father in seeking his assistance and/or conspiring and colluding with him in the abduction of the children from the jurisdiction, and failed thereby to prioritise the best interests of the children in light of the assessed risk presented by the father.   </p>

If that were to occur, it is unclear to me that this court can rely on the assurances of the parents in relation to their relationship in light of their conduct over the past number of weeks.  In particular, I have regard to the fact that the father is currently abroad, having left the UK with the mother and the children as a family.  It is still not clear or confirmed whereabouts in the world the father is.  I am satisfied that in light of the deception perpetrated by the parents on the local authority and indeed the court, there must be a real possibility that the father will also return to Pakistan where his family are located, albeit in a different part of that jurisdiction.  As I have noted, the parents left the UK together, travelled together to Milan, and did so with the shared intention of frustrating the conclusion of the care proceedings in this country, which conclusion was that the mother should care for the children alone.  There must in my judgment be a real possibility or risk that the family will be reconstituted in Pakistan with the resumption of risks that grounded the care proceedings in this country in the first place.   </p>

Having carefully considered that particular issue, however, I am not satisfied that this should prevent a return order being made.  In particular, I bear in mind that the children have only been out of the jurisdiction in Pakistan for a little over one month, after living for the past four years at least in this jurisdiction, during which time I am satisfied, not least on the mother&#8217;s own evidence, that the children were settled.   </p>

Prior to that abduction on 3 November, the mother had sought settled status in the UK under the EU Settlement Scheme and was taking advantage of support from the local authority to apply for permanent leave to remain under the domestic abuse exception.  Indeed, the court has now seen documents which grant the mother and the children free settled status in the UK under the EUSS.  The children were settled in this jurisdiction at home and in school, and the mother had evinced no intention during the course of the care proceedings of a wish to return to Pakistan with the children as the proper assessed outcome of those proceedings.   </p>

Whilst it is now convenient to the mother to represent this as the position that is most advantageous to the children, only some two months ago she was seeking a very different outcome in this jurisdiction for her children. </p>

It may well be that the mother now seeks to argue that that welfare outcome should be the placement with her in Pakistan with her family.  However, I am satisfied that whatever argument ultimately succeeds, the welfare arguments that fall to be determined are properly determined in this jurisdiction.  First, the children are habitually resident here; second, this court therefore has jurisdiction in relation to matters of parental responsibility; and third, the court is already seized of proceedings in respect of the children.  All the evidence concerning the children&#8217;s welfare by which the court will assess that welfare exists in this jurisdiction.  There is no evidence that the Pakistani authorities have been asked by the mother to take protective measures for the children with respect to the father.  There is no evidence that proceedings have been commenced in Pakistan with respect to the children.  In those circumstances all matters point to this being the most convenient forum in which the welfare of the children is to be determined.   </p>

When the matter came back before the court on 18 January 2021 the mother had had failed to return the children to this jurisdiction and had refused to provide her solicitor with the current address for her and the children.  The mother reiterated her intention to remain in Pakistan.  Both parents failed to attend a further hearing held on 1 March 2021.  Ms Lennox informs the court today that her instructions remain that the mother has no intention of complying with the order of the court for the return of the children from Pakistan.  There is likewise no indication that the father intends to seek or facilitate the return of the children to this jurisdiction. </p>

The children have also been seen with the mother in video calls made by the mother. At this hearing the court was again informed by Ms Lennox that the mother remains in Pakistan with the children who, the mother contends, are now enrolled in school and are happy and thriving.   As I have noted, the father contends that he has returned to Italy. At this hearing the court was again informed by Mr Sanders that the father has not joined the children and the mother in Pakistan, has no intention of doing so and remains in Italy. Mr Sanders relies in this respect on phone records that show that when the father briefly dialled into the hearing on 1 March 2021 he did so from a number that displayed the country code for Italy.  There is no evidence before the court to indicate that the father has entered or attempted to enter Pakistan. </p>

The court has been informed that GMP are in turn working closely with the UK Border Agency, Interpol and the police in Pakistan in an attempt to recover the children to this jurisdiction.  On 10 March 2021 a Strategy Meeting was convened between the local authority and GMP.  At that Strategy Meeting GMP confirmed that it awaited updates from Interpol in Pakistan.  GMP were unable to provide a timescale for the outcome of its efforts to secure the return of the children, dependent as it is on the actions of the Pakistani police and authorities.  In GMP&#8217;s assessment however, it is unlikely that the mother and the children will return to the United Kingdom in a timely manner and certainly not within a timescale consistent with that applicable to care proceedings.   </p>

In that case a local authority had obtained an interim care order in respect of a child who had been admitted to hospital with suspected non-accidental injuries.  On the day the local authority issued proceedings in respect of the sibling of that child the sibling was removed from the jurisdiction of England and Wales to Algeria by her paternal grandparents.  The sibling was also made the subject of an interim care order and the local authority was granted leave to proceed under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/100/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 100(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and the High Court made an order in the inherent jurisdiction requiring the sibling to be returned to the jurisdiction by her parents. The return order was endorsed with a penal notice.  In the context of a failure to return the child the father was found guilty of contempt of court and given a six month suspended sentence of imprisonment.  The father appealed to the Court of Appeal and by the time the matter came before that court the local authority was not opposing the appeal and seeking the withdrawal of the care proceedings, the Court of Appeal having directed a medical report on the sibling which confirmed she was in good health.  The application for permission to withdraw the care proceeding was opposed by the Children&#8217;s Guardian.   Allowing the appeal and granting permission to withdraw the care proceedings, Lord Justice Ward observed at 573D that: </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.4in">&#8220;The paramount consideration for any court dealing with a r 4.5 application is accordingly the question whether the withdrawal of the care proceedings will promote or conflict with the welfare of the child concerned. It is not to be assumed, when determining that question, that every child who is made the subject of care proceedings derives an automatic advantage from having them continued. There is no advantage to any child in being maintained as the subject of proceedings that have become redundant in purpose or ineffective in result. It is a matter of looking at each case to see whether there is some solid advantage to the child to be derived from continuing the proceedings&#8230;I would therefore be in favour of granting the authority's application for leave to withdraw [the sibling&#8217;s] care proceedings. If circumstances should radically alter &#8211; if there should be a change of heart by the paternal grandparents, for example, leading to a voluntary return of [the sibling] to this country &#8211; there are ample procedures available for a fresh invocation, if need be at short notice, of the child protection procedures under the Children Act. That would be a more satisfactory result in my view for everyone, including [the sibling], than keeping alive proceedings that have no current efficacy and have lost the momentum of any support from the authority which initiated them.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">With respect to the necessity of the investigation, it is now clear that the local authority assessment of the parents failed to provide an accurate picture of their parenting ability and, in particular, the mother&#8217;s capacity to protect the children from the risk of significant harm the father was assessed to present.  The father was assessed during the course of the care proceedings to present a risk of physical, sexual and emotional harm to the mother and the children.  It was further clear that the father had done no work to deal with his issues of anger.  Within this context, and as I noted in my judgment of 14 December 2020, whilst the mother was assessed in the context of the proceedings to be able to recognise the risk presented by the father, to be able to maintain separation from the father in the children&#8217;s best interests and accordingly to be able to act to prioritise the children&#8217;s best interests ahead of her relationship with the father, the evidence now before the court indicates that there is, in fact, a stark disparity between the conclusions drawn by that assessment and what has now been demonstrated in terms of the mother&#8217;s insight into the risk that father presents and her capacity to protect the children from that risk.  In the circumstances, within the context of the extant care proceedings, it is plainly necessary now to investigate further the mother&#8217;s parenting capacity in light of her actions from 3 November 2020 onwards.  Were the court to be satisfied by that the mother cannot in fact be relied on to protect the children from the risk presented by the father then, equally plainly, this will necessarily have an impact on the final care plans for each of the children. </p>

Although the UK / Pakistan Protocol was agreed between judges in England and Wales and judges in Pakistan in January 2003, which Protocol may be of assistance when a child is wrongfully taken to or retained in Pakistan and the taking parent either does not voluntarily agree to the child&#8217;s return or does not comply with an order to that effect made in favour of the left behind parent by a court in England and Wales, the Protocol has not been incorporated into Pakistan law and it does not require any particular step or steps to be taken in that jurisdiction.  In the circumstances, it does not provide a <span style="font-style:italic">directly</span> effective means of seeking to recover a child from the jurisdiction of Pakistan.  The ability of the Protocol, and international judicial liaison, to assist in facilitating the return of the children is further curtailed in this case by the fact that there are no ongoing proceedings in the jurisdiction of Pakistan, in circumstances where this is a public law case brought by an English local authority rather than a private law dispute between a taking parent in Pakistan and a left behind parent in England.   </p>

If that hearing resulted, in light of the developments in this case since 3 November 2020 evidencing the mother&#8217;s inability to safeguard the children from the risks the father has been assessed to present, in the court considering that the mother could not safely care for the children, the court would be left in the position of making orders that it could not readily enforce.  Were the decision to be that the children should remain in the care of their mother, the court would not be able to rely on any plan for supporting the mother and addressing deficits in her capacity to protect the children being implemented.  In addition, and importantly, continuing the care proceedings notwithstanding that the children are now in Pakistan, with the attendant focus on the return of the children to this jurisdiction, is likely in my judgment to leave children in state of considerable stress and uncertainty. </p>

The concerns regarding the mother&#8217;s care of the children during the course of the care proceedings centred not on her ability to provide good enough day to day care of the children but rather on her ability to acknowledge the risk of significant harm presented by the father and to protect them from that risk of significant harm.  Within this context, whilst the children are in the sole care of their mother, the risk to them is likely to be reduced.  In this context, and whilst the court remains sceptical of the father&#8217;s assertion that he is unable to return to Pakistan, there is some evidence that he remains working in Europe and is therefore not at present in contact with the children.   </p>
