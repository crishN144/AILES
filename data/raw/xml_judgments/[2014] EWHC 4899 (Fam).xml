He has less well-developed speech than a comparable child of his age (repeating mono-syllables), though has had speech and language therapy to assist him.  Dr. Solebo considers that AD is &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">very likely</span>&#8221; to continue to have some gross motor disorder of the left upper and lower limb. On 22 November 2013 he underwent a cranioplasty with insertion of a titanium plate.  Post-operatively he made a good recovery.  </p>

For most of the period (I believe) it has taken place three times per week (Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday). Contact originally took place at a contact centre; since December 2013 the contact has taken place at the home of the maternal grandparents.  This was moved to the parents&#8217; home in February 2014.  At present, the parents see the children every day, and the children stay over on one night per week.  At all times, the mother&#8217;s contact has been supervised &#8211; initially by local authority staff, and more recently by the maternal or paternal grandmother.</p>

The mother has been on the one hand loving and caring, but on 23 October the perpetrator of grave injury to her son.  It has been noted that the mother is &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">distant</span>&#8221; and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">tends to keep herself in the background</span>&#8221; as a result (I am advised) of reduced confidence in her abilities following the incident.  The father has been co-operative with the authority, but for as long as he aligns himself with his wife in denying her role in the causation of the injuries to AD, he places himself in a position of potential conflict with his feelings for, and duties to, his children.  I take comfort from all that I have read about the extended family, the grandparents, who appear to provide genuine support for this couple. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Decision-making for these children has not been straightforward.  The authority has understandably wrestled with the significant challenge of balancing on the one hand the powerful evidence of attachment and mutual love between the parents and the children, and the otherwise unimpeachable record of parenting, and on the other the mother&#8217;s gross act of injury on her son.  Many authorities, and courts, would have found it hard not to allow the perpetration of life-threatening injury to dominate future decision-making whatever the other advantages may have laid in rehabilitation. </p>

I am equally concerned by the challenges ahead: the parental response to reconstitution of the family, the inevitable stresses of the forthcoming criminal trial.  All of these make the task of this court profoundly challenging.  </p>

I consider that the authority has now struck the balance correctly in the plan which they have presented to the court following discussions this morning.  Vital to the plan is the role of the paternal grandmother (and in exceptional circumstances, where the paternal grandmother is unable to undertake the monitoring/supervision, a maternal grandparent or other approved third party).  I was impressed by the paternal grandmother&#8217;s apparent ability to accept, indeed embrace, the onerous obligations on her to monitor the family going forward.</p>
