She points out that the current care package is significantly more extensive than has ever been provided before to support AA&#8217;s care at home, and suggests that it will provide sufficient independent oversight of AA&#8217;s wellbeing so as to mitigate any risks of remaining at home: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">If it fails in a major way, it will be evident very quickly</span>.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">Conclusions</span>: I am concerned that the approach of the Local Authority appears to take too little account of AA&#8217;s wishes and feelings, particularly in the presently uncertain circumstances of her physical health needs. The aim of rehabilitation is laudable but there is insufficient information available to satisfy me that AA&#8217;s engagement in rehabilitation is realistically achievable at the moment. I can find nothing to suggest that compelling AA&#8217;s return to HV now, as the LA seeks, would be any less traumatic to her than Dr. Hanlon assessed it to be barely a month ago. If she is traumatised in her return to HV, there must be serious doubt that she would be able to benefit from HV&#8217;s rehabilitative approach in the short term at least.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The short term is, in my view, a critical consideration in this matter. It is generally expected that AA will very soon undergo surgery and the chemotherapy, or else chemotherapy and then surgery, but it is not known when and what that will involve for AA on a daily basis. Information is currently limited to that which Miss Moore has managed to establish in enquiries during the course of this hearing. A MDT meeting is thought to have taken place but any conclusions are yet to be discussed with AA and relevant others. Miss Harris has suggested that the picture may be clearer in two months.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">I am not satisfied that it would be in the best interests of AA to compel her return to HV against her wishes, even for the laudable aims of rehabilitation support, whilst there is the very real prospect that she will imminently be admitted to hospital for significant treatment. I am satisfied that it is in the best interests of AA to require further information to be provided about her physical healthcare needs before a final decision is made as to where she should live and receive care. Until that further information is available, in my judgment it is in AA&#8217;s best interests that she remains living at home with the current care package. I consider that a care package of 4 hours a day, 7 days a week, by independent carers, provides sufficient support for the family so as to mitigate the risks suggested by past crises, and sufficient oversight of the situation for the Local Authority to be able to respond very quickly to any deterioration in AA&#8217;s wellbeing if necessary. I consider that the family ought to be taken at their word, and given the opportunity to show that they can cooperate with the care package and &#8220;do better this time.&#8221;</p>

That information should be supplemented by updating statements from the Local Authority, the family and AA&#8217;s own representatives. The Court should then consider the position further at an attended hearing in approximately two months time, with a view to then making final orders or giving further directions as appropriate. In the meanwhile, I shall make an interim order that it is in AA&#8217;s best interests to remain living and receiving care in accordance with the care plan dated 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> June 2016 at her family home.</p>
