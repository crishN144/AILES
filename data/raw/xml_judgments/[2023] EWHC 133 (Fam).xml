	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The subject child in these proceedings is P, who was born in January 2007 and has therefore just turned sixteen years of age.  She is represented by Miss Martine Swinscoe of counsel.  She was made subject of a full care order on 16 January 2023 by order of HHJ Woodward upon the application of Manchester City Council, represented by Ms Emma Whelan of counsel.  Neither parent appears or is represented.  The local authority today urges the court to make an order under its inherent jurisdiction authorising restrictions that it submits amount to a deprivation of P&#8217;s liberty for the purposes of Art 5(1) of the ECHR, on the grounds that such an order is in P&#8217;s best interests.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In circumstances where the local authority seeks to include in that order the authorisation of restrictions on the use by P of her mobile telephone, this case raises the question of whether such steps constitute a deprivation of liberty for the purposes of Art 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights (hereafter the ECHR), such that the High Court has jurisdiction to authorise those steps as being in P&#8217;s best interests, in a deprivation of liberty safeguards order (known, colloquially, as a DOLS order).  The court is aware that, to date, it has been the practice to include provisions removing or restricting the use of a child&#8217;s mobile phone in orders authorising restrictions that constitute breaches of the child&#8217;s Art 5 right to liberty.  Indeed, this court took that step in <span style="font-style:italic">Salford City Council v NV, AM, M (By her Children's Guardian) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2019/1510" uk:canonical="[2019] EWHC 1510 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] EWHC 1510 (Fam)</ref>.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The question before the court in this case arises in the context of the ongoing need for the High Court to utilise the inherent jurisdiction to authorise the restriction of children&#8217;s liberty in order compensate for the acute lack of appropriate secure placements for vulnerable children with the type of needs exhibited by P.  In doing so, the High Court is deploying its inherent jurisdiction to authorise the <span style="font-style:italic">breach</span> of the child&#8217;s Art 5 right to liberty, albeit where that authorisation is demonstrated to be in the child&#8217;s best interests.  The difficulties of deploying such a jurisdiction have been repeatedly articulated by the judges sitting in this Division.  Within the context of these now well rehearsed difficulties, it is a deeply discomforting jurisdiction to have to exercise.  Those difficulties throw into sharp relief the very real need in these cases to avoid the tug of pragmatism (see <span style="font-style:italic">Rehan Malik v Governor of HM Prison Hindley (No.2)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/admin/ch/2022/2684" uk:canonical="[2022] EWHC 2684 (Admin)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2022">[2022] EWHC 2684 (Admin)</ref> per Fordham J) and to keep the exercise of this draconian jurisdiction within its proper bounds.</p>

An educational psychologists report completed in 2020 indicated that P is working at the level of a 7 year old child.  P also presents as a young person who has a sense of humour and is not shy in expressing her personality.  She is described by her Children&#8217;s Guardian as a funny, likeable, and kind young person with skills in creative arts, including making TikTok videos, and a love of animals. </p>

The local authority asserts that P has suffered physical abuse from her father, who has a history of drug misuse, and has been involved in violent incidents with her mother (including violent incidents arising from her mother asking to look at P&#8217;s mobile phone in order to safeguard her).  Between June 2020 and June 2021, P was missing from home on multiple occasions.  P also threatened to harm her mother and her brother with a knife and engaged in repeated acts of self harm, including attempts to take her own life.  When missing, the local authority considers that P has placed herself at risk of child sexual exploitation (CSE) and involvement in organised criminal gangs (OCGs).</p>

She was placed in a four bedroomed children&#8217;s home for children with learning disabilities, before being moved to another children&#8217;s home in which she was also one of a number of children in the placement.  During this period, P continued to attempt to take her own life.  In January 2022, P was admitted to Y hospital for a period of four weeks.  On 7 February 2022, P moved to an alternative solo placement called FW.  That placement was unregistered.  Following a further attempt on her life, P was admitted to X hospital on 29 May 2022 for an extended period whilst an alternative placement was sought.  Up to that point, P&#8217;s acts of self harm had been extensive, including overdoses, swallowing various items, including liquids, cutting herself, burning herself with aerosol cans, banging her head against hard objects/windows, taking herself to motorway bridges and ligature attempts.  However, following assessments in April 2022, May 2022 and June 2022, mental health professionals concluded that P did not meet the criteria for admission to a Tier 4 CAMHS bed.</p>

An order authorising restrictions that amounted to a deprivation of P&#8217;s liberty for the purposes of Art 5(1) of the ECHR was also made on that date.  The restrictions authorised in the order of 24 June 2022 did not, at that stage, include any restrictions referrable to P&#8217;s mobile phone, tablet and laptop or her access to social media.  The order of 24 June 2022 was renewed in the same terms on 13 July 2022, 25 July 2022, 29 July 2022 and 22 August 2022.

The mobile phone is to be charged by staff and kept in the office overnight. The local authority feels this is necessary as when P settles in the evening in her bedroom, the supervision is reduced, and this is when P will speak to her friends online. When P is unhappy, her peers have been known to encourage P to show behaviours such as, shouting at staff, being verbally aggressive and demanding; resulting in aggression shown if P is told &#8216;No&#8217;. It is a worry that P is sharing her address with her friends and the local authority do not know if the friends she has shared this with poses a risk to her, and if these individuals are people that P knows. P has shown a new behaviour of recording staff and the local authority cannot be ascertained that P has not posted this online or shared this with her peers. P could be placed at risk of significant harm if this has been shared with individuals that pose a risk towards her and the staff.</p>

The local authority is worried that P is befriending individuals online who she may not know, this may [be] to seek emotional support. We know that some of P&#8217;s friends are from her previous placements, and we know that some of her friends pose a risk towards her such as, P has a friend who has a DOLS and has another female friend who she alleges sexual abuse towards her back in November 2020. It is a worry that P is at a key stage of her development where she is learning who is a positive friendship and who is not, and it is a worry that some of her peers may be encouraging behaviours that are not safe resulting in further harm. It is unknown to which peer she was speaking to on 24 August but what we know is the female was telling P tactics of restricting holds so she can escape, again, causing P to be at risk of harm as she is being held to keep her safe when she is attempting to harm herself. It is the local authorities view that FW care staff need to record logs of who P is speaking to so the local authority can keep P safe from harm. P is needing a higher level of supervision in evenings when on the phone with her peers.</p>

This is to ensure that P&#8217;s behaviours do not continue to escalate, as during incidents P has contacted her family or friends and this has heightened P&#8217;s risks as she may be trying to impress others. We know from the incident dated 24 August 2022, that P had contacted a friend and a call had been made to the Ambulance Service who were concerned of P&#8217;s welfare. We also know that P has been taking video recordings of staff during the incident and this prevents P from being able to post this online. It is the view of the local authority, in the event, P takes videos of staff that staff should be able to delete these from P&#8217;s phone or observe P delete the videos for their safety in case P posts the videos online or shares this with her peers.  </p>

It is the local authorities view that this is necessary to keep a log of who P is speaking to and to ensure P is not placed at significant risk to individuals that may be older than her or individuals that she does not know. P will not be provided with top up for her mobile until P can show a level of understanding towards keeping safe online, this will be monitored and discussed within weekly meetings with professionals to review this. If P wishes to speak to her family or friends, they can contact her over social media or contact her directly by calling her. It is the local authorities view that giving P access to the work landline will cause further complications and behaviours in the event P may demand to use it.&#8221;</p>

In the period following notice being given, P did become more dysregulated.  On  22  December 2022, P kicked an agency staff member in the stomach and headbutted the staff member to the face, thereby necessitating the staff member attending hospital. On 3 January 2023, P was taken to the Emergency Department at X hospital after she had climbed through a downstairs window and was threatening to harm herself by throwing herself from a motorway bridge.

Echoing Ms Whelan&#8217;s submission that, for P, her mobile phone is very much an avenue to the outside world, particularly whilst locked behind closed doors, Miss Swinscoe points to the fact that the restrictions about which P is particularly concerned in this case are those placed on her mobile phone and social media access.  Within this context, and in circumstances where the ECHR is said to be a &#8216;living instrument&#8217;, Miss Swinscoe submits that the meaning of liberty for a young person today is very different to the meaning of liberty when Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, First Earl of Kilmur, was overseeing the formulation of the ECHR at the end of the Second World War, as Chair of the Council of Europe&#8217;s Legal and Administrative Division. In this context, Miss Swinscoe submits that a restriction on the use of P&#8217;s mobile phone, tablet and laptop, and the concomitant restriction of her access to social media, fits within Lord Kerr&#8217;s formulation of the meaning of liberty in <span style="font-style:italic">Cheshire West</span> at [76] (emphasis added): </p>

In the context of examining the relationship between liberty and security of the person, the ECtHR has over the course of a number of decisions held that liberty must be understood in the context of <span style="font-style:italic">physical</span> liberty rather than physical safety and that the word &#8216;security&#8217; in Art 5(1) serves simply to emphasis that the requirement that a person&#8217;s liberty may not be deprived in an arbitrary fashion (<span style="font-style:italic">East African Asians v United Kingdom</span> (1973) Application No 4626/70).  In this context, and historically, the concept of liberty under Art 5(1) of the ECHR contemplates individual liberty in its classic sense, that is to say the physical liberty of the person.

Its aim is to ensure that no one should be dispossessed of this liberty in an arbitrary fashion. As pointed out by the Government and the Commission, it does not concern mere restrictions upon liberty of movement (Art 2 of Protocol No 4). This is clear both from the use of the terms &#8216;deprived of his liberty&#8217;, &#8216;arrest&#8217; and &#8216;detention&#8217;, which appear also in paras 2&#8211;5, and from a comparison between Article 5 and the other normative provisions of the Convention and its Protocols&#8217;). As such the &#8216;security of the person&#8217; for the purposes of Art 5 of the ECHR will not be relevant, for example, in respect of applications relating to social security or insecure personal circumstances.&#8221;</p>

This is not a right to do or to go where one pleases. It is a more focused right, not to be deprived of that physical liberty. But, as it seems to me, what it means to be deprived of liberty must be the same for everyone, whether or not they have physical or mental disabilities. If it would be a deprivation of my liberty to be obliged to in a particular place, subject to constant monitoring and control, only allowed out with close supervision, and unable to move away without permission even if such an opportunity became available, then it must also be a deprivation of the liberty of a disabled person. The fact that my living arrangements are comfortable, and indeed make my life as enjoyable as it could possibly be, should make no difference. A gilded cage is still a cage.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;[118] It should be possible, now, to see how section 100(2) is moulded to the effects of a care order detailed in the provisions to which I have just referred. Having started with prohibiting the use of the inherent jurisdiction to place the child in local authority care or under their supervision, it then prevents the court using the inherent jurisdiction to order the accommodation of a child by a local authority, and, of course, prevents it being used to put the local authority in a position to determine any question in connection with parental responsibility. This seems to me to be entirely consistent with the aim being to confine matters to the statutory scheme in Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, the thinking being that a local authority needing the power to determine any question in connection with parental responsibility must seek it through the medium of a care order. For the most part, the care order would clothe the local authority with the required parental responsibility and, in so far as the local authority was aiming at an element of parental responsibility which receives special treatment in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/33" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 33</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/33" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 33</ref> itself would dictate whether the limit on the local authority&#8217;s parental responsibility was absolute (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/33/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 33(6)</ref>, for example, which prohibits a local authority from causing a child to be brought up in a different religious persuasion) or qualified (for example, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/33/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 33(7)</ref> provides that no person shall cause the child to be known by a new surname except with the written consent of every person with parental responsibility or leave of the court).&#8221;</p>

Within this context, I accept that the possession and use of her mobile phone, tablet and laptop, and her concomitant access to social media, is likely to equate in P&#8217;s mind to &#8220;liberty&#8221; broadly defined as the state or condition of being free.  However, this court is concerned with the meaning of liberty under Art 5(1) of the ECHR.  Whilst I recognise that the Convention is a living instrument, which must be interpreted in the light of present-day conditions (see <span style="font-style:italic">Tyrer v United Kingdom</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1978) 2 EHRR 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1978">(1978) 2 EHRR 1</ref> at [31]), over an extended period of time the Commission and the ECtHR have repeatedly made clear that Art 5(1) is concerned with individual liberty in its classic sense of the <span style="font-style:italic">physical</span> liberty of the person, with its aim being to ensure that no one is dispossessed of their physical liberty in an arbitrary fashion.  The Supreme Court proceeded on that formulation of the proper scope of Art 5(1) in <span style="font-style:italic">Cheshire West</span>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within the foregoing context, in my judgment the removal of, or the placing of restrictions on the use of, P&#8217;s mobile phone, tablet and laptop and her use of social media do not by themselves amount to a restriction of her liberty for the purposes of Art 5(1).  On the evidence currently before the court those restrictions do not act to deprive P of her physical liberty, but rather act to restrict her communication, so as to ensure her physical and emotional safety.  The evidence set out earlier in this judgment demonstrates that the effect of those restrictions is to limit P&#8217;s communications with peers who might encourage her to engage in bad behaviour, with strangers who may present a risk to her and with family and friends when she is in a heightened emotional state.  Within this context, the restrictions on the use of P&#8217;s devices for which the local authority seek authorisation do not, in my judgment, by themselves constitute an objective component of confinement of P in a particular restricted place for a not negligible length of time.  In the circumstances, whilst they are steps at times taken without P&#8217;s consent and are imputable to the State, those restrictions do not, by themselves, meet the first <span style="font-style:italic">Storck</span> criterion.  </p>

In this context, I have given careful thought to the submission of the local authority that, whilst the restrictions imposed on P in respect of her mobile phone, tablet and laptop and on the use of social media do not, <span style="font-style:italic">in themselves</span>, meet the first <span style="font-style:italic">Storck</span> criterion, it nonetheless remains open to the court to authorise them in an order authorising the deprivation of her liberty because those steps are an integral <span style="font-style:italic">element </span>of the deprivation of P&#8217;s liberty.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst the removal of, and the restrictions on the use of, P&#8217;s mobile phone, tablet and laptop and on the use of social media might be said, at least at times, to form part of a regime of continuous supervision and control in her placement and that she is not free to leave, once again those measures do not act to restrict P&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">physical </span>liberty.  The effect of those restrictions is to prevent P broadcasting online indiscriminately, to prevent contact from those advising her how to frustrate steps the placement takes to stop her from harming herself and others and to prevent her sharing details online with those who may pose a risk to her and restricting contact with those against whom she has alleged abuse.  There is no suggestion in the evidence currently before the court that those restrictions constitute a necessary element of the deprivation of P&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">physical</span> liberty or of the manner of implementation of that deprivation of liberty.  For example, the evidence before the court does not suggest that the restrictions on the use of P&#8217;s mobile phone, tablet and laptop and use of social media are required to ensure the effectiveness of the current measures that do operate to prevent her from leaving the placement, or that without those restrictions the current measures that operate to prevent her from leaving the placement would be rendered ineffective.  In these circumstances, in my judgment the restrictions in respect of P&#8217;s phone, tablet and laptop and on the use of social media do not, even when considered in the context of the other elements of the other restrictions for which authorisation is sought, constitute an objective component of confinement of P in a particular restricted place for a not negligible length of time.  Accordingly, it would in my judgment be wrong to authorise them under the auspices of a DOLS order simply because they form part of the total regime to which P is currently subject in her placement.</p>

I further accept that in <span style="font-style:italic">Cheshire West</span>, the proposition that continuous supervision and control is relevant only in so far as it demonstrates that the person is not free to leave was rejected by Baroness Hale.  In my judgment however, if the court is to authorise an element of supervision or control on the basis that it constitutes, either in whole or as part of the whole, a deprivation of liberty for the purposes of Art 5(1), there must be at least <span style="font-style:italic">some</span> evidential basis for concluding that that element of supervision and control constitutes an objective component of confinement in a particular restricted place for a not negligible length of time.  Otherwise, the court would be able to authorise by reference to Art 5(1) any and all measures in the package of care provided to P in placement, even if they had nothing to do with restricting her physical liberty.  This would be an undesirable outcome.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The difference between deprivation of and restriction upon liberty is one of degree or intensity and not one of nature or substance.  But there is nonetheless a difference and that difference can have consequences.  As I have noted above, restrictions of the type being imposed on P with respect to the use of her mobile phone, tablet and laptop, and concomitant limitations on her access to social media, are most naturally characterised as an interference with her Art 8 right to respect for private and family life.  When considering them as such, before a court could endorse that interference it would have to be satisfied that that interference was necessary and proportionate, pursuant to Art 8(2).  If however, those steps were instead to be considered and endorsed by the court by reference to Art 5(1), the exercise under Art 8(2) would be bypassed in respect of steps that constitute an interference in an Art 8(1) right. It is important that the court be careful not to allow its jurisdiction to make orders authorising the deprivation of a child&#8217;s liberty by reference to Art 5(1) to spill over into authorising steps that do not constitute a deprivation of liberty for the purposes of Art 5(1), particularly where those steps might constitute breaches of different rights, which breaches fall to be evaluated under different criteria.  It may well be that one of the reasons for ECtHR adopting the narrow interpretation of word &#8216;liberty&#8217; under Art 5(1) in cases such <span style="font-style:italic">as Engel v Netherlands</span>, limiting it to the classic concept of physical liberty, was to reduce risk of the Art 5 exceptions resulting in a <span style="font-style:italic">de facto</span> interference with other rights, without proper reference to the content of those other rights.</p>

In circumstances where the use of a mobile phone, tablet or laptop becomes a source of significant harm to the child, it is surely a proper exercise of parental responsibility for a parent to seek to protect that child by removing by way of confiscation, or restricting the use of, such devices as a means of protecting the child from exploitation, harm or abuse, even where that child is an adolescent, and in particular where that child is a vulnerable adolescent who may well be less mature and less capable of making autonomous decisions on these matters.

Whilst in a heightened state, P has displayed serious self-harming behaviours including making threats to her own life.  In addition to these behaviours P has also, again when in a heightened state, used the threat of violence towards others, including her family, peers and staff that are assigned to supervise her.  The evidence before the court demonstrates that these difficulties can be further exacerbated by the use by P of her mobile phone, tablet and laptop and by access to social media.  During those periods she can be enticed through these means to resist measures designed to keep her safe, to act out in terms of behaviour and to seek to undermine relationships with those caring for her. Against these matters however, whilst something she strongly dislikes, the removal or restriction of P&#8217;s mobile phone, tablet and laptop and access to social media, whether by way of confiscation of those devices or by a to provide top-up payments or by the restriction of Wi-Fi would not in my judgment itself be harmful to P.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I accept that there is some evidence before the court that P can, on occasion, be non-compliant and has on two occasions refused to surrender her mobile phone.  I also accept that there is evidence that when in a heightened state P can be aggressive and violent.  She can be impulsive, can at times not think of consequences and can exhibit poor control over her emotions and find it difficult to trust adults.  However, against this there is also significant evidence demonstrating that P has, to date, largely co-operated with requests made by those caring for her to surrender her phone, tablet and laptop when asked and to comply with requests to inspect that phone. The evidence further demonstrates a degree of understanding on the part of P as to why these steps are necessary.  In this context, P has willingly participated in work designed to increase her safety online and her understanding of the risks presented by people she does not know.  As I have already concluded, it is open to the local authority pursuant to its powers under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/33/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.33(3)</ref>(b) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> to confiscate P&#8217;s phone in the face of her objection where the local authority considers such a step necessary to safeguard and promote P&#8217;s welfare.

Confirmation from Ofsted is awaited but, as noted above, on 9 December 2022, Ofsted wrote to PT to confirm that another of their placements registered with the CQC, which the local authority asserts is almost identical to the provision now being provided by PT to P, does not meet the definition of a children&#8217;s home under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/14" uk:canonical="2000 c. 14" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Care Standards Act 2000</ref>, and accordingly does not constitute the operation of an unregistered children&#8217;s home.

However, I venture to suggest that it will <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> ordinarily be appropriate to authorise restrictions on phones and other electronic devices within a DOLS order authorising the deprivation of the child&#8217;s liberty.  Further, it is to be anticipated that, in very many cases, any restrictions on the use of phones and other devices that are required to safeguard and promote the child&#8217;s welfare will fall properly to be dealt with by the local authority under the power conferred on it by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/33/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.33(3)</ref>(b) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  Only in a small number of cases should it be necessary to have recourse to an order under the inherent jurisdiction, separate from the order authorising the deprivation of liberty, authorising more draconian steps to restrict the child&#8217;s use of a mobile phone or other device and only then where there is cogent evidence that the child is likely to suffer significant harm if an order under the inherent jurisdiction in that regard were not to be made.  </p>
