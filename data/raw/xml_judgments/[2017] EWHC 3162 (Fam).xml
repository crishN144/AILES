	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband is believed to be abroad, but his precise location now, as indeed for phases of this litigation is a mystery.  At the time of issuing proceedings, the wife did not know the husband&#8217;s whereabouts, and the court accordingly gave directions for substituted service on the husband.  That directions order, together with the Form A and other supporting documentation, was in fact successfully served on the husband by a range of substituted methods, and he responded by instructing distinguished London-based family law solicitors; they in turn instructed specialist junior counsel. The First Appointment, listed before a District Judge, was adjourned, of the court&#8217;s own motion, and the proceedings were transferred to the High Court.  The case was allocated to me.  When the case was finally listed before me on 29 July 2016, I gave specific leave (pursuant to <span style="font-style:italic">rule 27.3 FPR 2010</span>) for the husband not to attend given his residence abroad and his apparent ill-health (see [55] below); he was then, of course, fully represented.  No point was taken that earlier service of the documents had not been effective, nor was it argued that the substituted service had in any way infringed the provisions of <span style="font-style:italic">rule 6.19 </span>or <span style="font-style:italic">rule 6.43 FPR 2010</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">PD6A para.6.1/6.4 FPR 2010</span>.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband then engaged with the proceedings for a period.  He filed and served relevant documentation including a Form E (July 2016); he made an application for permission to adduce expert evidence, which was not in the event pursued.  The Financial Dispute Resolution Appointment (FDR) took place on 18 January 2017 before Holman J; the husband participated in this process, was present in court, and was represented.  The FDR did not produce settlement.  The husband has taken no further overt step in the proceedings. Mr. Bishop advises me that the wife&#8217;s lawyers tried to progress the case during the spring and summer 2017, but their actions provoked &#8220;little response&#8221; from the husband or his solicitors.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In late August 2017, the husband&#8217;s solicitors made formal application to come off the record; I granted their application.  I conducted a further directions hearing on 7 September 2017; the husband did not attend nor was he represented, and no explanation for his absence was provided.  At that hearing, I gave various directions to set the case up for trial, which was then timetabled for a 10-day hearing in May 2018.  I specifically directed that the husband should communicate with the wife&#8217;s solicitor within two weeks with an address for service, and I further requested that he provide a reliable means of communication.  I directed that he be served <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span> by e-mail (to an address known to have been effective in the past), by SMS messaging to his last-known mobile phone number, by private message to the husband&#8217;s private Facebook account, and via a former professional advisor of the husband&#8217;s.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In October 2017, the wife&#8217;s solicitors issued a fresh application seeking the court&#8217;s direction to bring forward the trial date.  Having served the husband with documents in accordance with my earlier direction, and having received no response, the wife (or more accurately her lawyers) were convinced that the husband was deliberately and wilfully not engaging with the process.  Their wish for an earlier hearing was specifically and further prompted by a belief (evidenced in part) that the husband was seeking to transfer, or otherwise place, assets out of the wife&#8217;s reach.  I acceded to the application for an earlier hearing date, provided that I could be satisfied that all proper efforts could be taken to notify the husband.  I directed that the husband be re-served with the new case management timetable by methods which appear previously to have been successful (e-mail, text and via a friend of the husband&#8217;s), and in additional ways (including via his son) which I felt were likely to bring the matters to his attention; these methods of service are all contemplated by the broadly crafted provisions of <span style="font-style:italic">rule 6.19 FPR 2010</span>.  I then varied the timetable to accelerate it significantly; I made clear on the face of the order that final orders may be made at this hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I was further advised by Mr. Bishop at the hearing that a firm of lawyers in Myanmar have very recently corresponded with the wife&#8217;s solicitors in relation to the matters under consideration, purportedly on behalf of the husband albeit via &#8216;intermediaries&#8217;, and specifically under the mantle of &#8216;without prejudice&#8217;.  Without breaching the privileged status of that documentation, Mr Bishop was able to tell me that his solicitors have notified the Myanmar lawyers of this hearing date.</p>

(&#8216;PS&#8217;) (one of the BVI listed companies in which the husband had placed significant assets: see [31] below) which has recently been placed into voluntary liquidation, alerting them to the final hearing date, and asking them to pass this information on to the husband.  Interestingly, the liquidator is a director of a firm of accountants which had routinely advised the parties during the marriage.  It is notable that correspondence had been sent on 1 September to the same firm (albeit to the liquidator&#8217;s partner) on issues relating to service, and this had prompted the reply that the husband &#8220;is no longer in Singapore&#8221;, and &#8220;we have ceased acting for him some time ago&#8221;; the parties&#8217; accountant failed in that correspondence to reveal that a partner in the same firm is the newly appointed liquidator of PS.</p>

They met in about 2001 or 2002 and on the wife&#8217;s case lived together from about 2002 (the husband says that their relationship commenced in 2004). They were married in December 2006 in Singapore.  Both had been married before.  The husband has one son, (N).  The wife has two children &#8211; a son (R) and a daughter (S).

The parties spent extended time also in Monaco and Switzerland.  The wife asserts in her form E that &#8220;our days consisted of socialising, wining and dining, beauty treatments and luxury shopping.  We had staff to assist us&#8221;.   I do not detect any dispute, from the material filed, that the wife took an active role in organising and managing the financial affairs of the parties.  The parties had apartments in Singapore and Monaco, at least in part for the storage of possessions and for use as personal offices.</p>

Following this incident, they were conveyed to hospital where they were medically examined.  When CT scans were performed of the wife&#8217;s skull, a large benign brain tumour (a supratentorial meningioma), plainly unconnected with the assault, was revealed.  Over the course of the next few weeks, the wife underwent five operations to excise the meningioma, evacuate it, and insert a ventricular drain.  Medical complications which followed have caused the wife neurological and neuropsychological impairments (discussed more fully below [67] <span style="font-style:italic">et seq</span>).  For a while, the wife recuperated in Singapore, but in 2014 she travelled to England to continue her recovery close (geographically) to her son; she alleges, although I know the husband denies, that the husband was unsupportive of and unsympathetic to her in her post-operative recovery period.   The husband made some financial provision for her, though this petered out after a few months; the husband does not explain his lack of financial support, but vigorously denies (and maintained through counsel at the First Appointment that he was &#8220;immensely distressed by&#8221;) the suggestion that he has &#8220;washed his hands&#8221; of his responsibility for his wife.

It was in those circumstances that the wife transferred her share in PS to the husband&#8217;s son, N, in January 2013.  Simultaneously (January 2013), again according to the husband, the parties executed new wills &#8220;and the [husband] left all such real and personal property that was situated in Singapore at the time of his death to the [wife]&#8221;.  </p>

These factors are likely positively to influence her &#8216;needs&#8217; claim. As against those factors, I have had regard to the length of the marriage and the source of the assets (see generally Lord Nicholls in <span style="font-style:italic">White v White</span>: [29] above).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It seems to me unarguable that the wife has a reasonable need for a home in England.  She currently rents a practical-sized property in a desirable part of a city in the North East.  She has the option to purchase this property; the option is open to her until April 2019, though at a favourable price if before April 2018 (the purchase price would be &#163;1.2m).  The home is geographically close to her son.  It requires some adaptation to reflect the wife&#8217;s physical disabilities, which (in accordance with the detailed specifications which have been submitted in evidence) would be likely to cost in the region of &#163;250k.</p>

Mr. Bishop argues that this is an entirely legitimate aspiration having regard to a combination of the following factors: (a) Singapore is the wife&#8217;s home country; (b) during the marriage, the parties spent extensive time there; (c) the wife ought to be able to spend time near her family (she has a large family in Singapore); (d) she benefits from the climate there. This will be, as he put it, a second home in the true sense, where she contemplates spending 12-18 weeks per year; this is <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> a holiday house, such as a ski chalet or Mediterranean villa.  The wife travelled to Singapore in September with her care consultant, Ms Chance; this visit enhanced &#8220;a positive mental attitude and good energy levels&#8221; in the wife, who was also able to access various therapies while there.  I broadly accept the wife&#8217;s case in this respect.</p>

Given what I know of the parties&#8217; lifestyle, I have resisted the temptation to view it through too parsimonious a lens.  The properties in England and Singapore will need to be maintained.  It is reasonable in my judgment for the wife to travel to Monaco for up to three weeks each year, to New York (where S has been living), and of course to Singapore. It is reasonable for the wife to have the use of a part-time Personal Assistant and of a Financial Deputy. I felt it was right only to trim the somewhat overly extravagant annual budget for food/dining/household, shopping/restaurants, socialising, clothing and handbags, entertainment and hobbies, and I did so by reducing it to &#163;65k.  </p>

Dr. Ruth Kent describes the wife having sustained a &#8220;severe&#8221; injury related to a relatively localised area of the posterior aspect of the brain, leaving her with very specific health needs.  She suffers a range of disabilities, including dysarthria and dysphasia and an ataxic gait; she has a right leg chorea, and a partial left Horner&#8217;s syndrome (all provided by Professor Chinnery, Consultant Neurologist).  She is in constant neuropathic pain, experiences headaches, suffers double vision and problems with co-ordination, choking and difficulties in swallowing, and displays communication difficulties with a decrease in vocabulary.  She has a severely impaired memory, has suffered depression, and has suffered from mood disorder, paranoia and aggression. Dr. Donald Brechin is of the view that she is at increased risk of depression in the future.  She has difficulty holding information in her mind, and displays evidence of confabulation. </p>

[HC] displays neuropsychological and behavioural evidence of problems with executive functions, consistent with her suffering from a dysexecutive syndrome.  An important of this syndrome in [HC]&#8217;s case is that she demonstrates limited insight into the extent of her difficulties&#8230; [HC] cannot independently manage her personal and financial affairs (including organising her care package) &#8230; it is more likely than not that the majority of spontaneous cognitive recovery has occurred, and that further recovery of cognitive abilities is limited in scope.  The nature of her dysexecutive syndrome is that it affects insight, problem-solving and judgment, and my assessment indicates that [HC] confuses information, she is impulsive and she is vulnerable to suggestion. As such, she could inadvertently put herself in situations that compromise has safety, and she is at risk of exploitation by others. As such, it is my view that [HC] requires care and support to maintain safety.&#8221;</p>

I have considered, although have given it modest weight only given the demise of the marriage, that the parties agreed during the marriage that the wife was to receive the Singapore property portfolio in consideration for her shareholding in PS (see [33] above).   While these factors pull in one direction, I readily acknowledge that this was a marriage of shorter than median length (8 years only, in a relationship of 10-12 years).  </p>

The wife&#8217;s annual budget going forward reflects of course the needs of a wife who has enjoyed and benefited from a luxury standard of living for more than a decade in the middle to latter years of her life, but materially reflects (and indeed is doubled by) the bespoke care costs required to provide for her special medical needs. </p>
