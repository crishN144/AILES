	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before me yesterday, 17 December 2013, were listed for final determination the applications by the Local Authority for a full care order and a placement (for adoption) order in respect of D who was born in June 2012 in Birmingham and who is now nearly 18 months old. However, my final case management order made on 8 October 2013 expressly contemplated that there may be an application by the Central Authority of the Czech Republic (the Office for the International Legal Protection of Children, or OILPC), or by the mother, for a request to be made by me pursuant to Article 15 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility (otherwise known as Brussels II revised or B2R) for the transfer of these public law proceedings to the courts of the Czech Republic for disposal there. My directions provided that any such application by OILPC ought to be made by 31 October 2013 and in the absence of such an application any equivalent application should be made by the mother by 14 November 2013. No such application was made by OILPC (even though it had clearly signified that it intended to do so on 23 October 2013) and accordingly the mother made her application in lieu a little late on 27 November 2013. (No-one has taken any point about the delay which I imagine was connected with the obtainment of legal aid.)</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is agreed that the mother&#8217;s application for a transfer request should be dealt with as a preliminary issue. It is advanced by Mr Newton QC leading Mr Metaxa. It is strongly opposed by Miss Rowley for the local authority and Mr Veitch who represents D, instructed by the Guardian. This is my judgment on the preliminary issue.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The background to this case is set out in my very full fact-finding judgment dated 30 November 2012 (<ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2012/3362" uk:canonical="[2012] EWHC 3362 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWHC 3362 (Fam)</ref>).  As I said there, the story that unfolded before me was wrenchingly dispiriting and was one of abuse, misery, exploitation, criminality, and unrelenting vice. The father here was the step-father of the mother. He seduced her (thereby committing the crime of sexual activity with a child family member as defined in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/42/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 25</ref> and 27 <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/42" uk:canonical="2003 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Sexual Offences Act 2003</ref>) at the same time that he was sleeping with the mother&#8217;s own mother. The mother&#8217;s half-siblings were allowed to be aware that their father was sleeping with their sister. The father plied the mother with drugs. It was a truly appalling state of affairs. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In short, the judgment described the father as a malevolent Svengali. It described how on Day 5 of the hearing he fled to the Czech Republic. Since then he has not engaged in these proceedings. I found the mother to be both victim and perpetrator of harm (see para 65). The mother&#8217;s stance at the time that I made that judgment was that she intended permanently to separate from the father and, if permitted to by the court, to bring up D alone (see para 62). That stance did not last long. She travelled to the Czech Republic at Christmas to see her dying grandmother. She re-united with the father and fell pregnant by him again. She returned here in January 2013, and kept up regular contact to D. She returned to the Czech Republic on 1 August 2013 to have her baby there. She did so because she was well aware that the local authority would have sought orders removing her baby from her at birth had she been born here. Her daughter L was born in September 2013. She lives with the mother and the father in Novy Ji&#265;in. The mother has returned here for this hearing and had been afforded contact to D during this visit.   </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">D&#8217;s position is that he is placed with English foster-parents in their 50s. They are very fond of and attached to him but on account of their age do not seek to apply for a special guardianship order as they would be in their 70s by the time he was a teenager. On account of their age they are not candidates for adoption (even if they wanted that). Therefore if the local authority&#8217;s substantive applications are granted D will be placed with a new adoptive family. </p>

Ethnically the father is fully Romani. The mother is half Romani and half Slavic. Thus D and L are three-quarters Romani and one-quarter Slavic.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Veitch correctly says that the Child Protective Services in Novy Ji&#265;in have decided to go down the route of supervision rather than care for L. Both he and the local authority strongly criticise the Child Protective Services for doing so. They regard it as a dereliction of their duties having regard to the very strong findings made by me against the father and to a lesser extent against the mother. Miss Rowley submits that &#8220;[the enquiries by the Child Protective Services] seem to amount to little more than a &#8220;safe and well check&#8221;. The information received from OILPC to date, does not suggest that [the Child Protective Services] has considered or addressed the risks arising out of the findings of this court, despite the judgment having been received by them.&#8221; Mr Veitch submits that &#8220;if there is clear evidence, as it is submitted there is in the instant case, that the Czech authorities are not appropriately protecting a child the court should not ignore that fact.&#8221;</p>

However, they do not outweigh the need for D to grow up in an environment which is safe, stable and secure and free from the risks already identified by this court. In recognition of the importance of his heritage, the Local Authority has sought to promote the Czech language to date with the assistance of his mother. At their request, she has provided the Local Authority with a CD of Czech nursery rhymes, which are regularly played to him. The Local Authority has addressed the cultural aspect of this case in the social worker&#8217;s statement at C20 and C127, and more recently in her statement dated 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2103 at paragraphs 20 and 22. At the date of the latter statement, there were 11 prospective adoptive families of Eastern European heritage. Committed efforts would be made to find a placement which met D&#8217;s needs in this country. It is questionable whether the Czech Republic is in a better position to place D in a more ethnically and culturally suitable placement, based on the information received from OILPC. On 24 October 2013, a representative of the Legal Department of OILPC confirmed that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">there are no direct adopters for D and the Local Authority is not even in contact with any other relatives of D&#8221;. </span>In earlier correspondence, OILPC have been unable to give any indication of the availability of placements which would reflect his Roma heritage.  </p>

It is understood that in contact mother spoke to D in English. At the time of his birth his parents were both ordinarily resident in the UK and intended to remain in this country. The father had an established home here for which he received housing benefits.

A vast amount of evidence has been prepared and filed both in relation to the substantive finding of fact hearing and the final hearing. This court has already had the benefit of hearing the parties give their evidence at the finding of fact and has made significant findings against both the father and the mother. The events on which those findings were based, largely took place in England. Regarding disposal of this case there has been detailed social work assessment of the mother including observations of contact, ISW assessment and the observations of the child&#8217;s guardian. All of this evidence would be highly relevant to the Czech Court&#8217;s determination of D&#8217;s best interests.

The Czech authorities are aware of the findings about the relationship between the father and the mother. Despite these findings L remains in the care of the father and his family.  The &#8220;latest and very important evidence&#8221; (per the skeleton argument on behalf of the mother) in fact amounts to little more than a superficial examination of the child&#8217;s immediate circumstances and the parents ability to provide basic care needs.  The court should be concerned that if these proceedings are transferred to the Czech Republic there will be a significant negative impact on D&#8217;s welfare both in terms of substantial delay to the outcome of proceedings and the risk that he will be returned to his birth family. A family which this court has found has caused him significant harm and puts him at risk of further significant harm in the future. D is now 18 months old and is forming attachments. His need for urgent determination of his future and placement in a permanent caring and stable placement is pressing.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The case of <span style="font-style:italic">Re T / Re K</span> was a very obvious one for a transfer request under Article 15. The arguments for and against in this case are much more evenly balanced. However, the issues that are raised go a good deal wider than a simple application of the words of the regulation to the specific facts of this case. They raise the very important political and social issue of whether, and if so to what extent, the remit of our child protection system should extend to children who are citizens of other EU countries (but not of this country) where there exists a clearly defined transfer procedure to enable their future to be determined in the court of their homeland. There has recently been a public clamour about a certain Italian case (see <span style="font-style:italic">In the matter of P (A Child)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/4048" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 4048 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 4048 (Fam)</ref>, where the press reporting is described) and it is fair to say that the issues which I have to determine are a matter of pressing public concern.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is important to recognise what an order authorising a transfer request under Article 15 entails. It is a request of the foreign court, no more than that. It is not a request to the government of the other EU state. Nor is it a request to its executive arm, the central authority. Nor is it a request to the local authority of the municipality of the foreign state. It is a request to a fellow EU court. And that court has the final say on whether to accept the case or not. It must decide within six weeks. If it accepts the request the case will go there. If it does not it will stay here and be determined here.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Here I agree with Mr Newton QC that up to the date of my judgment of 30 November 2012 the facts have been definitively found. Of course, having conducted the fact-finding hearing I have some advantage were I to conduct the disposal hearing over another judge, whether that judge is sitting here or in the Czech Republic. This is because not every nuance of the case necessarily finds expression in my judgment. But, generally speaking, the advantage that I have by virtue of having conducted a fact finding hearing over a fellow judge is marginal. Wherever the disposal hearing is conducted it will not be necessary to go behind my findings or to examine the underlying evidence. Indeed in preparing for the final hearing in this case there has been virtually no reference to the &#8220;wealth of evidence&#8221; (as Miss Rowley puts it) which led to my judgment about the historic facts. </p>

He argues that a Czech court would be far better placed to investigate those facts than this court. I tend to agree. Only the Czech court would be able to investigate whether the father is, as the mother claims in her latest statement, a changed and reformed character. This is because he will not engage in these proceedings. It may be said that it is unprincipled for this court to allow the father to put a gun to its head but at the end of the day it surely must be practical considerations that determine which court is better placed to conduct the final disposal hearing and to gather and consider all the relevant evidence as to whether reunification of D with his parents is feasible, or whether the drastic, extreme and exceptional measure of adoption is the only valid option.</p>

In my judgment the statement of Thorpe LJ in para 24 of <span style="font-style:italic">Re K</span> is not a mere rebuttable presumption but is a no entry sign.

Based on my findings the stance of the local authority is that the father is so irredeemably corrupt and malign that in circumstances where he and the mother maintain their relationship there is no alternative but to place D for adoption. The consequence of an adoption will be, as Miss Rowley realistically accepts, that D will lose, if not completely, then very largely, connection to his Czech/Roma heritage. This is an exceptionally important factor in my judgment. I accept that the promotion of D&#8217;s heritage must be balanced, as Miss Rowley says, against his need to be reared in a safe, stable and secure environment. However, underlying this submission is a tacit suggestion that the courts of the Czech Republic are incapable of promoting that need. That I cannot accept. On the other hand I believe that the Czech court will be much better able than me to recognise and promote his Czech/Roma heritage. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am concerned by the distinct lack of enthusiasm by the Czech authorities to seek themselves an Article 15 transfer request. But the very terms of Article 15 envisage the request being made upon application from a party, or of this court's own motion, or upon application from a court of another Member State with which the child has a particular connection. The Article does not in fact contemplate the application being made by either a foreign government or by an executive agency of a foreign government. It envisages, first, the application being made by a party, and that is what has happened here.</p>

Of course, if the Czech court does not accept the invitation within six weeks then the case will proceed to final disposal here. That is not a very long delay especially when one considers that D, if the orders are made as sought by the local authority, will have to be placed with a new adoptive family anyway. If the Czech court does accept the invitation then the delay in final resolution is a completely unknown quantity but it is fair to say that it will inevitably be longer than were I to deal with this matter, especially, as Miss Rowley fairly points out, where there are no actual proceedings in being in the Czech Republic.</p>

That would (almost) inevitably lead to an adoption order, most likely with an English family, and severance of his connection with his homeland, his ethnicity, and his half siblings B and K. I place no weight on Miss Rowley&#8217;s reference in para 19(iii) above to  their residence here along with their mother as I consider it much more likely than not that were the orders to be made as sought by the local authority that D would lose all contact with them. Equally, I think it is improbable, were the a matter to be adjudicated finally by the Czech court, that maintenance of the relationship between D and his half siblings would be in fact be achieved. This factor does not weigh with me either way.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">"it must never be forgotten that, with the state's abandonment of the right to impose capital sentences, orders of the kind which judges of this Division are typically invited to make in public law proceedings are amongst the most drastic that any judge in any jurisdiction is ever empowered to make. It is a terrible thing to say to any parent &#8211; particularly, perhaps, to a mother &#8211; that he or she is to lose their child for ever. When a family judge makes a freeing or an adoption order in relation to a twenty-year old mother's baby, the mother will have to live with the consequences of that decision for what may be upwards of 60 years, and the baby for what may be upwards of 80 years. We must be vigilant to guard against the risks."&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The evidence here suggests that save in cases of abandonment adoption in the Czech Republic is only permitted with parental consent. It is therefore even more momentous where a local authority seeks this remedy in a case where the laws of the child's homeland would not allow it. Indeed, it may fairly be said to give rise to diplomatic and political questions about the relations between states within the Union.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am fully alive to the fact that in 2004 this family came to this country and settled here. Social Services were not involved with the family until October 2011. When a family immigrates here they must be taken to accept all our laws whether they relate to tax, crime or the protection of children. The fact that our family law permit non-consensual adoption (in contrast to the law of their homeland) is part of the price of the exercise of the right to settle here. This feature is a strong pointer against making the Article 15 request. However, notwithstanding this period of settlement this was always a Czech family. It lived in a Czech community. It spoke Czech (indeed the English of all members of the family is very poor). It maintained many contacts with the Czech Republic. But beyond these lofty expressions of principle are the simple practical facts that the parents are in the Czech Republic, L is in the Czech Republic and any proceedings in the Czech Republic will be conducted in the first language of the parents. </p>

If that court has not responded affirmatively within six weeks then this case will proceed here. In the meantime D will remain in care under interim care orders which will be renewed on paper. If the Czech court accepts jurisdiction then D will continue to remain in care under interim care orders until the Czech court makes alternative arrangements for him.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I mentioned in argument that this is a case giving rise to very important concerns. Miss Rowley and Mr Veitch indicated that they would wish to appeal if I granted the application for a transfer request; conversely Mr Newton QC indicated that he would wish to appeal if I declined it. As I indicated to counsel I would, either way, grant permission to appeal as I consider that this case that falls within CPR 52.6(b) i.e. there is a compelling reason why an appeal should be heard. In my opinion the Court of Appeal needs to consider the very difficult issues thrown up by this case and to give definitive guidance as to how future Article 15 requests in public law cases should be dealt with. Certainly I would have thought that they would wish to emphasise that any court hearing a public law case where there is a potential Article 15 aspect should raise this with counsel at an early stage and give consideration to transfer to the High Court. But that will be for them. I confine myself only to granting permission to appeal to the local authority and to the Guardian. Any appeal must be heard with great expedition and I understand that the Court of Appeal would be able to hear the appeal in the first week of the forthcoming Lent term, and in fact will be giving directions later today.</p>
