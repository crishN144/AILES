I have already sketched out the background in a judgment I handed down in public on 2 November 2006 and need not repeat what I said on that occasion: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re Brandon Webster, Norfolk County Council v Webster </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2006/2733" uk:canonical="[2006] EWHC 2733 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWHC 2733 (Fam)</ref> at paras [2]-[7].

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Central to the allegations in the earlier care proceedings in relation to A, B and C were allegations that B had suffered non-accidental fractures at the hands of one or other or both of the parents. His Honour Judge Barham read and heard evidence from two experts, Dr D, a consultant radiologist, and Mr E, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon. He also read but did not hear oral evidence from two other experts, Dr F, a consultant paediatrician, and Dr G, a consultant community paediatrician. In substance the expert evidence, albeit with different shades of emphasis and certainty, all pointed in the same direction. In the judgment he gave on 21 May 2004, Judge Barham found that B had suffered six fractures in all: fractures to a rib, to both arms and to both legs. Those fractures had occurred on at least two occasions and possibly on more than two occasions. The experts ruled out all the various alternative possibilities that had been put forward by the parents to explain the fractures: osteomyelitis, osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone disease), poor nutrition and scurvy or rickets. The experts also rejected as plausible explanations of the fractures any of the following: parental restraint, the child getting a leg caught in a stair gate, or the injuries having been inflicted by child A (who at the relevant time, I might add, was not yet four years old). Judge Barham found that the injuries were non-accidental and that the only possible perpetrators were the parents.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the further judgment that he gave on 24 November 2004, Judge Barham made additional findings against the parents. I need not go into the details, for I am going to direct that both of Judge Barham&#8217;s judgments be released into the public domain (see paragraph [61] below), but these additional findings were, on any view, much less grave than his findings in relation to the injuries to B. </p>

Unsurprisingly, NCC&#8217;s threshold statement rehearsed Judge Barham&#8217;s findings in the earlier care proceedings. The core of NCC&#8217;s case was &#8211; and is &#8211; contained in the following two paragraphs:</p>

It is acknowledged, however, that is over 2 years since the findings in respect of [B]&#8217;s injuries were made, and over a year and a half since the conclusion of [A, B and C]&#8217;s care proceedings.

The number and distribution of fractures suggests all the child&#8217;s limbs were forcibly twisted on one or more occasions with enough force to cause the fractures. The degree of force is inconsistent with normal handling. The degree of force identified to cause these injuries is described as such that an observer would be clear that an assault had occurred. It is my opinion that a 4 year old would have insufficient strength to inflict these injuries on a 2 year old sibling. Indeed, significant force would have been required to inflict these fractures in a child of almost 2 years old who would be able to resist any painful stimuli &#8230;</p>

Previous DNA testing of one of the mother&#8217;s siblings had identified a specific mutation indicative of osteogenesis imperfecta (&#8220;OI&#8221;). But DNA testing of the mother showed that she does not carry this variant gene, so that &#8220;the risk of [her] being affected with OI is very low.&#8221; In short, the report indicated that the mother does not have OI.

He suggested that further assessments can contribute to an understanding of potential future risk and that this is something to be explored further during the period between now and the final hearing in June 2007. He made this interesting observation:</p>

At the end of the hearing I reserved judgment. On 1 November 2006 I made an order which lifted many, though not all, of the reporting restrictions that had been imposed by Judge Curl (though leaving Pauffley J&#8217;s order intact) and which permitted the media, though not the general public, to attend the hearing due to take place on 3 November 2006.

The children&#8217;s guardian was represented by Mr Jonathan Bennett. Although the hearing took place in chambers and the general public were not admitted, in accordance with the order I had made on 1 November 2006 the media were allowed to be present. Upwards of twenty journalists, representing both the print and the broadcast media, were in fact present throughout the hearing. Perhaps not surprisingly in the circumstances, both the judgment I handed down on 2 November 2006 and the hearing on 3 November 2006 were the subject of extensive reporting in both the print and the broadcast media.</p>

In compliance with that requirement, Ms Langdale filed a position statement on behalf of NCC which, conveniently and appropriately in the circumstances, contained all the relevant information in a single composite document. Mr Anelay did likewise on behalf of the parents. The position of the children&#8217;s guardian was very clearly set out in an interim report dated 1 November 2006 which obviated the need for Mr Bennett to file a position statement.</p>

It is proposed that when the family leave [the residential unit] on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2006, Brandon and his parents will return to the family home in Cromer, Norfolk for a community based assessment to begin. As part of the assessment Norfolk Children&#8217;s Services and Health will provide support and advice to Mr and Mrs Webster, and monitoring of both Brandon and the family&#8217;s situation as a whole. This is to provide the assessment with the maximum opportunity of success and to ensure, as far as possible, Brandon&#8217;s safety and well-being. </p>

Of necessity the initial part of the plan will already be in place when Brandon returns home with his parents but reviews over the period of assessment will enable Mr and Mrs Webster to participate in further planning. A Family Group Conference as recommended by [the residential unit] will enable the extended family to be part of this process.</p>

This is even more so in view of Dr [L]&#8217; recent report into [B]&#8217;s injuries. Mr and Mrs Webster&#8217;s unwillingness to engage or co-operate with professionals when challenged, and the description of them manipulating and dividing, raises the Local Authority&#8217;s levels of concern regarding their capacity to meet all of Brandon&#8217;s needs to a good and safe enough level in the long term.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Anelay makes no bones about why he is making the application. The parents have never accepted, and despite Dr L&#8217;s report they do not accept, that they caused B&#8217;s fractures. Their case is that there is likely to be (or at any rate a real possibility of) an alternative explanation to be found in genetic or other disorder; alternatively, that there is some other exonerating explanation. They wish to challenge in the present proceedings the medical evidence given in the previous proceedings. They assert that Professor P can bring to the proceedings something new and valuable. In the first place, he will bring a trans&#8211;Atlantic &#8211; a new and different &#8211; perspective to bear. He will not be beholden to what Mr Anelay called &#8216;the traditional English medical approach&#8217;. Secondly, he will be able to give a paediatric overview extending beyond Dr L&#8217;s narrow expertise as a paediatric radiologist. In short, says Mr Anelay, Professor P&#8217;s evidence is likely to be of great assistance.</p>

Moreover, and in any event, he says, it is important to lay the issue to rest &#8211; something, he says, which must be in the interests of all the children and the parents. Crucially, he says, it is in Brandon&#8217;s interests that the medical evidence is tested and any doubts resolved.  The instruction of Professor P is, in the view of the parents, central to that endeavour.</p>

The fact is that Judge Barham made other threshold findings &#8211; in relation to both A and B &#8211; in addition to his findings in relation to B&#8217;s fractures. Mr Anelay cannot gainsay that. But whilst not formally accepting that those other findings would of themselves have sufficed to establish threshold, or that they would, even if sufficient to establish threshold, have justified the making of care orders, Mr Anelay submits that, absent the injuries to B, the outcome of the earlier care proceedings would, or might very well, have been very different. Absent the injuries to B, the children would not, he submits, have been removed permanently from their family. Even if care orders were appropriate, there would not, he suggests, have been, as in the event there were, both freeing orders and adoption orders. I record Mr Anelay&#8217;s submission without comment, for it may yet be something on which this court will have to rule.</p>

I emphasise that this is not because I am persuaded that the parents have yet established a prima facie case justifying the re&#8211;opening of the previous findings. They have not. After all, their chosen expert, Dr L, produced a report that provided absolutely no support for their case. No, it is because it seems to me, in the particular and unusual circumstances of this case, that it is important, as Mr Anelay puts it, to lay this matter to rest once and for all. It is, in my judgment, in Brandon&#8217;s interest, as well as in his parents&#8217; interest, as indeed also in the public interest, that the parents&#8217; allegations &#8211; their allegations that they have been the victims of a miscarriage of justice, and are at risk of suffering a further miscarriage of justice if Brandon&#8217;s fate falls to be determined by reference to the earlier findings &#8211; should be properly explored, and then put to rest one way or the other. </p>

I can understand their view that it would be premature for them to take either step before receiving at least Professor P&#8217;s preliminary findings. But these matters cannot be left hanging indefinitely in the air. I am accordingly going to direct that if their application for permission to instruct a geneticist is indeed to be pursued, then the application must be made as soon as possible following receipt of Professor P&#8217;s preliminary views and in any event by no later than 19 January 2007. Similarly, if the parents are indeed to make an application for permission to re&#8211;open Judge Barham&#8217;s findings, that application must be made by no later than 19 January 2007. Moreover, it must identify, specifically and precisely, and by reference to the appropriate paragraphs of Judge Barham&#8217;s two judgments, which of his findings the parents seek to re&#8211;open.</p>

In other words, we have a system today under which the necessary advocacy is in part written advocacy though still in major part oral advocacy in the traditional manner. This system is intended to further the proper administration of justice. It does so in various ways including, in particular, by shortening hearings (and thereby increasing the throughput of cases through the court system), though at the cost of imposing on the judges the burden of pre-reading &#8211; usually, at least in this Division, in the judge&#8217;s own time &#8211; on a scale that would have astonished our judicial predecessors even in the quite recent past. </p>

The days are past when the business of the judges was the enforcement of morals. A judge, although it may be that on occasions he can legitimately exercise the functions of an aedile, is no censor. And as the Strasbourg jurisprudence establishes (see <span style="font-style:italic">Harris v Harris; Attorney-General v Harris</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 2 FLR 895" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 2 FLR 895</ref>, at [373]), the freedom of expression secured by Article 10 is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received, or regarded as inoffensive, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb the state or any section of the community. Article 10 protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed, but also the form in which they are conveyed. It is not for the court to substitute its own views for those of the press as to what technique of reporting should be adopted by journalists. Article 10 entitles journalists to adopt a particular form of presentation intended to ensure a particularly telling effect on the average reader. As Neill LJ recognised, a tabloid newspaper is entitled to tell the story in a manner which will engage the interest of its readers and the general public. If there is no basis for injuncting a story expressed in the temperate or scholarly language of a legal periodical or the broadsheet press there can be no basis for injuncting the same story simply because it is expressed in the more robust, colourful or intemperate language of the tabloid press.&#8221;</p>

In my judgment, it also provides a strong argument for judges in cases which are controversial, or which have attracted media attention, preparing a short written summary of their conclusions and their reasons which can be made publicly available when the judgment is delivered. </p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[31]   <marker name="tab"/>Cases involving children are currently heard in private in order to protect the anonymity of the children concerned. However, the exclusion of the public from family courts, and the lack of knowledge about what happens in them, easily lead to the accusation of &#8216;secret justice&#8217;. Moreover, judges communicate in carefully reasoned judgments, not soundbites. Thus, even when a judgment is published it is likely to be read in its entirety only by lawyers. </p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[32]   <marker name="tab"/>In my judgment, therefore, if judges wish to avoid misunderstandings about judgments in controversial cases, they should consider preparing short summaries of their reasons which can either be read out or distributed in court when the full judgment is given or handed down. This is not designed either to devalue the judgment or in any way to be a substitute for it. It needs, however, to be borne in mind that a journalist who gets a substantial judgment at 10.30 in the morning and has to write a piece about it against a short deadline cannot be expected to absorb and reproduce every nuance in it in such a short period of time.&#8221;</p>
