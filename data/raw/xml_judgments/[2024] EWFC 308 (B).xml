The first concluded in August 2021 with Ben being placed with a maternal aunt and uncle under a special guardianship order but with the mother residing there also.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Concerns arose about the placement of Ben and the mother with the aunt and uncle. Ben attended nursery on 9 January 2024 with a burn on his hand.  It is said that that occurred in the sole care of the mother.  No medical treatment was sought.  A medical examination was undertaken on 19 January and the burn was described as &#8220;a deep tissue burn&#8221;.  It was said, on balance, that the injury was &#8220;non-accidental&#8221; although now, it is accepted by all that it was accidental.</p>

The local authority said that the accounts of the mother and the aunt and uncle were not consistent.  The aunt and uncle being special guardians agreed to Ben being placed with the paternal grandparents on 2 February 2024, where he has remained.  </p>

They were both represented having parental responsibility and, on 22 May 2024, their position crystalised in that they did not seek his return to their care.  I discharged their special guardianship order and, by agreement, discharged them as parties.</p>

Only the mother has needed to give evidence and my order of 22 July 2024 made clear that the parties must take into account the good practice guidance and that, when asking questions of her, it must be at a pace and consistent with her understanding: using simple common words and phrases; asking short questions; be slow to allow time to answer; allow breaks; and be sympathetic to the fact that she was young.  I am clear that all that was done, save the breaks, because she was, as I will set out, clearly able to give her evidence.</p>

They take the view that she is a young mother that requires support and she should not be disadvantaged by her age.  They believe that, in the medium to long term, that that would be in Ben&#8217;s welfare.  They are concerned that, even with good intentions, if Ben were in the care of the grandparents, the role of the mother would be marginalised and, in the long term, that would be detrimental to Ben.</p>

What he wants is for Ben to be in the care of his parents.  He is clear that they would provide security and stability; that only they could provide and that they are committed to Ben in the long term.  That is very clear also from the grandparents who want the care of Ben and will, they say, promote a relationship between Ben and the mother.</p>

The aunt and uncle had left her overnight to go to London to see the New Year&#8217;s fireworks. She was at home with a list of chores.  One of those included the ironing. She gave Ben his breakfast, she put the iron down and left the room to empty the washing machine. When she was not there Ben touched the iron. She said he was not distressed but he might have been in shock. He ran to her and she put his hand under cold water.  She was then frightened about what had happened.  She told the aunt and uncle when they noticed it that it was caused on a radiator.  They thought it was superficial although, clearly, both the nursery and the hospital took a different view and the hospital being clear it was a deep burn.</p>

Firstly, their view of contact at the time of the SGO assessment.  Three times per week was too much.  That Ben himself was over-tired and required a lot of input to settle after contact.  That contact impacted on the ability to undertake normal family events and activities and therefore, their proposal was once per week after school 15:00 until 18:00, and then once per month 09:00 until 18:00.  Their view was that contact needed to be supervised.  They think that they need to be safeguarded against this mother because they are worried about allegations that she will make. They say that she has made allegations against the aunt, uncle and cousin and there was concern about a TikTok film in 2022 and, as such, they would not be prepared to supervise contact because of potential false allegations.

He was going to go to be under anaesthetic for 4 hours and likely afterwards to be in discomfort and pain. She feels that their decision-making process by the grandparents was to excluded her and the view was that she should not be there in hospital. The grandparents say they listened to professionals and the guardian thinks that, perhaps, people have blown this out of proportion.  When looking objectively at that situation, there is merit in what the mother says.  By this time in Ben&#8217;s life the only long-term carer, throughout his short life, was his mother.  There was clearly a very good, stable relationship and bond between them and that Ben would have wanted the comfort and presence of his mother at this time.  I am sorry that neither the grandparents, nor indeed, the guardian, could see that.  I agree with Mr Howard, on behalf of the mother, that the decision-making in that respect was wrong.  </p>

Until that time she had always been his carer.  I accept that the move from the grandparents back to the mother would be, also, a significant change.  Keeping him with the grandparents would mean that his relationship with his mother would be very different and would reduce; she would not be his main carer.
