The Children&#8217;s Guardian resists that application making the potent point that there would be an inherent incongruity in one arm of the State (namely the Counter Terrorism Command within the Metropolitan Police &#8216;SO15&#8217; and the Home Office) maintaining that the father is a terrorist with an Islamist extremist mind set whilst another (the local authority and the court) appears powerless to take any step so as to protect the welfare interests of the child.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The <span style="font-weight:bold">local authority</span> considered its position following the outcome of the application by the Secretary of State for the Home Office (SSHD) for PII. On 2 May 2017, a lengthy document entitled &#8216;Local Authority&#8217;s Position in relation to Threshold&#8217; was submitted by Mr Ashworth on behalf of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. Within that document, he sought to argue that the evidence before the court is or would be insufficient to establish the s.31 (2) threshold criteria on the balance of probabilities. From page 2 to page 13 he identified a number of evidential matters potentially supportive of the assertions that (i) the father has an Islamist extremist mind set; he has travelled to Syria on more than one occasion where he received military training and fought with an Islamist extremist group; (ii) the mother shares the father&#8217;s Islamist extremist mind set and is supportive of the terrorist-related activities in which he has participated; she is therefore unable or unwilling to protect the child; (iii) the father and mother harbour aspirations to take the child to Syria and he is at risk of being taken to a war zone; and (iv) there is a likelihood that the child will suffer significant physical, emotional and developmental harm if the matters alleged against the parents are proven.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Interspersed amongst Mr Ashworth&#8217;s very helpful analysis of the voluminous material are no fewer than 9 inferences which could potentially be drawn, adverse to the parents. He suggested it would be difficult for the court to draw many or all of the potential inferences without straining the evidence to an impermissible degree.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his initial document, Mr Ashworth had stated that the local authority would not be in a position to call witnesses to prove a case on threshold. He asserts that, at its highest, the threshold relies extensively on hearsay evidence and assessments made by others. During oral submissions, Mr Ashworth modified his position on witnesses indicating that a police officer attached to the Safeguarding Team within SO15 &#8211; who has already supplied a statement &#8211; could be a witness, so too the allocated social worker who, in July 2016, produced a lengthy analysis of the available material suggestive that the child may be at risk of suffering significant harm. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I would observe that there is the potential for several other witnesses as well. Those who, in June 2014, dealt with the father&#8217;s interview under Schedule 7 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/11" uk:canonical="2000 c. 11" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Terrorism Act 2000</ref>, and the two police officers who, in January 2016, apprehended and interviewed the mother pursuant to Schedule 7. All of those have made statements, already filed in these proceedings.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Ashworth acknowledges that the lies told by the parents might lead to the drawing of permissible inferences but reminds me that the judge would have to give himself a Lucas direction and then exercise &#8220;great caution&#8221; when considering &#8220;how far any inferences might go.&#8221; He reminded me in oral argument that the mother&#8217;s response to admitted lies about her final destination when she flew to Barcelona in January 2016 was that she had panicked because she was worried she would not be permitted to fly to Turkey to join her husband for a family holiday. I would only comment that the court would surely have a duty to consider all aspects of the mother&#8217;s lies to the police at the airport, how and why she reacted as she did before coming to a concluded view as to whether inferences could legitimately be drawn.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to the decision made by the Home Office that the father&#8217;s application for a passport should be refused, Mr Ashworth submits that although the assessment of the SSHD and her officials could potentially be attributed some weight by the court, the upholding of the SSHD&#8217;s claim for PII means there is no primary evidence before the court to underpin that assessment. That is correct.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As for the way in which hearsay evidence should be treated, Mr Ashworth referred to the decision in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re J</span><span style="font-style:italic"/><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2015/222" uk:canonical="[2015] EWCA Civ 222" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWCA Civ 222</ref> relying upon the proposition that &#8211; &#8220;Hearsay evidence &#8230; although admissible, has strict limitations if a parent challenges the hearsay evidence by giving contrary oral evidence at a hearing. If the local authority is unwilling or unable to produce a witness who can speak to the relevant matter by first hand evidence, it may find itself in &#8216;great or even insuperable&#8217; difficulties in proving the fact or matter alleged by the local authority which is challenged.&#8221;</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_10">
	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I pause to observe that here the evidence against the parents as it emerges from the papers does not exclusively, or even largely, rest on hearsay. I believe it was a correct analysis when, in the March judgment, I referred to it as &#8220;a mixture of established facts as well as matters which give rise to likely inferences.&#8221; In any event, judges in the Family Court routinely confront hearsay evidence (for example in cases where sexual abuse is alleged) and are well aware of the need to exercise great caution as they weigh that evidence alongside everything else known within the proceedings.</p>

	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Ashworth drew my attention to those passages of the police statements and in the letter from the Passport Office where it is said, &#8220;Information suggests the following &#8230;&#8221; in support of his hypothesis that there is not sufficient evidence to satisfy the threshold criteria. I quite accept that by reason of the outcome of the SSHD&#8217;s application for PII, there will be no more illumination as to the material underpinning those assessments. But the question of the weight to be attached to that material, if I were to decide the proceedings should lead to a fact finding hearing, would surely be a matter for the trial judge. His duty would be to survey the &#8216;wide canvas&#8217; of material from all sources (and of whichever quality) before arriving at his eventual conclusions.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Upon a detailed scrutiny of the whole of the available evidence, Mr Ashworth contends there is no realistic prospect of the local authority being able to satisfy the court that the threshold criteria are established to the required standard of proof. He suggests that unless the parents make significant admissions when they give evidence (and they are of course compellable), the threshold criteria are unlikely to be established on the balance of probabilities.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_13">
	  <num>13.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is also a factor, in the view of the local authority, that the parents have been very cooperative and fully engaged with the supervising social workers. There are no concerns about the way in which they have been looking after their child. He has been the subject of a Child in Need plan since January 2016. I would observe, however, that by reason of the status of the proceedings and the parents&#8217; denial that in any sense there is justification for them, there has been no direct work (as Mr Ashworth confirms is the case) in relation to alleged extremist views. And, for the much the same reasons, there has been no attempt made to seek to engage the parents in the Channel Programme. For the moment, of course, there is no foundation for the making of such a request for engagement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The <span style="font-weight:bold">mother&#8217;s position</span> is that she agrees the proceedings should be brought to a conclusion. It is Mr Barnes&#8217; over-arching submission that the interests of the child are not served by extending the court process in circumstances where the local authority has concluded that there is no real likelihood that it can discharge the evidential burden necessary to satisfy threshold. He argues that the imperative for proceedings to conclude is especially strong where they have already been on foot for some 11 months and where, during that period of intense scrutiny, no additional welfare concerns have arisen.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Barnes accepts that it is for the court to consider, on the basis of submissions by the local authority and the Children&#8217;s Guardian, as to whether the case continues. He emphasised however that there is or may be a difficulty, were the case to proceed, in achieving fairness. That is because in relation to decisions made by others about the assessment of risk, it will not be possible for witnesses to be called to describe how those decisions have been made. He seeks to argue that, accordingly, the case should not continue.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In response to that submission, I emphasise that judges are alert always to the need to be fair. They are acutely conscious of the distinction between the various categories of evidence &#8211; for example, first hand (direct), circumstantial and hearsay evidence. They are properly to be regarded as specialists in knowing how to weigh the several types of material to achieve a fair and just result. That is what they do. It is the very essence of judging.</p>

He submits that the local authority&#8217;s analysis of the available material has been &#8220;careful, detailed and robust&#8221; and that there would &#8220;rarely if ever be a solid advantage to a child&#8221; in proceeding with the application &#8220;where there is no prospect of succeeding in proving the threshold criteria.&#8221;</p>

These were family proceedings, not ordinary civil proceedings where the function of the judge is in large part to act as the umpire determining the competing cases put before him by the litigants. In ordinary civil litigation the circumstances in which a judge can prematurely stop a case are limited, albeit less limited now in accordance with the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 than was once upon a time the case. But these are not ordinary civil proceedings, they are family proceedings, where it is fundamental that the judge has an essentially inquisitorial role, his duty being to further the welfare of the children which is, by statute, his paramount consideration. It has long been recognised &#8211; and authority need not be quoted for this proposition &#8211; that for this reason a judge exercising the family jurisdiction has a much broader discretion than he would in the civil jurisdiction to determine the way in which an application of the kind being made by the father should be pursued. In an appropriate case he can summarily dismiss the application as being, if not groundless, lacking enough merit to justify pursuing the matter. He may determine that the matter is one to be dealt with on the basis of written evidence and oral submissions without the need for oral evidence. He may, as [the circuit judge] did in the present case, decide to hear the evidence of the applicant and then take stock of where the matter stands at the end of the evidence.&#8221;</span></p>

If there is or may be solid advantage in the children in doing so, then the inquiry will proceed, albeit it may be on the basis of submissions rather than evidence. But if the judge is satisfied that no advantage to the children is going to be obtained by continuing the investigation further, then it is perfectly within his case management powers and the proper exercise of his discretion so to decide and to determine that the proceedings should go no further.&#8221;</span></p>

Mr Ashworth began by stating this was an unusual case in which the local authority was not in possession of its own evidence and had been relying upon the assessments of others in relation to the issue of risk. When pressed for the reason, Mr Ashworth frankly conceded that it was because the local authority wished the court to be at the forefront in terms of responsibility for decision making.</p>

Either there is a firm basis for finding, on the balance of probabilities, that the parents represent the risks to their child&#8217;s welfare identified within Mr Ashworth&#8217;s analysis (see paragraph 3 above) or there is not. Suspicion, quite obviously, would not be enough. It should be for a judge, the essential decision maker, to analyse and weigh all the available material, consider the parents&#8217; responses to it and determine whether there is a likelihood that in their care the child would be exposed to the risk of harm. The judge would have to decide whether the parents hold extremist Islamist mind-sets, whether they are supportive of terrorist-related activities in which the father has participated, whether the father has travelled to Syria where he received military training and fought with an Islamist extremist group and whether the parents harbour aspirations to take the child to Syria or other war zones. The judge would also determine whether the parents or either of them were unable or unwilling to protect the child from harm.</p>

I said that &#8220;unless there was a disclosure mechanism for receiving and considering relevant, highly sensitive material from the SSHD then it was difficult to envisage a future for this application.&#8221; Whereas, in the second (between paragraphs 42 to 48), I associated myself with the submissions made by Ms Wheeler QC on behalf of the SSHD as to the existence of available evidence from which the court may be able to draw inferences and find the threshold criteria satisfied.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The explanation for my divergent views is simply this &#8211; my position shifted as the result of the PII hearing and the persuasive, analytical arguments advanced by Ms Wheeler. As I said during this hearing, I am only human; and would add that I must be entitled to view matters differently in circumstances which have developed over time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not agree with those who contend that the evidential result is ultimately highly likely to be a conclusion that the threshold is not satisfied. On the basis of the material, such as it is, it would be quite impossible to say that. I am unimpressed with the local authority&#8217;s assessment that there is insufficient to carry the case across the threshold. The evidence should be considered in all its forms by a judge and then an informed, fair and balanced decision will be taken. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Parker suggests that the primary source material is limited broadly to the father&#8217;s Terrorism Act conviction (which he seeks to blame on poor legal advice), the photographs (of the father posing with guns in front of what are said to be Islamic State flags) and alleged lies told by the parents in relation to travel and other plans. I agree that the court will need to analyse the plausibility of the father&#8217;s evidence in relation to his conviction and scrutinise the photographs as well as the explanations given for them (said to be an interest in hunting). A similar exercise would have to be undertaken in relation to the mother&#8217;s evidence and the reasons she puts forward for lying to police about her destination when leaving Gatwick with the child in January 2016.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">What I cannot forecast is how any fact finding exercise would end. All I can say is that I am not persuaded there is so little of any evidential value that it would be appropriate, in this child&#8217;s interests, to permit the withdrawal of the application. After all, I have made successive s.38 interim findings, with the encouragement of the local authority, so as to found interim supervision orders. In other words, I have expressed myself satisfied there is reasonable cause to believe that if an interim order were not made, the child would be at risk of significant harm. To come to a view that the evidence upon which the interim orders were founded has so many integral flaws or was so unreliable that I should now allow the local authority to withdraw its application seems illogical, if not nonsensical.</p>

Those, including the local authority, who seek to argue that because the parents&#8217; care of their child has been observed to be very good are rather missing the point of these proceedings. This is not a neglect or physical abuse case. The risk is that by reason of his parents&#8217; alleged extremist mind-set, terrorist sympathies and desire to exit this country with the child and travel to a war zone they represent a danger to this child. </p>

Assuming that conclusions were drawn, adverse to the parents, an assessment of the extent to which they are able to acknowledge the risks they pose to their child and their willingness to accept assistance from those agencies would be possible.  Even although the Channel Programme is voluntary, the local authority would be able to help in firstly accessing the programme and then monitoring progress.</p>

They argue that accordingly the relevance of any finding would be diminished. My response to that is that at this stage &#8211; prior to fact finding and expert assessment &#8211; it is simply too soon to know what public law orders might be called for.</p>

It seems altogether likely that, just as now, both parents will have Leading as well as Junior Counsel. It will be for the local authority to decide whether to once more instruct Leading Counsel as it has done for several of the earlier hearings. Mr Parker&#8217;s wise, well-researched and diligent work on behalf of the guardian could not have been improved upon. There could be no basis for saying that because she does not have the benefit of Leading Counsel there is the potential for any inequality of arms. Clearly there is not. I foresee not the slightest difficulty in achieving a fair trial. </p>

I end where I began with Mr Parker&#8217;s perceptive comment &#8211; there would be an inherent incongruity in one arm of the State maintaining that the father is a terrorist with an Islamist extremist mind set whilst another appears powerless to take any step so as to protect the welfare interests of the child.</p>
