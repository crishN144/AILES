	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 23 April PC was arrested regarding an offence of criminal damage. The arresting officers had concerns in respect of PC&#8217;s mental health. Although consideration was given as to whether he should be removed to a place of safety under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> an ambulance was called. Due to delays in the ambulance arriving the officers decided to take PC to a hospital that was operated by Surrey and Sussex NHS Healthcare Trust (&#8216;the Hospital Trust&#8217;). The mental health services were provided by the Second Respondent, Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (&#8216;the Trust&#8217;).</p>

PC was assessed by a psychiatric liaison nurse employed by the Trust,  the notes describe PC as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;agitated, aggressive, shouting and swearing, flushed&#8217;.</span> The plan was to see how his mental state was over the next 24 hours given the suggestion of drug use.

They did not arrange a Mental Health Act assessment as they were advised that PC was not fit to be assessed. They suggested that he was kept in the police station as a place of safety under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/136" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 136</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MHA 1983</ref>, which was done at 10.44. CJLDS and the Trust attended a meeting and updated the police about midday, informing them that PC was in line for the next bed. The local authority were advised that his PACE clock would expire around 12.30 pm so there was no legal framework to hold PC after that time. The local authority also suggested that PC was transferred to a Health Based Place of Safety (&#8216;HBPoS&#8217;) as soon as one was available.</p>

The local authority state they did not receive any update regarding PC&#8217;s presentation nor were they advised that he could be assessed under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MHA 1983</ref>.</p>

The lorazepam arrived about the same time and a health care Practitioner (nurse), employed by Mountain Healthcare was able to give the medication to PC. It was 2x1mg tablets, which he eventually took with water whilst still in the body cuff. Due to high level of concern about PC he had been on constant observation since the previous evening.</p>

By 2.45 pm on that day it was clear the AMHP who had conducted the first assessment was not going to be available until later in the day to make any application for admission. Effectively, there was no means to admit PC to hospital under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 2</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MHA 1983</ref> unless a further assessment was undertaken. The Official Solicitor considers that this could and should have been obvious by just after 9.30 am that morning when the AMHP realised they could not access either of the medical recommendations of the previous day. The local authority state it was apparent to the AMHP that there was no bed, so a further assessment would not have resolved the issue regarding the ongoing legal framework regarding PC&#8217;s deprivation of liberty.</p>

Article 5(1) ECHR guarantees that no one will be deprived of their liberty save in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law. The notion of &#8216;lawfulness&#8217; requires a fair and proper procedure offering the person sufficient protection against arbitrary deprivation of their liberty.</p>
