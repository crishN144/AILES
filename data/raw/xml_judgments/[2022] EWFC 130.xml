	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">On the afternoon of Monday, 1 February 2021, child B, born in &#160;2020, was taken to hospital by ambulance.  It was reported that he had sustained a fall and banged his head.  He was at the time in the family living room under the apparent supervision of his older brother, who I shall refer to as A.  No adult witnessed what occurred.  It was reported by the mother, who I shall refer to as &#8216;M&#8217;, the Uncle who I shall refer to as &#8216;U&#8217; and his partner, who I shall refer to as &#8216;GF&#8217;, all of who were in the next room, that they had heard a loud bang, and were on the scene within seconds, scooping B up from the floor.  He quickly became profoundly unwell, he collapsed and his breathing became erratic.  The emergency services were summoned, and the paramedics arrived remarkably quickly.  He was bradycardic and deeply unconscious.  He had seizures en route to the hospital.</p>

An MR scan confirmed the collections, but also showed signs of vein injury over the brain, and blood inside the spinal canal.  It also demonstrated a significant benign enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces, known as BESS.  Eye examination identified innumerable bilateral and layered retinal haemorrhages.  B had further seizures, but very fortunately rapidly improved and, in fact, was discharged into foster care just two weeks later.</p>

It is not unusual for the court to thank counsel for their assistance, but I especially wish to record the impressive professional conduct of those representing the parties for many reasons, not least the difficulties of the litigation history in this case, which has made the case, in some ways, more difficult.  Their conduct has been exemplary in every way, and is reflected in the way the case has been managed and the sophisticated written submissions, which I have received at the conclusion of this case, and for which I am extremely grateful.</p>

It is for the local authority to prove its case. It is not for the mother to disprove it. In particular it is not for the mother to disprove it by proving how the injuries were in fact sustained. Neither is it for the court to determine how the injuries were sustained. The court's task is to determine whether the local authority has proved its case on the balance of probability. Where, as here, there is a degree of medical uncertainty and credible evidence of a possible alternative explanation to that contended for by the local authority, the question for the court is not 'has that possible alternative explanation been proved' but rather it should ask itself, 'in the light of that possible alternative explanation can the court be satisfied that the local authority has proved its case on the simple balance of probability.&#8221;</span></p>

I make this point because in my view at times the approach of both the local authority and the Guardian in this case came perilously close to an approach which, on the basis of the expert medical evidence, proceeded on the basis that: 'R' was the victim of a shaking injury because the medical opinion was that this was the most likely cause of his injuries, and the relevant exercise was to consider whether, given their care, and thus the opportunity they had to so injure 'R', the parents could show that they did not injure him.&#8221;</span></p>

The court will consider grave allegations with proper care, but evidence is evidence and the approach to analysing it remains the same in every case. In my view, statements of principle (some relied on in this case) that suggest that an enhanced level of evidential cogency or clarity is required in order to prove a very serious allegation do not assist and may lead a fact-finder into error. Despite all disclaimers, reference to qualitative concepts such as cogency and clarity may wrongly be taken to imply that some elevated standard of proof is called for.</span></p>

This would indeed be to reverse the burden of proof.  However, if the judge&#8217;s observations are understood to mean that account should not be taken, to whatever extent is appropriate in the individual case, of the lack of a history of injury from the carer of a young child, then I respectfully consider that they go too far.  Doctors, social workers and courts are in my view fully entitled to take into account the nature of the history given by a carer.  The absence of any history of a memorable event where such a history might be expected in the individual case may be very significant.  Perpetrators of child abuse often seek to cover up what they have done.  The reason why paediatricians may refer to the lack of a history is because individual and collective clinical experience teaches them that it is one of a number of indicators of how the injury may have occurred.  Medical and other professionals are entitled to rely upon such knowledge and experience in forming an opinion about the likely response of the individual child to the particular injury, and the court should not deter them from doing so.  The weight that is then given to any such opinion is of course a matter for the judge. In the present case, an adult was undoubtedly in the closest proximity to the baby whenever the injuries occurred and the absence of any account of a pain reaction on the baby&#8217;s part on any such occasion was therefore one of the matters requiring careful assessment&#8221;.</span></p>

It is this: in the criminal jurisdiction the "lie" is never taken, of itself, as direct proof of guilt. As is plain from the passage quoted from Lord Lane's judgment in&#160;Lucas,&#160;where the relevant conditions are satisfied the lie is "capable of amounting to a corroboration". In recent times the point has been most clearly made in the Court of Appeal Criminal Division in the case of&#160;R v Middleton&#160;[2001] Crim.L.R. 251.&#160;In my view there should be no distinction between the approach taken by the criminal court on the issue of lies to that adopted in the family court.  Judges should therefore take care to ensure that they do not rely upon a conclusion that an individual has lied on a material issue as direct proof of guilt.&#8221;</span></p>

If the issue for the tribunal to decide is whether to believe X or Y on the central issue/s, and the evidence is clearly one way then there will be no need to address credibility in general. However, if the tribunal looks to find support for their view, it must caution itself against treating what it finds to be an established propensity to dishonesty as determinative of guilt for the reasons the Recorder gave in [40]. Conversely, an established propensity to honesty will not always equate with the witness's reliability of recall on a particular issue.</span></p>

In these circumstances, I venture to suggest that it would be good practice when the tribunal is invited to proceed on the basis , or itself determines, that such a direction is called for, to seek Counsel's submissions to identify: (i) the deliberate lie(s) upon which they seek to rely; (ii) the significant issue to which it/they relate(s), and (iii) on what basis it can be determined that the only explanation for the lie(s) is guilt. The principles of the direction will remain the same, but they must be tailored to the facts and circumstances of the witness before the court.&#8221;</span></p>

There will be cases where the manner in which evidence is given about such personal matters will properly assume prominence.

The uncle was first in the room, and picked B up from the floor, passing him swiftly to his mother.  B stopped crying and then collapsed, he clenched his fists, arched his back, stiffened, his breathing slowed, it became laboured and erratic.  He then went limp, his eyes half-open.

All experts deferred to Professor Fielder on the issues of ophthalmology, yet his conclusions proved to be in some ways the most important and controversial in this case, providing a tipping point in relation to many of the experts.

The presence of macular changes reduces the differential diagnosis to trauma.  Putting it, for him at least, at the top of the list.  A source of some inquiry was the assertion that whilst retinal haemorrhages may be linked to cases of BESS, he could find no causal link between BESS and retinal haemorrhages, indeed, he stuck resolutely to the view that a matchstick fall could not cause the injuries identified in B.</p>

I confess, I was troubled about that area of the evidence, not least of course because those &#8220;opinions&#8221; were not before me, but also it seemed to me that he had sought comfort (as well as confirmation) of his own conclusions.  They were not, as I have said, before the court, I do not understand how these meetings arose. I do not know what sort of discussions took place between those experts, but it is an aspect which is troubling, that is to say the combination of Professor&#160;Fielder himself being worried about it and seeking support as he had, I think, from the conclusions from Dr Oates and from others.

It struck me several times during the course of his examination and cross-examination that he combined those rare qualities of a high degree of clinical experience, excellence and learning with an appropriately open mind.  He is very obviously able, discussing each aspect and the foundation of either clinical experience and/or learning, and was able to contrast and comment on the two.  For example only, in considering the blood in the spinal column, Mr Calisto said that it was not possible to say whether it was caused by a direct bleeding or had tracked down, but he was able to discuss (in-depth) the strength and weaknesses of the arguments for and against.  For example, Mr Calisto was able to bring in the Choudhary paper, which had been relied on by Dr Oates.  They were all good examples of the considerable persuasive force and strength of Mr Calisto's evidence, and just how they applied to this case.  It was impressive and I rely on it.  He brought to this case a depth and intelligence which is invaluable.</p>

He went back to the kitchen. Some minutes later he heard a thud and rushed through.  B was on the floor. He said initially his feet were nearest to the sofa.

He did not react at all when she passed , when she passed through, he was doing as he had done previously, simply watching the film.  She described the really horrible loud thud. She confirmed the evidence, both of U and the mother.  It is true, in relation to a number of witnesses, that the description of the noise which brought them back into the living room was different or had changed, but I do not think there is anything in that.

I have reconsidered all the material that is now available to me, and I remain strongly of the conclusion that was entirely the correct decision, and nobody now suggests otherwise.  I bear in mind the evidence before the court, the very helpful expert assessment of A and of his functioning.  There is no doubt that A can have problems of emotional regulation, but each witness has consistently said on that day he was calm, he is a boy who wears his emotions, his moods on his sleeve.  That day he was calm and there is no suggestion of anything different.  Indeed, so calm that he was pretty disengaged from the comings and goings.  Of course, it is not unknown for a sibling to give another a &#8220;push&#8221; in the wrong direction, but there is absolutely nothing here to support that conjecture, nor less of a shake.

Inevitably, where medical experts disagree, the court must bear in mind the rubric that today's medical certainty may be discarded by the next generation of experts, together with the hypothesis that causation must not be dismissed just because it is unusual. The court must always exercise considerable caution when considering the significance of expert opinions, particularly where a condition or a combination of conditions is unusual.  Unusual, rare, or unknown conditions do exist, and it is sometimes not possible to identify what is not known or understood.  What has been described in so many cases as a known unknown. </p>

That is particularly so where the medical evidence is only one part of the evidence.  As there is no direct evidence of inflicted injury, that diagnosis may be just as much a hypothesis and just as contentious as an unknown cause or hypothesis.  Self-evidently, of course, it is not for the mother or members of the family to prove anything.</p>

Each are specialists within their own discipline and respected the frontiers of their knowledge and expertise.  Generally, each, I thought, were willing to acknowledge the perspectives of the others and possessed a good knowledge of the science and research of their own, but also beyond their specialities.  I do bear in mind that each deferred to other opinions and were clearly affected by the conclusions of Professor Fielder in the field of ophthalmology.  Equally, it would be too easy when reaching conclusions to look at each piece of evidence in isolation, that is to say in a linear way.  However, it is important to look at each piece of evidence separately and together.  I am satisfied that, generally, the medical witnesses did not arrive at their conclusions by a process of exclusion, and did try to put the ophthalmological evidence to one side if they could, although it was plain that each were affected by it.</p>

Ultimately, I have concluded that the evidence is far from clear cut.   All the witnesses accepted that a severe BESS, which had previously been an unidentified mechanism of how subdural haemorrhages occur, is not in doubt but there is significant debate as to the severity and extent, that is to say whether they are shallow, unilateral or extensive or bilateral.</p>

I am conscious that having regard to the qualifications that they made, nonetheless both he and Dr Cartlidge (and, to some extent, Dr Oates too), acknowledged that the injury threshold is lowered, even to the extent that routine activities, such as the baby swing, could cause damage and could be the source of bleeds.  Here too is the relevance of what is known, or not known, about otherwise routine household activities and the effect that may have on B, causing damage and doubly pertinent, of course, if chronic subdural hematomas were already present.</p>

There was little research on the tracking of blood, but without any hesitation I prefer and rely particularly on the evidence of Mr Calisto, who has the direct clinical experience.

As Dr Cartlidge so candidly put it, it was the eye injuries which led him to conclude that a shaking mechanism was the more likely mechanism as opposed to the fall.
