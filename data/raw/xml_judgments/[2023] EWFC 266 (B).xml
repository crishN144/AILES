	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In 2019 the wife applied for non-molestation and occupation orders, although the parties tried to carry on living in the same home until mid-2020. At that point the wife refused the husband access to the family home and stopped him from seeing the children. She applied to the court for an order under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> to limit the husband to indirect contact with the children. The children have not spent time with him since.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There followed a long legal battle about the children. After a 7-day fact-finding hearing in 2021, Deputy District Judge Leigh-Smith found that the husband had bullied, coerced and controlled the wife throughout the whole of their ten year marriage. The judge also found that, once their marriage had broken down, the husband was so driven to harm and undermine the wife that he did so despite the harm that it caused the children. The judge refused to allow the husband direct contact with the children and made an occupation order excluding him from the family home.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">After further hearings, the Children Act proceedings ended with an order allowing only indirect contact. The husband was required to undergo therapeutic work and risk assessments before direct contact could be considered. Despite this, the husband made a new application without completing all the required therapeutic work. As a result, the court imposed a &#8220;section 91(14) bar&#8221; preventing him from making further applications regarding the children without the court&#8217;s permission until the eldest child turns 16.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A Financial Dispute Resolution (FDR) appointment was scheduled for May 2022 but had to be adjourned because the husband had not provided several of the documents that had been ordered to prepare. District Judge Ayers attached a penal notice to the outstanding directions warning that further breaches would be a contempt of court, and ordered the husband to pay the wife&#8217;s costs relating to the wasted hearing.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_14">
	  <num>14.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Due to the history of domestic abuse, the FDR judge ruled that it would not be appropriate for the husband to cross-examine the wife himself at trial. Instead, the judge set out how cross-examination was to take place if the husband did not have a lawyer at the hearing. He directed that the husband would have to send to the court a list of the questions he wanted to ask the wife at least five days before the final hearing. The trial judge would then review the list of questions and ask the relevant questions herself during the hearing.</p>

	  <num>15.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> In light of the abuse, the judge also made &#8220;participation directions&#8221; providing for separate waiting areas, entrances and exits so that the parties would not encounter each other outside the courtroom, and for privacy screens to be placed in the courtroom so that the parties would not see each other during the hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Unfortunately, the hearing in February 2023 had to be cancelled because there was no judge available. The parties were only notified of this the day before the hearing. By that time, the husband should have submitted his list of cross-examination questions, filed a position statement and liaised with the wife&#8217;s lawyers regarding the asset schedule. He had done none of those things, nor did he do so in the 8 months between February 2023 and 25 October 2023 when the case came before me.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On Friday 20 October 2023, the husband emailed the court stating that he would not be attending the hearing on medical grounds. In the email, he also raised concerns about the wife&#8217;s care of the children that had nothing to do with the financial proceedings. He asked the court not to share the email with the wife.</p>

Not infrequently 'medical' grounds are advanced, often connected with the stress of litigation. Parties who think that they thereby compel the court not to proceed with the hearing or that their non-attendance somehow strengthens the application for an adjournment are deeply mistaken. The decision whether or not to adjourn remains one for the judge.&#8221;</span></p>

At no point did she ever say how much commission she receives or hopes to achieve. She should have done. In the end, I had to hunt through the disclosure bundle myself to find this out. It turns out that in the last 12 months she has received &#163;30,100 in commission. Since the wife has not tried to convince me that this is unusual, I assume it is sustainable. That takes her gross income to &#163;120,000 per annum, giving an average net monthly income of &#163;6,200.</p>

Repayment of this debt has never been included in the calculation of any of his settlement proposals. Second, if it were to be considered, it would fall at the very softest end of the scale described by His Honour Judge Hess in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">P v Q </span>[2022] EWFC B9. Importantly, it would not impact his ability to get a mortgage. Finally, it relates almost entirely to legal fees incurred in the Children Act proceedings and I do not want to make a back-door costs order. I have already decided that the wife&#8217;s debts should not be included as a separate capital need within her needs assessment. In my judgment, neither should the husband&#8217;s.</p>

Homes are of fundamental importance and there is nothing more awful than homelessness. So in the ordinary case the court&#8217;s first concern will be to provide a home for the primary carer and the children (whose welfare is the first consideration). Of course in many cases the satisfaction of that may absorb all that is immediately available. But, as in this case, where there is sufficient to go beyond that, the court&#8217;s concern will be to provide the means for the absent parent to rehouse.&#8221;</p>

His own best offer was for a deferred sale of the family home with equal division of the proceeds, or to buy the wife out himself for &#163;74,000. The second of those proposals was obviously unrealistic &#8211; he had no way of raising any funds at that time to buy the wife out &#8211; but I accept that it was intended to convey, if a little facetiously, the message that the husband would not accept any figure that the wife would not accept herself. The first proposal is in fact consistent with the award I have made in amount, but not in structure. It should have been obvious to the husband that the court would not countenance leaving them as joint owners of a property given the findings of controlling behaviour that had already been made. In this he was blinded, it seems, by his belief that he will soon be sharing care of the children with the wife. Overall, however, I do not consider that his approach to settlement was noticeably less reasonable than the wife&#8217;s.</p>

He has already received a costs order from DJ Ayers for his wholesale failure to comply with the First Appointment directions. Since then he has failed to comply with the FDR directions to provide updating financial disclosure (including the extremely relevant fact that he had obtained employment), example properties, mortgage information, cross-examination questions, and made a last-minute unsuccessful attempt to adjourn the final hearing. While some of these damaged his ability to present his own case, they have also forced the wife and her lawyers to undertake additional work and considerably reduced the chance of settling the case without a trial.</p>

Deliberately sending all his emails only to the most junior, female, member of the wife&#8217;s team, even when she was on holiday, suggesting private meetings and asking her not to share his messages with her employer, strikes me as an egregious abuse of the obvious power imbalance between them; one which I can only imagine made her deeply uncomfortable.</p>
