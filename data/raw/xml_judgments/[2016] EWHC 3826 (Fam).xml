By then the father seemed to have changed his approach, and expressed himself willing to adhere to the expectations of both the local authority and the Court. The local authority did not pursue its stated intention to seek an interim care order on the basis of removal to foster care. The father gave a number of promises by way of enforceable undertaking not to involve himself with demonstrations and rallies, to educate the children, to co-operate with social services and to introduce the children to the Sufi school of Islam which he asserted is its &#8216;mildest&#8217; branch.  I made orders preventing the father from leaving the jurisdiction, and ordered that their passports continued to be held. I made a supervision order, and gave directions. The local authority selected RX, a practising Muslim cleric who provides advice on religious and cultural matters and who has considerable experience of radicalisation  to assist  the Local Authority with a risk assessment of the family, and I approved this. </span></p>

B was at court, A and R were not.  The father&#8217;s counsel Miss George submitted to me, and I thought that she was right, that it would be necessary for the three young people to be made parties to these proceedings in order to resist any findings of fact sought against them.  I joined them as interveners but declined to adjourn.  I expressed the view, repeated at this hearing, that I would not make any findings against them in the absence of representation, in view of the shortness of time before the hearing.  I urged B to try to find a representative and to persuade A to do so also. I also declined to adjourn in order to permit the father to seek expert evidence as to whether the electronic material had only been saved on devices as opposed to opened, and whether any of could have arrived without being searched for; a mammoth task.  I ruled that a way must be found to deal with these points, and thus it has proved as the local authority have called police expert Mr T to assist. </span></p>

In April 20016 he re-interviewed the father about his Twitter feed account. He now assesses the risk as being higher and particularly high in respect of the two younger children.  He concludes by saying that there had been a &#8220;huge radicalisation element in the lives of the Y family for many years&#8221;.  He came to that view as a result not only of the new material, but the inconsistent and evasive answers of the girls, and the flippant and dismissive response of the boys and other evasions as well.  He is concerned, in particular, about defensiveness, denials and failure to engage with the issues which he raised, which support very strongly, in his estimation, that there has been full engagement with the very worrying material found on the family electronic devices, and alignment with the radicalised sentiments endorsed in and by such material. He considers that the younger children in particular have been put under pressure not to admit to what they know, although they recognise its serious importance and, possibly, adverse effect on the family.  He regards that as a process of radicalisation, namely, the recognition that certain activities exist, that they are not generally acceptable and maybe illegal and, therefore, there is a closing of ranks, dissembling and a failure to acknowledge what is really going on in the family.  In his view - he does not put it in those exact words, but it is the impact of what he says &#8211; that gives rise to further isolation of the children from the general mainstream of the society in which they live, a cleaving to the family, and a general distortion of their thoughts, wishes and feelings. </span></p>

The evidence of the father &#8211; and also from the interviews and statements of the older children - is that he had been intending to join them or to accompany them, but he became unwell and so he could not.  A conversation is recorded by the social worker, in which Mr. Poole asserts that the father had always intended to join them later and relies on this as indicating an inconsistency in the father&#8217;s account.  I do not think it is clear; what he says is ambiguous.  It is notable, however, that he booked the trip three days only before they were due to depart.  That, Mr. Poole suggests, is of some significance in itself as the later the booking, the less likely it was to come to the attention of the authorities.</span></p>

No one, I am told, - or at least the father - has any information as to whether sleeping in a parked car on a beach is lawful in Holland or whether that is likely to come to the attention of the authorities there and it is submitted by Mr. Poole that the plan is vague and unlikely in the circumstances.  </span></p>

They had an itinerary with them which Mr. Poole submits is written in stilted and unusual terms.  It is not the kind of list of activities that one might expect to see, and has detail, particularly in relation to timings, which seems, objectively, unnecessary for this sort of trip. It is suggested that this is a kind of decoy document, intended to distract the authorities from the real purpose and to support the case that this was a weekend jaunt.  Isis documentation online giving guidance about a planned journey to Syria via northern Europe suggests that such documentation might be useful and also suggests obtaining return tickets, so the existence of returns does not help. The father does not have very much money.  The passports had been obtained in contemplation of this trip many months before, costing over &#163;200.  Yet the journey had not been booked.  There are various other expenses, such as the ferry, which cost over &#163;400. The suggestion is that this was a very unusually expensive trip to make for what was going to be just a day and a morning in Holland, for the purposes of a trip to the play park.  The necessity or desirability of visiting that venue has not really been established. </span></p>

The day before the trip was made the father went to two branches of a camping shop, one in Area T and one in Area S, and spent over &#163;600 on equipment.  That equipment has considerable correspondence with a &#8220;suggested equipment list&#8221; in another document called &#8220;Hijrah (emigration) to the Islamic State&#8221;, emanating from supporters of Islamic State which is to be found online, the possession of which is a criminal offence.

He said that he had spent time in Scotland when growing up and had made such trips then. The family had never previously been camping.  He could not explain why this shopping trip had been made the day before the departure of the children, when he was unwell: too unwell to travel to Holland.  In answer to a later question from B as to whether he had made a mistake and the trip had been planned for Easter rather than the summer, he said that he thought it might have been:  he could not really remember. His explanation for going to the Area S outlet was that the Area T shop had not had one item: he thought the camping stove. In fact the majority of the items were bought in the second store. Mr Poole suggests that two shops were used to distract attention from the extent and nature of the purchases.  </span></p>

It supports and has links with Islamic State.  It is a political/ religious organisation.  It has had a number of previous names/identities. (The current name is also spelt in different ways).  It supports the establishment and maintenance of the Caliphate and its expansion potentially worldwide.  It encourages and supports travel to the Middle East for the purpose of supporting Islamic State in armed conflict. It regards secular, national law as invalid and abhorrent as an offence to the Almighty, and seeks the introduction of Sharia law.  A number of its members have travelled or attempted to travel to Syria. Photographs of members brandishing weapons, taken, presumably in Syria, because the members have gone there, have been published online and were found on Y family devices.  Members engage in public protests.  They are often videoed and the videos are posted online to promote the group's activity in which there has been violence against others. Members have been convicted of attempted murder, threats to kill, assaults, and violent disorder.  </span></p>

There are other placards next to the boys.  I note one, relevant to another issue, supporting the introduction of Sharia law for Pakistan, because, the father told me, the students in the Red Mosque had called for Sharia law in Pakistan. </span></p>

Sometimes children are too young even to take persuading, sometimes the placards are put in the child&#8217;s pram.  It could be said that the children, who probably do not understand in the least the point of the demonstration, are being used in order to put over and support adult views, in a way which could be seen as manipulative and even abusive. I recognise that this is not in any way an activity which is limited to any particular social or religious group.  What the father involved the boys in was not illegal, and as a one-off would have been unlikely to have led to any child welfare intervention.  However, the demonstration was linked with ALM, and it was not appropriate, in my view, for the boys to be actively involved in such a demonstration or such an organisation, knowing the views expressed by members and the possible consequences of the expression of those views: a public disturbance over which the father had no control, or the expression of harmful views.  The father said these were peaceful protests but he was not to know that they would be so. Most importantly it demonstrates the influences to which he has wished to or at least been prepared to expose the boys.  It is part of the overall picture.</span></p>

The father is devoutly religious and it seems to me to be well within the acceptable spectrum of behaviour for the children to go to meetings - even if they may not be terribly interested and may not actually understand what is going on - which may express views about religious practices, even though they may be of more interest to the adults than the children.  Those attendances do not seem to me to be of serious significance in themselves, but ALM members, later convicted of terrorist offences were present, and the father could not have predicted exactly what views would be expressed.

The second contained some very inflammatory statements, such as a defence of the killing of Trooper Lee Rigby and other similar plainly radicalised statements.  This speech involved the mocking of a Sheikh who had shown sympathy for the deceased soldier on television.

He told me that respectful attention was given by the audience to the content of these speeches and he would have been aware if the father had left at any time.  The father said that he had left because of the glorification of the killer, then said that he only thought that he may have done so, then wavered again and said that he was not certain of the time in any event.

The father was, at the very least, indifferent to the effect on his boys of hearing what were likely to be firebrand / inflammatory speeches; and the most likely explanation is that he wanted them to be exposed to those expressions of opinion and belief.</span></p>

I accept that, but his evidence was very clear, whereas the father&#8217;s asserted recollection was unimpressively unclear.  Sometimes, of course, lack of clarity can be a pointer towards veracity, but in this case I do not find it to be so.  Z has experience of giving evidence in the courts, as we now know.  In his particular occupation - there is no doubt about that &#8211; he is trained to observe and to make a mental as well as, subsequently, written notes.  He gave his evidence without any sense of overstatement, calmly and factually without any kind of hesitation which might lead to lack of confidence in that evidence. There was none of the dogmatism with which people sometimes cover up uncertainty or invention.  It was not put to him that he was untruthful.  I am convinced by his evidence and am certain that the father was aware of the planning of this meeting and had made a deliberate effort to attend with the children.  He did not have to be there.  He does not suggest that one of the older children was unable to babysit.</span></p>

When the father&#8217;s home was first searched a letter was found from this gentleman from prison; whether it was an original or whether it was a copy does not matter.  I suspect that, in the circumstances, it may very well have been a document made available to a number of people within this circle.  It is a letter which is covered by r.39 of the Prison Regulations, which is intended to go to the legal representative.  It is, in fact, quite a strongly worded letter making various strong comments about religious matters.  It is both assertive and rambling and is quite closely written.  It makes reference to a number of religious concepts, using a number of Arabic words, and also it makes various aggressive comments as to the role of various people in English political life, generally, and those who are connected with the Islamic religion.  The father accepts that it was found in his house.  He told RX that he did not know how he had come by it. He at first told me the same thing.  Then he said that he had been given it, but could not remember who by.  When asked again, he said that it had been a man.  He could not remember who or the circumstances, just that he had been told or encouraged to read it.  He said that he had not read it himself.  He could not remember any conversation with the donor, such as, &#8220;Why are you giving this to me; what this is about; what am I going to get from this; what is its importance?&#8221; and so on.  He cannot say why he kept this document, although he says that he did not read it and never gave it any thought afterwards.  I do not accept this explanation.  He must have known about the contents of and welcomed this letter in order to both have and retain it.</span></p>

It was still in the garage so another car was lent which belonged to the garage.  I do not know who the owner is or the registered keeper, but these three men are registered to drive it.

I have a number of separate photographs of the children and the father, dressed in what looks like Middle Eastern style red-and-white headgear, in the case of both the children and father, with their faces partly obscured by the cloth and holding what I am told are ornamental swords.  The adult children said these had been purchased by the family as a set at a boot fair, or similar outlet, and to be ornamental only.  The two younger children were very little when these photographs were taken and I suppose they may not have been aware of the significance, as it is asserted by Mr. Poole to be, of this style of dress.  The father says also that this cannot be connected with Islamic State because it was not then in existence.  Mr Poole submits that that this is a style of dress associated very much with Islamic fighters, and has been for some time, and that posing with weapons is very much a radicalised style.  Mr. de Burgos accepts that this style of dress and presentation would be regarded, and rightly so, as extremely culturally offensive if worn at a fancy-dress show or party, as to many people&#8217;s eyes it will have very significant associations with terrorism and with politically and religiously motivated violence. </span></p>

There are pictures of the older children, including J, when much younger, also in similar poses, in similar attire and with similar weapons.  There are pictures of A with a gun, which he says was taken when he was working on someone&#8217;s home and he simply asked whether he could pose with that particular gun, an air rifle, as a joke.  There are photographs of the father with a BB gun, also in a very similar pose.  These are strongly reminiscent of the poses in photographs of ALM members posted online, referred to above.  There are photographs of other weapons, the significance of which, the family has not been able to explain.

RX told me that there is a point at the holiest moment of Prayer where this gesture, the &#8220;shahada&#8221; is made with the hand held low, in order to signify the oneness and uniqueness of the Almighty, and after ablutions preceding the Prayer it may be made with the hand held up.  RX told me, however, that, as of late, in these difficult times, it has come to have a stronger significance.  The word &#8220;tawheed&#8221; is used in the prayer which means &#8220;oneness&#8221;. A word &#8220;maakiyah&#8221; has recently been added by radicals which refers to the sovereignty of power.  It is a political/religious statement which speaks to the assertion all matters are for the Almighty, and particularly the law. RX said that this has particular connotations for the acceptance of a secular Rule of Law. I note that the father has been associated with promotion of Sharia law and the rejection of secular law  within the demonstration photograph and also in messages he has written or forwarded. RX told me that the forefinger gesture is often used by suicide bombers as a prelude to the explosion of the device. </span></p>

It does not come from normal news sites.  Father says that they might have come from Fox News, but I find it very difficult to imagine or to accept that heads in buckets, details of crucifixions, the process of execution, dead bodies and dead fighters showing, it is asserted, the joy with which they died, material relating to bombings, a man with a knife to his throat, execution quads, would be shown on normal news channels. It is not my experience of the mainstream press.  I cannot say where this material came from, but the evidence that I had from RT, the technical expert relied on by the police, and his overall view, was that there had been a lot of internet searching for this kind of horrific image, particularly relating to the process of decapitation.  There was particular footage, which has nothing to do with Islam or the Islamic State at all, which relates to horrors in South America.  He told me that that was an indication of the kind of search that was going on and that someone in the home had had a pre-occupation with looking for this material. No-one in the family has been able to tell me who that might be. The father tells me, and I accept, of course, that, as a Muslim whose family emanates from South Asia, although via East Africa, he has an interest and a passionate commitment to finding out what is going on in the Islamic world and I quite understand that, but the material which has been downloaded does not fit with what the father told me about his focus of interest, or with the pre-occupation with terrorism, demonstrated also by books removed from the home. </span></p>

There were images found not only on R&#8217;s phone and other material on other devices as well.   There is a very strong theme of there being someone in this family, or perhaps more than one someone, who has an interest in painful things being done to other people.  This is not just related to terrorism.  I saw a video retrieved from one of the family phones of the youngest child, who must have been seven or eight, perhaps younger, it is difficult to see.  It is footage, apparently, taken by J, the child who is now nearly 16, of her younger brother being made to eat a raw chilli by his older sister, R.  The young people around him seem to be totally unconcerned about the pain which it is causing him and the distress that he is showing.  Anyone who has inadvertently bitten into a piece of raw chilli in a meal knows that it causes intense pain to the mouth, a very sensitive area.  There is laughing in the background.  It is not just that this was done, and it is a wholly inappropriate form of punishment, but that it does not seem to have evoked any form of sympathy or empathy at all.  RX suggested that this might have been a punishment for some kind of religious transgression, but I cannot say.  I am, of course, conscious that children used to have their mouths washed out with soap for swearing in the old days and I appreciate that treatment of children, which we would regard now as barbaric, was considered to be appropriate in the past.  Nonetheless, the combination of features, lack of feeling for the victim, group participation in this punishment and it being filmed, no doubt for some form of record or enjoyment, gives rise to a very uncomfortable feeling indeed.  It chimes with my sensation that there a nastiness about some of the attitudes in this family.</span></p>

According to the father he has scarcely asked R why she has had this material on the phone, and took some time to even state that he had.  The point is made by Mr. de Burgos that she is an adult and is entitled to do what she wants, but I would have thought that the father would want to enquire as to why his daughter had such interests, particularly because he is a loving father and the children have always been closely tied to the home and also, obviously, feel a high degree of responsibility for him.  He does not seem to have tackled this issue at all, and the most likely explanation is that access to these kinds of images and their sharing was part of the norm.  Furthermore, he told me that his little son had never told him about the chilli incident.  He had not spoken to R or, indeed, any of the other children about why the video had been taken or what had been going on, or why she had punished L in this way.  If that is true, it shows at the least a remarkable derogation of parental responsibility and lack of interest in what has been happening.  His lack of interest strongly suggests that this was a form of punishment that was part of the norm within this family.  </span></p>

I say that in particular because, during the family&#8217;s Eid celebration, there is a video of the family in front of the cake and a particular film being shown on the television.  There are photographs of the family living room decorated with the Black flag bearing the Arabic word &#8216;shahada&#8217;. The father says that this was just part of a continuous streaming through YouTube or music that he wanted to listen to.  Whether that is so, I am not going to decide, but let us assume that it is.  It showed the ISIS flag and a black-clad figure against a desert background.  It is very similar to some of the photographs found online and a very obvious approbation of the ISIS regime. Pro-Caliphate speeches can be heard in the background. The flag, the father accepts, which pictures the seal of the Prophet, is, as far as he knows, and as any of us know, only used by ISIS and not by any other group.  So although it may incorporate a perfectly acceptable and holy image, it has very obvious connotations if shown on the screen.  The children seemed to me to be looking at the screen in the photograph.  The father says they were interested in the cake, but this video was very obviously there, right in front of their faces, and available to be watched. The father says that he was not interested in the background; he was merely interested in the &#8220;Nasheed&#8221;, the religious songs which accompany it.  I do not find that an acceptable explanation.  At the very least, the father was extremely careless about what he exposed his children to, but it is far more likely that this was a form of entertainment which the family wanted to look at and was available to the younger children as well.</span></p>

Also F had previously referred in very glowing terms to HA as a &#8220;Sheikh who is a lion and gives talks&#8221;.

L and F also refused to identify their father. F declined to identify L in the &#8216;chilli&#8217; video when L was being punished. </span></p>

He did not think that F was unable to recognize his father. Rather, L was &#8220;unable to bring (his father&#8217;s) name to his lips&#8221;.  RX attributed the defensiveness and lack of openness and frankness, and dissimulation, as a combination of two features: firstly, that he was so scared of losing his father and family that he had to lie to cover up and, secondly, that he had been groomed/trained into refusing to identify his father.  He also identified in the older children some aspects which concerned him about their presentation.  I have already referred to A&#8217;s dismissiveness of any concerns, the attitude of all members of the family to weapons, the acceptability of them being in the household, and other photographs either depicting or referring to violence on line. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in;border:none"><span style="font-size:14pt">A cartoon on one of the older children&#8217;s telephones is based on the classic depiction of Darwinian theories of human evolution which shows progress from ape through intermediate humanoid forms to homo sapiens.  In this cartoon the Muslim progresses from human baby through various stages of maturity to a Mujahid warrior in Islamic dress who then becomes a green flying bird.  The non-Muslim starts as an ape and concludes as a pig.  B told RX that she did not think the content appropriate and did not identify a Mujahid as a fighter who attained freedom as represented by the green bird. RX told me that the concept of the fighter/martyr who becomes a bird is esoteric and not well known as it is generally confined to radicalised Muslims,  B was familiar with the concept.  This must indicate that she has been exposed to radical ideas.  </span></p>

Before the new material was examined he was even prepared to give credence to the father&#8217;s explanation when he interviewed him about his Twitter feed that he has posted pro-Islamic State material online as a form of protest against the intervention of the court in the children proceedings. He now does not accept that explanation. In my view that justification is lame and incredible. In any event it shows the father&#8217;s mindset. </span></p>

He comments however on the fact that R had given a &#8220;no comment&#8221; interview and that A&#8217;s constant nonchalance does not represent him as a responsible older sibling.</span></p>

I do not know whether he actually accessed these images himself.  I suspect he did.  It does not matter whether he did or he did not.  I accept that the possession of this kind of material was the norm within this family.  I am satisfied that the father did not protect the children from overall exposure to gruesome images, although what they were exposed to, and by whom, I cannot say.</span></p>

She is the person who has introduced the radicalising elements into the family.  I have some doubts about the veracity of some of the things that she has said to the officers at Harwich port, including whether or not she was genuinely going to Holland to have the opportunity to smoke cannabis; and whether she had cannabis with her, found in her possession, in order to smoke it in Holland or whether that was part of a decoy. </span></p>

It would be fruitless for me to direct R to appear at the next hearing.  She gave a &#8220;no comment&#8221; interview.  I know that she was not protected against answering questions, as the father was not protected against answering questions, by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/98" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.98</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>, but I would have to give her a warning, as I did the father in this case.  It is likely that that she would give me no useful information at all and she is not putting herself forward as a potential carer for the children.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in;border:none"><span style="font-size:14pt">This case has similarities in some ways to cases where children have been turned against the other parent by influence that used to be sometimes called &#8220;brainwashing&#8221;.  The similarity is in the pressures that other people bring to bear on the young and vulnerable and what ought to and can be done about it.  I have no hesitation in the appropriate case in removing children from the care of one parent and placing them with another, normally through the care arrangements made through the local authority.  My experience is that it works more often than not.  This authority may decide to ask me to remove these children.  I have no idea whether that would be the right result and I would hesitate before making such an order, but I might have to, even though, particularly where religious and cultural issues are involved, there must be a significant risk of making things worse.</span></p>

She expressed her view very firmly at an earlier stage when in retrospect, quite a number of participants in this case, including me, may ourselves have been gullible. RX certainly thinks, as a result of various things that he learnt after the second raid, that he had not been told the frank unvarnished truth about the mind set of this family, their true beliefs and their true motivations.  </span></p>

He has been keen to stress his multi-cultural social circle as a young man, and to tell me how he played in a rock band.  This may or may not be true and he may or may not feel these things, but I do not know what it would take to break the &#8216;covenant of security&#8217;.  It is quite possible that he was radicalised in prison. RX thinks so.  His personality may make him susceptible to influence, as well as leading him to influence others.  </span></p>

Yes, if it may work, and if he really wants to change.  I cannot make him, he is a grown-up, he has his own views and there would be no point in him paying lip service to something that he does not agree with.  RX told me that it is possible for views to be changed.  I appreciate that this is also a very sensitive area because, after all, who likes to think that they are wrong and who likes to think that other people know best?  But it may be worth trying, I do not know, it is not for me to say at the moment.  </span></p>

One is not one day a child and the next an adult.  I would find it very difficult to force these children to have any form of therapeutic or similar intervention that they did not want.  The father&#8217;s influence could be very important.  He has put himself forward as being quite passive in some ways in respect of what has happened to the children.  I rejected that in many respects, but if there is any truth in this description, then he needs to take and exercise parental responsibility.</span></p>
