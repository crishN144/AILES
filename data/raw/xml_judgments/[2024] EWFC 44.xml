In joining the trust to the litigation, I was influenced by the fact that the father is both the settlor (&#8216;Trustor&#8217;) and the trustee of the living trust.  Crucially it also shows that the father has very considerable control of the living trust; in this regard the trust deed provides (Article 4.1) that the trustee &#8220;shall pay to or apply for the benefit of the [settlor] so much of the net income and principal of the trust, up to and including the entire trust estate, as the [settlor] may request at any time&#8221;.</p>

I was satisfied then, as I am now, that Zoe will require particularly special care over the course of her childhood in the home and at school.  A year on from my last review, it appears that her condition continues to present challenges; I was informed by the mother that Zoe attended Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children as an outpatient on the day before this hearing for further treatment / monitoring.

This was the first time they had met.  The mother reports that the father and Zoe enjoyed seeing each other, and in that sense the visit was a success.  However, the mother also reports that during the visit the father informed her that he intended not to honour the court-ordered financial obligations which I had explained in my March 2023 judgment.   The mother&#8217;s evidence (which I am conscious has been presented to me unchallenged) is that the father told her that she would &#8220;not see a penny&#8221; of the award which I had made, and that he had been &#8220;arranging and managing his finances for years to limit/restrict [the mother&#8217;s] ability to enforce&#8221;.

Notably, this was in fact materially less than his open offer at the time of the final hearing (&#163;155,600pa), and in my judgment it falls significantly short of Zoe&#8217;s financial requirements. In light of this, the mother was forced to suspend Zoe&#8217;s engagement in privately funded and much needed medical therapies, including her physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy; Zoe has had to be withdrawn from the nursery which she enjoyed and from which she benefited, with the inevitable impact on her social and educational development.

I am conscious of the draconian nature of the order.  However, the father has plainly shown no willingness to meet his financial obligations as I have ordered them; he is willing only to provide for Zoe on his own terms.  I made it very clear in my judgment in March 2023 that I would not incorporate a trigger provision for capitalisation of the child periodical payments provision at that stage, contrary to the argument advanced on the mother's behalf, because I wished to give the father the opportunity (a) to honour the award on a routine basis, and/or (b) to address me on the issue should it become a live one.  I declined to make the capitalisation award when the case came before me for the freezing order, because I wished to give the father the opportunity to make representations.  The father has, in my judgement, provoked this application by his non-compliance with the ongoing orders for financial support; he has been given more than one opportunity to address the court, and specifically to seek to persuade me to take another course.  The sum to be injuncted by this order is a considerable sum; but Zoe&#8217;s needs are great and the father&#8217;s contempt of my order is both deliberate and flagrant. </span></p>

I am satisfied that she has been required to do so as the father has deliberately ignored the obligations imposed on him by my March 2023 order; indeed, he has made not the slightest attempt to comply.  The evidence, which I accept, reveals that the mother&#8217;s solicitors spent very considerable time (and therefore cost) in identifying US attorneys to accept instructions without requiring upfront payment, and liaising with them thereafter; it was also of course necessary to engage litigation funders in the USA.  The situation which has arisen here takes the case &#8220;out of the norm&#8221; of costs orders; I am persuaded me that the mother should not be left out of pocket in pursuing satisfaction of a carefully considered order in respect of Zoe which I made nearly one year ago.</span></p>
