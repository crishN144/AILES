In many of these cases large sums of money are paid for the expenses in undertaking these arrangements. Figures in excess of &#163;15 - 20,000 are not uncommon. Commissioning parents should, at the very least, get an outline of the relevant legal steps they need to take to ensure their position and, more importantly that of any child born as a result of the arrangement, is protected. The cost of that advice is likely to be a minimal expense in the context of the large sums spent on the surrogacy arrangement overall.</span></p>

It is only a parental order that provides lifelong security for the child, as it recognises the commissioning parents as the legal parents of the child with all the positive benefits that flow from that.

This application was made on the basis that they were automatically British citizens by descent, that AB is their biological father and legal father, in the same way they were granted Australian citizenship. These applications were refused on the ground that the applicants had been unable to provide satisfactory evidence to show that CT was not married at the time they entered into the agreement. The authorities did not accept the affidavit was sufficient evidence that CT was divorced; in their experience it was unlikely CT would have been single. The applicants therefore made applications for discretionary registration as British citizens. They sought further information from SCI regarding CT&#8217;s marital status. SCI reported CT had cancelled two or three appointments with them. They also stated that because CT was married and divorced in a rural area there is no paperwork. The applicants did not pursue this, as CT&#8217;s marital status was not required for the discretionary leave application. The discretionary leave application was successful; the children were registered as British citizens and received British passports in early 2014. The children and the applicants came to live here in April 2014.</span></p>

Can Parliament really have intended that the gate should be barred forever if the application for a parental order is lodged even one day late? I cannot think so. Parliament has not explained its thinking, but given the transcendental importance of a parental order, with its consequences stretching many, many decades into the future, can it sensibly be thought that Parliament intended the difference between six months and six months and one day to be determinative and one day's delay to be fatal? I assume that Parliament intended a sensible result. &#8230;</span></p>

I repeat in this context what I have already said in paragraphs 54-56 above. There are, without labouring the point, three aspects of a parental order which very obviously and very fundamentally distinguish it from the kind of case which the court was concerned with in Adesina. The first is that a parental order goes not just status but to identity as a human being. The second is that the court is looking, indeed is required by statute to look, to a future stretching many, many decades into the future. The third is that the court is concerned not just with the impact on the applicant whose default in meeting the time limit is being scrutinised but also with the impact on the innocent child, whose welfare is the court's paramount concern. In these circumstances the court is entitled, indeed in my judgment it is bound, to adopt a more liberal and relaxed approach than was appropriate in Adesina. After all, as Maurice Kay LJ recognised in Adesina, what the court is required to do, albeit it is required to do no more, is to secure compliance with the Convention. I would not be doing that if I were to deny the commissioning parents and X access to the court.&#8217;</span></p>

The reality is, on the information the court has, any prejudice she may suffer is minimal. She has had no direct involvement with the applicants or the children since 2011, the evidence points towards her having moved on in her life. She co-operated with the Australian proceedings in 2012 which, not unreasonably, she may have regarded as the end to her involvement in any litigation concerning the children. The tenor of what she said within those proceedings is that she did not anticipate having any future role in the children&#8217;s lives. She did not appear willing to co-operate with attending appointments with SCI in late 2013, and the more recent evidence demonstrates she is not contactable at all. </span></p>

It is only when all reasonable steps have been taken to locate her without success that a court is likely to dispense with the need for valid consent. Half-hearted or token attempts to find the surrogate will not be enough. Furthermore, it will normally be prudent for the Applicants to lay the ground for satisfying these requirements at an early stage. Even where, as in this case, the Applicants do not meet the surrogate, they should establish clear lines of communication with her, preferably not simply through one person or agency, and should ensure that the surrogate is made aware during the pregnancy that she will be required to give consent six weeks after the birth. </span></p>

She accepts that in the context of what I was saying in the preceding sentence it may be right, but as a general proposition it is not. She drew the courts attention to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/67/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 67 (1)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref> which provides &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">An adopted person is to be treated in law as if born as the child of the adopters or adopter.&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> This is what demarks the difference between the two orders. Adoption orders create a presumption in law that the child is treated as if the biological child of the adopters. A parental order does not require that presumption to be made. Both orders are transformative, but a parental order proceeds on the assumption one of the applicants is the biological parent. That is one of the key criteria in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 54</ref> HFEA. It doesn&#8217;t change the child&#8217;s lineage as an adoption order does; a parental order creates a legal parentage and removes the legal parentage of the birth family under the provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref>. Unlike adoption there is already a biological link with the applicants before the parental order application is made. Its purpose is to create legal parentage around an already concluded lineage connection. </span></p>

An adopted child is seen to have had a family created for it, whereas in a surrogacy arrangement the child&#8217;s conception and birth has been commissioned by the parents, the child has a biological connection and the same identity as one of the parents. The latter arrangement is more congruent with a parental order than an adoption order.</span></p>

They were specifically created to deal with these situations. Put simply, they are a more honest order which reflects the reality of what was intended, the lineage connection that already exists and more accurately reflects the child&#8217;s identity. An adoption order in these situations leaves open the risk of a fiction regarding identity that may need to be resolved by the child later in life. The effect of an adoption order according to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/67/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 67 (1)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref> of treating the child </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;as if&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> the child is born as a child of the adopter or adopters is not the reality; the child is born with a biological connection to one of the applicants.
