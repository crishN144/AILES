This is the court's judgement in respect of the applicant&#8217;s application for financial remedies on divorce.  The court previously dealt with a preliminary issue to determine whether an amount of &#163;900,000 provided to the respondent by his Father, RF, the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> Respondent, was a gift or a loan. For ease of reference in this judgement, and with no disrespect intended to the parties, I shall refer to the Applicant wife, as &#8220;W&#8221;, the First Respondent as &#8220;H&#8221; and the second respondent as &#8220;F&#8221;.</p>

W says she needs a suitable house for herself and C so he has his own space, a garden to use and a similar property to that of H. W says she has historically been C&#8217;s main carer and generally is the one who takes responsibility when he is off school sick, receives calls from the school and arranges his medical and dental appointments. She also arranges the bulk of his extra-curricular and social activities. She wants to stay in her Warwickshire town because C knows the area and she has a support network there.</p>

The second property is a 3-bedroom semi-detached house on the market for &#163;375,000.

She said she had been fighting from day one to be in a situation where H had his own home and she had her own home with her son in order to provide him with a nice environment. W said that she had not known about the arrangements between H and F and had she known, then she would not have moved into that property, and she would have got a smaller property with a mortgage because she wanted to own her own home.

W said that she made enquiries, but she did not meet the essential requirements for the job, and therefore there was no point putting in an application. W said she was registered with agencies for jobs, and when her savings ran out due to legal fees she applied for all sorts of jobs, for example, where she could use her mentoring skills, management experience, teaching experience and professional experience. She said she was not shy of working, but wanted to meet C&#8217;s needs.</p>

This is in circumstances where he is legally represented and has incurred a large amount of legal costs.  It was clear from his responses in cross-examination that his intention was to show that he had no mortgage capacity by stating to potential lenders that he was likely to have a county court judgement against him. His evidence and attitude to the proceedings have been coloured by his position that his highest obligation is to repay his father's loans which he says is the reason for making no offer other than a clean break. At the same time, he and F indicate a wish that H should remain in the former family home, which is, of course, only possible on the basis that W receives no substantial payment funded from a sale of the property and H relies on the goodwill of his father not to require repayment of the loan.</p>

Difficult questions can arise as to whether and to what extent property which starts out as non-marital acquires a marital character requiring it to be divided under the sharing principle. It will all depend on the circumstances, and the court will look at when the property was acquired, how it has been used, whether it has been mingled with the family finances and what the parties intended.</span></p>

Considering all of the evidence and the section 25 factors, I find that it is appropriate for W to receive a lump to enable her to purchase a suitable property for herself and C. H and F invite the court to take the view that F has made a generous offer to provide housing which it is unreasonable of W to reject.  I do not agree. The details of the proposed trust arrangements are not settled and this would provide W with no capital amount of her own over which she would have ultimate control and be able to deal with as she chooses in the future. This would not, in my view, be a fair division of the available assets between the parties. </p>

Taking into account all the factors including the parties&#8217; standard of living I find that it is appropriate to allow &#163;375,000 for a suitable property.  In addition it is appropriate to allow an amount of &#163;12,000 for stamp duty, moving costs, essential white goods and furniture, and I consider that an amount of &#163;387,000 is reasonable in respect of W's housing needs.</p>

No repayment term details have been provided in respect of the family loan and therefore it is reasonable to assume that this is in the nature of a soft loan and can be repaid over time out of income.

I consider that it is fair to make provision for these by way of a capital lump sum given that W has succeeded in being awarded a capital sum and H and F have not succeeded in persuading the court that the court should award no capital as a result of the existence of the loan by F to H.</p>

I find that it is reasonable for the periodical payments to continue at the current rate of &#163;600 per month for six months from the date of the final Order and thereafter at a rate of &#163;300 per month for a further six months as this will allow W to adjust to the cessation of payments at the end of a 1 year period without undue hardship  -  she will be able to purchase her own property and therefore not be paying the high level of  rent she currently pays, and she can take steps to increase her earned income during that time.</p>

After sale of the former family home H will receive the balance of around &#163;541,000. Whilst H&#8217;s position is that he must repay the entire amount of the loan to his father, the repayment of that soft personal family loan is not the court&#8217;s primary concern and it does not take priority over meeting the needs of C to have a suitable home with both parents.

H has professed his wish to repay his father in full, and that is something which he may do over time. If he were to use &#163;387,000 of the net proceeds of sale for a housing fund (as I have allowed for W, and not even giving consideration for H&#8217;s mortgage capacity or any contribution from his new wife) he would have a balance of &#163;154,000 in order to make lump sum repayments to F and in respect of his other debts.  He has a well-paid job and in the more distant future may be able to obtain more lucrative private work. In addition, his household income will be increased in the near future by his new wife&#8217;s earnings. Further, and importantly, H will ultimately benefit from the discretionary trust into which F intends to place the assets in his estate which include the loan and this provides significant security for H in the future, despite the current extent of his debts. </p>

He has chosen to incur very significant legal costs. Whilst H said he could not propose anything other than a clean break due to the loan amount he owes to his father I cannot fail to note that H has incurred costs of over &#163;305,000. F has incurred costs of over &#163;139,000 during the course of these proceedings: had an amount in the region of those combined costs been offered to W, a settlement would most likely have been achieved. Instead, all that has ever been on the table for W is an offer of the provision of housing through a discretionary trust to be set up by F whilst H and F&#8217;s legal advisers have received sums of over &#163;400,000. </p>
