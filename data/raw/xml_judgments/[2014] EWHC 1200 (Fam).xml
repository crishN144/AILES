It is a discrete judgment on a discrete point during the course of a directions hearing which is essentially concerned with a range of other points.  These proceedings concern seven children.  The five eldest have for some time been the subject of care orders.  The two youngest have for some time been the subject of placement orders.  It is plain that for a long time the proceedings and issues surrounding these children and their parents have been the subject of considerable public interest.  That is obvious from the fact that as long ago as the 8</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> July 2010 Baron J made a reporting restriction order in relation to them.  </span></p>

It appears that at that time there were outstanding criminal proceedings concerning the parents of the children.  Obviously, when findings in family proceedings precede some criminal trial that raises the same or overlapping issues, it is extremely important in order to protect the integrity of the forthcoming trial that the public (which might therefore include potential jurors) are not aware of the findings already made by the judge in the family proceedings.  In the last section of his judgment dated the 17</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> May 2012, Charles J discussed the issue of &#8220;Publication of this judgment&#8221; in a very thoughtful passage, if I may respectfully say so.  His conclusion at paragraph 178 was that:</span></p>

However, there was then an application before Bodey J on the 20</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> July 2012 as a result of which he directed that a sub-paragraph (h) should be added to paragraph 7 of the underlying reporting restriction order that had been made by Baron J on the 8</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> July 2010.  The effect of the added sub-paragraph (h) is that all judgments had to be &#8220;anonymised to the satisfaction of the local authority and the children&#8217;s guardian as to the identity of the applicant [viz:  the London Borough of Haringey], all family members and all witnesses and as to any other details which might lead to the identification of the children (or their placements) as being the children the subject of</span><span/><span style="font-size:14pt">these proceedings&#8221;.

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Time then moved on and this case came before me (I believe for the first time) on the 19</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> March 2014.  On that date I gave an ex tempore judgment which contains an account of developments between the time of the hearing in front of Charles J in May 2012 and the recent time.  The essence of the applications currently before the court is for permission to change both the surname and the forenames of the two youngest children so as to enable them to be absorbed into long-term adoptive placements with total anonymity.  Because that anonymity would risk being breached by any continuing direct contact between the two youngest and the five eldest children, there is a linked application for permission to cease altogether any direct contact between the five eldest and the two youngest children.  So the express purpose of, and suggested justification for, those very significant applications is to enable the two youngest children to acquire complete anonymity and new identities in society.  The reason for that is that it is said (and indeed appears to be the case) that there has been, and continues to be, very considerable public interest in this case and this family, in particular upon a range of internet websites.  Indeed, this morning, as a result of reading a reference in the position statement prepared for today by Miss Sarah Morgan QC, who appears on behalf of the local authority, I myself did a very basic Google trawl on the internet, feeding in only the names or words &#8220;Musa&#8221; and &#8220;Haringey&#8221;, and I at once saw a considerable number of different websites discussing in various ways, and expressing a range of points of view about, these children and their parents and the whole history of the family and the criminal proceedings.</span></p>

At the last hearing before me there appeared, as I described in paragraphs 31 to 33 of my judgment, Mr F.N. Enya, Senior Counsel (Consular, Education and Welfare) at the Nigeria High Commission here in London.  I mention that Mr Enya is again in court today.  Mr Enya told me at the March hearing, as I recorded in paragraph 32 of my judgment, that this case has indeed been debated on the floor of the Nigerian National Assembly, that is, their Parliament.  Further, it has been the subject of diplomatic exchanges between the Nigeria High Commission and the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office here in London.  So the notoriety, if I can use that word, of this case concerning these children has indeed spread to the Parliament itself of Nigeria of which all these children are citizens.  Further, there has been placed before me today, and circulated of course to all other parties, a letter dated the 9</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> April 2014 from Mr Ahmed Inusa, Minister/Head of Chancery for the Nigeria High Commissioner here in London.

I had sat in public throughout.  I placed my judgment upon Bailii pursuant to the recent Practice Direction of the President of the Family Division with regard to transparency and the publication of judgments.  I had been scrupulously careful when I delivered the judgment that day, and also when I corrected it, not anywhere to mention the forenames of any of the children (although one of the applications concerns the issue of forenames), nor their dates of birth, nor or course any addresses.  I very deliberately made plain on the face of the cover note of the judgment that the judgment does relate to this family of Musa and that the relevant local authority are the London Borough of Haringey.  I did so very deliberately, precisely because I was aware, for it was of the essence of the application, that this is a case that has attracted, and continues to attract, considerable public notoriety and public debate.  I do not have the slightest idea of the rights and wrongs of any of these matters.  I have not in any way read the detailed content of any of the many websites.  I merely know, as is indeed the case of the London Borough of Haringey, that this family is notorious and the subject of public debate both here and in Nigeria.</span></p>

Frankly, there is probably enough information inevitably contained within the judgment that an informed reader might guess that it related to this family even if the title had said the London Borough of X and referred to the family as Y.  But, to my mind, it runs counter to openness and transparency in family proceedings to conceal or disguise the family to which a judgment relates in circumstances such as this.  So it was my very deliberate decision that the words Musa and the London Borough of Haringey should appear in the title to the judgment.</span></p>

The welfare of the children concerned is clearly very important and uppermost in my mind, though not necessarily paramount.  Of course children should always be screened, so far as practicably possible, from the embarrassment and upset of things being said about them publicly, but it is not always practically possible.  The fact of the matter is, as the websites demonstrate, and the questions in the Nigerian Parliament demonstrate, and the interest in this case of the Nigerian community in the United Kingdom demonstrates, there is already notoriety surrounding these children and this case.  That notoriety will not go away.  Few things stoke notoriety, &#8220;campaigns&#8221; and conspiracy type theories more than courts operating in private and behind a wall of apparent secrecy.  It merely fans suspicion and the sense that things have been done by, and in, the courts which are wrong and which must be barred from public scrutiny.  </span></p>

So a balance has to be struck.  In my view, at this stage of this case the balance clearly falls down in favour of the public being entitled to know, at least in outline, the current issues that are before the court in relation to these children.  It goes without saying that nothing whatsoever should be published which might in any way reveal to the public the whereabouts of the children and, above all, the identity of the family with whom the sixth child has already been placed and the seventh child is proposed to be placed.  But meantime, whilst the court debates and decides issues such as whether children should be given totally new names and identities, and whether the contact between a sibling group, which Charles J thought was so important that he expressly ordered that there must be continuing direct contact even after placement,  should now be ended, the public are entitled to be aware of the debate, the content of the debate and the decision and the family to which it relates.  For those reasons, I have now already made an order, the effect of which is to vary para.(h) added by Bodey J in July 2012 to now provide that the name or the identity of the applicants, that is, the London Borough of Haringey, and the surname only of the children, may appear in the title on the cover of any judgment which a judge deliberately places upon Bailii in that form.  </span></p>

His order expressly bound "any persons with whom [the youngest two children] are placed".  Accordingly, it is crystal-clear from the terms of the order as well as the explanations in his judgment that Charles J had it in mind that until further order of the court inter-sibling direct contact should take place, not only before, but also after placement of the children with a view to adoption.  Further, as he explained and made clear, the local authority had to identify prospective adopters who would feel willing and able to support and cooperate with direct inter-sibling contact.</span></p>

Further, although I used the word "probably" regarding observing contact, I certainly envisaged that almost inevitably there would be an observation at a contact.

She said it was monthly, but when I asked when there had last been contact between the two groups of children she said, on instructions, that it was the 14</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> December 2013.  I expressly asked Miss Morgan whether there had been any "farewell" contact and she said that there had not.  That of course clearly indicates that at that moment the state of mind and understanding of the Queen's Counsel instructed by and on behalf of the local authority was that, although contact may have been paused, it certainly had not in any sense been terminated or the subject of a farewell or goodbye event.  Shortly after that, the social worker handed her a note as a result of which Miss Morgan corrected what she had said earlier (in the utmost good faith), and told me that in fact the contact on the 14</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> December 2012 had been expressly and deliberately a "goodbye contact".  For these purposes, there is of course no distinction whatsoever between the concept of a "goodbye" or a "farewell" contact.  Either way, it is expressive of an enormously sad but apparently final occasion upon which for the last time related children meet and say a farewell to each other, at any rate for their childhoods.</span></p>

I understand that in discussion outside the court room before we first assembled in court today the advocates for the guardians had learned that there had not been any contact since the 14</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> December 2013, but they did not appreciate until the note was passed in court this morning, that that contact had been set up as being of a "goodbye" character.  Later today, Ms. Jonquil Houghton, who appears on behalf of the guardian for the two youngest children, Ms. Trudy Jordan, told me that Ms. Jordan "is extremely surprised and shocked to hear that it was a farewell contact".  I have to say that I share the surprise and shock of Ms. Jordan.  If the local authority did indeed reach a decision on or before the 14</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> December 2012 that that occasion should be a "goodbye" contact, that was tantamount to reaching their own decision firmly and permanently to terminate all contact between the two groups of children.  However, the subsisting order of this court by Charles J, which I have quoted, positively ordered not only the local authority, but also any persons with whom the two youngest children were placed, to allow direct contact.  The gravity of the situation is compounded by the fact that it was not even until the 16</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> January 2014, namely a month later, that the local authority even issued their present application to the court in which they seek permission to vary the order of Charles J so as to cease to be under a duty to promote the contact.  </span></p>

The current situation is that the sixth child was placed during January with a prospective adoptive family.  It is of course of the utmost importance that that placement should not be destabilised.  Further,  the local authority currently hope and intend that the seventh child will also be placed with that family once the sixth child is well settled in.

Realistically, there has now been a four month break in contact.  It appears that the message that has been deliberately and directly communicated to the five eldest children is that the December contact was the last and that they will never see their two younger siblings again, at any rate during their respective childhoods.  It may not be possible now to unscramble that egg that the local authority have created.  Certainly it could potentially be extremely destabilising for all or any of these children, but especially the sixth child, if between now and the substantive hearing there was a court imposed resumption of direct contact.  The implications go further than that.  As I have explained, my primary intention in appointing a guardian on behalf of the five eldest children was that that guardian could both observe contact and also have conversations with all, or at any rate the elder, of those children to establish their views and wishes and feelings with regard to contact.  It might now be unsettling to the point of cruelty for conversations of that kind to take place, for if the guardian was now to discuss with any of those children possible future  contact with the two youngest, it would raise excited expectations in them upon which the guardian might, indeed, be unable to deliver.  Further, it would inevitably be extremely confusing for them that last December social workers had told them that they were saying goodbye to their siblings, and now somebody sent by the court was asking them about seeing their siblings again.  Frankly, it is likely that the actions of the local authority have created a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">fait accompli</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> and overridden the clear intention of Charles J in May 2012.</span></p>

All I can do is direct the guardian for the youngest two children to meet the adoptive family and discuss all these issues with them and then file and serve a report in which she reports upon them.  It may of course be that the prospective adopters will indicate that they are not averse to some resumption and continuation of some inter-sibling direct contact.  When that guardian does report, the guardian for the five eldest children must of course consider the report.  I must leave it to her discretion to decide whether, in the light of that report, she feels it would or may be damaging to the elder children if she spoke to any of them and unfairly raised any expectation that contact might resume.  If, however, she considers that she can speak to all or any of those children without causing harm to them, then she should do so.  If not, she should not.</span></p>
