	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">On 24 June 2021, Ms Borg, the Applicant, issued an application for the committal of Mr El Zubaidy, the Defendant, for contempt of court. At the outset of the hearing on 17 November 2021 I advised the Defendant, through his Counsel, that he had the right to remain silent and was entitled, but not obliged, to give written and oral evidence. He did not have to answer questions the answers to which may incriminate him. He has been represented by Mr Crawley, Counsel, and has not required the services of an interpreter.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The alleged contempt of court is by breaches of court orders. Those orders were designed to support orders for the return of two of the parties&#8217; children from Libya to the jurisdiction of England and Wales where both their parents live. The two children concerned have been in Libya since being retained there by the Defendant in 2015 and are believed to be currently in the care of their paternal grandmother. The High Court first ordered the return of the children from Libya to this jurisdiction on 26 January 2017. There have been numerous subsequent orders for the return of the children with which the Defendant has failed to comply. The Defendant is familiar with committal proceedings. In August 2017 Moor J sentenced him to 12 months imprisonment for breaching court orders made in proceedings concerned with securing the return of the children from Libya. Whilst out on licence following that period of imprisonment he was in breach of further orders for the return of the children. On 26 February 2018 Mostyn J sentenced the Defendant to a further twelve months imprisonment for contempt of court (deferred for one month to allow the Defendant to comply with the order he had breached). Then, on 15 November 2018, Hayden J sentenced the Defendant to two years imprisonment for contempt, again for breaching orders to secure the safe return of his children.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">As can be seen from the history of committal applications, there is a long and involved background to the making of the orders which the Defendant is alleged to have breached. The parties have three children. Two are still under 18, one is over 18 but has been declared by the Court to be a vulnerable adult in whose best interests it was to make orders for her return to the jurisdiction of England and Wales. As shorthand I shall refer to those remaining in Libya as &#8220;the children&#8221;. The youngest of the children is a ward of court. The adult child in Libya is protected under the inherent jurisdiction of the court. The Defendant retained the children in Libya in 2015. The children have therefore been away from their mother and their home country for six years. The Defendant was not released from prison following his previous committals until 15 November 2019. The Applicant travelled to Libya in 2019 and commenced proceedings against the paternal grandmother. The Applicant was awarded custody of the children by a court in Libya which ordered the paternal grandmother to bring the children to court. The paternal grandmother did not comply and went into hiding with the children. Whilst he was in prison the father executed power of attorney in favour of his mother indicating that he knew where she was and was in communication with her. A series of hearings took place in the High Court, Family Division, in November and December 2019 with the purpose of securing the return of the children from Libya. Further return orders were made. Still the children remain in Libya.</p>

He has previously signed a consent form but the mother has been advised that his consent must be given by way of a document signed and attested at the Libyan Embassy, and the document must be translated into Arabic. The Applicant&#8217;s solicitors duly prepared the necessary consent documents (in English and Arabic) ready for signing and witnessing. They were sent to the Defendant and to the Libyan Embassy in London on 8 January 2021 together with an explanation to the Defendant of what steps he needed to take, namely, to sign the documents before a member of the Libyan Embassy as a witness, and for the witness to sign and date the documents accordingly. The Defendant did not respond to the Applicant&#8217;s solicitors. The Applicant applied to the court accordingly. The Defendant appeared before Judd J on 8 February 2021 and she made the order set out above, attaching a penal notice. The order records the Defendant&#8217;s email address and that he consented to service by email of court documents. A sealed copy of the order of 8 February 2021 was sent by the Applicant&#8217;s solicitors to the Defendant by email on 11 February 2021.</p>

The wording of Russell J&#8217;s order refers to &#8220;ward&#8221; (singular). I proceed on the basis that this order applied only to the younger of the two children who is a ward of court. The order of Judd J remained extant but the order of Russell J did not, on the face of it, refer to the elder child who is not a ward of court. Again the Defendant&#8217;s email address was recorded and service of further court documents was ordered to be served on the Defendant at that address in addition to service upon his solicitors.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I gave a brief ruling at the hearing on 17 November 2021 refusing the Defendant&#8217;s preliminary application to dismiss or set aside the committal application of 24 June 2021 on the grounds of irregularity or non-compliance with Part 37 of the FPR. I have given fuller reasons in this judgment. Notwithstanding that ruling, I note that the manner in which the application notice was compiled was not as clear and helpful as it might have been. The requirement under r.37.4(1) for every contempt application to be &#8220;supported by written evidence given by affidavit or affirmation&#8221; unless and to the extent that the court directs otherwise, is a requirement to provide evidence of the contempt alleged. A statement of supporting evidence is not the same as a statement of the matters and information required to be included under r.37.4(2)(a) to (s). Now that there is a FC600 form that includes the standard information to be proceeded on its face, the case specific<span style="font-style:italic"/>requirements under r.37.4(2) could be included on the face of the Part 18 Application Notice itself if room can be made by expanding the boxes on the form under what is now box 6, or by use of a separate sheet. In either case the matters and information required to be included under r.37.4(2) should not, in my view, be conflated with evidence in support of the contempt application. It was unnecessary to provide the required matters and information under r.37.4(2) in the form of a witness statement from the Applicant. If a separate sheet was needed, it would in my view have been preferable to include in the application a &#8220;Notice pursuant to FPR r.37.4(2)&#8221; which set out the required matters and information. I would also caution against relying on a witness statement with exhibits that include another witness statement with its own exhibits. I do not understand why this was thought necessary &#8211; the earlier witness statement had not been withdrawn when the previous application had been withdrawn.</p>

However, Mr Crawley did rely on an unsigned, undated written statement from the Defendant. Whilst Mr Crawley said that little weight could be given to the statement he nevertheless wished to rely on it. In that statement the Defendant makes it very clear that he had no intention of signing the consent documents. His reasons for not doing so are less clear, but he maintains that to do so would be to place the children at greater risk than they are under at present.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The Applicant did not have &#8220;clean hands&#8221; as he put it. She had been in breach of court orders made on 4 and 19 December 2019. However, as pointed out by Ms Renton for the Applicant, those orders had been amended by the court on 31 January 2020. The Applicant was not in breach of the orders when amended and no action was deemed necessary to be taken at the time. Mr Crawley said that the Defendant did not believe that he had been given notice of the hearing on 31 January 2020 but it is recorded on the face of the order that he had been given notice. In any event, I cannot see the relevance to the committal proceedings before this court that the Applicant may have breached a court order in 2019. Mr Crawley also suggested that the Applicant had given &#8220;dubious&#8221; evidence to the court in Libya in 2019. Again, I am unclear as to the relevance of her evidence in Libya but in any event I have no reason to doubt the veracity of her evidence and a suggestion that it is dubious without evidence that it was untruthful or inaccurate takes the matter nowhere.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Mr Crawley submitted that the court should not make an order in vain and that an order for committal has no possibility of producing the desired result. This is not an attractive submission. Firstly, although the Applicant accepted in evidence that Libya was a country in which law and order had broken down, her pursuit of a duly attested, signed consent for the removal by her of the children from Libya has not been considered by the courts making the orders set out above, to be a pointless exercise. The orders in question were intended to give effect to ongoing orders for return to the children. The production of the Defendant&#8217;s attested consent to the removal of the children may be productive and allow the Applicant to remove the children from Libya. Secondly, committal proceedings are a process for upholding the authority of the court, they do not exist purely for the purpose of achieving the end intended by the order allegedly breached. Thirdly, the submission surely goes to the question of sentence rather than guilt.</p>

He did not press the point and did not submit that they had not had jurisdiction. The orders have not been appealed. With regard to the elder child of the parties, who is an adult aged over 18, Mostyn J held on 9 May 2018 (when she was no longer a child under the age of 18) that she was a vulnerable adult who required the protection of the court and that it was &#8220;necessary and appropriate&#8221; for the court to &#8220;exercise its inherent jurisdiction with respect to vulnerable adults so as to grant all such relief as may protect and/or assist her.&#8221; There have been numerous court hearings and orders since that date and I cannot see any evidence of any challenge to the jurisdiction of the court to make orders protecting the adult child who is in Libya and to assist her to return or be returned to England. The point was not argued before me either; it was only raised as an observation that the adult child was not a ward of court. The court has proceeded since May 2018 on the unchallenged basis that it has jurisdiction to take steps to secure the return of the adult child. In the circumstances, albeit challenges to jurisdiction could have been made, I proceed on the basis that the orders alleged to have been breached were orders the court was entitled to make. In relation to the younger child, who is under 18 and a ward of court, the jurisdiction to make the orders has not been doubted.</p>

Since his release from the most recent sentence of imprisonment, in November 2019, there have been numerous subsequent orders for him to return the children which he has breached, but those breaches are not the subject of the application now before the court. Instead, as I have found, the Defendant has breached orders designed to assist the mother to recover the children from Libya without him.

He has obdurately defied court orders which are designed to protect his children. He appears not to recognise the authority of the courts in this jurisdiction or in Libya. His sustained refusal to assist in securing the return of his children is clearly deliberate. He has previously sought to avoid further penalties by assuring the court that he wished to do everything he could to secure the return of the children - that is what he said in a statement to the court in 2018. However, by his actions in 2021 he has shown that he has no such desire or intention. He has openly defied the court. I find it difficult to understand why. He has asserted, without any cogent evidence to support the assertion, that it would create a risk to the children for the mother to remove them from Libya. He has said through Counsel that Libya is a dangerous country but he acts so as to keep his children within that dangerous country. It appears to me that, ultimately, he objects to the prospect of the children living with their mother, and that he has gone to extreme lengths to prevent that possibility from happening. In adopting that position he arrogantly and uncompromisingly places his own judgment above the mother&#8217;s, above the professionals involved in the case, and above that of successive High Court Judges who have ordered the children&#8217;s return.</p>

The children remain stranded in Libya, living away from both of their parents. They are also separated from their sibling who lives in England with the mother, and that sibling is enduring separation from them. The children in Libya are also being kept in a country whose structures of governance and public services are under enormous strain and where the people live under the threat of violence. It is difficult to conceive how the children&#8217;s father can possibly believe that the continued separation of the two children in Libya from their parents and other sibling is in their best interests. The Defendant himself says, through Counsel, that Libya is currently a dangerous country. It is cruel to leave them stranded in Libya and to refuse to do anything to help secure their return. The Defendant&#8217;s breaches have resulted in continuing harm being caused to his children by separation and by their being deprived an opportunity to come home to a safer and more supportive environment within a reunified family.</p>

The court should not impose a sentence of imprisonment if a lesser sanction is appropriate. Previous sentences of imprisonment for contempt have not secured the return of the children to this jurisdiction. It might be said therefore that imprisoning the Defendant once again will serve no purpose: it will be unlikely to achieve the purpose for which the breached orders were made. I accept that it is unlikely that a sentence of imprisonment will suddenly cause the Defendant to change his approach, although it may do so. However, wilful defiance of the court should not cease to be recognised and appropriately dealt with as contempt of court merely because it is repeated. The Defendant has had it in his own hands to avoid imprisonment, but he has chosen a different course. He leaves this court with no choice. In my judgment, given all the circumstances, the only sentence that is appropriate in this case is one of imprisonment.</p>

I take into account the terms of imprisonment previously served by the Defendant when assessing the appropriate sentence. Whereas the continued breaching of court orders is an aggravating feature, not a mitigating feature, in this case, the court should ensure that the totality of the sentences is proportionate to the contemptuous conduct. It is not necessary on each occasion to increase the length of the sentence of imprisonment, even where that is permissible in law. Although the previous sentence for contempt in this case was the maximum permitted of two years, it does not follow that this court should impose the same sentence. That sentence was imposed three years ago. Whilst the Defendant has continued to defy court orders, I have to take into account the nature and circumstances of the current contempt of court. I do take into account the fact that in detention the Defendant will be less able to assist to secure the return of the children if he were to decide to do so. When he is released, he should not think that he is immune from further penalty including imprisonment because he has already spent so long in custody.</p>

A shorter sentence would not be sufficient to reflect the seriousness of the breaches in this case.

Ms Renton for the Applicant proposed that the court should defer the commencement of the sentences for three to four weeks to allow the Defendant to comply with the breached orders, but I have already adjourned sentence for that purpose and the Defendant did not avail himself of the opportunity. I have no reason to believe that he would do so if given yet another opportunity to comply and I see no justification for delaying the sentence for that purpose. The 12 month sentences of imprisonment will begin immediately.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The Defendant will serve half of that twelve month term of imprisonment and then he will be entitled to be released. He may seek to purge his contempt by complying with the court orders, but he now has a limited opportunity to do so from prison unless members of the Libyan Embassy are prepared to visit him in prison, or some other arrangements can be made.</p>
