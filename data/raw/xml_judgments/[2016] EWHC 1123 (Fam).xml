	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">This is an application by a Guardian who seeks an order restraining a local authority from disclosing to the parents of a child in care a specific piece of information which that child, I, has shared with professionals. As a result it has come to the attention of the local authority which seeks the court&#8217;s guidance on whether or not this is information which should be passed on to his parents and step-mother, the respondents in the care proceedings.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I, whilst still a child for the purposes of the current care proceedings, is a young man who will celebrate his sixteenth birthday in October this year (2016).  On learning that what he said might be shared with his family, he has very specifically asked the Guardian to ensure that the information remains private.  His mother, the first respondent, supports his wish.  In common with the Guardian, she is very anxious that his choice to confide in the professionals involved in his life about personal matters which may or may not be of any great consequence should be respected in accordance with the personal autonomy he is entitled to exercise as an increasingly independent young man.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The second and fourth respondents are I&#8217;s father and step-mother.  He has lived with them since August 2013 when, at the conclusion of earlier care proceedings involving  the mother&#8217;s children, a residence order was made in favour of the father subject to a supervision order.  The child was originally placed with the father in August 2013 under an interim order made in favour of a different local authority.  A residence order was made in favour of the father and a supervision order was made in favour of Local Authority X on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> April 2014. Local Authority X has therefore been involved with the child for just over 2 years. In March 2015, he was made the subject of a child protection plan because of the perceived emotional abuse he was suffering in his father&#8217;s home.  He has expressed great unhappiness in his placement with his father and step-mother and has absconded on more than one occasion.  Very unusually, he wishes to remain in care in an appropriate foster placement for the remainder of his minority.  He does not want to return to his father&#8217;s home and has made it clear that he wishes to have no contact at all with either his father or his step-mother.  Whilst he recognises that he cannot return to live with his mother, he does anticipate returning to her home once he has completed his secondary education and begins to make his way in the world as an adult with the freedom of choice which that status will bring.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Matters came to a head at the end of last year.  In December 2015 I was placed in police protection and transferred to a local foster placement.  An emergency protection order was made on 14 December 2015.  In February 2016, Holman J made an interim care order at the conclusion of a contested hearing.  There is a further hearing listed later this month with a final hearing in the substantive care proceedings on 17 May 2016.  Throughout this year, I has lived at his foster placement and is happy to stay there until further decisions are taken in relation to his immediate future.  He attends school locally and, whilst it is recognised that he has special educational needs, he appears to be thriving in that environment.  The local authority&#8217;s care plan refers to the inability of I&#8217;s father and step-mother to place his wishes and feelings above their own and their refusal to acknowledge his wish to leave their household.  It is said that they have consistently failed to acknowledge and recognise the detrimental impact of their behaviour on I both during the period when he was living with them and during contact since his removal.  It is said that they lack insight into his emotional needs and, were the court to force him to return to his father&#8217;s home, the likelihood is that he would abscond again  thereby putting himself at risk of unnecessary harm.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Whilst the mother supports the local authority&#8217;s care plan for S, the father and his current wife do not.  The father accepts that he operated what might be described as a disciplined household but he rejects the local authority&#8217;s case that he is unable to meet I&#8217;s needs in terms of providing a secure and nurturing home.   He seeks the discharge of the interim care order and the return of I to his care notwithstanding the clear wishes which I himself has expressed.  For all practical purposes it appears that the relationship between father and son has effectively broken down completely at this point in time.  When I moved to his current foster placement, he asked for all of his belongings to be sent to him, including his clothing and his X-Box.  He was adamant that he did not wish to return to his father&#8217;s home.  In a report which the Guardian prepared in January this year, she referred to the neglect which I had suffered over the years of his mother&#8217;s care.  He was exposed to episodes of domestic violence between his parents and he has reported at least one similar episode between his father and step-mother.        </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Thus, the central issues for the court at the forthcoming final hearing of these care proceedings will be the extent to which I&#8217;s father and step-mother can provide adequate, or &#8220;good enough&#8221;, care for this young man and whether his independent wishes and feelings should take precedence over their wishes to have him living once again in their home.</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">&#8220;Relatively recently, the child concerned imparted some information to a social worker, which he has repeated also to the guardian.  <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">I stress that the information does not relate or pertain at all to either of his parents or his stepmother, but relates and pertains essentially to himself.  Nothing in the information is in any way critical of anything done or not done, or said or not said, by either of his parents or his stepmother</span>.  The child himself has said very strongly that he does not wish either of his parents or his stepmother to know the information in question.  The guardian considers that that confidentiality should be respected and that the information should not be disclosed or revealed to either of the parents or the stepmother. The local authority are very mindful and respectful of the confidentiality of a 15-year old child who is in their care, They do not consider that, realistically and objectively, the information could or should affect any issue at the forthcoming final hearing of the care proceedings. But they do consider that if one or other or both parents did know the information, one or other or both of them might wish to seek to deploy it in some way as part of their case in the care proceedings.&#8221; (The emphasis is mine.)</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Thus, the current dilemma arises in circumstances where the local authority perceives an obligation to disclose the information unless the court indicates that in its view, on the facts and in the circumstances of this particular case, there is no such duty or obligation. On the other hand, the authority is properly mindful of the confidence which I reposed in sharing this information with a professional and his adamant wish that it should not be discussed with or revealed to anyone else.  He has made it plain that he regards what he said as an entirely private matter and, through the Guardian, he asks the court to respect that confidence.  At this stage, there has been no investigation into whether or not the information is true in any event but that is not a matter on which I have been asked to express any view or make any findings. </p>

In accordance with the practice recommended in those authorities, his Lordship directed that the papers were to be released to counsel instructed to attend today but on the basis that those legal representatives should not disclose the papers or the information contained in them to their respective clients.  Pending adjudication of the issue, the local authority was ordered not to disclose the information to any of the respondents.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Before turning to the substance of those arguments, two points need to be made with emphasis.  First, there is now a much greater move towards transparency in Family Courts sitting up and down the land and no more so than in the Family Division of the High Court.  In accordance with the Practice Guidance issued by Sir James Munby, President of the Family Division, on 16 January 2014 under the banner of &#8220;Transparency in the Family Courts&#8221;, there are now many more published judgments which are regularly made available to anyone who cares to read them.  Sometimes the private family information recorded in those judgments will lead to the anonymization of certain names and details in order to protect the individual children or their parents who are the subject of proceedings. It is absolutely right and proper that this is so and nothing said or done in the context of these proceedings should be seen as diluting that fundamental and overarching principle in any way.  Secondly, these are care proceedings by virtue of which, in appropriate circumstances, Parliament has sanctioned state intervention in the regulation of family life.  Courts are required to make decisions on a daily basis which inevitably have far reaching consequences for the future lives, happiness and wellbeing of children and their families.  The local authority&#8217;s current application for a final care order will have a significant impact in this case for both I and his parents and step-mother.  To that extent, they are entitled as of right to a fair trial of this issue.  That right is enshrined in Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  However, as I shall explain, in relation to disclosure for the purposes of such a trial, none of the respondents has an absolute right or entitlement to disclosure of every last piece of information which is, or may be, available.  What they are entitled to is information or documents which are relevant to the issue or issues which fall to be considered by the court or which enable them, as litigants, properly to advance their respective cases and to challenge any defects or shortcomings in the case advanced by the local authority.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Those principles expose the conundrum in this case.  As I shall shortly need to consider, the disclosure of the information which is the subject of the Guardian&#8217;s current application is an issue which engages a balancing exercise.  Each of the respondents in this case, including I, has the right to respect for his or her private and family life (Article 8).  That is a qualified right.  Where competing Convention rights are in issue, as here, neither Article 6 nor Article 8 has precedence: see <span style="font-style:italic">Campbell v MGN Ltd </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] 2 AC 457" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] 2 AC 457</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">R(L) v Commissioner of the Metropolis </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] 1 FLR 643" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] 1 FLR 643</ref>.  However, in terms of the competing rights of parents and a child under Article 8, the European Court of Human Rights has unanimously held that it is the interests of the child and his or her right to respect for private and family life which prevails in any balancing exercise undertaken by the court: see <span style="font-style:italic">Yousef v The Netherlands </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2002) 36 EHRR 290" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">(2002) 36 EHRR 290</ref>.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">During the course of this hearing, I raised with counsel how I was to deal with the substance of the information provided by I so as not to defeat the purpose of this judgment.  If disclosure is ordered, there is no difficulty because the information will be available to the respondents in any event together with my judgment.  However, if the balance falls in favour of I&#8217;s interests in preserving the confidentiality of that information, any attempt to define its substance, even in the widest terms, will expose that which he regards as essentially a private matter which should not, and need not, be shared with his family.</p>

I wish only to reiterate that the information relates and pertains essentially to I himself and contains no element of criticism of either his parents or his step-mother or the care which any of them has provided in the past or is likely to provide in future.  I would not wish the fact that there has had to be a judicial determination of the issue after a formal application by the Guardian to lend any additional weight or credence to a suspicion on the part of the respondents (or, indeed, anyone else who might read this judgment) that there is something essentially secret or sinister in what I has said.  It is a personal matter which he wishes to keep privately to himself and those with whom he chooses to share the information.  What I have to decide is whether his expectation of confidence is justified and permissible when weighed against the rights and expectations of the respondents and, in particular, the father who shares parental responsibility for I with the local authority and who has an absolute entitlement to a fair trial in the forthcoming care proceedings in accordance with his Article 6 rights.</p>

Some thirty years ago, the House of Lords ruled that a parent&#8217;s right to control a child in the exercise of his or her parental duty was a dwindling right which existed only to the extent necessary for the child&#8217;s benefit and protection. In relation to medical treatment or advice, a parent&#8217;s right to determine whether a child under 16 years should undergo such treatment came to an end once the child achieved sufficient intelligence and understanding to make the decision for himself or herself.  The decision gave rise to the concept of <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;Gillick competence&#8217;</span>, a developmental concept which has to be considered in the light of the age, understanding and intelligence of each relevant child.  It is accepted by all parties that I is <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;Gillick competent&#8217;</span>.</p>

In the course of delivering his judgment, Silber J highlighted the prevailing and developing trend towards giving young people greater rights concerning their own future whilst reducing the supervisory rights of their parents.  In relation to the respect to be given to a child&#8217;s right to confidentiality, he cited the earlier reference of Thorpe LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Mabon v Mabon</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2005/634" uk:canonical="[2005] EWCA Civ 634" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] EWCA Civ 634</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 2 FLR 1011" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 2 FLR 1011</ref> to &#8216;the keener appreciation of the autonomy of the child and the child&#8217;s consequential right to participate in decision-making processes that fundamentally affect his family life&#8217;.  Silber J stressed the critical importance of the age and maturity of the young person concerned in any determination which involved a parent&#8217;s right to exert parental authority over a child. He held that any right to family life on behalf of the parent dwindles as their child gets older and is able to understand  the consequence of different choices and then make decisions relating to those choices (para 129).</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">&#8220;The European Commission on Human Rights has explained the existence of family ties depends upon the real existence and practice of close family ties.  It is not clear why the parent should have an Article 8 right to a family life where first the offspring is almost 16 years of age and does not wish it, second where the parent no longer has a right of control over the child for the reasons set out in the last paragraph and third where the young person, in Lord Scarman&#8217;s words, &#8220;has sufficient understanding of what is involved to give a consent valid in law&#8221;. There is nothing in the Strasbourg jurisprudence which persuades me that any parental right or power of control under Article 8 is wider than in domestic law.  Parental right to family life does not continue after the time when the child is able to make his own decisions. So parents do not have Article 8 rights to be notified of any advice of the medical profession after the young person is able to look after himself or herself and make his or her own decisions.&#8221;</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In this case, the Guardian and the local authority are not agreed upon the correct approach to the determination of this matter.  On behalf of the Guardian, Dr Bainham submits that the issue should be resolved by applying <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick </span>principles as subsequently explained and expanded by Silber J in the <span style="font-style:italic">Axon </span>case.  In this case the information which I wishes to remain confidential does not involve any proposed medical treatment.  That much I can properly say.  Thus, on the Guardian&#8217;s case as advanced by Dr Bainham, the duty of confidentiality which was found to exist as between a <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick </span>competent child and a doctor or other medical professional advising on, or offering, medical treatment would necessarily be extended so as to cover social workers and other professionals engaged with the young person concerned.  The local authority points to the existence of the specific statutory duty under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/22/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 22(4)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> to share information.  This obligation, argues Mr Krumins, establishes a default position of disclosure unless and until a court decides that withholding information is justified in the particular circumstances of any given case.  But for the existence of care proceedings, he accepts that there would be no obligation placed upon the local authority to disclose the information as the <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick </span>line of authority would apply.  On the basis of <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick, Axon </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Yousef</span>, I&#8217;s Article 8 rights would take precedence over those of his family members.  However, because of the existence of the current care proceedings, the competing rights which have to be considered are I&#8217;s Article 8 rights and the respondents&#8217; Article 6 rights.  Whereas Article 8 rights are qualified, Article 6 rights are absolute.  Thus, on the local authority&#8217;s case, the approach developed and applied by the courts through <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick, Axon </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">PD </span>applies but only insofar as it confirms I&#8217;s entitlement to full consideration of his Article 8 rights.  In order to strike a fair balance between the various interests involved, the test set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Re D </span>must be applied subject to the overarching consideration of the relevance of the information to these particular proceedings.</p>

He contends on behalf of the Guardian that the <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Axon </span>principles which recognise the respect to be accorded to a child or young person&#8217;s autonomy in relation to contraceptive advice or medical treatment should also be applied in equal measure to a personal disclosure of the kind made by I.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is important in my view to bear in mind that these observations were made in the context of R&#8217;s request for disclosure of documentation which included, inter alia, various psychiatric and psychological reports on a mother, the children and her present husband (not R who was the natural father of one of those children).  Within that material were notes made by a therapist of the therapeutic work being undertaken with the mother and two of the children.  She had claimed that disclosure of this particular information to R within the care proceedings was a violation of her Article 8 rights.  Whilst allowing disclosure of some of the contested material, Munby J agreed that proper respect for the mother&#8217;s Article 8 rights justified redaction and/or non-disclosure to R of certain parts of the evidence since the harm which disclosure would cause would be wholly disproportionate to any legitimate forensic purpose served.  At para 86 of his judgment, he said this:</p>

It is not something that is necessary if R is to have a fair trial.  To allow him to see this material would, I am satisfied, fail to afford due respect for the mother&#8217;s private and family life.  So far as concerns (iii) <span style="font-style:italic">[those parts of the report of the consultant psychologist relating to sessions with two of the children, K and S] </span>the position is very much the same save that the primary focus is here upon K and S rather than the mother.

Depriving R of the opportunity to see this material will not deny him a fair trial; allowing him to see it will, I am satisfied, breach the Art 8 rights in particular of K and S.&#8221;</p>

It was accepted that the information might well have &#8220;extraordinary&#8221; adverse consequences for the design and implementation of the care plan if general disclosure was permitted.  Counsel for the guardian accepted that the information which he sought to protect was not directly adverse to the mother who was resisting the care proceedings in the sense that it nowhere bore upon her suitability or the assessment of her capacity to provide good enough parenting in the life of her child.  In delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Thorpe LJ said this at page 1032 F:</p>

As matters stand, I&#8217;s father does not know anything about the information and he will not know unless and until the court authorises its disclosure.

Whilst I can see the force of that submission, it does not in my judgment mean that I can disregard the equally important considerations which flow from the engagement of the respondents&#8217; Article 6 rights.  I&#8217;s views are important.  They are entitled to considerable respect but they are one aspect of the overall balance which has to be achieved in this case.  In my judgment, they are not determinative of outcome.

In relation to relevance, he contends that the threshold is low.

Within the material which has been put before the court is a statement prepared by a social worker on behalf of the local authority.  It is dated 8 April 2016.  In that statement, the social worker, AB, expresses the view that I may be embarrassed or ashamed as a result of disclosure.  However, she acknowledges, too, that he may in future be reluctant to share information with professionals if the information is revealed to his parents against his wishes.  Her statement also raises an issue as to whether what he said was true in any event.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The concerns of the social worker find strong reflection in the Guardian&#8217;s evidence.  She tells me that, knowing what she does about I&#8217;s father and step-mother, she believes neither &#8216;would &#8230; be able to respond to the information in a child-centred way at all, and that this could have emotionally devastating consequences for [I]&#8217;.  She sets out in her evidence a report which she had received from a colleague who was present at a recent LAC review which was attended by I&#8217;s father and step-mother.  One of the issues for discussion on that occasion was their willingness to engage in some work with an appropriate professional in order to assist their understanding of I&#8217;s needs.  Their presentation on that occasion was said to be &#8220;extremely oppositional, even in [I&#8217;s] presence&#8221;.  The report which emanated from that meeting is recorded in the body of the Guardian&#8217;s statement in this way.</p>

His wife [I&#8217;s step-mother] then started a wholly inappropriate and crass attack on the social worker &#8211; how can she do the job at her age, not having children. Basically, following father&#8217;s continued ranting and finger-pointing at me, I had no choice but to prematurely bring the review to an end. I&#8217;m far from convinced that the LA should be promoting contact for [I] with them.  Before there can/should be any relationship work undertaken, perhaps father in particular should be advised to see his GP regarding having anger management and/or counselling.  He certainly won&#8217;t be invited to the next review unless he makes some radical changes.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"> The Guardian expresses her very real concerns that the good relationship which I has managed to establish with his social worker and foster carer may be damaged by disclosure of the information which he wishes to keep private.  Those relationships are important to him because they enable him to confide in these professional carers and, in turn, to receive appropriate support and guidance.  To override his express wishes may undermine his trust in professionals making it difficult for them to offer the level of help and support from which he has so clearly benefitted to date.  This would be entirely counter-productive and inimical to his best interests.  She has no confidence in either the father&#8217;s or step-mother&#8217;s ability to respond appropriately or sensitively to something which I regards as a personal and embarrassing episode and she regards the prospects of disclosure as being &#8216;highly detrimental&#8217; to his welfare.</p>

He points to the absence of any direct statements by I himself as to his fear of his parents&#8217; reaction.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I have to bear in mind that I is a very vulnerable young man.  He is not yet 16 years old and has already been the subject of two separate sets of care proceedings.  He has been found to have suffered neglectful and abusive parenting at the hands of his mother.  His experience of life was fractured when he left his home with her to live in a completely different part of the country with his father and step-mother.  His unhappiness and distress in that placement is reflected in his attempts to abscond and his absolute resistance to any return to that household and any form of continuing relationship with his father and/or his present wife.  Whilst I accept that it is an untested account, I regard the record of what transpired at the recent LAC review as providing a valuable insight into what I is likely to be experiencing at the present time in terms of the conflict which appears to exist between his family and the professionals who are currently caring for him.  The picture of I which emerges from the record of that meeting is one of a young man who has few, if any, coping strategies for dealing with that conflict.  I do not accept that the absence of a specific reference by I to fear of his father&#8217;s reaction should lead me to a conclusion that he has no such fear.  On behalf of the mother, Miss Bartholomew supports the Guardian&#8217;s position that there is a real risk of further significant harm to I in the event of disclosure.  She records in her written submissions the mother&#8217;s historic and ongoing concerns about the aggressive and inflexible behaviour demonstrated by his father.  She is concerned that his reaction to the information may well place I at risk of significant harm.</p>

In his evidence in response to the local authority&#8217;s case, I&#8217;s father has denied entirely that his son is suffering, or has suffered, from any significant emotional harm.  He accepts that he has shouted at I but justifies this on the basis that, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;If you don&#8217;t stand up as a parent, the children are going to walk on you&#8221;</span>.  It is said that he referred to I in highly derogatory terms because of his educational difficulties.  He does not admit using any such inflammatory terms but still refers to I in his statement as &#8220;this little boy&#8221;.  I am satisfied that there is a clear risk that the consequences of disclosure of this material may well result in I&#8217;s disengagement from the professionals who have provided him with guidance and support since his reception into care.  He has been damaged by his experience of family life in recent years and findings in relation to threshold have already been made in the context of the interim care order which sanctioned his removal from his father&#8217;s home.  If his current support structure were to be put at risk for any reason, he may well withdraw and internalise issues thereby putting his happiness and future wellbeing at significant risk.</p>

In this respect, it is essential that I believes that he can repose trust and confidence in those professionals and the care and support they will be providing.  It would be harmful to him, and significantly so, if the chance to restore some form of relationship between parent and son in future were jeopardised because of a disclosure now of information which he regards as confidential.</p>

Thus, I ask myself whether the overall interests of I benefit from non-disclosure.

I have already recorded my doubts about the relevance of the information to the issues which are likely to be addressed at the final hearing.  In this context, I can see little benefit to I in ventilating the material before the court later this month.  If his wishes are overruled in this respect, I can see his distress in relation to disclosure to his father and step-mother being compounded by the knowledge that these very private matters may well be the subject of forensic scrutiny and debate in court.  That distress may well compound fears he may harbour about maintaining an open relationship in future with the professionals who are charged with responsibility for his wellbeing, whether teachers at school, social workers who continue to be involved in his care, foster carers or therapists.  There is ample evidence in the papers to substantiate the positive benefits which have already flowed from his ability to confide in others.  I regard both the magnitude of the risk of harm occurring and the gravity of that harm if it does occur as being substantial and significant.  The balance at this point clearly falls in favour of non-disclosure. Indeed, I can find no positive benefits to I whatsoever in disclosure at this stage.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">As to the respondents&#8217; Article 6 rights, the relevance of the information to outcome has already been addressed.  In my judgment, it is of tangential or minimally indirect relevance at its highest and is completely irrelevant at its lowest.  The local authority accepts that it will not impact upon outcome or future planning for I.  The respondents&#8217; rights to a fair trial are, of course, absolute but, as Lady Justice Hale acknowledged in <span style="font-style:italic">Re X</span>, in deciding how to conduct a fair trial, it is perfectly reasonable to take account of the facts and circumstances of the particular case with which the court is dealing.  The concept of a fair trial is inviolable but the <span style="font-style:italic">content</span> (including the evidence) which is placed before the court is flexible and depends upon context and the issues with which the court is dealing. Whilst I accept that any departure from the usual requirements in relation to the disclosure of evidence in an adversarial trial must be for a legitimate aim and proportionate to that aim, the Court of Appeal has held that protecting the welfare of vulnerable young persons is a specific and undoubtedly a legitimate aim.</p>

The circumstances of this case, looked at in the round, do make it exceptional and I regard it as entirely necessary that I&#8217;s confidence and privacy in this information is maintained.  I cannot overlook the fact that, as a <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick </span>competent young person, he has expressed in the clearest terms his wish that the family should not have access to the information.

The hearings listed on 12 and 17 May 2016 shall remain in the court list as effective fixtures.  I am aware that there was some discussion at the hearing before Holman J as to whether or not these hearings should be dealt with by the designated judge at the Family Court where the care proceedings are due to be heard.  On one view, if this information is not relevant to the proceedings and has not been disclosed to the respondents, the judge who hears the case should not know about it either.  However, I am aware (because I was told by counsel for the father) that there are ongoing discussions about this case.  I say no more about those discussions because they are legally privileged despite the fact that no one has raised any objection to my being alerted to their existence.  There appears to be a consensus that the IRH listed before the designated judge on 12 May 2016 should proceed in any event.  I propose to leave it to her to consider whether she should hear the final hearing or whether she should allocate the case to a different judge for the purposes of a final disposal, should matters reach that stage after what I anticipate will be careful discussions at the IRH..</p>

We are in the realms of speculation and these matters are much better dealt with, if at all, in the context of the final hearing and any consequential directions which may flow from the judge&#8217;s findings of fact.  Miss Bartholomew also raised the issue of the mother&#8217;s representation at the IRH and final hearing.  In the event that she is not available to represent the mother as seems likely, she seeks guidance on whether or not alternative counsel should be made aware of the information which I have said must not be disclosed on the basis that counsel will provide the same written assurance as that provided today by all four legal representatives pursuant to Holman J&#8217;s order.  It seems to me that any alternative counsel should conduct the hearing from the same footing as all the other legal representatives in the case.  In these circumstances, and because everyone in court is aware of the (now) embargoed information, I shall give permission for the release of the information to any alternative counsel instructed by the mother.  That information will be disclosed to him or her on condition that he or she complies with paragraph 4 of the order made by Holman J on 18 April 2016.</p>

I, too, am deeply conscious that whenever disclosure issues of this kind arise, there is inevitably a problem once parents or other interested respondents are put on notice that there exists some information in respect of which the court has supported an application for non-disclosure.  As Holman J observed, &#8216;&#8220;conspiracy theory&#8221; and imaginings may inevitably take over&#8217;.  The parents and step-mother may well be concerned that the information is graver than it actually is.  I would hope to reassure them by my finding in relation to the likely relevance of the information to the issues which are at stake.</p>
