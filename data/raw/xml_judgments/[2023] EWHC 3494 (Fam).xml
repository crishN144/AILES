Unfortunately, the court did not list the application upon receipt and the CACASS safeguarding checks were not carried out. U was subsequently taken in August 2021 by his mother to France; a move which his father did not oppose on the basis that it had been agreed between U&#8217;s parents that the father would have regular contact with U. That contact did not take place and the father made an application through ICACU for access to U under the Hague convention. As a result of that application, the father became aware that U had been removed from his mother and taken into care by the French authorities. </p>

The procedural formalities set out in FPR Rule 31.4(2) and Practice Direction 31A para 2.2 include providing a statement and a copy of the judgment translated into English.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I consider that the issue now before me is the recognition and enforcement of the July 2022 and September 2022 orders made in the French courts. The French Appellate Court in May 2023 simply refused the mother&#8217;s appeal against the September 2022 order which as consequence remained standing. Whilst I understand the father&#8217;s wish to adopt the appeal court&#8217;s reasoning, Art. 23 of the 1996 Convention applies to measures. In this context, measures mean orders &#8211; see for instance <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re P</span><span style="font-style:italic"/>(above) at paragraph 10. In my judgment, the orders which apply for consideration by me are therefore the French orders made in July 2022 and that made in September 2022. The order of the Appeal Court in May 2023 merely refused an appeal against the September 2022 order. There is no May 2023 order of substance to recognize or enforce.</p>

Accordingly, the order made by the French courts in July 2022 should be recognized and can be enforced. I agree.</p>

However, the order was made at a time when proceedings in England were already before a court and when the court in France would have known that the order of July 2022 had been acted upon and U was now living with his father in London. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I have also considered the effect of the order of Mr. Justice Macdonald on 6 March 2023. On 6 March 2023 Mr. Justice Macdonald considered a request pursuant to Art. 8 of the 1996 Hague Convention from the French Republic that this court should accept jurisdiction pursuant to Art. 8 of the 1996 Hague Convention. Having accepted the transfer in, on the same day Mr. Justice Macdonald went on to direct that this matter will be allocated as if the application had been made in England and Wales and duly listed it for further directions before a judge of the Division. Since then, it has been case managed by Mrs. Justice Knowles who has made directions to enable welfare decisions to be taken in the future in relation to U. On 1 August 2023, Mrs. Justice Knowles dismissed the mother&#8217;s application dated 7 July 2023 to vary the arrangements under the July and September 2022 orders to enable the mother to care for U in France over the summer holidays. She also made: a prohibited steps order prohibiting the mother from removing U from his father&#8217;s care and control; a spends time with order limited to a card or letter once a week which the mother could send to U; and a non-molestation order to protect U and the father from the mother&#8217;s behaviours. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In the end, however, I have decided that the duration of the order of September 2022 is determined by the wording of the order itself.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It appears to me that it may assist the parties and be beneficial to U if I set out in brief and plain language what this all means for U.  Putting it simply, it means that U has been entrusted to his father and lives with him by reason of the order of July 2022. The contact provision of that order has now been varied by this court. The interim contact order in force as I type this judgment is that of Mrs. Justice Knowles which she made on 1 August 2023, namely a spends time with order limited to a card or letter once a week which the mother can send to U. In addition, the prohibited steps order made by Mrs. Justice Knowles prohibiting the mother from removing U from his father&#8217;s care and control remains in force. On 1 August 2023, Mrs. Justice Knowles made a non-molestation order to protect U and the father from the mother&#8217;s behaviours. That has been replaced by undertakings given by the mother on 20 September 2023 and which this court understands the mother will renew at the conclusion of this hearing.</p>
