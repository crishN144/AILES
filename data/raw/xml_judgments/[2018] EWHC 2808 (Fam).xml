The parents moved in October of that year to stay with the mother&#8217;s brother who lived in England. The mother says this was a decision to permanently move but it is the father&#8217;s case that there was no agreement to live in the UK permanently and no discussion about such a plan. Nevertheless, the family clearly settled in England and remained in this country for nearly 4 years. </p>

The mother complains that the father&#8217;s interest in spending time with A decreased and he began spending less regular time with his son. The father states that it was the maternal grandmother who was providing the majority of care for A (until sometime in the summer of 2017), whilst the mother was working in a bar and the father alleges, continuing with her &#8220;partying lifestyle&#8221;.

	    <p class="ListNumber" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">It is the mother&#8217;s case that separation of the parents led to her struggling financially and she alleges that there was no financial support from father. These financial difficulties, she says, led to her proposing that A go to stay with the maternal grandmother who was once again living in Latvia. She states that the proposal was for A to stay in Latvia &#8220;for a few months&#8221;. She states that the agreed plan was for him to stay in Latvia from February until sometime after his birthday in June. She states that it was agreed between the parents that A would then come back to the UK in the summer of 2018. Although no set date was agreed, she states it was agreed that it would be after his birthday.</p>

	    <p class="ListNumber" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Whilst both parents were able to provide a little more detail through their oral evidence, it is unfortunate that a large focus of both parents&#8217; evidence was on complaints about each other&#8217;s behaviour rather than the life experiences and perceptions of their son. However, both parents in their oral evidence did present in a straightforward way. I am satisfied that both were trying to assist the court in explaining their own perception of the circumstances. </p>

It is the father&#8217;s case that there was a verbal agreement between the parents that A would stay with his mother for &#8220;a few days&#8221; and be returned to his care on 4 July. </p>

On further enquiry it appears that following the father&#8217;s complaint to the police about the removal of A from Latvia at the beginning of July, the grandmother had responded with criticisms and complaints about the care that had been afforded to A by his father. Neither parent appeared particularly clear about this information or the outcome, although both confirmed that there are no proceedings in Latvia and no action had been taken against the father.</p>

He was living with his father and paternal family and having regular contact with his maternal grandparents. Whilst his mother was not part of his day-to-day life, she had visited and I am told, had regular telephone/ Skype contact. The familiarity of the people and places that were his day-to-day life in Latvia, I am satisfied will have led to him integrating relatively quickly, feeling familiar, stable and settled in his father&#8217;s care. I am satisfied that the seesaw analogy referred to by Lord Wilson had tipped well and truly in favour of Latvia.  As such, his removal by his mother on 4 July was wrong.</p>

	    <p class="ListNumber" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The mother argues that the return of A, would place him at risk of psychological harm or otherwise place them in an intolerable situation. The defence pleaded is that he would be in unfamiliar surroundings with unfamiliar people. This is simply not factually correct and it was in fact the mother herself, who placed him in Latvia in February 2018.</p>

	    <p class="ListNumber" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">I do accept that separation from the mother will be distressing for A. In the defence statement, the mother asserts that she is unable to return to Latvia due to the commitments in England. I do not have any details about this. I hope she will be able to look at ways of travelling to Latvia to spend significant periods of time with her son. I note that the mother herself did not see separation of A from his parents, for a period of several months between February and the summer, as placing A at grave risk of psychological harm or placing him in an otherwise intolerable situation. Whilst I accept that he has now started school in the UK, this in itself is insufficient to satisfy me that a return to Latvia would place him at such risk.</p>
