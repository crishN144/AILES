VT told me that the X property is managed by a lawyer who collects the rents; he wrote a supporting letter dated 23rd April 2009 stating he would be prepared to continue this role for a fee but he did not provide any accounts. The Y property is managed by ST's cousin who collects the rents and pays them into ST's bank account with a Nigerian bank. VT was able to provide a fair amount of financial information; see schedule 2 to her second statement. However, I was surprised by the lack of disclosure of the raw material (such as bank accounts or receipts) which enabled her to provide that information notwithstanding the deputy's requests for the same. Some documentation such as copy deeds might not be in her gift to provide but that does not explain the complete absence of supporting documentation. I am left with an overwhelming impression of a desire to retain absolute control within the family.</p>

However, it became apparent that AT last went to Nigeria in the 1980's and his evidence then appeared to be on the lines of ST keeping him informed about ST's enterprises. The COP1A completed for AT in September 2009 does not contain the detail one would expect from someone with intimate knowledge to share and is all the more surprising for there being such little information about the bank accounts (given AT told me he collected the statements).</p>

I could not begin to reconcile his evidence of having intimate knowledge of ST's property and affairs with his ignorance of the arrival of the builders and the negotiations with members of the letting agency. I am incredulous that once AT saw there were builders in the property knocking it about he felt that nothing more was to be done than inform his solicitors and make a competing deputyship application. I am also incredulous that he took the same attitude upon discovering that the builders had been replaced by persons living in the property.</p>
