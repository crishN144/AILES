	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">I am concerned with a young person to whom I shall refer in this judgment as &#8216;R&#8217;.  He was born in 2009 and is now aged 13&#189;.  I shall refer to the parties as &#8216;the father&#8217; and &#8216;the mother&#8217; respectively.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">On 20 February 2023, I met R briefly at court in the company of Ms Catherine Callaghan, the Cafcass Officer.  In her first report, Ms Callaghan described R as a teenager who presented as &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">a polite, articulate young person whose level of maturity is consistent with his chronological age</span>&#8217;.  Having met him, I entirely agree with that description and would add that he comes across as a charming and engaging young person who is a credit to his parents.  He is lucky to have two parents who love him and want to do what they feel is best for him.  It is his misfortune, however, that his parents disagree and that he is caught in the middle of their dispute.  In common with many young people his age who find themselves in a similar situation, this creates a conflict of loyalties for him.     </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">In the summer of 2022, R came to stay in England with his mother for a holiday.  At the end of the summer, he was expected to return to Portugal, the country in which he had until that point lived since his birth.  Instead of returning him, the mother retained him in England.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">In those circumstances, the father now applies for R to be returned to Portugal under the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (&#8216;the 1980 Hague Convention&#8217;), an international instrument given statutory force in this jurisdiction by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985</ref> (&#8216;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1985 Act</ref>&#8217;).</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Although the application comes before the court nearly six months after the date of the retention, the father acted promptly once he learned from the mother that she would not send R back to Portugal.  He made his application through the Portuguese Central Authority on 27 September 2022.  The application was then transmitted to the International Child Abduction and Contact Unit (&#8216;ICACU&#8217;) acting as Central Authority for England and Wales.  ICACU instructed solicitors on 10 October 2023 and proceedings were issued under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1985 Act</ref> on 19 October 2023.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The mother accepts that her retention of R last summer was a wrongful retention for the purposes of Article 3 of the 1980 Hague Convention.  This means that the court is obliged to make an order returning R to the jurisdiction of Portugal &#8216;forthwith&#8217;, unless the mother can establish one or more of the exceptions contained in Article 13, the burden being on her to do so.  If an exception is established, the court has a discretion as to whether a return should be ordered or not.</p>

I explained my role to R and allowed him the opportunity to ask me questions or to tell me anything he wished to say.  In fact, R did not raise anything of relevance to these proceedings (we spoke briefly about the court system more generally).</p>

	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">At the outset of the hearing, the mother applied for permission to adduce a further statement, an application which I allowed (the application was not seriously resisted by the father; although the statement was excluded from the court bundle, a copy was provided to me before the start of the hearing so that I could read it <span style="font-style:italic">de bene esse</span>).  Her only other statement is dated 2 February 2023 and was prepared at a time when she was acting in person.  Shortly after it was filed, she was granted legal aid and she prepared a fuller statement with the assistance of solicitors.  This was served on the father on 10 February 2023, which in my view allowed him sufficient time to deal with it. The delay in obtaining legal aid was not due to any fault on the mother&#8217;s part.  The father has been able to file two statements in the proceedings and, in my view, there would have been an imbalance in the evidence had I restricted the mother to relying upon the short statement she prepared when acting in person.  The statement had in any event been sent (by agreement) to the Cafcass officer and it would thus have been artificial for me not to see it.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The case has not been assisted by a significant delay in the listing.  One consequence of the delay was that the Cafcass report in the bundle was based upon an interview with R which took place nearly four months ago.  At the outset of the hearing the parties raised with me the potential for R to meet me, as he had expressed a wish to do.  Given the forensic constraints that apply to meetings between judges and children and the length of time which had elapsed since R had been able to communicate his views, I directed that prior to meeting me, R should be interviewed again by Ms Callaghan.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">In 2011 there were proceedings before the Portuguese Court which led to an order being made for R to live with each of his parents on a rotating basis whereby he would spend fifteen consecutive days with one of them followed by fifteen days with the other.  Understandably, however, given R&#8217;s young age the father came to the view that this shared care arrangement did not best serve R&#8217;s interests and so he agreed instead that R should live with the mother and have regular contact with him.  The parties did not take steps to vary the court order in consequence of this new arrangement.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">In March 2015 the mother moved from Portugal to live in England.  There was a disagreement between the parents about whether R should also relocate to England.  It appears that the mother may have initiated some form of legal process, although in the event she did not pursue a relocation application and decided to move here alone.  According to the father, the mother&#8217;s motives for the move were that she had struggled to cope with caring for R while working and that she had financial difficulties.  I am not in a position to make any findings about this.</p>

As she puts it, &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">I always kept in touch with [R] with regular calls and constant visits to Portugal, my presence in my son&#8217;s life is constant</span>.&#8217;  She also describes remaining closely involved in his education to the extent that she would phone him every morning during the 2020 lockdown to ensure that he was awake and ready to attend online school and maintained the routine of calling him in the morning before school even after the period of lockdown came to an end.</p>

The father&#8217;s wife&#8217;s family come from the area to which the family decided to move.  The father remained in Lisbon initially, he says for approximately 2 months. According to the mother she was not informed about the proposed move by the father but learned of it from the girlfriend of another relative during R&#8217;s summer trip to England.  She says that the father had made clear that she should not be told about the impending move and that R objected to it.  The discovery led, on her case, to a disagreement between the parents followed by a fraught telephone call between the father and R during which the father reprimanded R for having revealed to the mother that he was soon to be moving.  Again, this is not something about which I can make any findings.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">In 2019 the father issued proceedings which led to an order being made &#8211; I understand, by consent &#8211; by the Judicial Court of the District of Vila Real on 26 September 2019.  This provided for R to live with the father and for parental responsibility to be shared.  The order also contained a provision for R to have unrestricted contact with the mother whenever she was in Portugal (subject to maintaining his school commitments and to giving the father 48 hours&#8217; notice).  The order further provided for R to spend 45 consecutive days each summer with the mother in England and for the Christmas and Easter holidays to be alternated.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Since the September 2019 order, the mother has had contact with R in both England and Portugal, although less often than may have been envisaged when the order was made.  I am told that the typical pattern was that R would have direct contact with his mother twice a year: once during either the Christmas or Easter holidays in Portugal (sometimes in Porto when the mother would stay with the paternal grandmother and sometimes in Lisbon when she would stay with her family), and a second time for a lengthy period over the summer the majority of which would be spent in England.  As I commented during the hearing, this arrangement does not seem to me to have been child-focussed as (1) it resulted in there being very long gaps up to six months in which R did not see his mother at all (apart from over a video screen), and (2) it allowed R to spend very little holiday time in the company of his father and his paternal family or socialising with his friends in Portugal.</p>

The father would, however, insist upon R&#8217;s return and before 2022 the mother would return him.  The father&#8217;s evidence is that R &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">is easily influenced by his mother</span>&#8217; and has sometimes said that he wants to stay with her after a holiday; upon returning to Portugal, however, he would get back into the routine of his life at home and at school.</p>

She says that that R was put in a position where he had to conceal important information from her, such as his father&#8217;s continued absence from the new home in the North of Portugal while he worked in Lisbon.  She says that the father &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">defames</span>&#8217; her, accusing her of abandoning her son and that he has failed to inform her about significant events in R&#8217;s life such as a serious car accident in which he was involved in 2020.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Towards the end of the summer, the mother contacted the father by telephone to inform him that R did not wish to return to Portugal.  The father has subsequently learned that before starting his holiday with the mother, R had said goodbye to his friends and told them that he would not be returning to school after his holiday in England.  In my view, it is likely that he would only have done so after discussing with his mother the potential for him to remain living in England.  The mother&#8217;s belief appears to be that as a matter of Portuguese law R was free to choose where he wished to live once he attained the age of 12, a belief which she communicated to R himself according to what he told Ms Callaghan.  Neither R nor the mother told the father before the start of the holiday that there was a plan afoot for him to remain in England.</p>

She initially attempted to do this unilaterally, but the father objected.  I understand that the question of R&#8217;s schooling was raised at the case management hearing in October 2022, but the father maintained his objections (Mr Edwards told me that it was expected that the proceedings would be concluded before the end of the year).  Accordingly, R has not been in any form of schooling since July 2022 and has thus missed an important period of his education.  This may not be due entirely to the father&#8217;s objections: R informed Ms Callaghan that he had taken some form of educational test which he had failed and that this was an impediment to him starting school.  It was not clear to me or to Ms Callaghan what this test might have been.</p>

The order records receipt of a letter from her solicitors in which they stated that she had been assessed as financially eligible for legal aid; however, a merits assessment was in the process of being undertaken.  Moor J&#8217;s order further records the imperative that the application should proceed at the February hearing as there was a risk that if R did not return to Portugal by the end of February he might have to redo his school year.  The LAA was urged to treat the mother&#8217;s application for legal aid as a matter of the highest priority in view of the impending hearing and the court&#8217;s direction that she should file her evidence by 2 February 2023.</p>

Therapy was also a potential option.  She acknowledged that as a young gay man, R might experience bullying in England or in Portugal.  It was important for R to be raised in a non-judgmental environment.  Ms Callaghan did not agree with the proposition that R feels that he lacks unconditional support and acceptance in his father&#8217;s household; rather he does not feel as comfortable talking about himself and his sexuality with his father as he does with his mother.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Overall, Ms Callaghan&#8217;s professional judgment is that R has effectively experienced an extended holiday period in England and that he holds an idealised version of living here.  He has not yet experienced a life in England in which he would have to start at a new school, with all the structure and rules this would entail.  In her oral evidence she described school as a big issue which has not been tried.  In response to questions from me, she said that if R were to remain in England it would be challenging for him to start in Year 8 in the middle of the school year.  Among the challenges he would face would be developing friendships at a point when friendship groups had already been formed.  Another challenge would be coping with the academic work (although he speaks good English, it is not his first language, and he has never been educated in the English curriculum).  Ms Callaghan said there was a risk that he could become frustrated if he feels left behind academically and this could affect his self-esteem.  That is not to say that he could not necessarily rise up to the challenges, but these would be significant.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">It is relatively common in Hague Convention proceedings for allegations to be made by one party and denied by the other.  As the proceedings are summary in nature and it is rare for the court to hear oral evidence, the court is usually not in a position to resolve such disputed allegations.  This can give rise to difficulties where a respondent&#8217;s assertion that Article 13(b) is satisfied is founded upon factual assertions which the court is unable to resolve.  In this connection, the Supreme Court said the following at paragraph 36 of <span style="font-style:italic">Re E</span>:</p>

Mr Turner submits that there is a sensible and pragmatic solution. Where allegations of domestic abuse are made, the court should first ask whether, if they are true, there would be a grave risk that the child would be exposed to physical or psychological harm or otherwise placed in an intolerable situation. If so, the court must then ask how the child can be protected against the risk. The appropriate protective measures and their efficacy will obviously vary from case to case and from country to country. This is where arrangements for international co-operation between liaison judges are so helpful. Without such protective measures, the court may have no option but to do the best it can to resolve the disputed issues.&#8221;</span></p>

She also put the allegations in context, bearing in mind what Mr Power had said about something good having happened in E's parenting, which she took as a demonstration that E would not be at risk if returned to Lithuania (&#167;36).&#160;The Article 13b argument had therefore not got off the ground in the judge's view. The judgment about the level of risk was a judgment which fell to be made by Hogg J and we should not overturn her judgment on it unless it was not open to her (see the important observations of the Supreme Court on this subject at &#167;35 of Re S, supra). Nothing has been said in argument to demonstrate that the view Hogg J took was not open to her; in the light of it, it was unnecessary for her to look further at the question of protective measures. She would have taken the same view even if the child had been going back to the father's care, but the Article 13b case was weakened further by the fact that the mother had ultimately agreed to return with E.&#8221;</span></p>

So, one can envisage a situation, for example, where it is apparent that the child is merely parroting the views of a parent and does not personally object at all; in such a case, a relevant objection will not be established. Sometimes, for instance because of age or stage of development, the child will have nowhere near the sort of understanding that would be looked for before reaching a conclusion that the child has a degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of his or her views. Sometimes, the objection may not be an objection to the right thing. Sometimes, it may not be an objection at all, but rather a wish or a preference.&#8221;</span></p>

The exception itself is brought into play when only two conditions are met: first, that the child herself objects to being returned and second, that she has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of her views. These days, and especially in the light of article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child , courts increasingly consider it appropriate to take account of a child's views. Taking account does not mean that those views are always determinative or even presumptively so. Once the discretion comes into play, the court may have to consider the nature and strength of the child's objections, the extent to which they are "authentically her own" or the product of the influence of the abducting parent, the extent to which they coincide or are at odds with other considerations which are relevant to her welfare, as well as the general Convention considerations referred to earlier. The older the child, the greater the weight that her objections are likely to carry. But that is far from saying that the child's objections should only prevail in the most exceptional circumstances.&#8221;</span></p>

It is also significant, in my view, that by contrast with the position here, R has friends in Portugal, and they have supported him in dealing with the bullying.  Unfortunately, bullying is an issue which children have to confront from time to time.  If R were to start school in England, it is possible that he might experience bullying there too.</p>

In some cases, a court may conclude that if an order is made, the taking parent will not maintain their stance of refusing to accompany the child.

If he started school now, he would be moving into an environment where the friendship groups have already been established.  There is a risk that he would be isolated at school and if he experienced bullying, as he did in Portugal, he would not have the support of friends to fall back on.</p>

His school place in Portugal remains open to him and he will be able to reintegrate into that school and its curriculum far more easily than starting afresh here.</p>

It is important that he has friends who will support him.  I do not accept the mother&#8217;s submission that the father will simply ignore the issue.  It is also open to the mother to raise the matter herself with the school.</p>

The exchange of text messages referred to above not only demonstrates the contrary, but also suggests that the father accepts his son for who he is.  There is no credible evidence to suggest that the father holds an antipathy towards homosexuality; this does not follow from the fact that he may have expressed views which suggest lack of acceptance of people who are transgender (even if this is true). In any event, although the mother will not be present in Portugal, she will continue to support R through their telephone and video contact which takes place every day and through what I hope will be more frequent visits to Portugal on her part.  </p>

He has a close relationship with his brother and, despite feeling cross with him, also with his father (both of whom he says he misses).</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in;text-indent:0.12in">In my view, any decision that R should relocate to England should only be made following a full welfare investigation.  The Portuguese courts are better placed to undertake such an investigation.  Apart from the fact that Portugal currently has exclusive jurisdiction under the 1996 Hague Convention (itself a factor of some significance) the evidence about R&#8217;s existing life is primarily in Portugal.  Any welfare assessment would need to weigh the advantages of a move to England &#8211; in particular R&#8217;s wish to live with his mother &#8211; against the potential detriment to his educational prospects and his relationships in Portugal.  If a move is to take place, it should be done in a planned way with particular consideration being given to R&#8217;s educational future.  He is talented and ambitious and both parents should be working in concert to help him fulfil his ambitions.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">I strongly suspect that a significant element of R&#8217;s objections is a sense of dread at having to face the consequences of his decision last summer to remain in England.  He is anxious about how his father may react and worried about having to explain what happened to his friends.  Unless R is to cut himself off forever from his life in Portugal (which would be wholly contrary to his interests), these are anxieties he will have to confront at some stage in any event.  In my view, the sooner he does so the better from his perspective.  Otherwise, they have the capacity to escalate as an issue in his own mind.  Many people &#8211; adults and children alike &#8211; have experienced the sort of dread that R may now be feeling after taking a decision which was unwise.  Confronting his decision by returning to Portugal, in my view, is likely to bring about a sense of relief for R as he once again experiences the love and affection of his father and paternal family and comes to realise that the anxieties he may have built up were overblown.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Another matter which I consider to have played a significant part in the views R has formed is the lack of direct contact he has been able to have with his mother.  I do not consider the current arrangements whereby he only sees his mother twice a year, including an extended block comprising 45 days over the summer, to be in his interests.  In my view, although it is not my task to make long term welfare decisions, it is clear that R needs to see his mother more frequently than has been the case hitherto.  I also think it would benefit him if he were able to spend some of his summer holidays in Portugal enjoying some relaxed time with his paternal family and interacting with his peers.  At present, his experiences of his father are predominantly of a parent who has to maintain the school routine (although he does also spend significant holiday time with his father including approximately 45 days over the summer) whereas he spends time with his mother in a relaxed holiday environment.  Cost is an issue, but at R&#8217;s age he should be able to fly unaccompanied.  In my view, R should be spending time with his mother at least every holiday and also for any extended weekends that take place in the middle of term.  It should additionally be possible for the mother to fly to Portugal to spend time with him during term time, perhaps for a weekend in Porto.  I hope that this is a matter which the parties can discuss and agree.  If not, I will hear submissions as to whether I should make a temporary order on the basis of my jurisdiction under Article 11 of the 1996 Hague Convention.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Article 11 confers upon the court a limited jurisdiction and any orders I make will only have effect until such time as the Portuguese Court is in a position to deal with any application which either parent may make.  I do, however, consider that R&#8217;s circumstances are sufficiently urgent to justify the use of the jurisdiction in this case. It will benefit R and make the return easier to manage if he and his parents have a clear understanding as to the arrangements going forward and he knows that he will be seeing his mother more frequently than has hitherto been the case.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The order should also record the undertakings offered by the father.  Both parties, in my view, should give an undertaking not to denigrate R to the other and to allow him to have unrestricted indirect contact with the other parent during the times he is with them.  I do not consider it appropriate to require the father to undertake not to criticise R for his sexuality; there is no credible evidence that he has done so.</p>

My view is that it should take place soon, within a matter of days, to enable R to resume his schooling.  Assuming she remains willing to travel back, R should be accompanied to Portugal by his mother.  The father should fund the cost of her flight (which will be cost neutral for him as he was proposing to fly here himself).</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">I conclude by repeating that I found R to be an impressive young person.  I know that he will be disappointed by my decision, but I hope he will understand and accept it.  The mother has a role to pay in this: R should be told that I have listened carefully to what everybody had to say and decided that this is the best solution for him.  I hope she will encourage and support him in returning to Portugal. The parents should feel proud of the son they have brought up.  He has a bright future ahead of him.  It is important that his parents should put aside any animosity they hold towards each other and focus on trying to work together collaboratively in order to support him throughout the remainder of his childhood and ultimately to help him achieve his ambitions.</p>
