They conceived a child in 2013 but subsequently the mother underwent a termination. It is the parents&#8217; case that the extended family on both sides were very upset that the parents had conceived a child when they were both so young and unprepared to look after a baby. Notwithstanding what had happened, the parents conceived a second child later in 2013. During this second pregnancy, difficulties emerged in their relationship and there were extensive discussions as to whether or not the mother would keep the baby after the birth. </p>

As a result, the extended paternal family had no knowledge of L&#8217;s existence during the currency of the care proceedings. The father was pressed by professionals, including the allocated social worker and his own solicitor, to explain why he did not want his family to be involved. During the course of these discussions, he alleged that he had suffered physical abuse at the hands of his own father, L&#8217;s paternal grandfather. His case before this court is that this allegation was completely untrue and was said with a view to &#8220;getting people off his back&#8221;. </p>

The father had disengaged from contact some months earlier and L had her final contact with her mother in September 2014. Later that month, she was placed with prospective adopters, hereafter referred to as &#8220;Mr and Mrs A&#8221;, with whom she remains living to this day. </p>

On the following day, members of the father&#8217;s family had an initial meeting with L&#8217;s social worker, AD, at which they were informed about developments and that the local authority planned to support the proposed adoption. On 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2015, the father applied for leave to oppose the adoption order. He further applied for a direction for an assessment by an independent social worker to establish the suitability of members of his paternal family to care for L. Statements in support of his application were provided by the father himself, the paternal grandfather, paternal uncle and aunt. After a case management hearing, the case was transferred to be listed before a High Court judge. </p>

The President made further directions within the proceedings, including listing the matter before a judge of the Division for a final hearing of the application for permission to oppose the adoption and of the adoption application itself on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> June 2015 with a time estimate of 3 days. </p>

Given modern expectation of life, this means that, with a young child, one is looking far ahead into a very distant future &#8211; upwards of eighty or even ninety years. Against this perspective, judges must be careful not to attach undue weight to the short term consequences for the child if leave to oppose is given.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">(ix)Almost invariably the judge will be pressed with the argument that leave to oppose should be refused, amongst other reasons, because of the adverse impact on the prospective adopters, and thus on the child, of their having to pursue a contested adoption application. We do not seek to trivialise an argument which may in some cases have considerable force, particularly perhaps in a case where the child is old enough to have some awareness of what is going on. But judges must be careful not to attach undue weight to the argument. After all, what from the perspective of the proposed adopters was the smoothness of the process which they no doubt anticipated when issuing their application with the assurance of a placement order, will already have been disturbed by the unwelcome making of the application for leave to oppose. And the disruptive effects of an order giving a parent leave to oppose can be minimised by firm judicial case management <span style="font-style:italic">before </span>the hearing of the application for leave. If appropriate directions are given, in particular in relation to the expert and other evidence to be adduced on behalf of the parent, <span style="font-style:italic">as soon as </span>the application for leave is issued and <span style="font-style:italic">before </span>the question of leave has been determined, it ought to be possible to direct either that the application for leave is to be listed with the substantive adoption application to follow immediately, whether or not leave is given, or, if that is not feasible, to direct that the substantive application is to be listed, whether or not leave has been given, very shortly after the leave hearing.</p>

On behalf of the father, Miss Daisy Hughes submits that the revelation that L had an extended paternal family that is able and willing to care for her throughout her minority is a relevant and sufficient change of circumstances so as to &#8220;open the door&#8221; to the granting of leave to oppose the making of an adoption order. On behalf of the guardian, Miss Pamela Warner points out that not only the allocated social worker but also the guardian agree that, had the parties known the details of the extended family and been able to undertake the assessments now available, it is highly likely that L would have been placed with the grandfather at the conclusion of the care proceedings. </p>

She relies on the assessment of the independent social worker, supported by the analysis of the local authority and the guardian, as to the paternal grandfather&#8217;s ability to meet L&#8217;s needs, with the support of other members of the extended family. Miss Hughes points out that, given L&#8217;s young age, although she has been placed with Mr and Mrs A for over 8 months, she is still young enough to move without retaining in the short or medium term any conscious memory of her time in the care of the prospective adopters. Furthermore, Miss Hughes submits that the good care that L has received from Mr and Mrs A makes it more likely that she will be able to attach securely to her grandfather if placed with him. In those circumstances, Miss Hughes submits that the father has solid grounds for seeking leave to oppose the adoption application. </p>

Instead, both of them are proposing that she be placed with the paternal grandfather under a special guardianship order and, as a result, both of them are agreeing to limit the exercise of their parental responsibility and furthermore accept that their contact to L should be limited. Miss Hyde points out that the paternal grandfather cannot apply himself under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/47/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.47(5)</ref> because he is not a parent or guardian.

She contends that, if the court now allows an application which may thwart a successful adoption application, there will be grave and wide-ranging policy consequences. First, Miss Hyde submits that it will lead to a reduction in the pool of prospective adopters who will be discouraged from coming forward if there is perceived to be an increased risk of a late challenge to the adoption after the child has been placed. Secondly, she submits that the advice to future prospective adopters would inevitably be to refrain from making the adoption application until the child has been placed with them for a number of years so as to reduce the risk that the application will be opposed. This would be contrary to public policy because it would extend the period of uncertainty for the child. Thirdly, she contends that it will be extremely difficult for any court to control the timetable for assessment of family members in care proceedings, and thus the policy of identifying such placements as quickly as possible, which is an important feature of the Public Law Outline, (now in Practice Direction 12A of the Family Procedure Rules), will be undermined. </p>

In this context, Miss Hyde relies on the fact that L has thrived in the prospective adopters&#8217; care and will continue to do so should she remain placed with them. Furthermore, she has established a close relationship with Mr and Mrs A&#8217;s older child. In contrast, Miss Hyde points out that the paternal grandfather has not had the sole care of a young baby and is untried and untested in that respect. She submits that he is likely to find it very difficult given that L will be suffering harm as the result of the breaking of her attachment to the prospective adopters. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> I do not accept Miss Hyde&#8217;s submission that I should consider the application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/47/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.47(5)</ref> as an application under s.29(5)(b). The application made by the father, supported by the mother, is not a device to get round a statutory or regulatory hurdle but, rather, the obvious application to make in all the circumstances. It is a legal and appropriate application, and in my judgment it would be quite wrong to disregard it on the basis that there is another application that was open to the birth family. On the contrary, were the court to adopt the approach suggested by Miss Hyde, it seems to me that it could be said to be resorting to a device to get round the approach stipulated in statute as explained by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re P</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B-S</span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">,</span> namely one that requires proof of a change of circumstances and, if such a change is established, a holistic evaluative analysis in which welfare is the paramount consideration. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I therefore turn to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/47/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.47(5)</ref> application. I am satisfied that there has been a change of circumstances of a nature and degree to &#8216;open the door&#8217; to the evaluative exercise. As other courts have stressed, there is nothing in the statute to limit the change of circumstances to a change in the parents&#8217; circumstances. The developments that have occurred in this case are of very great significance. They are akin to the change that occurred in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re C (Adoption Proceedings: Change of Circumstances)</span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"/> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/431" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 431" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 431</ref>. In that case, the mother and father of a child had a brief affair while the mother was in a relationship with another man. The father, although aware of the child&#8217;s birth, was unaware that he was the biological father until after the child had been placed with prospective adopters following the making of a placement order. When a DNA test confirmed that he was indeed the father, he filed an application for permission to oppose the adoption order. The court at first instance, and the Court of Appeal, (although ultimately refusing leave having carried out the evaluative exercise), accepted that the subsequent discovery of the identity of the father following DNA testing was a sufficient change of circumstance to &#8216;open the door&#8217;. In the present case, the discovery that the father&#8217;s relations, far from being the dysfunctional family as portrayed by the father during the currency of the care proceedings, are in fact able and willing to offer L a home, is manifestly a change of circumstances of a degree sufficient to satisfy <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/47/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.47(7)</ref>. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Turning to the evaluative exercise, I accept Miss Hughes&#8217;s analysis. I accept her argument that the prospects of an adoption order being refused are good. I bear in mind the President&#8217;s observation in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B-S</span> that, in considering the prospects of success in such circumstances, the court is looking at the prospect of resisting the making of an adoption order as opposed to the prospect of the child being moved to the care of the birth family. In the context of this case, however, this may be a distinction without a difference because it is unlikely in this case that the court would refuse an adoption order unless it concluded that the child should be placed back in the birth family. Although L has been with the prospective adopters for over 8 months and is likely to suffer a degree of emotional distress and harm if removed from their care, she is probably still young enough to be moved successfully with care and support.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although at the leave stage I am not able to say with certainty whether the adoption application would be successfully opposed if leave were granted, the father and his family plainly have strong arguments, given the very positive assessment carried out by the independent social worker and the endorsement of analysis of the local authority and guardian. I note the view of the social worker and guardian that, if the position as described in the independent social worker&#8217;s report had been before the court at the time of the care proceedings, it is likely that this child would be placed with the grandfather at that stage. Amongst the matters in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1(4)</ref> to which the court must have regard is the ability and willingness of any of the child&#8217;s relatives to provide the child with a secure environment in which the child can develop, and otherwise to meet the child&#8217;s needs: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1(4)</ref>(f)(ii). I agree with Miss Hughes that L&#8217;s welfare, in the sense identified in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1(4)</ref>, requires that the options of a family placement be thoroughly explored before a final decision is taken as to her long term future. </p>

There would be a risk that contested adoption proceedings may cause an element of distress and upheaval for the adoptive family which would impinge on the child&#8217;s welfare. Thanks to the President&#8217;s case management directions, the contested hearing will take place immediately after the leave application has been resolved, so the risk of distress and upheaval arising from drawn-out proceedings does not arise. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the context of the evaluative exercise, I have considered the policy considerations that lie at the heart of Miss Hyde&#8217;s submissions. It is of course important that prospective adopters are not discouraged from coming forward. It is equally important that adoption applications are brought to a conclusion speedily so that the child can settle in the new family. It is also important that all possible family placements are identified as quickly as possible. On the other hand, as the President observed in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B-S,</span> I must keep at the forefront of my mind what might be described as the fundamental policy consideration identified in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B (Care Proceedings: Appeal)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2013/33" uk:canonical="[2013] UKSC 33" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] UKSC 33</ref>, that adoption is the &#8216;last resort' and only permissible if &#8216;nothing else will do' and that, as Lord Neuberger emphasised, the child's interests include being brought up by the parents or wider family unless the overriding requirements of the child's welfare make that not possible.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The crucial point, however, is that the purpose of all these policies is to serve the overall welfare of children. Where the law requires the court to give paramount consideration to the welfare of the individual child, and her welfare clearly points to one particular outcome, it would be manifestly wrong to allow her welfare to be overridden by any policy considerations. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Furthermore, anyone reading this judgment will realise that the circumstances of this case (the father&#8217;s deceptive and misleading conduct, and the subsequent discovery that the birth family is, on the written evidence, manifestly able to care for the child) are very unusual. I hope, therefore, that prospective adopters will not be discouraged from coming forward as a result of this case. Adoption has a crucial role to play in our society and it is very important that people should not be discouraged from putting themselves forward as adopters. Those who do must, however, be advised that, where placement orders have been made, the law allows parents to be granted leave to oppose an adoption application where there has been a change of circumstances and the court concludes that the child&#8217;s welfare, which is the paramount consideration, requires that leave be granted. Applications for leave will only be made in a minority of cases and in most cases are unlikely to succeed, but Parliament has allowed the right to apply for leave to oppose adoption applications in such circumstances and all prospective adopters should be advised that this is the law. </p>

After careful negotiations, arrangements were made for L to move quickly to live with her paternal grandfather. This has only been possible by the extraordinary efforts of all concerned, in particular Mr. and Mrs. A and the paternal grandfather.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I therefore conclude by adding these final brief observations. First, it is obvious to everyone in these proceedings, and it will be obvious to everyone reading this judgment, that these events have been brought about by the father&#8217;s conduct. He is a young man, and he has not had the opportunity to explain his conduct in oral evidence before me. On any view, however, it must be acknowledged that as a result of his actions, a number of people have suffered very greatly. Mr and Mrs A, and their older child, have had to endure the terrible ordeal of losing the little girl to whom they had made the extraordinary commitment that all prospective adopters make. Furthermore, his daughter, L, has to cope with the distress and upheaval of moving from the home where she is settled and thriving to live with people she does not know. All this has come about because of the father&#8217;s misleading and deceptive behaviour. I hope he will now do whatever he can to ensure that L&#8217;s life with his family is as secure as possible.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, although I have no specific criticism of this local authority&#8217;s work, (which I have not had an opportunity to examine in detail), this case illustrates the crucial importance of identifying at an early stage in public law proceedings any potential family members with whom a child can be placed. Local authorities must strive to identify the best possible methods of identifying such placements, and must not easily be distracted by comments made by natural parents which may conceal the truth. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My final observations are addressed to Mr and Mrs A. I can hardly begin to appreciate the anguish that you, and your older child, must now be feeling at losing the little girl whom you accepted into your care and looked after in an exemplary fashion. Although the birth family undoubtedly had a strong argument for opposing adoption, I do not know for certain what order I would have made at the conclusion of a contested hearing. You have made the courageous decision not to proceed with your application and to allow L to return to her birth family as soon as possible. I had not been told in detail the reasons for your decision but, from what I have read, I am confident that you would not have taken this step unless you believed it to be in L&#8217;s best interests. In those circumstances, I have nothing but admiration for your actions. I know that there will be some contact between L and you and your other child, although the details are yet to be agreed. I am sure that, as she grows older, L will come to understand and appreciate the wonderful things that you have done for her, both in looking after her for the past eight months, and in making this great sacrifice that has enabled her to be returned to her birth family. </p>
