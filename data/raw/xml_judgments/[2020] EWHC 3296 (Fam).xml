The adoption application, however, was made and then issued by the court in August 2020 before she had attained her majority. </p>

Ms MacLynn provided me with an extremely helpful and comprehensive skeleton argument. Her instructing solicitors prepared and provided me with a helpful bundle of documents.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The applicant is a British citizen of St Lucian origin and has lived in England for her entire life.  She works as an ambulance care assistant.  She has four children of her own, all older than A.  In 2002, the applicant&#8217;s grandmother died in St Lucia and she went there to assist with the family arrangements and to attend the funeral.  While she was there, the applicant met with her cousin, Mr Y.  Mr Y and his partner had very recently had a baby, A, for whom they did not feel able to care.  They asked the applicant if she would take care of A and give her a better life in the United Kingdom.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The applicant agreed to take A back to England with her and care for her alongside her own children.  Mr Y and his partner signed a deed in the presence of a St Lucian lawyer on 17 October 2002, stating that they were &#8220;relinquishing parental and legal custody of A&#8221; to the applicant, as well as giving her permission to take A to the United Kingdom &#8220;or any other territory she thinks appropriate reasonable and safe&#8221;.  The deed also stated that the birth-parents gave the applicant permission to take all reasonable decisions regarding A&#8217;s education while she lives in the United Kingdom, health, religious upbringing, immigration and &#8220;any other matters touching the life of our child&#8221;.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The deed signed by A&#8217;s parents might be described in this jurisdiction as a document delegating parental responsibility, with reference to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/2/9" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2(9)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.   A&#8217;s birth-parents refer to A throughout as &#8220;our child&#8221; and there is no reference to adoption in that document.  There was no discussion of adoption at that time nor any proceedings to that effect in St Lucia. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The applicant returned to England shortly thereafter in October 2002, bringing A with her.  The basis upon which A entered the country is not clear at this stage, and the Home Office has been requested to confirm A&#8217;s immigration status.  A has remained in the care of the applicant ever since.  She has never returned to St Lucia.  A regards the applicant as her mother and the applicant&#8217;s older children as her siblings.  She is regarded as a much-loved daughter and little sister in return.  The applicant has ensured that A has attended school and has met all of her emotional, physical and other needs.  A is currently attending college and turned eighteen in September 2020. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">A&#8217;s birth-parents initially had some contact with her by telephone however this ceased when A was about five years old.  When the applicant has returned to St Lucia, she would take photographs of A for the parents.  A&#8217;s birth-father visited England to see A in 2007 and 2010, latterly intimating that he wanted to take A back to St Lucia.  The applicant subsequently sought and obtained a residence order.  A&#8217;s father did not engage in the court proceedings and has not been in touch with A since. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">As A reached her teenage years, the applicant began to think about formalising her relationship with A, particularly in light of the fact that her birth-parents had not taken any part in her life.  Having made some inquiries but without the benefit of legal advice, the applicant gave the local authority in which she and A lived, a London Borough, notice that she intended to apply to adopt A.  That notice was provided by way of a letter dated 1 June 2018 and it triggered inquiries into the applicant&#8217;s suitability to adopt A by a social worker, Ms B. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Ms B made a number of enquiries including meeting the applicant and A and speaking to a number of referees.  As a result of those enquiries, she fully supported the making of an adoption order.  Ms B did not complete an Annex A report as her practice was not to do so until the adoption application has been made.  The applicant did not in fact make the application for some time in large part due to having to deal with the death of her own father and that of another family member.  It was not until 24 February 2020, with the encouragement and support of Ms B, that she signed her application and sent it to the court.   </p>

Over time it has however become clear that they either did not intend or did not feel able to have any involvement with A at all, leading the applicant to make this application.

What is the consequence if it is not done? In the case of statutes that are said to be imperative, the Courts have decided that if it is not done the whole thing fails, and the proceedings that follow upon it are all void. On the other hand, when the Courts hold a provision to be mandatory or directory, they say that, although such provision may not have been complied with, the subsequent proceedings do not fail. Still, whatever the language, the idea is a perfectly distinct one. There may be many provisions in Acts of Parliament which, although they are not strictly obeyed, yet do not appear to the Court to be of that material importance to the subject-matter to which they refer, as that the legislature could have intended that the non-observance of them should be followed by a total failure of the whole proceedings. On the other hand, there are some provisions in respect of which the Court would take an opposite view, and would feel that they are matters which must be strictly obeyed, otherwise the whole proceedings that subsequently follow must come to an end. Now the question is, to which category does the provision in question in this case belong? &#8230; I believe, as far as any rule is concerned, you cannot safely go further than that in each case you must look to the subject-matter; consider the importance of the provision that has been disregarded, and the relation of that provision to the general object intended to be secured by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>; and upon a review of the case in that aspect decide whether the matter is what is called imperative or only directory." </p>

It is central to his being, whether as an individual or as a member of his family. As Ms Isaacs correctly puts it, this case is fundamentally about Xs identity and his relationship with the commissioning parents. Fundamental as these matters must be to commissioning parents they are, if anything, even more fundamental to the child. A parental order has, to adopt Theis J's powerful expression, a transformative effect, not just in its effect on the child's legal relationships with the surrogate and commissioning parents but also, to adopt the guardian's words in the present case, in relation to the practical and psychological realities of X's identity. A parental order, like an adoption order, has an effect extending far beyond the merely legal. It has the most profound personal, emotional, psychological, social and, it may be in some cases, cultural and religious, consequences. It creates what Thorpe LJ in Re J (Adoption: Non-Patrial) [1998] INLR 424, 429, referred to as "the psychological relationship of parent and child with all its far-reaching manifestations and consequences." Moreover, these consequences are lifelong and, for all practical purposes, irreversible: see G v G (Parental Order: Revocation) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2012/1979" uk:canonical="[2012] EWHC 1979 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWHC 1979 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2013] 1 FLR 286" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] 1 FLR 286</ref>, to which I have already referred. And the court considering an application for a parental order is required to treat the child's welfare throughout his life as paramount: see in In re L (A Child) (Parental Order: Foreign Surrogacy) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2010/3146" uk:canonical="[2010] EWHC 3146 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWHC 3146 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] Fam 106" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] Fam 106</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] 1 FLR 1143" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] 1 FLR 1143</ref>.

Thus family life is not confined to married couples. A de facto relationship outside marriage can give rise to family life (Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v United Kingdom at para [63]), even if the parties do not live together (Kroon v The Netherlands <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1994) 19 EHRR 263" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1994">(1994) 19 EHRR 263</ref> at para [30]), and even if the couple consists of a woman and a female-to-male transsexual (X, Y and Z v United Kingdom <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1997) 24 EHRR 143" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">(1997) 24 EHRR 143</ref> at para [37]).

A formal adoption creates family life between the adoptive parents and the child: X v Belgium and the Netherlands (1975) 7 D&amp;R 75, X v France (1982) 31 D&amp;R 241, Pini v Roumania (unreported &#8211; 22 June 2004).
