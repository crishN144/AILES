Almost invariably in such situations, the abducting parent is, at best, reluctant to return to the other country.  People do not abduct their children on a whim, and only do so for what seem to them to be good reasons.  So it is hardly surprising if there is reluctance to return.  </span></p>

That is why I say that this is a very unusual case.  </span></p>

She travelled to Poland with the full consent of the father in June 2014 but did not return with the child to Spain.   Rather, she moved to Manchester and established a home there where the child and the mother&#8217;s own mother joined her in September 2014.  As a matter of fact, the father and daughter have not seen each other physically since June 2014.  </span></p>

There could have been a moot legal debate in this case as to the date upon which the mother wrongfully retained the child, and a debate as to whether the father&#8217;s application was issued more or less than 12 months after that retention, so as to trigger the &#8220;settlement&#8221; defence under Article 12 of the Convention.  Sensibly, that issue of mixed fact and law has not been pursued, and the only defences that were raised are those under Article 13(a) and (b) of the Convention, namely, that the child objected to return to Spain; and/or that the return of the child to Spain forthwith would expose the child to a grave risk of physical or psychological harm, or otherwise place her in an intolerable situation.</span></p>

The Family Court advisor&#8217;s report is available for any court or person with a proper interest in this matter to read and see.  The advisor clearly had reservations as to whether the stated position of the child amounted to &#8220;objections in Convention terms&#8221;, but did express concern about the presentation of the child as being a child who may have suffered trauma and who could be re-traumatised and damaged by a return to Spain.  Meanwhile, the child had also been seen by a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist called Dr Jasti.  There was some somewhat inconclusive material from Dr Jasti.  </span></p>

Again, any future court or person with a proper interest in this matter can read that report.  It does indicate a degree of psychological or emotional risk to the child if she was required to return to Spain.  There would no doubt be scope for considerable argument, as indeed is foreshadowed in the excellent written arguments of both counsel for this hearing, as to whether, so far as the psychological state of the child herself is concerned, those risks amount to a grave risk of psychological harm within the meaning of Article 13(b) of the Convention.  </span></p>

The father is personally present, having travelled from Spain for the purpose, together with his own Spanish lawyer, Abogado Marta de la Mata, whom it is a great privilege to have present in court today.  </span></p>

Realistically, that would have been a return with her mother, with whom she has always lived, and with whom, rather than her father, she has been living for the last 16 months or so.  I perfectly understand that today must have been a very difficult day indeed for the father.   But he, just as I would have had to have done, has had to face up to the situation that now presents itself.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">It is very much to the credit of the father that he has made the very difficult decision today now to abandon and withdraw his application for the return of his child to Spain.   But he has available to him the medical evidence to which I have referred; he has had legal advice of very great expertise from his counsel, Miss Jacqueline Renton; and he has voluntarily made a decision in the best interests of both the mother, who was his partner, and also of his child, to accept that the prospect of return to Spain is simply too big a hurdle for this particular mother.  The result is that I have not had to adjudicate upon anything of substance today.  Very responsibly and caringly indeed, the father withdraws his application.  The child will remain living with her mother here in England.</span></p>

The father seeks that that order and provision continue.  Accordingly, I have given permission today for the father to issue, as has now been done, a fresh, freestanding application for a child arrangements order under the provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.    Within those new proceedings I will make an order that essentially repeats the existing order within the now withdrawn proceedings under the Hague Convention. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">There has been some adjustment as to the actual precise time and days of the week for the Skype contact.  That has been done without any communication with, or instructions from, the mother since she is incapacitated in hospital.   But Miss Cabeza has been able to speak to the mother&#8217;s partner, who was present in court and whom I recall from the hearing in September, and who has indeed generally played a supportive role in this case.  There do not seem to be any practical difficulties with regard to the substituted precise time and days of the week, and accordingly I will make an order under the Children Act for Skype contact on the days and at the times that the father now requests.  As the mother has not had any input, she must, of course, have permission to apply to vary those times, or days, but I sincerely hope that it will not be necessary for her to do so.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The last year has clearly been a period of intense stress for this family.  The father must have felt great despair when his child did not return to Spain in September 2014, as had been agreed.  He was fully entitled to make, and perfectly justified in making, his application under the Hague Convention, in which the mother has admitted from the outset that there was a wrongful retention, or abduction, of the child by her.  But clearly, also, the prospect of return to Spain has raised, in this particular mother, a degree of anxiety and, as Dr Harrison said, terror in the mother which goes way beyond normal reactions in a case such as this, and I am very glad indeed that the father has made the decision that he has made today.  </span></p>
