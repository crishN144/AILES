There were repeated attempts to try and engage and work with the parents before Z was born, with limited success.  A pre-birth assessment determined that it was not safe for Z to remain with her parents.

However, it is important that professionals are mindful of his history of trauma and consequent hyper-vigilance, and that if under significant stress he is likely to fall into low mood, with the risk that he will begin misusing substances again, feel suicidal and lose his appetite. Because of his difficulty sleeping, The father may miss appointments or require breaks in assessments/Hearings due to fatigue. Due to his post-traumatic symptoms, he would benefit from working with consistent professionals and from assistance to feel safe by, for example, seeing rooms (including Court rooms) in advance with his legal representatives.&#8221;</span></p>

During the course of that assessment, Professor Wilcox took a detailed history from both parents, including asking the father some very difficult questions about his past.

The father has accepted that he remained in touch with this man by way of regular telephone calls from prison. The local authority was rightly concerned when it found out about this contact, and I have seen the telephone records from the prison which evidence the extent to which the two men were in touch. The father told Professor Wilcox that BB</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;color:#FF0000"> </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">had threatened to hurt himself if the father cut him off.

Relatedly, his unusual behaviours and thought patterns may make it difficult for others to relate to him.  In addition, social withdrawal is noted and a likelihood of a loss of interest in daily activities, with low energy reported.  The father&#8217;s test results suggested a lack of empathy, coupled with above average needs for attention, affection, love and intimacy.  Trying to meet these needs will be difficult for the father, as, in my judgement, he presents with a level of distrust and social withdrawal that will prove to be a frustrating barrier for him in terms of meeting these</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">personal requirements.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">&#8221;</span></p>

I consider that these features are associated with dysthymia (minor, chronic depression), wherein the mother adopts a victim posture, a &#8216;poor me&#8217; persona in reflecting on her life and experiences.  Significant anxiety elevations were also noted, with the mother reporting being so nervous that she has trouble dealing with everyday stress, pressures and demands, such that she easily feels panicky and threatened by people or events. Indeed, the mother&#8217;s coping abilities are so challenged that she is likely to over-evaluate objective danger and feel threatened by situations that would likely be of little or no concern to the average individual.  These ongoing heightened levels of anxiety will lead the mother to be an over-ruminative worrier, where an over-arousal is likely to occur regularly, producing fatigue, confusion, and a tendency, at times, to act without thinking, in ways that may ultimately be self-defeating.</span></p>

This may lead to difficulties for others in terms of understanding and relating to her.  The mother is extremely introverted and tends to be much more comfortable alone.  An attachment deficit probably exists, as the mother actively avoids and withdraws from others.  This is associated with significant levels of social discomfort and anxiety, such that she questions her ability to effectively deal with and relate to others.&#8221;</span></p>

The mother would also benefit from CBT over about the same period of time with a view to enhancing her confidence, self-esteem, assertiveness abilities and coping skills. However, there is a risk that, as the mother becomes more assertive, this may, in turn, lead to conflicts developing within the parental relationship, as it would disrupt the current dominant/submissive dynamic which exists.

While suggesting a need for a considerable amount of oversight and supervision to support their efforts to provide basic care for Z, I am not confident that they would be able to protect Z from potential harm from others whom they might not view as risky, within timescales that will meet Z&#8217;s needs.  Further, this is, in my opinion, a relationship dynamic that is dominated by the father, passively accepted by the mother, and one in which meeting father&#8217;s own needs will take precedence over those of Z, exposing her to potential risk of neglect, emotional and physical harm, or inadequate safeguarding. </span></p>

It follows too that children will inevitably have both very different experiences of parenting and very unequal consequences flowing from it. It means that some children will experience disadvantage and harm, whilst others flourish in atmospheres of loving security and emotional stability. These are the consequences of our fallible humanity, and it is not the provenance of the State to spare children all the consequences of defective parenting.

In fact, Professor Wilcox had determined that, whilst the mother did have some autistic traits, but they were not sufficient for him to be able to make a diagnosis, albeit he accepted that a more detailed assessment maybe needed. Professor Wilcox also told me that the father&#8217;s presentation was incredibly complex as a result of his trauma experience, and so to conclude that ADHD was likely to be the significant presenting problem was wrong. Having read the written evidence from the father&#8217;s personal advisor (for the past three years), the father&#8217;s Probation Officer, and the father&#8217;s Police Offender Manager, I simply do not accept that the work that has been attempted with the couple has had no value. It is apparent from all their evidence that they have been acutely aware of the parents&#8217; difficulties and have worked hard to engage in a meaningful way, commensurate with their abilities. </span></p>

I am afraid that the first, and perhaps most significant, was my assessment that she had lost sight of the need to be an independent and fair witness before the court. Her overall presentation was incredibly defensive. As I alluded to above, it was apparent that Ms Williams brought to her role and to her evidence a number of personal experiences and beliefs, which, in my assessment, led her to error and affected her ability to remain dispassionate and balanced. She told me on several occasions about her work with Dr Bessel van der Kolk (a Dutch author and researcher), and her views on the impact of trauma upon parents and children, including herself, as she told me that she was a survivor of trauma in her own life. She was anxious to tell me her own views about the impact of trauma upon parents, which was informed by her interest in this subject. But with the greatest respect to the work of Dr van der Kolk, and the increasing understanding of trauma-based responses, this was not what Ms Williams was asked to do. I am absolutely clear that she has allowed her own experiences and interests and her sympathy for what these parents have been through to cloud her judgment. </span></p>

It was apparent that she had a great interest in psychology, but she is not trained in that field, although that did not appear to prevent her from forming her own views and ignoring the recommendation of the court appointed psychologist, who has over twenty-five years&#8217; experience of preparing court reports. Ms Williams is not qualified to diagnose neurodiversity (however much she may know as a result of her experiences). For reasons I cannot understand, she seemed reluctant to accept the recommendations which Professor Wilcox had made for each of the parents, preferring her own view of what kind of therapy might be the most effective. She had neither the qualifications nor experience to do so. She provided her own &#8216;timelines&#8217; for when the parents might be able to engage in the work, the period by which they may not experience disruption as a result of addressing their issues, and when they might be able to resume the care of their daughter without any evidence to substantiate them. It seemed to me that in appointing herself as both social worker, psychologist, therapist and judge, Ms Williams had fallen into significant error. </span></p>

The father&#8217;s history makes him incredibly vulnerable, emotionally needy and lacking in self-esteem. The mother is compliant and unassertive. Whilst they only have to think about each other and making each other happy, it is absolutely correct that the relationship suits them both, and there is no need for arguments or coercion. At the moment, they only fall out about what to watch on Netflix and which puzzle to do. But the father does have a conviction for behaving in a controlling and coercive way when his needs are not being met. If he felt that the mother was concentrating too much on Z, it is entirely predictable that he may seek to control his partner in the way that he has before. </span></p>

But it is obvious that in the event that she were to change, and become less compliant, there is a risk that this would change the dynamic between them, and that this may lead to arguments and previous patterns of behaviour.

Ms Williams placed reliance upon her own observations that the couple were maintaining their flat to an acceptable level, and that this was an area in which they had made progress. This completely ignored the observations of the other professionals who had visited the flat and found that there was an on-going issue, and that the flat was not being cleaned consistently. I was incredibly concerned when Ms Williams was asked to consider the recent photographs of the flat (taken on the 11</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">th</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> July), which show the kitchen, bathroom and lounge to be cluttered and dirty. Rather than to tell the truth about what she saw, Ms Williams, in a wholly unprofessional way in my view, tried to suggest that there were other authorities for whom she worked who would not regard the state of the flat to be a significant concern. This was utterly disingenuous, and potentially dangerous in my view. To give these parents the message that their flat was a suitable place for Z to be, when it was in the state that it was, was both wrong and unprofessional. </span></p>

She assisted the parents in buying items for the flat. She appeared to discuss with them, and encourage them, to think about a move away from Coventry.

Your childhood has also had an effect on you. One important way is that you are very quiet and find it hard to stand up for yourself. I was really worried when you told me that you didn&#8217;t try and suggest to YY that coming back to Coventry wasn&#8217;t a good idea, because that tells me that you are not able to guide him when he is doing something that is risky. That was also true about his &#8216;phone calls with BB. You weren&#8217;t able to stop those, but also you didn&#8217;t tell the professionals about them. Although you said that you didn&#8217;t think that it was your place to tell, if Z was with you, she would rely on you to be able to stand up to YY and to be honest about what was happening with the social workers. At the moment, I do not think that you can do that. </span></p>

YY, you are getting your emotional needs met, and XX is able to concentrate on you and what you need. Although she told me that you sometimes disagree about what film to watch and whether you should be on the PlayStation, these are not big things. You don&#8217;t really have any reason to fall out, and XX doesn&#8217;t really challenge you about anything. </span></p>

This work is essential if she is going to be able to protect Z. But if she has this work, there is a risk that this might affect the way that the two of you are together, and YY might feel so insecure that he might go back to old patterns of behaviour and start to try and control XX. If Z were exposed to this, it would cause her emotional harm. Z needs to see her parents being equal and independent. At the moment, you are not this. </span></p>

Without this therapy, you are likely to continue to find it hard to motivate yourself to look after yourself and XX properly, to be able to manage your finances, to cook and plan. If Z came back to you now, I am worried that you would not mean to, but you would neglect her, because caring for her would feel like too big a task. </span></p>

You cannot avoid people forever. I do not think that it was a good idea to come back to Coventry. There is a real chance that you might bump into someone from your past, who might try and exploit you. You should not have been in contact with BB and I think that you do know that, but you could not stop it, because you were thinking about what was right for him and not what was right for you. Until you can make good decisions, Z will be at risk.</span></p>

I think that Carmel wanted to try and help you because she liked you and felt sorry for the horrible pasts that you have both had. But I think that she didn&#8217;t listen to the professional opinions of the other experts, particularly Dr Wilcox, and she fell into the mistake of thinking that she was a psychologist, because she seems to have a personal interest in issues like neurodiversity and trauma. She seemed to think that she knew better than he did, and she had no basis to believe that. That wasn&#8217;t fair to you. She was too positive about your situation. For example, although I am sure that she is right when she has only seen you being loving and respectful to each other, if she had listened to Dr Wilcox, she would have realised that her observation is superficial, and the potential risks to Z are more complicated than just what she saw. I prefer the evidence of the social worker, Dr Wilcox and the Guardian, who are all in agreement. </span></p>

You have been to every family time session that you could, and when you are there, you give her lots of cuddles and praise. You spend money on her when you can, and you enjoy seeing how she changes with each week. But without the work that Dr Wilcox recommends, if Z were to come back to, she would be at risk of significant physical and emotional harm, even though you would not mean it. You have to do that work before it would be safe for her to come home. But Carmel&#8217;s recommendation does not factor that in and I think that she is wrong about that. Her timescales do not make any sense. Carmel forgot how long Z would have to wait for you to be able to be the parents you want to be, and that was a mistake. </span></p>
