	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am concerned with a little child, who I will refer to as X, who was born in 2012. Not long after the birth, the local authority issued care proceedings in relation to X. In due course the care proceedings, together with proceedings for a placement order which the local authority had also issued, came on for a finding of fact hearing before a Circuit Judge in early 2013. The local authority&#8217;s Schedule of Findings Sought identified various injuries which X was said to have suffered, including a number of metaphyseal fractures. The judge had written reports from three experts, all of whom gave oral evidence, as did the birth parents, as I shall refer to them. The judge found the local authority&#8217;s case proved. There was no appeal from the judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Subsequently, in 2014, X was placed with prospective adoptive parents. Later that year they applied to adopt X. In response, the birth parents applied for permission to oppose the adoption application. Their application was heard by the same judge in 2015. By then a criminal investigation was on foot. At the subsequent trial in the Crown Court, the expert evidence had expanded both in volume and, very significantly, in its ambit, but at the date of the hearing before the judge in the family court this new evidence was not to hand. The judge refused the birth parents leave to oppose the adoption. Again, there was no appeal from his order. Later the same day, the judge made an adoption order in respect of X in favour of the adoptive parents as I shall refer to them.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The effect of that order was, as a matter of law, to terminate the birth parents&#8217; rights and to make the adoptive parents X&#8217;s parents for all purposes: see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/46" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 46</ref> and 67 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following the outcome of their trial in the Crown Court, the birth parents applied to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal out of time against the judge&#8217;s original decision at the finding of fact hearing in 2013, essentially on the ground that there was fresh evidence now available to them which satisfied the test in <span style="font-style:italic">Ladd v Marshall </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1954] 1 WLR 1489" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1954">[1954] 1 WLR 1489</ref>. They sought orders setting aside the judge&#8217;s findings and ordering a new trial. It should be noted that there was no application for permission to appeal either against the subsequent care and placements orders or against the adoption order. On the other hand, both in the grounds of appeal as settled by counsel and in their accompanying skeleton argument, it was made clear that (I quote the grounds of appeal) &#8220;If the parents succeed in overturning the findings &#8230; they will seek revocation of the adoption order.&#8221;</p>

The birth parents were represented by Ms Martha Cover and Ms Katy Rensten, the local authority by Ms Sarah Morgan QC, and X by Mr Christopher Archer. None of them had appeared below. Given that the only challenge was to the judge&#8217;s original fact-finding decision, the adoptive parents were neither parties to the appeal nor represented in the Court of Appeal. Indeed, McFarlane LJ had directed that no steps were to be taken to inform them of the pending application without the leave of the Court of Appeal.</p>

The local authority was represented by Ms Morgan, the birth parents by Ms Cover and Ms Rensten, the adoptive parents by Ms Deidre Fottrell QC, and X&#8217;s guardian by Mr Archer. Ms Fottrell drew attention to the fact that her clients had known nothing of the proceedings in the Court of Appeal and had had little time in which to prepare themselves for the hearing before me. After hearing argument, I decided that justice to the adoptive parents (and, indeed, to X) required me to grant Ms Fottrell the adjournment she sought. I accordingly adjourned the directions hearing part heard to 11 May 2016. I understand that because of this the Court of Appeal vacated the hearing listed for 6 May 2016 and re-listed it for early June 2016.</p>

Although making clear that her clients made no point against any of the parties, Ms Fottrell submitted that the decision to exclude the adoptive parents &#8211; X&#8217;s legal parents &#8211; from the appeal process and the permission hearing in the Court of Appeal was wrong and in breach of both Article 6 and Article 8 of the Convention. I record Ms Fottrell&#8217;s submission on the point; it is not a matter on which it would be proper for me to comment.   </p>
