	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">&#8220;E&#8221;, who sues by her Litigation Friend, is presently a ward of court. She is a citizen of Ghana who, on her account, entered this country with her older sister &#8220;S&#8221; in 2001 and has since been resident here.  The circumstances of her background and early life in Ghana are by no means clear.  She states that she believes and has always understood that she was born on 20 September 1988 and is now therefore just seventeen.  The question at issue before me is whether or not that is indeed her age, or whether she has been deliberately and persistently misstating her age in order to represent herself as a child entitled to various benefits, and / or protection from the London Borough in which she has until lately been resident (&#8220;the Local Authority&#8221;) as a child in need of care.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On her account, she was brought up with her elder sister S in the midst of an extended family in a compound in a rural area of Ghana, being principally cared for by KY whom she looked on as her mother, but understood to be her maternal grandmother.  She believed that her mother (&#8220;E McL&#8221;) went to the UK soon after her birth and was living in England where she had married. E McL rarely returned home to Ghana.    S had preceded E to the United Kingdom. She obtained a visa in Ghana in 2001and went to live with E McL, enrolling at school.  However, she was not happy there. She returned briefly to Ghana where E then obtained a visa and went to England, the girls returning on separate flights.  E was accompanied by a man called Vincent whom she understood to be her mother&#8217;s boyfriend.  Once in England, she lived with E McL and S as her mother and older sister respectively, being enrolled at a local secondary school where she proceeded to do well.</p>

In June 2004, E was caught shop-lifting and, shortly afterwards, her school notified the Local Authority Social Services that her work had deteriorated and that she appeared to be sad and hungry much of the time.</p>

When recommended by social workers to return to her mother&#8217;s care, E left home and spent three nights sleeping on a park bench.  When she returned to school on 12 July 2004, her tutor took her back to Social Services insisting that they accommodate her, which they did, placing her with foster carers.</p>

However the meeting was difficult and E and E McL were unable to resolve their differences.  E McL withdrew her consent for E to be accommodated by the Local Authority with foster parents and stated that she had an airline ticket for E to return to Ghana on 30 August 2004.  E was again advised to return home.  She refused and stayed a further 3 days with her foster carers, before the Local Authority removed her belongings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 27 August 2004, being now homeless, E consulted solicitors and acquired an advocate from Reconstruct. E applied ex-parte by counsel before Munby J to be made a Ward of Court and for an order that the Local Authority should prepare a report outlining the outcome of any child protection investigation and making clear why E had not been accommodated or placed on the Child Protection Register.  On counsel undertaking to issue an Originating Summons requesting such relief forthwith, E was made a ward of court and her advocate from Reconstruct was appointed her Litigation Friend. It appearing to the court that a care or supervision order might be appropriate, the Local Authority was directed to prepare a report under s. 37(1) of the <span style="font-style:italic">Children Act</span> 1989 and the case was listed for urgent hearing on 6 September 2004.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There was placed before the court a s.37 report upon E dated 3 September 2004, made by a qualified and experienced senior social worker employed by the Local Authority, Ms M.  That report is a thorough and comprehensive document, setting out the circumstances surrounding E and her family, being based on a number of interviews and conversations with E and E McL over a seven week period as well as two interviews with S, in which a thorough investigation of the family history and situation was set out.  The Report records E&#8217;s date of birth as 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 1988, and that E McL had produced E&#8217;s birth certificate (which Ms M photocopied), which stated that E McL was the natural mother of S and E.  The s.37 report was in large measure concerned with the allegations and counter allegations of E and E McL and the best way forward so far as E was concerned.  It concluded that the Local Authority had no grounds to apply for an order, and that the issues centred around family boundaries and a breakdown in communication.  The Local Authority did not consider the threshold for proceedings was met and considered that the issues within the family could be dealt with without the Local Authority sharing parental responsibility for E. The Local Authority, having referred to Rapid Response to work with the family, proposed no further action on its part.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Despite the indication of Holman J that, if application were made, he would be prepared to make an interim care order, the Local Authority took the position that it believed the return of E to E McL could be brokered.  In the face of E&#8217;s stated fear that E McL wished to return her to Ghana, which she did not want, the judge urged the Local Authority to be as caring as possible.  He directed that the Home Office provide information as to E&#8217;s immigration status and ordered that no one should cause or attempt to cause E to be removed from the jurisdiction, the Local Authority being ordered to hold E&#8217;s passport by the order of the court.  The matter was adjourned to 21 September 2004 for further directions.</p>

The Local Authority conducted a s.47 investigation and concluded there was no risk.  E still refused to go home. The refuge to which she applied was unable to accommodate her and the Local Authority called the police to remove E from their offices.  </p>

At that hearing Cox J ordered the Local Authority to provide suitable accommodation.</p>

At an adjourned hearing on 13 September 2004, E McL consented, and the Local Authority agreed, to E being accommodated by the Authority with foster parents under s.20 of the 1989 Act.  On 22 September 2004 a consent order was made in the judicial review proceedings discharging the order of Cox J, the Local Authority agreeing as part of that order that it would give forty-eight hours notice of any future intention not to provide such accommodation.</p>

She kept in touch with S who stayed on with E McL in the family home. However E McL would have nothing to do with E.  An application was lodged with the Home Office by the Community Law Clinic on behalf of E for her to have leave to remain in the United Kingdom (which application has since been granted).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.11in">  At the hearing before Singer J, however, E McL stated that she was not E&#8217;s mother, but her older sister, and that E was not a child.  In those circumstances, Singer J gave directions that E McL file and serve a full and frank affidavit setting out the circumstances concerning paternity, age and family relationships of E and that E file and serve a statement in response.  He gave additional directions and listed the matter for further hearing on 26 January 2005.  He also adjourned an application made by the local authority to be discharged from the proceedings to be heard on the same date.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In her second affidavit, dated 21 December 2004, made pursuant to Singer J&#8217;s order, E McL asserted that she was not the mother of E, although she was the mother of S.  She claimed that E was the child [and not the grandchild] of KY by DA, and thus was E McL&#8217;s half-sister.  DA was E McL&#8217;s stepfather and S had been born to her as a result of her rape by DA.  E, was in fact <span style="font-style:italic">older</span> than S by some three years, S having been born on 20 September 1985.  E McL had originally come to the UK because of the unbearable situation in the home in Ghana leaving KY to care for E and S. S had first joined her, followed later by E. She said that difficulties had developed in England between her and E once E arrived in the UK. E had begun to threaten her and in effect to blackmail her, telling her that if she did not let E stay she would tell E McL&#8217;s husband that S&#8217;s birth father was a result of rape by her step-father.  E McL exhibited a certified copy of E&#8217;s Ghanaian birth certificate obtained by her on 21 March 2002 (presumably that produced to Ms M when she made the earlier s.37 report). It is noteworthy that this named DA and E McL respectively as the father and mother of E, the date of her birth being 20 September 1988.  It thus gave no support to E McL&#8217;s assertion that E was older than S or that she had any birth date other than 20 September 1988. E McL asserted that the birth date shown on the certificate was false. However, she gave no explanation as to how that came about or why it should be so.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 26 January 2005 Singer J again adjourned the proceedings to 10 March 2005 when E and E McL were to attend.  He also ordered that the Local Authority file and serve a final or interim age assessment on E by 28 February 2005.  He adjourned to the same date the application of the local authority, together with a similar application now made by E McL, to be discharged from the proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 28 February 2005, Ms N, a social worker employed by the Local Authority completed an Age Assessment in consultation with Ms M, the author of the earlier s.37 report.  That too was an apparently thorough document, which set out at length the conflicting material considered by Ms N.  It highlighted various inconsistencies found to exist in the accounts given by E from time to time of the dates and circumstances surrounding the application for her visa and her flight from Ghana to London and her apparently shifting memory of various members of her extended family.  It also placed weight on the fact that, whereas previously E had presented to Ms M as focused and grown-up in manner, she was at her assessment interview presenting as relatively &#8220;immature, giggly [and] unsure about basic information to do with her family, life style and future.&#8221;</p>

Miss Craig, who appeared for the local authority, submitted that, if E wished to challenge the Age Assessment, then the appropriate process was by way of judicial review, and that no such application had been made.  Bracewell J having heard representations from all parties discharged E McL as a party but refused to discharge the local authority. She considered that E&#8217;s age required to be determined for the wider purpose of the wardship proceedings and in the interests of her future welfare. To that end, she directed that E serve a statement in response to the Age Assessment and any other evidence to show she was a child by 31 March 2005, by which date the Local Authority was also to file any further evidence.  The matter was listed to be heard before Singer J on the issue of E&#8217;s age on 13 June 2005.</p>

That home is situated in Croydon, a different local authority area.  E has completed her GCSEs with good results and is now at a convent senior school, hoping herself to go to university in due course.  Her finances are precarious.  She receives &#163;30 per week from the school she now attends. She also does some part-time work outside school hours as a sales assistant, earning almost &#163;40 per week.  The Department of Work and Pensions are currently assessing E, whom they accept is a child of seventeen. Mrs CG, is presently accommodating E rent-free, but she is now retired and feels unable to give E continued lodging unless she shortly receives rent. E is hoping that she may in due course receive housing benefit.  Her immigration position is that she has now obtained limited leave to remain in the United Kingdom until 2008.</p>

Furthermore, the Local Authority, where E now resides has been notified of these proceedings but does not seek to be heard.  However, if E is still only 17, because the period of accommodation which she spent in foster care provided for her by the Local Authority between September 2004 and March 2005 exceeded 13 weeks, she is a &#8220;relevant child&#8221; for the purposes of access to the resources and support of the Local Authority under s.23A-C and s.24B of the 1989 Act, as amended by s.2 and s.4 respectively of the <span style="font-style:italic">Children (Leaving Care) Act </span>2000, although she has made no claims in that respect.</p>

Nor has she suggested that, for the purposes of determining its own jurisdiction over infants in wardship proceedings, the court lacks the power, which plainly it has, to determine the true age of the subject of the proceedings, in order to ensure the proper exercise of its powers.  However, Miss Craig submitted that the sole purpose for which the wardship proceedings are now being pursued, following the Local Authority&#8217;s adverse Age Assessment is to reverse that assessment.  Thus (1) in substance the court is being asked to exercise an appellate or review function in respect of the Age Assessment which (if done at all) ought properly to be done by way of judicial review and (2) the court is in any event being invited to interfere with the powers granted to the Local Authority to supply or (if so decided) to withhold services under the 1989 Act, which invitation it ought in its discretion to decline.</p>

He submits that the court should proceed to its determination, not only for the purpose of deciding whether or not to continue to exercise its powers of wardship, but because it is in the general welfare interests of E in the confused and effectively parentless situation in which she finds herself to have the matter of age determined on the basis of the evidence now available and, if found to be a child, to enjoy the protection of the court.</p>

If Parliament in an area of concern defined by Statute (the area in this case being the care of children in need or trouble) prefers power to be exercised administratively instead of judicially, so be it.

That assessment was conducted under a non-statutory internal procedure of the local authority carried out in accordance with the guidance given by Stanley Burnton J in <span style="font-style:italic">B v London Borough of Merton</span> [2003] EWHC 1689 (Admin).  I am being asked on E&#8217;s behalf to conduct an inquiry by way of original (and not appellate or review) jurisdiction for the purposes of the court in the exercise of its wardship function on the basis of the evidence now available to it a good deal of which was not available to the local authority.  To do so will not in itself interfere with the exercise of the statutory powers of the local authority in relation to which there are no provisions governing age assessment.   While the local authority is at liberty, and indeed no doubt obliged, to withhold care services it would otherwise supply to a person if it is satisfied that party is not a child, the statute does not prescribe what method of assessment should be adopted for that purpose.   It does not seem to me that, if the question of the age of a putative child becomes an issue in wardship proceedings, a decision of the court to adjudicate upon that issue for the purposes both of establishing or confirming its protective jurisdiction and furthering the welfare of the child, the court should decline to deal with it simply because a local authority has conducted an earlier age assessment on the basis of more limited evidence and for a more limited statutory purpose.</p>

While the 1989 Act does not expressly so provide, it is inherent in its structure and content that a local authority, in any case where doubts are raised in respect of the age of a putative child in need of care and protection, should make an age assessment and, according to its results, decide whether to take measures in respect of the &#8220;child&#8221; under the provisions of the Act.

The question of doubt as to E&#8217;s age only arose in the mind of the local authority <span style="font-style:italic">in the course </span>of these proceedings in the unusual circumstances described.  When it did arise, Singer J rightly directed the authority to conduct an age assessment before the matter was further considered.  When the matter returned for further consideration before Bracewell J, I am told that Miss Craig aired the submissions which she has made before me, however, Bracewell J was not prepared to treat the Age Assessment as dispositive of the question of E&#8217;s age for the wider purpose of the wardship proceedings in which the court is required to consider the position of the subject child on a broad welfare basis. In that respect, it was the position of E at that time was that her fate would be entirely at large on termination of the foster placement in which she was currently placed but from which she was about to be ejected.  She would effectively be parentless and the local authority would have washed its hands of her.  That being so, Bracewell J no doubt considered that in relation to (a) the need to determine the jurisdiction of the court in wardship and (b) general welfare concerns in respect of E in her limbo of uncertainty as to her age, it was appropriate to make a judicial determination of E&#8217;s age, having afforded her a sufficient opportunity to gather evidence in that respect.</p>

Although in the ensuing paragraphs of my judgment, I refer in some detail to the content of the Age Assessment, that is because, at the request of the Local Authority I have received it in evidence in the inquiry before me, the nature of which is more inquisitorial than adversarial for the purpose of establishing E&#8217;s age.  In that respect, at the outset of the hearing I made it clear to the Local Authority, who were content, that I would treat the views and conclusions stated in the Age Assessment as being the bona fide views and conclusions of Miss N and Miss M on the basis of the interviews conducted by them and the evidence before them as referred to in the assessment, without the necessity to hear their oral evidence to that effect.

The birthplace is shown as Konongo Health Centre, Konongo, informant DA.  The entry number in the Konongo registry is shown as No 331.  Both the date of registration and the date of the certificate by the Konongo Registrar are shown as 18 March 2002.  The second affidavit of E McL states that this certificate was obtained shortly after E was due to return to Ghana in 2002 after her original entry to the UK as a holiday visitor but &#8220;could not find her passport&#8221;.  Its date is consistent with that account.</p>

I received no satisfactory account of the individuals involved in obtaining it.  The father is again shown on the certificate to be DA, but the mother is stated to be one A.  The birth date of E is also shown as 20 September 1988.  The birthplace is shown as the District Hospital Konongo and the informant is stated to be A (mother).  The entry number in the Konongo Registry is shown as No 461.  The date of registration and the date of the certificate by the Konongo Registrar are shown as 4 April 2005 and 5 April 2005 respectively.</p>

It appears to be a copy of an authentic document, though again I have no further detail as to its provenance.  It is on its face signed by the Registrar of the Konongo District and witnessed by him on 10 October 1988.  Like the second certificated copy of Registry Entry referred to above it shows DA and A as father and mother respectively, the birth date being 20 September 1988.  The entry number appears as No 369.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Despite the various discrepancies I have mentioned and, most notably the fact that, the first certificate of Registry Entry shows E McL (under her Ghanaian name) as mother, whereas the second certificate of entry and the Birth Certificate show one A as mother, all show that a female child with the same name as E, whose father is DA (who is in turn acknowledged by all concerned to be part of the extended family in Ghana from which S and E McL also came) was born at Konongo on 20 September 1988.  The only suggestion to the contrary comes from the second affidavit of E McL, sworn at a time when she was plainly interested to disown or discredit E and have her returned to Ghana.  Furthermore, at the time the first certificate of Registry Entry was obtained by E McL in March 2002, she had no obvious reason to misrepresent E&#8217;s birth date.  Whatever the precise state of the Konongo Registry or the number of the entries within it relating to the birth of E, there seems no reason to doubt that the date of birth recorded in the Registry is 20 September 1988 or that the date shown on the copy of the original Birth Certificate (see paragraph 38 above) was other than a true statement when made by the Registrar on 10 October 1988.</p>

However, since it is immediately apparent to the eye that the digits of the year &#8220;1984&#8221;, and possibly the month &#8220;December&#8221; are overwritten upon characters not now discernible, and since the document was produced by E McL after her &#8220;revelation&#8221; in order to support her new account, the document in my view has no probative value whatsoever.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, it places great weight upon E&#8217;s somewhat giggly and relatively vague and inarticulate performance at interview as compared with her presentation to Ms M, who was responsible for the earlier s.37 report, in which she described E as &#8220; bright, intelligent and focused&#8221;.  The question was raised, and indeed it is plain that the conclusion was drawn, that E was deliberately adopting this attitude because of the need to appear younger than she was.  Accepting that to be so, it does not seem to me logically to follow that her age was older than that of a 16 to 17-year-old, which Ms M had plainly accepted that she was for the purposes of the earlier s.37 report, her care plan documents (which are also before me), and in all subsequent dealings between the local authority, E and E McL up to the time of E McL&#8217;s &#8220;revelation&#8221;.</p>

In particular, doubt is cast on the circumstances and history of E&#8217;s leaving Ghana and coming to England, including her visa application in Ghana.  Again accepting this to be the case, and that such inconsistencies go to the general truth of E&#8217;s account, they go, in my view, principally to the question of the lawfulness of her arrival and immigration status rather than the question of her age.</p>

However, it is not apparent that this theory was ever put for comment to the teachers consulted, one of which was Mrs A to whose own considered assessment I have already referred at paragraph 27 above.  Further, there is a passage in the Age Assessment, which shows that E&#8217;s foster carer (who obviously had the opportunity to know E and her behaviour well) explained E&#8217;s apparent maturity for her age on the ground that &#8220;in their Ghanaian culture children are trained from a very young age to be independent and they tend to be more developed than other young people who live in comfort in the UK.&#8221;</p>

I am not clear, nor has it been made clear to me in argument, to what documents this is a reference. Of the documents exhibited with the Age Assessment the only documents referred to are (1) the birth certificate (in fact the first copy Register Entry) obtained by E McL when applying for a new passport for E.  In the Age Assessment it is stated that it is &#8220;unclear&#8221; whether the birth certificate can be relied on as evidence of age, and plainly it has been ignored in that respect, because the certified birth date was 20 September 1988, which is supportive of E&#8217;s case.  </p>

There is nothing in these documents to show E&#8217;s age as being other than 16.  On the contrary, the Admissions Document, signed by E McL, showed E&#8217;s birth date as 20.9.88.  The Admission Document is accompanied by a post-natal &#8220;Road to Health Chart&#8221; from the Konongo Health Clinic, which shows the same birth date and bears a series of dated immunisation entries in different hands dated in 1988/1989, which are entirely consistent with such a birth date.  It is again noteworthy that, whereas the father&#8217;s name is shown as DA, the name of the mother is shown as AA.</p>

The revelations contained in that affidavit were the very context in which the Age Assessment was ordered by the court, whereas hitherto it had not occurred to the Local Authority that any such assessment was necessary.  Indeed no question had been raised as to whether E was older than her appearance, let alone three years older (rather than younger) than S, who was by that time apparently of University age.  Whereas the final Conclusion of the Age Assessment is stated in terms that rely simply on E&#8217;s behaviour, demeanour and educational assessment, the fact that none of these had hitherto given the Local Authority any pause for thought and are contrary to the evidence of her teachers themselves, leads me to conclude that, although now acknowledged to be unreliable, the evidence of E McL was influential upon the mind of the maker of the assessment.</p>

However (subject to the further submissions of counsel) I do not consider it appropriate to discharge the wardship of E before she reaches the age of 18, in the light of the uncertainty as to her present circumstances should she be obliged to leave her present lodging.  It is by no means clear that she will continue to live with Mrs CD and, in the interim, it seems to me desirable that the court should retain oversight of her welfare for the 10 months or so of her minority.  However, I will hear the further submissions of the parties as to the appropriate terms of any order following their opportunity to consider this judgment.</p>
