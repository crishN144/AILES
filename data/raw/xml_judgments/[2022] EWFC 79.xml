	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This is an application for financial remedies by the Applicant Wife against the Respondent Husband. The Applicant was represented at this final hearing by Mr Howe of counsel and the Respondent represented himself but was assisted throughout by a McKenzie Friend. This is a case in which the capital either just meets the needs of the parties or is not sufficient to meet the needs of the parties depending upon decisions that are made in terms of the needs of each of the parties and what assets are to be considered for distribution.</p>

The case is published following the guidance provided by the President of the Family Division in which it is stated that each Family Judge should aim to publish 10% of their judgements. There is also a lack of reported Financial Remedy cases other than those that involve individuals that are either wealthy or extremely wealthy and this case does not fit into such categories. </p>

The Applicant is also in receipt of Universal Credit in the sum of approximately &#163;1,300 every 4 weeks and Child Benefit of &#163;140.60 every 4 weeks. There is also child maintenance paid by the Respondent. The Applicant is presently living in rented accommodation together with the 7 year old child of the parties and her three daughters from her previous marriage who are aged 19, 17 and 13 years old. The eldest of those daughters is currently at University and resides with the Applicant out of term time and will also be spending considerable time whilst she is undertaking her placements for her degree. These children also spend 50% of their time with their father in the previous former matrimonial home held in the joint names of the Applicant and her first husband.</p>

This encompasses these Financial Remedy proceedings but also the Children Act proceedings which are still ongoing. These debts include &#163;36,347 on credit cards, &#163;7,626 loans from banks and &#163;33,358 loans from friends and family. The costs attributable to the Financial Remedy application are stated to be &#163;22,612, of which &#163;16,966 have been paid, leaving a shortfall of &#163;5,646 still to be paid. It is stated that there has also been a shortfall form her income to meet her outgoings which has caused an increase in liabilities.</p>

He continues to reside in the former matrimonial home together with two of his children from a former marriage who are both in their twenties and in full-time employment. At present the child of the parties has no contact with the Respondent, although, as stated, there are continuing Children Act proceedings on this issue. He also has a daughter from his first marriage who is aged 22 and is living independently with her partner. The Respondent sets out his liabilities as &#163;11,645.04, the largest part of this is comprised of a bank loan in the sum of &#163;9,061 which he states was used to clear a joint debt. It appears that the Applicant accepted in her oral evidence that this loan was raised to fund a joint overdraft. </p>

The former matrimonial home was purchased in June 2013. The parties separated in October 2019 when the Applicant left the property to live in a confidential address, having made allegations of domestic abuse against the Respondent. Those allegations have not been referred to within these proceedings nor have any allegations that were raised within the Children Act proceedings. I have not taken such issues into account for the purposes of this judgment.</p>

The Applicant commenced these proceedings in February 2020 which were not issued until June 2020. A First Appointment was listed in September 2020. At that stage the lists were still being triaged by myself as they were all being held remotely and upon reviewing the file it appeared that neither party had filed their Forms E which caused me to vacate the hearing. In fact, the Applicant had filed a Form E but the Respondent had not. Following the orders of the court the Applicant filed further Forms E but the Respondent did not file his document until 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2021. The Respondent states this was because he had never been served with the relevant documents. The FDR was heard by a Deputy District Judge in the summer of 2021. No settlement was achieved but directions were made including further questionnaires, statements dealing with conduct, valuations and updating disclosure and s.25 statements. The matter was listed for a final hearing before a District Judge in April 2022.</p>

That application was heard by myself in November 2021 at which I made further directions. At that hearing I noted that a case that had been in my diary had recently settled meaning there was presently availability in my diary to list this matter in January 2022 and ordered that the hearing in April 2022 be vacated and the matter listed before myself. The Applicant agreed to the matter being brought forward but the Respondent objected stating that there would be insufficient time to prepare for such a hearing. I made the order and the Respondent sought permission to appeal that decision. I refused permission to appeal, and the Respondent pursued the matter but Arbuthnot J refused permission to appeal on the basis that it was &#8220;totally without merit&#8221;.</p>

The parties had filed their section 25 statements and the Respondent had provided written questions for me to put to the Applicant in compliance with the ground rules made in relation to special measures for the Applicant. However, that hearing did not take place as the Respondent sent an email to the Applicant&#8217;s solicitors on the day before the hearing was due to commence timed at 16:44 stating that he had tested positive for Covid 19 and he enclosed the email he had received from NHS Covid 19 notification which was timed at 14:56.

That test was negative. The matter then came to hearing on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 13 April 2022 before myself. The Applicant provided the electronic bundle for the January hearing which totalled 355 pages. The documents that were produced following that hearing including valuations which had not previously been available, the PCR test result, the order of that hearing and an updated case summary and schedule of assets as required within the Efficiency Statement were all added to the bundle taking the total pages to 400. The Respondent made a complaint to the solicitors acting for the Applicant in relation to the size of the bundle, it being greater than permitted pursuant to PD27A as well as the order made by myself. He sent an email on 8 April 2022 stating that he requested an adjournment of the final hearing &#8220;to allow sufficient time for the bundle to be made fully compliant and to enable the proceedings to be do disposed of justly&#8221;. I stated to the Respondent that a pragmatic approach was required and continued with the hearing. </p>

It will all depend on the circumstances, and the court will look at when the property was acquired, how it has been used, whether it has been mingled with the family finances and what the parties intended.</span></p>

The applicant states it should be &#163;226,930 whereas the Respondent claims the correct figure should be &#163;232,908. I note that the mortgage figure at May 2021 was in the sum suggested by the Respondent and as this is a repayment mortgage amounting to &#163;1,115 per month it is difficult to see how the mortgage would still be at the same level as one year ago. The lower figure seems to be the correct one. The respondent also includes an early redemption penalty of &#163;6,987. If there is such a penalty and the property is required to be sold then naturally that will have to be taken into account but I have yet to see any evidence in relation to that figure. </p>

It does not seem to me that this difference has any impact upon the decision that needs to be made in this case and is symptomatic of the Respondent&#8217;s approach to every single issue.

To that extent the argument put forward by the Respondent in relation to the deposit that he paid for the former matrimonial home is somewhat stronger than it would be in other cases. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">A further point made by the Respondent is that the claim that the Applicant makes in relation to capital gains tax relating to her original former matrimonial home is not one which should impact upon the Respondent. In oral evidence he said: &#8220;that is not my problem&#8221;. His argument is that if it was sold when the Applicant and her original husband first separated then there should be no capital gains tax and he should not be financially impeded by that decision. However, I am satisfied that the decision not to sell that property was a reasonable one bearing in mind the needs of the three children of that family and that the Applicant should not be criticised for that decision. The respondent also raises an issue as to the calculation of the capital gains tax claiming that it does not include the annual exemption allowance which presently stands at  &#163;12,300. I have not seen the calculation for capital gains and cannot comment but clearly the applicant would be expected to mitigate the tax to the fullest extent possible which would need to be calculated as at the time the property is sold and the gain realised. For the purposes of this judgement I am satisfied that the correct figure to take into account would be in the region of &#163;90,000 equity depending upon the CGT calculation. </p>

At present the property is occupied by her first husband and her 3 daughters (for half of the time) and the Applicant has considered that this was appropriate ever since she vacated that property in 2012. Her youngest daughter is presently aged 13.   In her oral evidence the Applicant stated that she had discussed financial settlement with  her first husband on separation but they had not discussed it since and that as their youngest daughter was 13 it is unlikely that they are going to be able to do anything for 8 years. The Applicant did add that if and when she was in a position to buy a property then she would have a discussion with her former Husband and he may be able to cohabit and buy her out. </p>

She has been living in rented accommodation for over two years now and states that she is only just able to make ends meet, yet she has not suggested at any time that any pressure should be placed for this property to be sold. There is simply no evidence to suggest that this will change at any point in the near future. The finding is that this asset, which is certainly pre-marital, by definition, will not be realised any time soon and the Applicant will not be able to utilise it to assist in the purchase of any alternative property at present.</p>

I must not reach the conclusion that just because I do not accept the Respondent&#8217;s evidence on certain points (as I clearly do not) that he is wrong on every aspect of the case. Having no counter evidence at all makes it difficult to alight upon the correct figure and it is tempting simply to accept the only evidence that has been provided.

As far as the Respondent is concerned, it is likely that he could obtain a larger mortgage offer, if he stated he was willing to work beyond the age of 67, as many people will be required to do these days, and by actually providing a mortgage broker with all of his information in order to discover what deals are out there for him. It is unfortunate that the Respondent failed to do this as it means that the Court is bereft of this important information. However, a Court can only deal with the evidence that is placed before it by the parties and not the evidence that is not provided. </p>

The Respondent states that he was not aware of the hearings or orders. All notices and orders were sent to his address and he has received some of them, and I have not heard any issue with the notices in the Children Act proceedings in which he is seeking to be able to spend time with his son. Further, there are letters returned from the correct address, and e-mails from both the Solicitors of the Applicant and the Court have been blocked for some reason. It is always possible for there to be one document going astray, or one problem with e-mails, but when there as many as must have occurred in this case for the Respondent&#8217;s position to be correct then that becomes highly unlikely. I am satisfied that the Respondent has done all he could to block documents getting into his hands. It was due to this issue being highlighted that I took the extraordinary step of ensuring that my clerk personally e-mailed all of the documents directly to the Respondent to ensure that the same issue could not be raised again (the terms of a restraining order prevented direct communication between the parties). Indeed, despite the Applicant&#8217;s Form E and enclosures having been e-mailed by my clerk to the Respondent on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July at 14.30 he still claimed not to have received it causing me to order in November that it was e-mailed by my clerk again and also to his McKenzie friend as well as being posted to his address.

This would mean that the Applicant would receive &#163;200,000 but I am satisfied that she would not have access to any of her interest in her original property in which her 3 children still spend half of their time. This has a significant impact upon her needs as it means that she could not utilise the &#163;90,000 that is represented by that property towards the purchase of a property at present. Further, it is unlikely that this will be realised in anything less than 5 years&#8217; time, on the evidence provided to the Court.</p>

That would leave a figure of &#163;129,000 to put towards an alternative property. If she was to be able to purchase a property worth &#163;425,000, which in turn would require a &#8216;housing pot&#8217; of &#163;450,000 then she would require a mortgage of &#163;321,000.

Those other assets were all pre-marital in nature and it is accepted that he had also contributed &#163;80,000 towards the deposit on the joint property. He is aged 50 and has next to no pension. I am satisfied that this would not produce a fair outcome for the Respondent bearing in mind all of the factors that must be taken into account. This is especially so once it is understood that such an order would still not produce a result whereby the agreed housing needs of the Applicant could presently be achieved. It could not be deemed to be a fair outcome for the Respondent to be left in such a position without it leading to the benefit of the Applicant and children being housed in a property owned by the Applicant.</p>

In general, that is dealt with by ensuring that a suitable property can be purchased to accommodate such children. That is simply not possible in this case. In such circumstances the Court must strive to achieve an outcome which is fair to both parties and puts them in a position whereby they will be in the best position possible to obtain such accommodation in due course. For the Applicant in this case that requires that she is able to be debt free and, in a position to be able to obtain a mortgage once her original matrimonial home is sold in anything up to 5-8 years&#8217; time. In terms of the needs of the Respondent; the Court is satisfied that they can be met by way of being in a smaller property than the former matrimonial home as there is no duty for the Court to take into account his independent adult children, however desirable that such an outcome might be. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Respondent set out in his closing submissions that the most cost effective outcome would be one that avoids a sale of the former matrimonial home. That is certainly correct but can only occur if he is in a position to raise sufficient capital to pay to the Applicant a reasonable sum. The Respondent was clear that &#163;50,000 was the maximum that could possibly be raised in this manner and I am satisfied that this would not be a sufficient sum to produce a fair outcome as set out above as it would not even cover the hard debts of the Applicant.</p>

The sharing principle would state that the starting point would be for this sum to be divided equally between the parties, but in a &#8216;needs&#8217; case this is not the case. I have reached the conclusion that the least that the Applicant can receive is the sum of &#163;150,000 from the sale, which must be set out in percentage terms rather than as a set figure to allow for price fluctuation. This would mean that she would be left with approximately &#163;80,000 upon payment of her pressing debt.</p>

It will mean that the significant sums that she has to pay out to service her debts each month will be reduced substantially. However, once the Applicant receives the lump sum her Universal Credit will cease and that is presently a figure of &#163;1,300pm. The Respondent argued that this was why the Applicant should not receive any capital above &#163;15,000 as it would affect the benefits the Applicant would receive. The Court cannot approach any claim in such a manner as it is contrary to public policy.</p>

The mid to long term financial position of the Applicant is one that will improve. As stated above, her childcare responsibilities will reduce over the coming years and the housing need for both her and her first Husband will also reduce as her children achieve their majority. This will mean that the income of the Applicant will increase, and the amount of capital required to meet her housing need will reduce as there would be fewer people to accommodate on a full time basis. This should lead to the Applicant being in a position to be able to purchase a property at some point in the next 5 years by which time she will still only be aged 51 and will have sufficient working life left to be able to obtain a 20 year mortgage or thereabouts. Once she is able to realise the &#163;90,000 from her original matrimonial home together with whatever capital is left from the lump sum that she receives pursuant to this judgment then I am satisfied that there will be sufficient to purchase a property. This may be outright or on a part ownership basis.</p>

However, I am satisfied that he would be able to purchase another property. He will have capital of close to &#163;100,000 from the sale of the property together with the &#163;70,000 from his other assets. It is a matter for the Respondent as to whether he decides to realise those assets or not, but in a case where the resources are as limited as they are, the Court simply has to take such assets into account. This would leave the Respondent with a deposit in excess of &#163;150,000 and I am satisfied that he is likely to be able to obtain a mortgage in the region of &#163;200,000, leaving him with a housing fund of &#163;350,000.

The Court should strive towards a clean break if it can be achieved without being unfair to either party. I am satisfied that this can occur in this case and the parties require a total financial break from each other, save for that relating to continued payments for the child.

It would be inappropriate to fail to mark this behaviour with some order as to costs. However, in reaching the decision set out above I have taken into account the hard debts of the Applicant which relate, in the main, to costs both within these proceedings and the other litigation between these parties.

On 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2022, in his judgment <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">VV v VV <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2022/41" uk:canonical="[2022] EWFC 41" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2022">[2022] EWFC 41</ref> </span>dated 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2022 in which there were findings of litigation conduct by both parties, but anonymity was provided and there does not appear to be any consideration of the issue within the judgment.

It would be inappropriate for me to set out any view of the law, but I note that I am not aware of a single reported case at any level below High Court Judge in which anonymity has not taken place, although I accept that there may be one or two cases in which this may have occurred. In such circumstances it would be harsh to litigants, who had no real possibility of being aware that any reported judgment in their case would not be anonymous prior to the litigation commencing, to now make their names public. Indeed, in this particular case, the final hearing commenced the day before Mostyn J&#8217;s recent decision was reported, although he had clearly signposted the path he intended to follow in earlier judgments. It was with that in mind that I intended that this judgment should accordingly be anonymised.

It is not an anonymity order under CPR 39.2(4), not merely because no process for making such an order was followed, but more fundamentally because it is not such an order. Such an anonymity order can only be made exceptionally. The general rule is that the names of the parties to an action are included in orders and judgments of the court. There is no general exception for cases where private matters are in issue. An order for anonymity (or any other order restraining the publication of the normally reportable details of a case) is a derogation from the principle of open justice and an interference with the Article 10 rights of the public at large and, indeed of the parties.</span></p>

In reaching this conclusion, I take into account that I have made findings of dishonesty against the Respondent and I am satisfied that he is strongly motivated to cause anguish to the Applicant and, indirectly (not intentionally), upon the child.

It would be entirely inappropriate for any Court to seek to persuade, let alone order, any litigant not to make any comments about any member of the judiciary or the legal profession. It is vital that the Family Court, including the Financial Remedies Court is as open as possible for all of the reasons set out by the President of the Family Division, Sir Andrew McFarlane in his quest for greater transparency. This must include the ability for an individual to be able to air their views about the professionals involved, so long as that is carried out appropriately. </p>

The Article 8 rights of the child are of greater significance in this case, and it is a proportionate method of protecting those rights by restricting the competing Article 10 rights in this particular case.  To that extent I grant a Reporting Restriction Order/Anonymity Order that this judgment may be published but in an anonymous form. This will enable any member of the public to have a full understanding of the issues between the parties and how and why the decision that has been made has been reached without risking further harm upon the child in the middle of the parties involved. </span></p>
