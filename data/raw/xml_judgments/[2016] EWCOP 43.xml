He considered that sepsis might already be present in the tissue and could spread to the bone.  He acknowledged that it was difficult to specify the exact degree of urgency, because he had not yet explored the wound, but thought there might already be a degree of infection.  He also acknowledged that it was hard to estimate what would happen if the operation is postponed, since it is not usual practice to delay exploration and treatment in such circumstances.  However, he was concerned that if the infection did get into the bone, the possible consequences would be very serious:</span></p>

The clinicians explained what they wanted to do and why, and the risks of both having and not having the operation. Mr S&#8217;s view was that HN could understand and retain the information relevant to the decision whether or not to consent to the operation, but could not use and weigh that information in order to make the decision.  She did not engage in any discussion, and although she consistently refused treatment, she was unable to give any reason.</span></p>
