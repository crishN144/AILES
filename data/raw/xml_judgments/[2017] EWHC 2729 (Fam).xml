	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">An adoption order, involving the permanent severance of all family ties of a child, is one of the most significant of all court orders available in the law of England and Wales.  Some, albeit relatively few, adoption orders are made with the consent of the birth parents; in the majority of applications for adoption orders, the court will need to consider whether the welfare of the child requires that parental consent be dispensed with.  All parties in this case hope that the adoption of the 3-month old baby (&#8216;T&#8217;) with whom I am concerned may proceed with the consent of the birth mother (&#8216;S&#8217;); she wishes to give her consent, but issue has arisen as to her competence to do so.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">S is a young person; she is under 16 years of age.  S suffers from developmental delay and learning disabilities.  Approximately 12 weeks ago, S gave birth to a baby (T).  T was delivered by caesarean section under general anaesthetic.  The putative father of the baby is an adult.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">S wishes nothing to do with the baby, T.  She has not seen T.  She has not named T.  She did not want to know the gender of T, but has recently discovered this by accident; S then wanted to know T&#8217;s given name.  S does not want the father to have anything to do with T.  T was placed with foster-to-adopt carers directly from the hospital, accommodated under <span style="font-style:italic">section 20 Children Act 1989</span> (&#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">CA 1989</span>&#8217;) with S&#8217;s agreement.  S wishes for T to be adopted, as soon as possible.  Since the birth, S herself has been received into foster care, pursuant to an order under <span style="font-style:italic">Part IV CA 1989</span>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In September 2017, the Local Authority issued an application in the Family Division of the High Court pursuant to <span style="font-style:italic">rule 14.21 </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Part 19 Family Procedure Rules 2010 </span>(&#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">FPR 2010</span>&#8217;) seeking my directions in relation to adoption procedure; specifically, it sought (a) my authority not to notify the putative father of T&#8217;s existence, and (b) directions in relation to obtaining S&#8217;s consent to the placement of T for adoption and/or the adoption of T.  As it happens, the putative father had (unbeknown to the Local Authority) been advised by the police of the existence of T, and so the issue at (a) above fell away.  Following discussion at court at a directions hearing on 12 October 2017, the Local Authority issued an application for a placement order, in order that the Court could consider the widest range of case management and other powers in relation to the consent of S to the placement of the baby and/or adoption.  That application was issued on 17 October 2017; I listed the case for argument on the issue of S&#8217;s consent, and related matters, on 24 October 2017.</p>

The question, therefore, is whether, and if so in what circumstances, a relinquished baby would be the subject of a care or placement order.  The decision of Cazalet J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re M (Care Order)(Parental Responsibility)</span> [1996] 2 FLR 84 is an example of a case where the threshold was found to have been met; this case concerned a baby boy who was only a few days old and was abandoned in a hold-all on the steps of a health centre.  Cazalet J found the threshold proved under <span style="font-style:italic">section 31(2) CA 1989</span>, saying:</p>

When a baby has been simply abandoned on a doorstep, it is likely that criteria will be satisfied &#8211; each case will, as always, turn on its own facts. In cases where the mother has reached the difficult decision that she cannot keep the baby, notified the local authority in advance, and made responsible plans for the relinquishment of the baby in a way which minimises the risk of harm, it is in my judgment unlikely to be the case that the threshold criteria will be satisfied. It is likely that a baby deprived of her mother's care will suffer some form of harm but that will be diminished if the baby is swiftly moved to another carer in a planned way. Even when a baby suffers harm from being deprived of her mother's care, it does not follow in these circumstances that the harm can be described as being attributable to the care given to the child not being what it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give. A mother who concludes that she cannot care for her baby, and who notifies the authorities and makes responsible plans for relinquished in the baby at birth, is not, in my judgment, acting unreasonably&#8221;.</p>
