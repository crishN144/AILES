On 20 March 2015 the mother and B moved to live with the maternal grandparents because of the risks to B arising from the violent relationship between the mother and DW. The local authority issued care proceedings in respect of B in May 2015. The basis of the application was the local authority's assertion that she was suffering significant emotional harm in the care of the mother and DW and was at risk of suffering significant physical harm as a result of their drug taking and domestic violence. On the 14 May at the hearing of the local authority&#8217;s application for an interim care order the mother consented to B being accommodated by the local authority pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s20</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">children Act 1989</ref>.

Again, the social worker statement could have included information reported by health colleagues, making it clear that health colleagues would be required to submit statements as soon as possible following the lodging of the care application. </p>

This will prevent documents &#8220;sitting in the inbox&#8221; when social workers/ case holders are absent from work due to sickness or annual leave. </p>

The staff involved in this matter take their roles very seriously and did work hard to produce all the materials required by the court, as expeditiously as possible. However, we have all learnt from this experience and will ensure that issuing is done in a timely manner. The staff involved also offer their sincere apologies for the delay and did not wish to cause the court and parties any offence. They were working hard to gather all the necessary evidence and ensure all parties had full and up to date records of recent events. Again the team recognises the need to issue proceedings as soon as possible following the birth of the baby and will ensure this message is shared across their team&#8230;..</p>

The pre-birth assessment of LW concluded that the risks remained as the mother had not changed or accepted the concerns, but instead minimised the domestic abuse and impact this would have on her as yet unborn child&#8217;s development and safety. </p>

Plainly the period of time for which a hospital is prepared to keep a new born baby as an in-patient, either on medical or welfare grounds,  maybe a material consideration for a local authority on the timing of the  making of an application for an interim care order, but must not place too great a reliance on these indications or assurances.

It is all a question of perceived and procedural fairness. </p>

Of equal importance, it is unfair to the children&#8217;s guardian who was only appointed on the morning of the issue of this application. The fault for this unfairness lies squarely at the door of this local authority. </p>

Further it is likely that a local authority&#8217;s failure to act fairly and/or timeously will be condemned in an order for costs.</p>
