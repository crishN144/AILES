That decision followed an earlier judgment by this Court on 30 August 2023 in respect of an application for expert evidence (</span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:11pt">Re GB (Part 24 Application: Parental Alienation)</span><span style="font-size:11pt"> [2023] EWFC 150). The background need not be repeated. In short, the Court made findings of fact in respect of the father&#8217;s use of coercive controlling behaviour towards the children and towards the mother, neglect of &#8216;B&#8217;s medical needs, financial control over the mother, making major decisions about the children&#8217;s lives without the mother&#8217;s consent, providing misleading information to the Court and using Court proceedings to emotionally torment the children and the mother. Further, and significantly, the Court made findings that the father raped the mother. The father made a series of allegations against the mother, including allegations that she had emotionally abused the children and that she had alienated or negatively influenced the children against him. The Court found none of the father&#8217;s allegations to be proved. At the conclusion of the Fact Finding Hearing, the Court made an Order that the father pay the mother&#8217;s costs assessed at &#163;50,445.40.</span></p>

Further, the best interests of the children demand the making of a Child Arrangements Order such that contact with their father be limited to indirect contact only. The best interests of the children demand that there should be no direct time spent between the children and their father, consistent with their ascertainable wishes and feelings, for the reasons articulated by Guardian.

The mother agrees to communicate that email address to the father. The mother seeks to use a third-party to act on her behalf to access the email address, to prevent the mother from having to facilitate such contact. The Court agrees the practical arrangements as proposed. The father may email Christmas cards and birthday cards to the children. He shall not use the email address for any other purpose. Further, the father is entitled to receive by email the children&#8217;s annual school reports once per year. If the children wish, the Order will permit a photograph of the children to be emailed to the father annually. </span></p>

Having regard to this Court&#8217;s earlier findings of fact, this Court reaches the conclusion that it is in the best interests of both children individually to permit the change of surname proposed. Although the children were registered with their father&#8217;s surname at birth, there has been a significant change of circumstances since, as recorded in the Court&#8217;s findings of fact, such as to undermine the mother&#8217;s psychological security, to an extent so serious as to represent a significant failure of parenting on part of the father. This Court acknowledges that the children&#8217;s surname is an important factor in maintaining a link with their identity, with their father and with their wider paternal family. The names on the children&#8217;s birth certificates will not change. Both children are of an age where they clearly understand their paternity. However, their surname maintains a connection to their father who has caused significant harm to them and who has caused significant harm to their mother. That name provides a daily reminder to them all of that connection. Their father&#8217;s surname should not be imposed on them in those circumstances. Their mother will be their primary carer. </span><span style="font-size:11pt;color:#000000;background-color:#FFFFFF">The name of a child is not a trivial matter.

The mother cannot apply to terminate the father&#8217;s Parental Responsibility, as the mother and father were married at the time of the birth of each child respectively. Accordingly, the father was granted Parental Responsibility for the children automatically in law. The Order sought by the mother seeks to </span><span style="font-size:11pt">prevent the father form communicating with the children&#8217;s schools, save from receiving an annual school report and to prevent the father from making decisions about the children&#8217;s education or health. For the reasons articulated by Children's Guardian, this Court is satisfied that the welfare of both children individually demands the making of a Prohibited Steps Order as sought, limiting the father from exercising his Parental Responsibility. For the avoidance of doubt, the mother will be required to inform the father through an identified third party if the children experience any life-threatening health issues or experience significant illness, notwithstanding the fact that the father&#8217;s consent for any medical decisions for the children is not required. </span><span style="font-size:11pt;color:#000000">The mother is permitted to make all welfare decisions concerning the children in respect of their education, health and welfare without the consent or knowledge of their father. The Court makes a Prohibited Steps Order under s.8 Children Act 1989 prohibited the father from communicating with the children&#8217;s schools. No steps which could be taken by the father in meeting his responsibility for the children of any kind shall be taken by the father without the permission of the Court. </span><span style="font-size:11pt">Further, t</span><span style="font-size:11pt;color:#000000">he mother is permitted to take the children out of the jurisdiction without the consent or knowledge of their father.
