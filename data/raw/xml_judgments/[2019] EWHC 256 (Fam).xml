	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In proceedings as complex as these, I have been guided by the principles found in the 1980 Convention, set out by Baroness Hale and Lord Wilson in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re E (Children)</span><span/><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">(Abduction: Custody Appeal)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2011/27" uk:canonical="[2011] UKSC 27" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] UKSC 27</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2012] 1 AC 144" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] 1 AC 144</ref>. In paragraph 8, they state that the first objective of the 1980 Convention is to deter either parent from taking the law into their own hands and pre-empting the result of any dispute between them about future upbringing of their children. If an abduction had taken place, the second objective was to restore the children as soon as possible to their home country so that any dispute could be determined there. Paragraph 13 makes clear that there is no provision expressly requiring the court hearing a 1980 Convention case to make the best interests of the child its primary consideration. Such proceedings are not proceedings in which the upbringing of the child is in issue but are proceedings about where the child should be when that issue is decided. Nevertheless, both judges stressed that the fact that the best interests of the child are not expressly made a primary consideration in Convention proceedings, does not mean they are not at the forefront of the whole exercise [see paragraph 14]: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;&#8230;The aim of the Convention is as much to deter people from wrongfully abducting children as it is to serve the best interests of the children who have been abducted. But it also aims to serve the best interests of the individual child&#8230;&#8221;</span>. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.03in"> Both judges emphasised the view that the 1980 Convention is designed with the best interests, not only of children generally, but also of the individual child concerned as a primary consideration is reinforced by the provisions of Article 11 of BIIa. Recital 12 to BIIa points out that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;the grounds of jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility&#8230;are shaped in the light of the best interests of the child, in particular on the criterion of proximity&#8221;</span>. The judges concluded in paragraph 18 that both the Convention and BIIa had been devised with the best interests of children generally, and of the individual children involved in such proceedings, as a primary consideration. </p>

The background to the proceedings was complicated and what follows is not intended to be a comprehensive summary. It is moreover not a recital of the facts about which I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities. Given the level of factual dispute, I have confined myself to finding facts which are germane to my decision on habitual residence (as to which, see the relevant section of this judgment). I have studiously avoided finding facts relevant to the Article 13(b) defence, save that I must come to a view about E&#8217;s presentation and needs in order to assess the defence in the way that the authorities signpost. </p>

Both agree that they began to cohabit at the end of that year/in early 2006. Although the father and the mother were cohabiting, the relationship was not sexually exclusive since the father continued to be involved with, if not also cohabiting with, D&#8217;s mother in 2005.

The mother alleges that, only after she started cohabiting with the father, did he tell her that he was a drug dealer. Though he was working as an IT consultant at the time, the mother alleged that the father was cultivating cannabis on a commercial scale with a variety of associates. There is some very limited support for this contention as, on 2 March 2007, the father was convicted under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1971/38" uk:canonical="1971 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Misuse of Drugs Act 1971</ref> of cultivating cannabis and given a twelve-month supervision requirement together with an unpaid work requirement of 180 hours. The father&#8217;s statement dated 26 September 2018 asserted that he cultivated cannabis for his own personal use rather than on a commercial scale. However, in a police report of an incident between the mother and the father on 4 April 2014, the father was recorded boasting to officers about how he made his money through drug dealing and how cannabis was completely non-harmful as a drug. The mother also alleged that the father took cocaine each day and I note that the father&#8217;s statement dated 26 September 2018 contained an admission that the father occasionally used cocaine though he did not consider himself to be addicted to it.  </p>

He was recorded as leaving their flat briefly but returned when he realised that he had forgotten his passport. He could not gain entry so kicked the door open and left once he had retrieved his passport. V told officers that she was not assaulted or threatened at any point during this incident.  Further, on 1 January 2017, the police were called to the home the father and V shared. Both the father and V were reported to have been drinking and had rowed. V was reported to have called the police after the father became verbally aggressive to her, fearing that he might also become physically violent. She refused to provide more details as she did not want to get the father into trouble. The father was contacted by the police and was described as being heavily intoxicated with slurred speech.

The mother was described as upset, crying and clearly in a state of shock but she was adamant she did not want the father to be arrested. The officers found duct tape in the bathroom and the mother eventually admitted that the father had put duct tape over her face and mouth to stop her talking or screaming. She claimed that the father had raped her and strangled her but said she loved him. The father was arrested and denied the mother&#8217;s account. He was not charged as the mother refused to provide further information or support his prosecution.

The minutes of that conference recorded an earlier incident in when D had reported to his paternal aunt that the mother had exposed him to sexualised behaviour. The behaviour complained of is unclear but seems to have been the mother being naked in front of D. I note that a child protection investigation was undertaken by LA2 in 2012 in response to what D had said but concluded there were no concerns and the case was closed on 29 August 2012. A police report dated 15 July 2012 recorded, amongst other matters, the paternal aunt saying that D had told her of the mother pulling down her underwear and showing him her private parts.

It appears that E was no longer thought to need a Child Protection Plan but did require a Child in Need Plan. E was said not to have seen her father since she was about 5 months old. There were no concerns about the mother&#8217;s parenting of E but it was thought the mother remained vulnerable because it had been difficult for her to let her past life with the father go. On 20 April 2015 the mother&#8217;s GP records stated that the mother had been severely physically abused by her ex-partner. She was said to have been hit multiple times to her face. The entry in the records also referred to a previous assault about two years earlier which had left the mother with facial bruising and other injuries. On examination the mother was said to be unable to smile fully or blow her cheeks and there was some drooping of the corners of her mouth. She was referred to a plastic surgeon by the GP. The incident which led to this consultation with the GP does not appear to have been reported to the police or to the local authority. On 28 July 2015 LA2 closed the case as the family were said to have moved abroad. </p>

K said she had told the local authority of her concerns and had tried to persuade the mother to get help from the police. She also said that the father had been violent to her during their relationship. The police went to the father&#8217;s home and he confirmed that he had not seen the mother in over seven months and did not know where she lived. Eventually the mother was spoken to by the police and confirmed the account given by K which had been reported to her. She said she was very scared of the father though she had no contact with him and did not wish to take matters further. There is one further entry concerning D&#8217;s mother, K, in May 2015 which is found in the local authority records.

This followed a complaint by the father to the police in December 2015. The father was also said to have showed police videos he had taken of the mother being very drunk whilst caring for E. The mother was arrested later in February 2016 for being drunk in charge of E after the father visited her home and found her slurring her words.  She fell and the father rang the local authority who then called the police. E was placed in her father&#8217;s care following this incident.  A local authority record dated 9 March 2016 noted that the father had, at some point, told police officers that E and her mother were in Russia and would return at the end of the month. He was later recorded to have said to social workers that he did not know where the mother and E were and to have been verbally abusive and threatening.  On 5 March 2016 the mother called the police after the father allegedly took E&#8217;s passport. She appeared to police to be drunk but she made no claim that she had been assaulted by the father or that she was in fear of him. The police took no further action as it appeared to them that both parents were calling the police for any minor disagreement, the purpose being to log evidence against each other to gain custody of E.

LA2 listed various things the father was expected to do in order to avoid care proceedings, including attending a parenting course and a course aimed at preventing further abusive behaviour towards partners. He was not to permit E to have unsupervised contact with her mother when her mother was drunk.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Whether or not the move to Spain was intended to be a fresh start, by March 2017, the father was making enquiries of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office [&#8220;FCO&#8221;] in order to obtain a passport for E. LA2&#8217;s records indicated that this request was prompted by a domestic incident between the parents and that the father wished to return with E to the UK. He told the FCO in an email that E&#8217;s life was in danger if she was allowed to return to her mother whilst her mother was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">in this state</span>&#8221;. He threatened to take E to Iran if he was prevented from obtaining UK travel documents and said he wanted the UK authorities to be involved so they could be sure E was being looked after. The FCO refused to issue travel documents without the mother&#8217;s consent and made a referral to LA2 which included details of the father&#8217;s address in Spain. Upon learning of the father&#8217;s address, LA2 contacted the Spanish local authority in whose area E resided to alert them to their concerns about the family and to ask for a welfare visit to be made to E. LA2 also made contact with the father who told them he was willing to work with LA2 to keep E safe and sent them some videos of E and her mother. It is not entirely clear what the father sent though, in an email sent to the FCO, LA2 considered that the videos had been highly edited. LA2 informed the FCO that it was really worrying to see the father filming the mother in this state with E present which suggested that neither parent was putting E first. LA2&#8217;s records from 2014 indicate that the father showed the social worker a video in which the mother appeared to be masturbating but it is wholly unclear if the video material sent to LA2 in 2017 was the same as the 2014 video or something entirely different. The FCO informed LA2 on 17 March 2017 that social services and the police in Spain had been asked to undertake a check on the family and the FCO maintained its refusal to issue travel documents as requested by the father. </p>

He said he had separated from the mother and had two children with another partner who was residing in England. Spanish Social Services advised the father to seek custody of E via the court. During the meeting the father said he had to travel to Iran and that the mother would be caring for E whilst he did so. Following the father&#8217;s visit, Spanish Social Services tried to visit the mother and E without success. They were eventually told by a maintenance person that the mother was no longer living at the address provided by the father.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">On 22 November 2017 the father travelled to Iran, planning to return on 25 January 2018. On 19 December 2017 the mother was arrested by Spanish police for an alleged sexual assault on D. The mother is alleged to have forced D to touch her sexually and forced him to have vaginal intercourse with her. She was bailed on 20 December 2017 when a restraining order made by the Spanish court prohibited any contact with D. On 21 December 2017, the Spanish court, of its own motion, made an order for Spanish Social Services to protect E though, somewhat surprisingly, she remained in her mother&#8217;s care. A police report dated 20 December 2017 referred to the conditions in the mother&#8217;s home as being untidy, unhygienic and smelly when she was arrested.  After the father&#8217;s return to Spain, Social Services interviewed both parents following the court&#8217;s referral. The mother denied problems with alcohol and alleged that the father had subjected her to physical and psychological abuse. She said she had not reported this as she feared he would take E to Iran. She said the father was taking drugs and drinking alcohol. She described herself as being financially dependent upon him. The Social Services report does not detail the interview with the father but recorded that contact had been made with his lawyer in December 2017 who said that no application for E&#8217;s custody had yet been made. Social Services later visited the mother&#8217;s home and agreed with the mother what she should do to make it clean, tidy and habitable. The last home visit established that the property had improved in terms of cleanliness.  </p>

His first statement recorded that he saw E about three times after his return to Spain and that the mother kept making excuses to prevent him seeing E. In December 2017 the father began proceedings in the Spanish court with respect to E and that court accepted jurisdiction on 17 January 2018 and listed an inter partes hearing on 17 April 2018. It is noteworthy that the father was, at that point, suggesting that the mother have staying, unsupervised contact with E. On 7 February 2018 the father discovered that the mother and E had moved out of the Spanish property and reported the matter to the Spanish police. It transpired that the mother and E had flown to this jurisdiction on 29 January 2018 to stay with D&#8217;s mother, K.  </p>

That order was refused on 29 December 2017 on the basis of the prosecutor&#8217;s submission that there was no objective situation of risk for the mother.  The mother appealed the court&#8217;s refusal and a chronology of alleged abuse was produced to the court by the mother&#8217;s lawyer on 8 January 2018 which included allegations that the father would beat E when he thought she had behaved badly. On 27 June 2018 the appeal court dismissed the mother&#8217;s appeal and any further investigation by the criminal court into the mother&#8217;s allegations against the father came to an end on 12 July 2018. </p>

These included: frequent changes of address; the mother&#8217;s poor mental health; E&#8217;s poor diet and inability to eat solid food; E&#8217;s exposure to domestic violence; and the mother&#8217;s inability to provide stimulation and behavioural boundaries. The mother herself alleged to social workers that D used to masturbate in front of E. LA1 undertook a child and family assessment which resulted in E being placed on a Child in Need Plan. The mother did not tell the local authority about the criminal proceedings in Spain and it was not until 30 August 2018 that this information was made known to LA1 by the police. As a result, E was removed from her mother&#8217;s care on 31 August 2018 and placed with foster carers. The mother agreed to E being accommodated pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 20</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> but she withdrew her consent for that placement in mid-September 2018.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The mother&#8217;s mental health was thought to be fragile and on 13 September 2018 Baker J (as he then was) ordered that the mother undergo a psychiatric assessment.  The report of Dr Kolkewicz dated 25 October 2018 concluded that the mother was suffering from (a) a mental and behavioural disorder arising from the use of benzodiazepines; (b) posttraumatic stress disorder; and (c) a severe depressive episode without psychotic symptoms. Her symptoms were of a severity that impaired her day to day functioning, including her parenting, to the extent that she was then unable to accompany E to Spain unsupported if an order were to be made for E&#8217;s return. However, the mother&#8217;s legal representatives became concerned about her apparent unwillingness to give them instructions and on 19 October 2018 I approved the instruction of Dr Kolkewicz to assess the mother&#8217;s capacity to litigate these proceedings. Dr Kolkewicz&#8217;s report dated 9 November 2018 concluded that the mother&#8217;s presentation had altered since her last assessment of the mother on 17 October 2018. The mother was now showing a range of psychotic symptoms including persecutory delusional beliefs (a) that the father&#8217;s friends were driving past her house to laugh at and torture her and they were tooting their car horns to signal that they knew everything; (b)  that social workers and lawyers in the case were being bribed by the father; (c) that the father was forging the statements being used in the proceedings; and (d) that the father was using black magic against her and others. Dr Kolkewicz considered these beliefs to be well systematised and to interfere with the mother&#8217;s ability to believe what was said to her by professionals and others involved in the proceedings. Additionally, the mother displayed signs of formal thought disorder which worsened when she felt anxious or under pressure. Dr Kolkewicz concluded that the mother had developed a paranoid psychosis in addition to the mental health problems identified in the earlier report dated 25 October 2018. The symptoms of this disorder meant she lacked the capacity to conduct the proceedings. With appropriate treatment, she had the potential to regain litigation capacity. In consequence of Dr Kolkewicz&#8217;s conclusions, the Official Solicitor was appointed by me to act as the mother&#8217;s litigation friend as there was no other suitable person who could so act.   </p>

Rather later than anticipated, Dr Kolkewicz provided a report dated 17 January 2019 which concluded that the mother&#8217;s symptoms of depression had significantly decreased; the symptoms of thought disorder, though still present, had reduced in intensity; and her persecutory, delusional beliefs were less extensive and held with less intensity. Thus, the mother had regained litigation capacity though this status was described as fragile. Her improvement had been driven by a recent move to another area rather than by taking anti-psychotic medication (which she had not commenced). Her capacity to conduct the proceedings would be strengthened and be less likely to fluctuate if she were to take anti-psychotic medication. In the light of this report, I discharged the Official Solicitor from acting as the mother&#8217;s litigation friend at the start of the substantive hearing on 21 January 2019. </p>

Notwithstanding Article 11.3 of BIIA which provides that proceedings to which BIIA applies must be completed within six weeks except where exceptional circumstances make this impossible, the determination of the father&#8217;s application has been substantially delayed. The first final hearing was due to take place on 14 September 2018 but this was adjourned on 31 August 18 when E was placed in foster care and the mother was arrested. The second final hearing was then listed for 25-26 October 2018. On 13 September 2018 the final hearing was once more adjourned and listed on 5-6 November 2018 in order to allow Dr Kolkewicz to prepare a psychiatric assessment of the mother. On 31 October 2018, when it became clear to the mother&#8217;s legal representatives and to this court that it was necessary to assess her litigation capacity, the final hearing was once more adjourned to 20-23 November 2018. On 13 November 2018, when it became clear that the mother lacked litigation capacity and required the Official Solicitor to act as a litigation friend in the proceedings, I adjourned the final hearing to 21-25 January 2019.

I directed that a report on E&#8217;s reactions to this material should be served upon the parties to the proceedings. This staged approach to the reintroduction of the father&#8217;s contact was influenced by the local authority&#8217;s statement dated 17 October 2018 which described E as a much traumatised child who was smearing faeces in her foster home; crying for no apparent reason; sobbing and saying &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m sorry</span>&#8221;; and suddenly switching from tearful and </p>

A statement from the allocated social worker dated 12 November 2018 indicated that E showed little reaction at the time to seeing the card from her father. However, over the weekend, E smeared faeces once more. Though initially smiling when shown the video of her father and saying that she would like to speak to him on a video and tell him that she loved him, E had subsequently refused to play in the playroom which was where she had viewed her father&#8217;s video and had spoken to her foster carer about concerning behaviour between her parents and concerning behaviour between her and her father. On 21 November 2018 I approved, with the agreement of all the parties, the instruction of a child psychologist, Dr Teper, to provide an initial assessment of E&#8217;s current psychological functioning and her emotional and therapeutic needs together with an assessment of the impact upon her of her experiences to date. In addition, Dr Teper was instructed to advise about the nature and frequency of contact (direct and indirect) between E and her parents and, if it was her view that contact between E and her father should be restarted, how that might best be managed. Dr Teper was directed to provide an interim report for the court hearing listed on 14 December 2018. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">On 14 November 2018 I gave a short judgment on interim contact between E and her parents. In summary, I accepted the view of the local authority and of the Guardian that E presented as a highly vulnerable child whose experienced foster carer described her as the most traumatised child she had cared for. Though she had achieved some stability in the foster home, I considered it to be desirable that there were as few changes as possible to E&#8217;s circumstances. There was evidence that contact between E and her mother had been less beneficial for E than it ought to have been. The mother had often been late for contact and had missed contacts without warning. Her persistent focus on providing food and feeding E was to the detriment of her interaction with E. Latterly, E herself was asking if it was time to go well before the contact with her mother had ended. Though it would be a change, I decided that contact between E and her mother should reduce from three times each week to once a week. Turning to the contact between the father and E, I decided that the best way forward was to invite Dr Teper to report on contact prior to the December hearing. I considered it would be helpful if the father wrote another card which Dr Teper could explore with E and provided another video which could also be used by Dr Teper when she assessed E. The father had provided a toy which might also be a means of assessing whether contact between E and her father could be reintroduced. It was for Dr Teper to use her common sense to decide how to deploy this material in coming to her view about contact with the father. </p>

He relied, in particular, on the facts that (a) neither E nor her mother had retained a home or indeed any ties in this jurisdiction; (b) the FCO in March 2017 had regarded E as resident in Spain; (c) there was no evidence that E had returned to this jurisdiction between July 2016 and January 2018; and (d) E&#8217;s registration with a medical practitioner in Spain and her attendance, albeit brief, at a local nursery school. In contrast, the mother asserted that E was not habitually resident in Spain because she had not integrated into her family and social environment in that country at the date of her removal on 29 January 2018. The mother argued the move to Spain had taken place under duress from the father and that her life and that of E was circumscribed and divorced from the social and family environment in Spain.

To echo the words of Hayden J in paragraph 16 of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B</span>, E&#8217;s habitual residence does not reveal itself instantly. I have exercised considerable caution in evaluating the accounts given by both parents about E&#8217;s time in Spain. I have looked for corroborative material where possible and I have drawn such inferences from the material as I consider are justified. I have also taken into account that the material on which the court might draw to come to its conclusion on this issue varies according to the age of the child concerned. The lives of very small babies might not be capable of much separation/differentiation from those of their primary carers but this changes as a child gets older and goes to school or nursery/playgroup. It is crucial in my judgment to always focus on the child&#8217;s circumstances and not be distracted by those of the adults.  </p>

To that end, there is no evidence that the mother and E retained a property in this jurisdiction to which they could have returned if the move to Spain was but a trial move. I also bear in mind that the involvement of LA2, who had sent both parents a letter threatening care proceedings, may have been an additional incentive for a permanent move abroad. </p>

In November 2017 the school confirmed that it also had a place for E but it recommended that E attend nursery first as she was still eating bottled, pureed food and would thus have been unable to eat with the other children. In consequence, E was enrolled at the Moonlighting Nursery in October/November 2017 for morning sessions from Monday to Friday. Both parents agreed that she did not attend regularly though the reasons for this differed. The mother said E had been unwell though the father said the mother was making excuses because she neglected to take E to nursery. A record of Spanish Social Services involvement with the family dated 7 November 2018 noted that the Moonlighting Nursery confirmed E&#8217;s erratic attendance for health reasons and commented about her eating habits and impulsive behaviour. I do not know whether the nursery was for international children or not but it is beyond doubt that E did not learn to speak Spanish whilst she lived in Spain and attended nursery. This will have inhibited her ability to socialise with other children for play dates outside school though I have no reason to believe that she did not socialise and play with other children during her time at nursery despite her lack of Spanish. Had she not done so, I consider it likely that the nursery would have commented about such unusual behaviour when asked by Spanish Social Services about E. </p>

The father in contrast suggested that E played with other children in the playground and exhibited some pictures in his statement to confirm this. He also exhibited pictures of E at the birthday party of the family&#8217;s housekeeper&#8217;s daughter. It seems to me that E probably had more contact with other children when the father was present. The mother&#8217;s lack of Spanish and her other problems made it, in my view, less likely that she would promote E&#8217;s opportunities for play with children outside the immediate family.  </p>

Though I accept &#8211; in the ways I have outlined &#8211; that the mother was isolated, the reasons for that do not seem to me to be solely attributable to the father. Personality, language problems and the like may all have played their part. Even if I am wrong about that, it is E&#8217;s situation which must be my focus rather than that of her mother. For slightly different reasons, I do not regard as conclusive the FCO&#8217;s view that E was habitually resident in Spain. I must make my own assessment centred on what I can find is known about E&#8217;s life in Spain &#8211; the view of the FCO is of little relevance in that exercise especially as the reasons for its conclusion as to habitual residence are unknown. </p>

It is, as article 13(b) makes clear, the return to the requesting state, rather than the enforced removal from the requested state, which must have this effect. Thus the English courts have sought to avoid placing the child in an intolerable situation by extracting undertakings from the applicant as to the conditions in which the child will live when he returns and by relying on the courts of the requesting state to protect him once he is there. In many cases this will be sufficient. But once again, the fact that this will usually be sufficient to avoid the risk does not mean that it will invariably be so. In Hague Convention cases within the European Union, article 11.4 of the Brussels II Revised Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003) expressly provides that a court cannot refuse to return a child on the basis of article 13(b) &#8220;if it is established that adequate arrangements have been made to secure the protection of the child after his or her return&#8221;. Thus it has to be shown that those arrangements will be effective to secure the protection of the child. With the best will in the world, this will not always be the case. No one intended that an instrument designed to secure the protection of children from the harmful effects of international child abduction should itself be turned into an instrument of harm&#8221;. </span></p>

There was evidence of concerning instability with respect to both parents and the evidence of Dr Teper established the extent of E&#8217;s current psychological and emotional difficulties, such that E could not be moved anywhere without there being a risk of grave harm. Given the difficulties in establishing contact between E and her father, Mr Turner QC accepted that a return to Spain could not take place shortly after the conclusion of the hearing. However, Mr Turner QC submitted that the risks of return to Spain could be ameliorated by delaying E&#8217;s return for a relatively short period of time so that (a) suitable arrangements could be made to safeguard her well-being in the father&#8217;s care and (b) re-introducing direct contact with a view to her being placed in the father&#8217;s care.

The local authority considered E to be a very traumatised child who should remain with her current carer as moving her would be severely detrimental to her emotional and psychological well-being. Smearing remained an issue for E as she had smeared after receiving a card from her father and following Dr Teper&#8217;s first visit when she had been asked some questions about her family.  </p>

Her smearing behaviour was odd in that she herself was entirely clean after she had smeared. E had a notable absence of stranger anxiety which was unusual in a child her age and suggested the possibility of an attachment disorder. She had an unusual attachment style across all environments, being over-familiar in the foster home as well as with complete strangers in the street.  E actively avoided conversation and discussion about both her parents which was unusual in a normally developing child. When she did speak about her parents, all her comments were negative. Dr Teper&#8217;s oral evidence about E&#8217;s dissociation into the persona of Princess Sparkle was striking and persuasive. Princess Sparkle was hypothesised by Dr Teper to be an imaginary safe figure E turned to when upset in order to detach herself from and to avoid emotional pain. Dr Teper told me that this dissociation was a worrying phenomenon in a young child. E was at an extremely fragile and critical time given her disordered attachments and unusual psychological presentation. It was crucial that E had a period of stability and consistency so she could begin to build attachment relationships which were predictable and safe. </p>

This would sever her attachment to her foster carer which was just beginning to develop. E was, in any event, bordering on the age when she would no longer be able to form healthy attachments. Any move would have a negative impact on her selfesteem, interpersonal relationships, anger management, mood and anxiety. She was at high risk of significant emotional and psychological harm given the number of losses she had already experienced in her life. Dr Teper&#8217;s firm recommendation was that E should not be moved from her current placement at this time. If the developing healthy attachment to her foster carer was severed, E would be at serious risk of developing an attachment disorder with potentially adverse consequences for her emotions and her ability to form healthy relationships in future. Any change to E&#8217;s environment should be minimised at this moment in time. The reintroduction of her father must be taken in stages and be subject to review: E was not ready for a reintroduction now which might cause her emotional harm. It was difficult to state with any precision when a reintroduction might be possible. E required regular and urgent play therapy with an experienced play therapist.  </p>

I accept the submission made by Mr Edwards that, without ascribing blame to one parent or the other, there is ample evidence of the utterly chaotic environment to which E was exposed throughout her life by both her parents. As the background summary illustrates, the evidence from police and LA2&#8217;s records support many of the assertions made by each parent against the other. It is inappropriate for me to make findings of fact about the parents&#8217; conduct given the summary nature of 1980 </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The material before me raises a concern that, in February 2014, E was assaulted with a blow to the head by her father when she was a small baby. In March 2014 the mother withdrew that allegation, but that retraction does not wholly allay the court&#8217;s concern about E being a victim of physical harm if placed in her father&#8217;s care. The mother&#8217;s application on appeal to the Spanish domestic abuse court in January 2018 stated that the father would beat E when she behaved badly. Though that court dismissed the mother&#8217;s appeal, I am not wholly persuaded that this is an allegation I can put out of my mind in the assessment of risk or harm to E. Dr Teper&#8217;s report recorded E talking about her father hitting her, for example hitting her head and making it bleed and kicking her in the tummy. Analysis of what E has said about her father&#8217;s behaviour requires a cautious approach because there seems to me to be some aspects of E&#8217;s account which are fantastical or imagined such as her telling Dr Teper that her father had poured boiling water on her legs [there being no medical evidence of injury to her legs occasioned by such an incident]. In addition I bear in mind that, as Mr Turner QC submitted, E may be repeating things which have been said in her presence by the mother. Nevertheless, I have concluded that I cannot exclude a risk of physical harm to her from her father though, of itself and absent other matters pertaining to risk, that risk would not satisfy the grave threshold test required in an Article 13(b) defence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Rather more worrying is the emotional or psychological harm to which E might be exposed if she were returned to Spain. Dr Teper&#8217;s evidence was clear and unequivocal about the profound emotional and psychological harm in both the short and long term which might flow from any move of E from her foster carer at this current time. What is striking about E&#8217;s complex and worrying presentation is that it seems, in my opinion, to have arisen in consequence of the chaotic and unstable environment to which she was exposed by both her parents over a lengthy period. Allied to E&#8217;s obvious fragility is evidence that her father appears to have failed to protect her despite making serious allegations about the mother&#8217;s care. Prior to the move to Spain, the father was fully aware of the mother&#8217;s problem drinking in early 2016. Yet even after E was placed in his care, he permitted the mother to have unsupervised contact and then eventually returned E to her care. Additionally, despite knowing of LA2&#8217;s concerns which were serious enough to invoke the pre-care proceedings protocol, the father moved with the mother and E as a family to Spain. Although in 2017 the father made a variety of allegations to both the FCO and to Spanish Social Services about, variously, E&#8217;s life being in danger in her mother&#8217;s care and the mother being negligent and abandoning E, he then apparently left E in the mother&#8217;s sole care on a number of occasions, for example, in January 2017 when police records place him in this jurisdiction; in April 2017 when he told Social Services in Spain he was due to travel to Iran; and in November 2017 when he left for a visit to Iran (originally planning to return in late January 2018). Notwithstanding the serious matters raised about the mother&#8217;s conduct with D and her neglectful care of E, the father&#8217;s application for custody made in December 2017 suggested that the mother should continue to have overnight staying and unsupervised contact with E. This history raises a very serious question mark about the father&#8217;s ability to protect E which is barely acknowledged in his own statements. It also calls into question both his understanding of E&#8217;s needs at a very fundamental level and his ability to meet those needs were she to be returned to his care. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Turner QC suggested that, were contact to be reintroduced between E and her father, there were some grounds for optimism about the father-daughter relationship given the positive observations in the 2016 assessment by LA2. Additionally, he relied on similar positive comments in an email from the father&#8217;s Spanish lawyer who, on 28 December 2017 when the mother and father attended court in Spain, saw a happy-faced E run to try and embrace her father. The mother forcefully prevented her from doing so and took E to another room. The lawyer observed that E appeared to be upset, and she could be heard mentioning her father for several minutes inside the room. For the following reasons, I do not share Mr Turner QC&#8217;s optimism.  </p>

In March 2015 the father claimed not to have seen E for 7 months and in November of that year the father told the police he lived between two addresses with two different women. In January 2017 a police report placed the father in England and in April 2017 he told Spanish Social Services E would be cared for by her mother whilst he travelled to Iran. In November 2017 he left E with the mother at the start of what was planned to be a two- month trip.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Second, the 2016 risk assessment of the father made little reference to other sources of information about the family such as the police call-outs following incidents of alleged domestic abuse between the father and all of his sexual partners (namely K, the mother and V) or a letter from the mother&#8217;s GP dated 7 March 2016 which reported that the mother was seen in Accident and Emergency on 27 February 2016 &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">after she was assaulted by her partner and punched in the left eye</span>&#8221;. It is clear that, in June 2016, LA2 noted that it had never received reports of domestic abuse between the father and V. The assessment reported what the father told the social worker but there was no interview with the mother to cross-check the father&#8217;s account of family life. Remarkably, the social worker concluded that, though the father had been a risk to women, he was not a risk to E. Mr Edwards on behalf of E&#8217;s Guardian described that conclusion as shocking given what is generally known about the effect of domestic abuse on children. Unsurprisingly, the positive conclusion of this assessment was undermined by subsequent events. For example, although the risk assessment recorded the father agreeing it was not appropriate for him to supervise E&#8217;s contact with her mother, LA2&#8217;s records showed that, by 29 April 2016, the father was permitting the mother to have contact with E in his presence. He admitted permitting the mother to have unsupervised contact with E on 25 April 2016 and on 28 April 2018 the mother told the social worker she was having daily contact with E and the father. I thus approach the contents of LA2&#8217;s 2016 risk assessment with considerable caution. Its investigative and analytic flaws mean that I am wary about the report of a positive relationship between E and her father &#8211; I cannot ascribe to the risk assessment the weight Mr Turner QC invites me to do. Further, the report of the father&#8217;s Spanish lawyer is but a snapshot to which I can attach relatively little weight.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Finally, perhaps the most telling material which inclines me to caution about the fatherdaughter relationship is what E herself has communicated during Dr Teper&#8217;s assessment. Dr Teper was struck by E&#8217;s active avoidance of conversation and discussion about her parents and that when she did speak about them, all her comments were negative. She considered this to be very unusual in a child of E&#8217;s age. I conclude that, given the history, the father-daughter relationship is more complex and far less straightforward than Mr Turner QC suggests.  </p>

That failure to appreciate E&#8217;s needs for safety and security is coupled with the father&#8217;s apparent failure to accept and act upon advice given to him by statutory agencies in both England and Spain charged with child welfare. He appears to have flouted advice from LA2 not to supervise contact between E and her mother having purportedly agreed at the conclusion of the risk assessment that he would not do so. It is clear he knew he should not have done so having received the pre-proceedings letter on 13 April 2016 and having attended the planning meeting on 19 April 2016. Further, in April 2017 the father reported serious concerns about the mother to Spanish Social Services and was advised to issue an application for custody of E. He did not do so until late December </p>

Her statement in these proceedings dated September 2018 makes no mention of these incidents and speaks of only one row with the father which was apparently caused by the mother. The father&#8217;s statements dated 26 September 2018 and January 2019 do not mention these incidents or suggest there were or are any difficulties in his relationship with V.  </p>

I have taken into account that E did not repeat her allegations to a social worker and that the mother had every incentive in December 2017 to attribute sexually inappropriate behaviour to D himself. If returned to her father&#8217;s care, E would be living under the same roof as D. This material represents a further potential risk factor in what is already a fraught family situation though, as I concluded with respect to the risk of physical harm, this risk alone would not satisfy the grave threshold test required by Article 13(b). </p>

The initial questions posed to the Spanish Central Authority were precise and comprehensive. I envisaged that a response would be provided relatively early, following on from which more detailed enquiries, informed by the disclosure of relevant reports about E, might then be made. The initial request was made on 9 October 2018 and I regret that, to date, no response at all has been received from the Spanish Central Authority. Mr Edwards produced a helpful chronology of the chasing efforts made by those who represent E from which it is clear that the Spanish Central Authority had (a) information about the Spanish Social Services previously involved with the family and (b) information about the dates of the relevant final hearings. A further chasing email was sent to ICACU in the week of 21-25 January 2019 without any success. At the hearing in December 2018 I expressed real concern at the lack of response from the Spanish Central Authority and undertook to liaise via the European Judicial Network in an effort to elicit a response to the court&#8217;s enquiries. I did so with the assistance of the International Family Justice office based at the Royal Courts of Justice. That effort was unsuccessful as the matters about which the court sought information were considered matters for the Spanish Central Authority to address rather than the relevant Network Judge in Spain. </p>

In fact, it is very unclear when she might be ready for such a move or if any reintroduction to her father might enable her to be placed in his care with any degree of confidence. None of the protective measures truly address what might be described as the serious concerns about the father&#8217;s parenting of E where, on the evidence before me, the father does not appear to accept his past parenting was at fault and did not previously follow advice given to him by statutory agencies charged with E&#8217;s welfare and protection in both this jurisdiction and Spain.

He invited me to make an order to the effect that E should be returned forthwith to Spain, but the implementation or enforcement of that order should be deferred until further order with liberty to the parties to apply on notice to set-aside or vary. In the meantime, there would be directions as to the reintroduction of contact with the father and for assessments of the type commonly seen in care proceedings. These might include, for example, a parenting assessment of the father and V; a parenting assessment of the mother; assessments of extended family members who might be able to offer E a permanent home and the like. Such an order would reflect the desirability of the return of an abducted child and encourage and require the taking of all steps that could enable such a return without resulting in an Article 13(b) situation. It would, however, contain sufficient conditions and protections to ensure that a return did not take place if, in the event, such a return would result in an Article 13 (b) situation.

Such requirements are to make the return of the children easier and to provide for their necessities, such as a roof over the head, adequate maintenance, etc, until, and only until, the court of habitual residence can become seized of the proceedings brought in that jurisdiction. In Re C (A Minor) (Abduction) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1989] 1 FLR 403" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1989">[1989] 1 FLR 403</ref> Lord Donaldson MR said at p 413: &#8216;Save in an exceptional case, our concern, i.e. the concern of these courts, should be limited to giving the child the maximum possible protection until the courts of the other country, Australia in this case, can resume their normal role in relation to the child.&#8217; This court must be careful not in any way to usurp or be thought to usurp the functions of the court of habitual residence. Equally, the requirements made in this country must not be so elaborate that their implementation might become bogged down in protracted hearings and investigations, as was suggested by Sir Thomas Bingham MR in Re M (A Minor) (Child Abduction) (above at p 397). Undertakings have their place in the arrangements designed to smooth the return of and protect the child for the limited period before the foreign court takes over, but they must not be used by parties to try to clog or fetter, or, in particular, to delay the enforcement of a paramount decision to return the child. It would be helpful if realistic time-limits for the compliance with undertakings were included in the orders to return the child, but in the absence of a specified time, clearly the court would consider a reasonable time and not allow the case to drag on with repeated applications to the court.&#8221; </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The course suggested by Mr Turner QC is an unusual one. It does not fit easily within the ambit of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 5</ref> of CACA which applies to interim measures before the 1980 Convention application is determined. Here, I am invited to determine the father&#8217;s application and make an order for return but to give directions for assessment as if all the options for E&#8217;s future were still available. That strikes me as tautologous. Further, as Mr Turner QC conceded in answer to my enquiries, for meaningful assessments to be undertaken, a court in this jurisdiction might in the near future have to grapple with the serious factual dispute between the parents and make findings of fact about it, in order to provide an agreed platform for assessments by experts or other professionals. That course would undermine the very purpose of the 1980 Convention supplemented by the BIIa which, by Article 16, constrains the judicial authorities of the contracting state to which the child has been removed/retained from deciding on the merits of the rights of custody until it has been determined by those authorities that the child is not to be returned under the Convention. The result contended for by Mr Turner QC would, in my judgment, stretch <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 5</ref> to breaking point.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">I have also considered whether Mr Turner&#8217;s suggested order might fall more easily within the ambit of the authorities on deferral or stay of return orders. It does not. Those authorities make clear the limited purpose for which deferral or stay might be appropriate namely, to await the outcome of either an application to or a determination by the courts of the state of habitual residence. In any event, the potentially indefinite or uncertain timescales envisaged by Mr Turner&#8217; QC&#8217;s order goes well beyond the timescales envisaged in those authorities or the parameters recommended by ButlerSloss LJ in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re M (Abduction: Undertakings)</span> [see above]. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">For the above reasons, Mr Turner QC&#8217;s suggested order fails to commend itself to me. Though, as provided for by such an order, there would be an advantage to E remaining in the current placement, her future wellbeing would be very much up in the air notwithstanding the making of a return order to Spain. If the aim of the proposed order is to permit a full understanding of E&#8217;s needs and an exploration of E&#8217;s welfare in a wide sense alongside efforts to reintroduce contact to her father, those aspirations are undermined by the making of a return order. Assessments would be undertaken on the basis that a return order has been made rather than on the basis of the wide flexibility Mr Turner QC suggested in submissions might be possible. I cannot see the justification for such compromised assessments and observe that the outcome of any such assessments would not bind a court in Spain if E was eventually returned there. The proposed order seems to me to be crafted from the perspective of the father rather than from that of a highly vulnerable child who requires a decision in these proceedings to be made as soon as possible. Put simply, I find the Article 13(b) defence made out which militates against a return order to Spain either immediately or at some uncertain point in the future. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Mr Turner QC drew my attention to a decision by the Court of Appeal in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re W</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2018/664" uk:canonical="[2018] EWCA Civ 664" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] EWCA Civ 664</ref> where that court directed that the provision in a return order providing for the return of children to the USA without their mother should be discharged unless the mother obtained a visa allowing her to enter the USA. He contended that this condition precedent &#8211; the obtaining by the mother of a visa to the USA &#8211; might never be fulfilled and suggested that this was directly analogous to the position in this case where an order for return might never come to pass if, for example, the reintroduction of E to her father proved to be damaging to her wellbeing. In my view, that case was factually very different from this one. The order sanctioned by the Court of Appeal in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re W</span> contained only one condition precedent to a return whereas Mr Turner QC&#8217;s proposed order is likely to contain a number of precedent conditions aimed at addressing risk issues, some or all of which might never be fulfilled. In my judgment, that very fact requires the court to scrutinise most carefully in this case whether it should make a return order in circumstances where risk issues remain so clearly at large.  How might a court in future when seised of an application on E&#8217;s behalf to set aside the return order determine which condition precedent applied or did not? Could the order for return be set aside if the father were having direct contact but was otherwise thought to be an unsuitable carer? Suppose E spoke of very serious physical or sexual abuse involving either her father or D which was not accepted? I doubt that drafting the order proposed would deal with such eventualities which may not be fanciful given the history I have summarised. I fear precisely that about which Butler-Sloss LJ warned in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re M (Abduction: Undertakings)</span> [see above], namely protracted investigations and hearings arising from an over-elaborate order implementing a return.  For all these reasons, I do not find the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re W</span> order a helpful analogy in this particular case.  </p>
