	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">Once again the court is being asked to deal with the legal consequences for two very young children following a foreign surrogacy arrangement. Since their birth they have been cared for by either, or both, the commissioning parents. Yet, subject to the outcome of this application, their legal parents are the surrogate mother and her husband, who live in India and have had no involvement with the children since their birth.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">A striking feature of this case is the lack of knowledge the applicants had about the need for a parental order to secure their legal position in this jurisdiction in relation to children born as a result of the surrogacy arrangement. This observation is not meant as any criticism of the applicants. They had diligently researched the position on the internet prior to entering into the surrogacy agreement with the clinic in India. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">B told me in evidence he had drawn up a list of things that needed to be done and ticked them off as he did them. Despite his research he was not aware of the need for a parental order. Their names were on the Indian birth certificates and he understood that was sufficient to secure their status here in relation to the children. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">A told me she had nagging doubts about whether the Indian birth certificates was enough. Upon her return here she was very open with all professionals who came into contact with the family (for example, general practitioner and health visitor) about the circumstances of the children&#8217;s birth. No-one suggested to her the need for a parental order. It was only when it was raised by a family support worker in the summer of 2014 that she conducted further internet research and contacted a specialist solicitor, Natalie Gamble. She was advised then that she was too late to make a parental order application, as the six month period had expired. At that time, that was in accordance with the reported cases. The decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Re X (ibid)</span> published in October 2014 permitted an application to proceed even though it was made after the expiry of six months. The applicants made their application in November.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">I recognise that when the applicants conducted their initial research in 2008 there may have been limited information available on the internet. That was probably still the position in 2011, when they entered into the surrogacy arrangement. In their submissions, the advocates for the parties suggested that there remains some confusion amongst the general public about the need for a parental order.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">The legal position is clear. Unless a parental order is made the legal mother of any child born following a surrogacy arrangement entered into here or abroad is the surrogate mother who gives birth to the child, she will also have parental responsibility (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/33" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 33</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref>). If the surrogate mother is married her husband is the legal father of the child, even though he may have no biological relationship with the child (s35<span style="font-weight:bold"/><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref>)<span style="font-style:italic">.</span> If the surrogate mother has a civil partner that partner will be the child&#8217;s legal parent (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/42" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 42</ref> and 44 <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref>).<span style="font-style:italic"/>If the surrogate mother is unmarried, does not have a civil partner, and the commissioning father has a biological connection with the child he is the legal father, but he may not have parental responsibility. That usually depends on whether his name is on the birth certificate or he and the child&#8217;s mother have made an agreement for him to have parental responsibility for the child.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">A parental order, if made, results in the commissioning parents becoming the child&#8217;s legal parents and extinguishes the surrogate mother&#8217;s status as the child&#8217;s legal mother, together with her husband and any other legal parent. Importantly, such an order gives the commissioning parents parental responsibility.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">Without a parental order the commissioning parents will not be the legal parents of the child they have probably cared for since birth, and whom the child regards as their de facto parents. Whilst this in itself may not affect their ability to provide day to day care for the child, it may have long term consequences, for example affecting inheritance rights. If there are no other orders in place the commissioning parents may not have parental responsibility, which may affect their ability to take certain steps on behalf of the child (for example, apply for a passport).</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">This court, which exercises jurisdiction on matters relating to children&#8217;s welfare, is anxious to ensure the legal consequences of surrogacy arrangements are properly understood by the commissioning parents. I am not concerned about the children who are the subject of parental order applications, but am more concerned about those who are not. There is a real risk that those who care for children born as a result of these arrangements may be inadvertently sleepwalking into an uncertain legal future for their much wanted child. That uncertainty is very likely to be detrimental to that child's long term welfare. I sincerely hope publication of this judgment will assist people who may be in that situation.</p>

Many applicants do not have legal representation, some obtain initial legal advice and then represent themselves. After issuing the application the court will appoint a Parental Order Reporter who will visit the applicants and the child and make his or her own enquiries and assessment about the criteria under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 54</ref> and the welfare considerations the court has to consider in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref>. In the majority of cases there will be a first directions hearing, when the court will raise with the applicants any further information or evidence that is required to satisfy the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 54</ref> criteria, direct the applicants to file a statement addressing those matters and for the Parental Order Reporter to file a report. This is with the intention of the second hearing being the final hearing, when the court will expect to be in a position to make a parental order.</p>

Both parties have the benefit of experienced legal representation, all of whom acted pro bono. No doubt the applicants share the courts appreciation of the expertise that has been available. It would have been extremely difficult for them to navigate the complex issues in this case without that assistance. Both Mr Bennett and Dr Jackson represented them at the fact finding hearing pro bono. Mr Rogerson, A&#8217;s solicitor, has done all he can, using his considerable expertise in this area, to ensure all the relevant information is before the court. Ms Logan has represented Mrs Odze with her customary skill and the report provided by Ms Odze is a detailed and perceptive analysis of the issues in the case.</p>

He would like the girls to stay overnight, but recognises his accommodation is not suitable. By agreement between the applicants he took the girls to stay in a hotel in May. The applicants have been able to agree a framework of future contact, supported by mediation and attendance at a Separated Parents Information Programme (SPIP).

The agreement confirms that the agreement is given unconditionally and with full understanding of what is involved.

A said when she got married her mother gave her a sari which was a traditional gift in the expectation she would wear it when she had children.

Although, as I have pointed out, Theis J founded her analysis on Article 8, whilst the Supreme Court's analysis was based on Article 6, the reasoning in both cases is fundamentally the same: the statute must be 'read down' in such a way as to ensure that the "essence" of the protected right is not impaired and that what is being protected are rights that are "practical and effective" and not "theoretical and illusory." </span><br/><br/><span style="font-style:italic">59.&#160;I agree entirely with Theis J's powerful and compelling reasoning. Her focus was on <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 54(4)</ref>(a), but in my judgment her reasoning applies mutatis mutandis with equal force to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 54(3)</ref>. </span><br/><br/><span style="font-style:italic">60.&#160;I add two things. First, I draw attention to the fact that Theis J was prepared to read down &#8211; and in my judgment correctly prepared to read down &#8211; <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 54(4)</ref>(a) to enable her to make a parental order after one of the commissioning parents had died notwithstanding that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 54(4)</ref>(a), in contrast it may be noted to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 54(3)</ref>, seemingly requires the relevant condition to be satisfied both "at the time of the application" and "at the time of &#8230; the making of the order." If that degree of 'reading down' is permissible in relation to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 54(4)</ref>(a) &#8211; and Theis J held that it was, and I respectfully agree &#8211; then the lesser degree of 'reading down' required in relation to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 54(3)</ref> is surely a fortiori.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-style:italic">61.&#160;The other point is this. Theis J focused on that aspect of Article 8 which protects "family life", but Article 8 also protects "private life", and 'identity', on which she appropriately laid stress, is an important aspect of "private life". So, any application for a parental order implicates both the child's right to "family life" and also the child's right to "private life". The distinction does not matter in the circumstances of the present case (see further below) but I make the point because it is, I suppose, possible to conceive of a case where, on the facts, it might be more difficult or even impossible to demonstrate the existence of "family life."&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><br/><br/><span style="font-style:italic">62.&#160;Having got thus far in the analysis, the remaining question is whether in the present case the commissioning parents are to be allowed to pursue an application made some two years and two months after X was born. In my judgment, they are.</span></p>

The commissioning parents, who have been the de facto, psychological, intentional, and in the case of B the biological, parent would be denied the status of legal parent. The surrogate mother and her husband would remain the legal parents to the children, even though they have stated they do not want to raise the children. The children would remain in a legal vacuum, with the people who provide for all their needs and who intended to be their parents in the fullest sense, not being able to secure that status.  No one would suffer any detriment should the parental order be granted. There are clear and obvious benefits to the applicants and the children if the order was made.</p>

Section 3 enables language to be interpreted restrictively or expansively. But section 3 goes further than this. It is also apt to require a court to read in words which change the meaning of the enacted legislation, so as to make it Convention-compliant. In other words, the intention of Parliament in enacting section 3 was that, to an extent bounded only by what is 'possible', a court can modify the meaning, and hence the effect, of primary and secondary legislation.&#8221;</span></p>

As the President rightly points out at paragraph 61 Article 8 not only protects &#8216;family life&#8217; but also &#8216;private life&#8217; and &#8216;identity&#8217;. I am satisfied, relying on <span style="font-style:italic">Kroon</span> that family life is established here, despite the fact the applicants live in separate homes. In addition the identity of the children is also an important consideration.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">First, the issue of domicile. It is clear from the evidence both applicants have lived in this jurisdiction most of their lives. They were born as British Citizens, came here as very young children and have not lived anywhere else. Every aspect of their lives are based here, they have never returned to their country of birth, neither have their respective families. They have each said they have no intention of living anywhere else. It is clear they have both discharged the evidential burden on them of proving that this is their domicile of choice.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">Second, the issue of consent. The documents signed by the surrogate mother and her husband on 26 May 2015 clearly signify that they have fully understood the effect of a parental order in extinguishing their parental rights and they have signed the consent freely, unconditionally and with full understanding. The consent was translated and notarised. I am satisfied that any payment made to them by the Clinic was after they gave their consent and there is no evidence to indicate that the giving of the consent was conditional on any payment being made. It is reasonable to infer from the information the court has that despite the passage of time they were willing to attend the clinic to sign the documents and are likely to have incurred some limited expense in making the journey to the Clinic.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">Thirdly the question of payments. The court is somewhat hampered by the lack of detail. I can only re-iterate the call made by this court and others (notably Baker J in <span style="font-style:italic">D and L <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2012/2631" uk:canonical="[2012] EWHC 2631 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWHC 2631 (Fam)</ref> </span>at para 35<span style="font-style:italic">)</span> of the need for commissioning parents to, at the very least, meet the surrogate mother or establish an effective line of communication and have some understanding of the financial arrangement between her and the Clinic. Although the court lacks the detail it has in other cases I am satisfied that any payments other than for expenses reasonably incurred should be authorised.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">The court can infer that the sums paid were not disproportionate to reasonable expenses. There is reference in the papers to the surrogate&#8217;s husband working, although no details are given of the level of his income. The total sum paid is not significantly different than the sums authorised by Baker J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re D and L (ibid).</span> In this case the sums were higher as the applicants paid for an additional surrogate and the successful surrogate was carrying twins. A&#8217;s evidence about the way she observed the conditions at the Clinic that supported the surrogate mother after the birth, her observations of the surrogate when she met her and the way the surrogate dealt with her gifts all support the surrogate having freely entered into this arrangement.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">Although Mrs Odze raises concern in her report about the emotional harm the children have suffered she considers that whilst their physical and educational needs are met their emotional needs are not.

As set out at the start of this judgment a plan has been put in place to assist the parties to help restore effective communication between them, particularly on issues concerning the children. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">In her report Mrs Odze does not advocate the court should not make a parental order. She carefully considers the other orders the court could make, a child arrangements order, special guardianship order or an adoption order. In my judgment she rightly rejects each of those orders as not meeting the welfare needs of the children. A child arrangements order or special guardianship order would only last until the children&#8217;s majority and the surrogate mother and her husband would remain the legal parents. Whilst she recognises an adoption order would sever the legal ties with the surrogate mother and her husband it is not what she has termed the &#8216;bespoke&#8217; order for children born through surrogacy, particularly where, as here, there is already a biological connection between the children and one of the applicants.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in">I agree with Mrs Odze. Even though, unusually in my experience, the court shares her concern about the emotional needs of the children being met by the applicants that does not mean their lifelong welfare needs will not be met by a parental order being made. I consider it is very likely that once the uncertainties of these proceedings concerning the parental order are concluded, that is going to help the applicants re-focus their attention on the children. Having observed the parties during both substantive hearings it is clear the uncertainty surrounding their legal position regarding the children has been stressful for them both, particularly A.</p>
