Both doctors have emphasised that there is a real risk, indeed a likelihood, that this baby will grow up without a mother. C&#8217;s partner (F) has never been tested for HIV and has refused to do so. The couple have disclosed that they have been having unprotected sexual intercourse for more than 12 years. I incorporate this very private fact into this judgment because it is important to understand that the medical consensus establishes that it is very likely that F will, most likely, be HIV positive himself. Inevitably, he has not been receiving any treatment and is accordingly exposed to medical complications which are avoidable. </span></p>

As Dr Herbert has explained to me, HIV is a viral infection which can be transmitted from a mother to a child during pregnancy. It passes from the mother to the child through the blood flow via the umbilical cord and through the mixing of blood and genital fluids during birth. The overall risk from older studies estimates the risk during (i) pregnancy (ii) delivery and (iii) post-natal period to be between 15-45%. In 2023, these risks are mitigated by a number of interventions which have been repeatedly shown to reduce the risk of transmission. If treatment is administered during these stages, the estimated rate of mother to child transmission of HIV is reduced to 1-2/1000 or 0.1-0.2%.</span></p>

HIV is monitored by blood tests looking at the immune system as measured by a CD4 count, and the amount of virus in the blood (the HIV viral load). When people are not on treatment for a long time, or have never been on treatment, the virus level can be anywhere from 20,000 to over 1 million, and usually will increase over time without treatment as the immune system becomes weakened and is unable to manage the infection to keep the virus under control.</span></p>

I am not a paediatrician but AMC was diagnosed aged 11 and that she has had very little treatment over the years. Notwithstanding her viral load level has remained low (9000-13200) during her time with us. She has therefore remained well but this level of virus poses a significant risk of transmission to the baby. Any viral load greater than 400 poses a risk to the baby. For that reason, ordinarily treatment is provided to get the viral load in the mother to an undetectable (or at least &lt;400 copies/ml) level as soon as possible before delivery.&#8221;</span></p>

Dr Herbert has explained that the viral load level in the mother, at 36 weeks, determines the management of the delivery of the baby. If the level is undetectable, a normal vaginal delivery can take place. If the level is detectable but between 50-399 copies/ml, a c-section is recommended. Above 400 copies/ml, a c-section delivery is strongly recommended and advised. This mode of delivery provides the lowest risk of HIV transmission.</span></p>

The greater the level of viral load in the mother, the greater the number of medications required for the child and the longer the period they are required for in order to decrease the risk of transmission to the child and to decrease the risk of the virus establishing itself in the child if it has been transmitted. If C had taken her medication through pregnancy and had an undetectable virus level at 36 weeks the child would have only needed to be given two weeks of a single antiretroviral drug. But because her virus level is high and she has not taken the antiretroviral treatment, the child will have to undergo a course of three separate drugs for four weeks. This will provide the child with the best chance of preventing the virus taking hold.</span></p>

Given the high viral load in the mother, there is a significant risk that some virus will be present in her baby. The level of infection may not be so great as to generate a lifelong infection.

However, the Article 8 and 6 rights engaged are not absolute rights and require to be balanced against other competing rights and interests. The ECHR has recognised that there will be, circumstances where parental involvement must yield to alternative rights, particularly where the interests of children are engaged. Without notice applications, in this sphere, have been endorsed as compatible with the Convention in a number of cases, see: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Haase v Germany <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] 2 FLR 39" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] 2 FLR 39</ref>; Venema v The Netherlands <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 1 FLR 552" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 1 FLR 552</ref></span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">. Many of the cases arise in the context of emergency protection orders where the ECHR has emphasised that it is for the state to establish that a careful assessment of the impact of the proposed measure on the parents and child was carried out, prior to the implementation of the plan, as well as careful consideration of the possible alternatives. These principles of proportionality resonate throughout the whole of the European jurisprudence. </span></p>

In particular, she had agreed to take retroviral medication at the latter stage of her pregnancy. Dr Herbert told me, in oral evidence, that the prescribed dosage of the retroviral has been increased for C, in effect, using her as a conduit to medicate her baby prophylactically. HIV passes from the mother to the child through the blood flow, via the umbilical cord and particularly, in consequence of the mixing of blood and genital fluids during birth. Thus, as I understand it, the birth process becomes a high point of risk of infection for the baby. There is very considerable doubt as to whether C has been taking the retroviral medication in the run up to the birth. The preponderant evidence indicates that is unlikely, but it is sufficient for me simply to conclude that the position is, as yet, unknown. </span></p>

The objective is effectively to provide a strong defence for the baby from infection by the HIV virus and to prevent it, if it is present, from becoming an established infection. The longer the virus is in the baby&#8217;s body and permitted to circulate, the greater the risk of the infection becoming established. Where a mother has not taken retroviral medication in pregnancy, there is a greater risk that the foetus might already have become infected. Thus, the immediacy of intervention is key. The baby will be given an antibody test at birth followed by a viral load test and a proviral DNA test (to see whether the baby was infected earlier in pregnancy). I am told that there is a real possibility that the baby might achieve HIV negativity, albeit, that it can take up to two years for the HIV antibody test to become negative in a truly HIV negative infant. </span></p>

Though the mother has repeatedly attended hospital during the course of her pregnancy, seemingly prepared to comply with medication, ultimately, she has declined to do so and has left the hospital. Her anxiety surrounding her treatment may lie in the circumstances of her infection. I was told that C knew a number of women with HIV, some of whom she believes have given birth to healthy children, without any retroviral medication for mother or baby. I enquired how she came to know such a seemingly wide group of HIV positive individuals. I was told by Dr Herbert that she was part of a cohort of children who had been infected during a programme of routine childhood vaccinations with needles that must have been contaminated with HIV. This information was not included in the case papers. To my mind, it is not difficult to see how such an experience, which I should record did not occur in the United Kingdom, might generate a pervasive distrust of medical advice. C reports having felt very sick when she took the retroviral medication in the past. Dr Herbert agreed that nausea was a recognised side effect but told me that it could be corrected by anti-sickness medicine. C has steadfastly refused that medicine. She has also indicated recently that if her baby were to be sick under this medical regime then she might withdraw her consent to the treatment. As Dr Herbert noted, young babies are often sick or posseting and there is a real risk that C might misinterpret this risk. Dr Guna, who is able to communicate with C in her first language, was particularly concerned about this risk. Indeed, she considered it to be one of her biggest concerns. C told her expressly and in a conversation which is very recent, that if her baby vomited, she would most likely stop the baby from receiving further medication as she </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8220;knows how bad it was for her&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">. </span></p>

It is obvious, given the nature of the treatment involved and the importance of timing, that it can only be achieved by prospective declaration. This is not an application that has been made lightly and a great deal of work has been done with the mother, in what I find to be a constructive and sensitive way, to achieve her co-operation. That co-operation may ultimately be forthcoming but it is certainly not possible to be confident that it will. On the baby&#8217;s birth, it is, to my mind, redundant of contrary argument that it will be the baby&#8217;s best interest to receive the medication offering the best chance of avoiding infection. </span></p>

She initially submitted that the &#8216;exceptional&#8217; circumstances required to justify a declaration of this kind being made, in the absence of C, were not met in this case. Recognising that were the declaration not to be made, there would be inevitable delay in the medication of the baby at the most crucial time, Miss Gollop contended that the countervailing harm might not be as significant as the Court was contemplating. Many people, she said, now live full and active lives whilst HIV positive and achieve a long-life span. In fact, for children who have contracted and are living with HIV, that data is inevitably not yet available. However, the general point is broadly valid. HIV is, happily, not the death sentence it once was. But, the fact that people confront an HIV diagnosis with courage and phlegmatism does not, to my mind, detract from its life altering impact. It continues, as I was reminded, to carry very great stigma in all areas of the world. It requires lifelong medication. It has a real and enduring impact on the most intimate aspects of people&#8217;s lives. It carries a psychological burden, which is not easy to bear. An infected child will come gradually to know of their infection but in early adolescence they will confront the stark realities of the virus at a time of their life when they will be ill-equipped. C herself, I have been told, jealously guards the privacy of her HIV status. Moreover, whilst her attitude to medication is, objectively, misconceived, I am not left in any doubt that her most profound wish would be for her baby to be HIV negative. I have a strong sense that this is a very much wanted baby, by both prospective parents. </span></p>

The doctors and medical team are entirely right to identify the immediate medical treatment as an imperative which establishes a secure basis for what remains an exceptional declaration.</span></p>
