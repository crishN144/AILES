As appears from the second reference the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Evans</span> case went to the European Court of Human Rights, Grand Chamber. </p>

	<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Blood</span> case involved the retrieval, storage and export of gametes.  The retrieval was carried out at a time when Mr Blood was in a coma.  Following the decision of the Court of Appeal, in which it was held that the HFEA should reconsider its earlier refusal to do so, the HFEA gave permission for the export of the gametes.  Mrs Blood now has a second child as a result of her insemination with those gametes abroad. </p>

	<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Evans</span> case involved a different situation.  Ms Evans was diagnosed with a precancerous condition of her ovaries and was offered IVF treatment prior to their removal.  She and her partner signed the relevant forms which also indicated that in accordance with the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 (the 1990 Act) either of them could withdraw consent at any time before the embryos were implanted.  The couple attended a clinic and had treatment resulting in 6 embryos being stored.  Later the couple&#8217;s relationship ended and the man withdrew his consent to the embryos being implanted.  This had the result that Ms Evans lost the chance of having a child to whom she would be genetically related.  It was held that the embryos could not be implanted.  The Grand Chamber was unanimous in concluding that there had been no violation of Article 2 and held by a majority (13 / 4) that there had been no violation of Article 8, or Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8. </p>

The central issue was whether his withdrawal of consent was decisive.  It was held that it was. </p>

      <blockContainer>

	<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Whereas the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Blood</span> case involved a situation in which the man did not have the capacity at the relevant time to give his consent to storage or use of his sperm and the result was that his sperm was retrieved, and stored in the UK and successfully used abroad after the death of Mr Blood. </p>

	<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">A central issue in the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Blood</span> case was the exercise by the HFEA of a power conferred on it in connection with the export (and import) of gametes or embryos.  That discretionary power enables the HFEA to grant a direction in an individual case permitting the export of sperm, and modifying, if appropriate, for the purposes of </p>
      </blockContainer>
      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">export the provisions of the 1990 Act that set in mandatory terms licence conditions (including the consent provisions). By contrast, the HFEA has no power under the 1990 Act to make any direction modifying those licence provisions for the purposes of storage of gametes in connection with their use in the UK.</p>
      <blockContainer>
	<num>9.</num>
	<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">This power also plays a central part in the issue in this case.  In my view issues as to its width as a matter of statutory construction, and limits on its exercise by reference to the underlying purposes of the power and of the 1990 Act are relevant.  There are distinctions between a power that cannot be, or never will be, exercised to achieve a certain end, and one that will only rarely, if ever, be so exercised.  </p>

      <blockContainer>
	<num>10.</num>
	<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Retrieval without, shortly thereafter, use or storage in appropriate conditions renders the retrieved sperm useless.  So in many (if not all) cases involving export for the discretionary power to permit export and a change in licence conditions to have any practical effect the sperm must be preserved and stored.</p>
      </blockContainer>
      <blockContainer>
	<num>11.</num>
	<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Immediate use of retrieved sperm would, as I understand it, be outside the licensing regime of the 1990 Act. So the HFEA is not directly concerned with the lawfulness of retrieval. </p>

	<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Blood</span> case the sperm had been preserved as a result of arrangements made in an unexplored legal situation where the Court of Appeal expressed the view that humanity dictated that the sperm was taken and preserved first and legal argument followed. </p>
      </blockContainer>
      <blockContainer>
	<num>13.</num>
	<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In this case the sperm has been taken and preserved as a result of interim relief granted by the Court, initially out of hours but later continued.  This has resulted in the existence of gametes retrieved from a dead man which could be used and which in practice can be the subject of a discretionary decision of the HFEA permitting export, so long as they continue to be stored pending that decision. </p>
      </blockContainer>
      <blockContainer>
	<num>14.</num>
	<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">To my mind a problem in this case arises from the fact that before me the parties have not addressed in any detail how that sperm is to be preserved pending that discretionary decision if the Claimant fails to obtain the declarations she seeks.  </p>

His death was completely unexpected and very understandably L and her husband did not have relevant discussions as to what should happen if he died when in hospital.  His death was inevitably a great shock to L and I accept that the steps that she took in its immediate aftermath were motivated by the wishes of herself and her husband to have another child, her wish to have another child who by blood would be a full sibling to her existing child and time to think about whether she should pursue that course.  To do this, urgent steps had to be taken to retrieve and preserve H&#8217;s gametes.  To this end an out of hours application was made to Macur J for declaratory relief on 26 June 2007.  The hospital was notified of that application.  The first Defendant (the HFEA) was not notified. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The letter from the solicitors acting for the HFEA and the Human Tissue Authority pointed out that they did not believe that this was a matter that concerned the Human Tissue Authority because <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/30/section/53/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 53(1)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/30" uk:canonical="2004 c. 30" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Tissue Act 2004</ref> has the effect that gametes are outside the regulatory remit of the Human Tissue Authority.  They then pointed out that the storage and subsequent use (but not retrieval) of gametes is subject to the licensing requirements of the 1990 Act, and that s. 4 provides that the storage and subsequent use of gametes can only be carried out pursuant to a licence issued by the HFEA, and subject to the statutory conditions contained in ss. 12 to 14 of the 1990 Act, in particular s. 12(c), which provides that a condition of every licence granted under the 1990 Act is that the provisions of Schedule 3 are complied with.  Schedule 3 contains the requirements for effective consent from the provider of gametes for the storage and subsequent use of gametes.  They went on to say that they identified the relevant statutory provisions in an effort to assist, and that it was by no means clear that the HFEA would wish to intervene in these proceedings and that in their view the court had to determine whether the above requirements of the 1990 Act were satisfied and that was not a determination about which the HFEA has any discretion.  They also pointed out that the HFEA were not aware of the facts giving rise to the retrieval and storage of the gametes and asked that any directions made provided liberty to the HFEA to intervene if it thought it appropriate to do so.  </p>

This has had the result that I express a number of preliminary views and reach my decision on one of the central points on the basis on which it was argued before me, namely that if I refuse the Claimant the relief she seeks H&#8217;s sperm will be preserved pending a decision on the HFEA on export and so that decision will not be rendered redundant by the destruction of the sperm.  </p>

In both cases the point can be made that the ethical issues involved are complex and difficult and there is inevitably uncertainty as to how a man, who wanted another child with his wife, would react to the question whether he would support and agree to his wife using his sperm after his death, or to her retrieving of his sperm when he could not consent to this and to her using it after his death.   </p>

These proposed amendments apply to gametes that are lawfully taken and therefore proceed on the basis that this can be done.  They provide for storage thereafter without effective consent from the child or patient.  They provide that gametes are not to be so stored after the death of the child or patient.

I am also of the preliminary view that it has no such powers to declare storage that does not comply with the terms of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1990 Act</ref> lawful.

Generally it seems to me that the cases at common law have not addressed this point and those dealing with property in a body, or parts of a body, are not directed to the issue of removal of parts of a body, or the lawfulness of the relevant process to a body that can render it the subject of property. Rather they deal with the position after authorised or unauthorised removal.

An approach by reference to the interests and rights of a surviving spouse including those under the Convention and the Treaty, and thus one to enable that person to make use of the gametes of another person, would also, so far as I am aware, be a novelty.

These are jointly referred to as the &#8220;EU Tissue and Cells Directives&#8221; (&#8216;EUTCD&#8217;).  Directive 2004/23/EC of 31 March 2004 (&#8216;the First Directive&#8217;) lays down common safety and quality standards for the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells.  Article 6 of the First Directive establishes a system of mandatory accreditation or licensing for establishments within Member States carrying out any of these activities on human tissue or cells intended for human application (including clinics providing assisted conception).  </p>
