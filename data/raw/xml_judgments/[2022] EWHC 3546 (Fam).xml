	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A mother of two young boys died in Portugal.  She was called Edite.  She is also referred to in the papers as Carla, but for the purposes of this judgment I will call her Edite.  In August 2020, Edite was diagnosed with terminal colon cancer.  From the time of her cancer diagnosis until her death, the boys lived with Edite&#8217;s mother, their grandmother, in Portugal.  The grandmother was also looking after Edite while this was happening.  The father of the boys was living in England and did not return to Portugal, save for one trip in October 2020, when he visited Portugal for about a week or so.  When Edite died on 27 June 2021, he returned to Portugal on 30 June.  He stayed there for approximately three weeks and then took the children with him to England.  That was on 21 July 2021 and thus about a month after Edite&#8217;s death.  The legitimacy of his removal of the children is what this case is about.</p>

Nobody can doubt that.  The grandmother wants the boys back in Portugal.  She says that this was her daughter&#8217;s dying wish: that she should continue to bring up the children with her in Portugal.  Their father wants them to stay in England, where they have made a home together.</p>

They are settled living with their father and have attended school in [a northern city].  They like it there and like living in the United Kingdom.  It must be said that Mr F deserves a great deal of credit.  It appears that the boys are doing well at school and the Cafcass officer in the case, Ms Gwynne, has said that that is unlikely to have been the case if there had been issues at home.  So, unquestionably, since the boys have come to this country, Mr F has looked after them well.  There can be a little doubt about that, and I proceed on that basis.</p>

I emphasised to the children that there were rules like there were rules at school.  This was not a time to get evidence, but was the chance for the boys to meet the person who was going to make such an important decision in their lives and for them to ask about the procedure.  They did that.  They are boisterous boys, if I can put it that way, full of life and energy.  I told the children at the end of our meeting that I would do everything I could to tell them as soon as possible my decision about whether they would stay in England or return to Portugal.  If at all possible, by the next Thursday.  That was going to be Thursday 23 June 2022 - today.  With the outstanding assistance of counsel and the Clerk of the Rules (listing office), I have kept my promise to the boys.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is submitted that Ms C has rights of custody under Portuguese law.  She has been caring for the children since August 2020 before the father removed them secretly without the boys even saying goodbye to her.  Immediately before the boys were removed, they were habitually resident in Portugal where they had lived.  She was exercising rights of custody.  She did not consent to the removal.  In fact, the opposite.  She wanted the children to remain with her so she could bring them up in Portugal as was her daughter&#8217;s last wish.  The Portuguese court and/or Ms C, in any event, had rights of custody as of 28 July 2021.  Thus, from that point, there was a wrongful retention in breach of those rights of custody.  There are no Convention exceptions.  Therefore, it is unnecessary for the court to consider the inherent jurisdiction.  Should the court do so, the welfare interests of the children demand their return to Portugal.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father submitted that Ms C did not have rights of custody when he removed the children on 21 July 2021.  Mr F was, as father, the sole surviving parent and in Portuguese law, he had exclusive rights of custody.  All the rights in respect of the children&#8217;s care were therefore vested in him.  He was, thus, within his rights to take the children with him to England where he had been living.  So as of 28 July, Ms C was not exercising her rights of custody.  The children have become settled in England.  Mr F will not return to Portugal.  Therefore, for these reasons, there would be a grave risk of psychological harm because of the disruption to the lives of the boys and the ensuing separation from their father.  The children would similarly be exposed to an intolerable situation.  Claudio has attained sufficient age and maturity for the court to take into consideration his views.  He objects to return.  Any discretion should be exercised in favour of refusing a return.  The children are settled here.  They are living with their father and he has looked after them well.  The children&#8217;s welfare under the inherent jurisdiction requires that they remain in this country.</p>

McFarlane P said at [58] that a judgment is &#8220;not a summing-up in which every possibly relevant piece of evidence must be mentioned&#8221; (Proposition (4)).  Thus, I focus on what is important.  But the evidence was complex, conflicting and contentious and will benefit with recitation in its main features to make the court&#8217;s assessment intelligible.  The sources of evidence include the bundle (313 pages), and an updating bundle (19 pages).  As indicated, there were further documents about the Portuguese proceedings filed on the last afternoon.  Parties provided several position statements and written submissions of great assistance. I read everything.  Indeed, one of the reasons that I indicated that this judgment would be reserved for a short time was to give the court an opportunity to reflect carefully on these important matters and the detail of the evidence in front of it.</p>

It was simply so they could meet the decision-maker and have the court procedure explained to them.  Though Mr Perkins objected to the court meeting the children, the court ruled that there should be a meeting.  Mr Dodd was in favour of it.  It is a matter of broad discretion.  I judged that the children should feel included as they wished.  However, in accordance with governing guidance, I made it clear that the meeting was not to gather evidence and there would be &#8220;no secrets&#8221; (see: President of the Family Division Guidance, April 2010, &#8220;It cannot be stressed too often that the child&#8217;s meeting with the judge is not for the purpose of gathering evidence.&#8221;). The necessary safeguards were in place.  The Cafcass officer attended; a note was taken and approved by the court and then circulated.  The court is very grateful to the lawyers who assisted in this respect, Ms Jones and Ms Gaunt.</p>

However, Claudio was able to say that Ms C had played a role in their lives, and Ms Gwynne&#8217;s judgment what was that Ms C had played a big part in his life.  These children, she said, had already had to cope with a substantial amount of upheaval.  So it would impact them if there was a further change now, that is by returning to Portugal.</p>

During that period, Mr F lived in England.  Also, during that period, there was no discussion with the father about where the boys would live and who should look after them, and where they should go to school.  Mr F left the children and they stayed with her and she never discussed with him or he never sought to discuss with her any of these important matters.

Therefore, when she last saw them on that day in July 2021, her relationship with the boys was &#8220;so good&#8221;, as she put it, it was a loving relationship.  Bruno was asking her for kisses and hugs, and he was always saying to her, &#8220;Give me a kiss.  Give me a hug.&#8221;  She had no secrets from them and so Claudio spoke to her and said they were going on holiday for three days to the Algarve.  He said they were taking a plane there.

She believed at the end of the holiday in the Algarve the boys would come back and simply resume living with her.  They were registered at the school they had previously attended, and the school registration named her house as their home address.</p>

Right at the outset of the evidence, he said there was an issue about the extent to which he could adopt his statement because there were inaccuracies and errors in it.  Whilst his counsel Mr Dodd believed there was one correction which was at para.15, Mr F stated there were other things that were not right.  So the court gave him permission, with the assistance of the interpreter, to go through the statement.  I judged it the most expeditious way to get to the bottom of what, in fact, he said was wrong in his statement.  The court adopted that procedure even though he had begun his evidence because time was very limited.  He referred to the last two sentences of para.15 which were:</p>

I returned to the United Kingdom after booking her a hospital appointment in Portugal, but I do not know what the issue with her was.  We reached an agreement which the maternal family knew which was for her to recover and for the children to return to the United Kingdom where we had our life.  I went to Portugal after her death.  There was a meeting on 30 June.  It was attended by my niece and also by Pepe, her brother, and also Pepe&#8217;s solicitor and myself.  At that meeting on 30 June, I said what I wanted to happen to the children, which was to keep the same deal I had with my wife which was to return the children with me to the United Kingdom.  At that meeting, I did not mention any dates.  I felt intimidated as they mentioned some documents which were already signed in court, a document that had already been signed by my wife.  There was then a second meeting on 14 July.  At this meeting, Ms C was present.  I made it clear that my intention was to bring the children to the United Kingdom as had been agreed with my wife and we agreed that in Portugal, we would spend three days with each of the children.  I did not say that I would be taking the children to England because during that period I was in Portugal, I felt they were keeping the children from spending time with me.&#8221;</p>

I found her to be an impressive witness, but she was clearly conflicted about what was the right decision in the best interests of the children, whether to return or stay in the United Kingdom.

Claudio had told her, and I accept her evidence as truthful about this, that he understood that they were going on holiday for three days to the Algarve and were taking a plane.  That obviously required identification documents, but I accept that she never thought Mr F would take them to the United Kingdom.  She was expecting, and the children were expecting, to come back to her after the holiday in the Algarve that Claudio had spoken about.  In evidence, of course, at one point Mr F accepted that he was going to take the children on holiday, but I find that the children were expecting to return to Ms C&#8217;s home at the end of this.</p>

I will come to the rest of it shortly.  However, it makes little sense that the boys would be taken out of Portugal without saying any goodbyes to their grandmother and the rest of the Portuguese family.  They had lived with her for almost a year.  I find it inherently improbable (<span style="font-style:italic">Re H; Re BR</span>).  I also accept that if the father was going to remove the children to the United Kingdom, that Ms C would have sought an injunction to prevent it.  She believed that she had rights of custody in the boys.  She loves them and did not want to be separated from them not least because, and I accept her evidence on this, her daughter&#8217;s dying wish repeatedly expressed to her was that the boys should stay in Portugal and be brought up by her. I find this fact supported by the proceedings Edite filed with the Portuguese Court (contemporaneous documentation capturing her wishes: <span style="font-style:italic">Onassis v Vergottis</span>).  At no point prior to the removal on 21 July and indeed after it was there any communication to formalise the position or to document what had happened with the removal.

This is inconsistent with someone acting transparently in accordance with his rights and consistent with what had been agreed or at least stated clearly to Ms C.  It was only when one member of the family saw some pictures on Facebook that Ms C knew that the children had been taken out of Portugal and were, in fact, in England.  She said and the court accepts that she did not want to reach the stage of calling Mr F a liar, but she said he is not telling the truth about the meeting on 14 July. </p>

She could, of course, have said he never mentioned anything like that, but her evidence was more nuanced and detailed and she accepted &#8211; reasonably - that he had an intention but he never said he was actually going to do it.  That is credible.  I find that her credibility about this supports and strengthens her credibility on other matters (<span style="font-style:italic">Arkhangelsky</span>).

Also, a holiday in the Algarve is something she was told about by Claudio.  I accept that evidence - it is supported by the fact that Mr F accepted that he was taking the children for a holiday and his account is undermined by his changing stories and the inexplicable failure to say where his niece&#8217;s &#8220;wedding&#8221; actually was.  It is plain that the children believed they were going to the Algarve and Claudio therefore told his grandmother about it.  Again, the fact that this cover story was only told to the children makes sense if it was part of a deceit because Mr F would not want his lawyers involved in all the lies.  So it was a communication between Mr F and his son about the holiday.  It worked.  Ms C was deceived and identity documents were handed over and the boys were secretly removed to England.</p>

This is a clear and important inconsistency.  In fact, it was plainly a lie.  The reason he had to maintain this falsehood is because he claimed that in the meeting in Portugal on 30 June 2021, he gave them, that is the maternal family (including Pepe, the uncle) and not Ms C directly who was not at the meeting, what he called &#8220;his idea&#8221; which was to keep the same deal he had with his wife - to return to a life in the United Kingdom with the children.  This simply could not have been true because the relationship with Edite, as he finally accepted when he was pressed, was over.  Indeed, he accepted also that not only was the relationship at an end, but he did not speak to Edite <span style="font-style:italic">once</span> between October 2020 and her death at the end of June 2021.  However, he would not answer questions directly whether he did, in fact, speak to her.

It is inconceivable that his lawyers would not tell him about these vital matters.  His evidence that his lawyer &#8220;probably did not make me aware of it&#8221; is simply implausible.  This is the heart of this case.  It was put on his behalf to Ms C that he made it plain at the 14 July meeting that he was going to take the children from Portugal.  It is difficult to reconcile this with his concession documented in a recital to the order of Morgan J dated 11 April 2022 that:</p>

I found that Mr F did not tell the truth about the events after his arrival in Portugal following his wife&#8217;s death.

Instead, I have no doubt that he created a false cover story to get the identity documents which involved a fictitious trip to the Algarve.

Eventually, after much pressing, he accepted all of this, but he was trying to present a different and deliberately false picture to the court.  The purpose of it was to shore up his claim that Ms C had agreed with him to take the children to England.  She had not.  He was also trying to suggest that she was not exercising her rights of custody at the time of the removal.  She was.

I find that he had delegated his care of the children and had affectively abandoned his sons.  He did not have to know how the proportion of care was provided by his wife and his mother-in-law and, in fact, it is quite clear that this was shifting constantly in the direction of Ms C, but that matters not for the <span style="font-style:italic">Re K</span> rubric.  I accept Ms C&#8217;s evidence that she had to undertake the majority of the childcare and especially as Edite&#8217;s death tragically approached.  I also accept Ms C&#8217;s evidence that Edite wanted her mother to look after the children and for the boys to stay in Portugal.  This is all supported by Edite issuing proceedings in Portugal before her death (<span style="font-style:italic">Onassis</span> contemporaneity).  It is supported by the evidence of Ms C whose testimony I found convincing and truthful and by Ms C urgently issuing proceedings in Portugal once the boys were removed, without her consent, against her wishes, and against the wishes of their mother.</p>

The question of rights of custody should ultimately be a question of law for the home jurisdiction.

The agreement with the children is they would visit and stay with their father for three days at a time but then they would return to their home which was Ms C&#8217;s house.  That is very different to caring for the children to the extent of sharing rights of custody.  This is particularly so given the impermanency of Mr F&#8217;s stay in Portugal, the fact that his accommodation was not settled, and that he had no job or income in Portugal.  This was very far, I find, from Ms C giving up her rights of custody or having them extinguished.</p>

It was a reasonable compromise made by Ms C in the best interests of the children.  They had just lost their mother to cancer.  This reasonableness was then exploited covertly by Mr F to wrongfully remove the children.  I reject the submission that Ms C either did not have rights of custody or lost them once the boys began spending time with their father.  It is more complex than that simplistic characterisation because it ignores two things.  First, the extensive history of Ms C&#8217;s care of the children and the fact it was ongoing.  Second, the deceit and subterfuge Mr F engaged in to get the children out of Portugal.  That was because he knew that taking them to England would be against the wishes and the rights of custody of Ms C, but he proceeded to do it anyway.</p>

Mr F agreed a recital that he did not rely upon consent.  It is unclear what his stance towards whether Ms C was not exercising her rights of custody.  It seems to be that he is suggesting her rights of custody, if any, were extinguished when he returned.  That was because of his priority of parental responsibility, he submits.  In issue 1, the court has rejected the submission.  Thus, I find that Ms C&#8217;s rights of custody were, in fact, breached and Art. 3 is engaged.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It strikes me that there are three fundamental problems with Mr F&#8217;s submissions in respect of wrongful retention.  First, the second line of Art. 3 expressly states that rights of custody would have been exercised but for the removal.  Here, I find that Ms C would undoubtedly have exercised her inchoate rights of custody but for the wrongful removal.  Second, Mr Dodd realistically accepts that the Portuguese court &#8220;could have acquired&#8221; rights of custody.  I find that it did.  I received no submissions about how the rights of custody the Portuguese court acquired were rendered inapplicable or extinguished especially as the court in Portugal has continued to progress proceedings even though the children have been in the United Kingdom.  If the argument is that they were not being exercised, the same point applies.  The court in Portugal would have exercised its vested rights of custody but for the wrongful removal.  I find, therefore, that both Ms C and the Portuguese court had rights of custody as at 28 July 2021.  They would have been exercised but for the removal and then wrongful retention.</p>

The Convention question is whether the retention was wrongful: that is in breach of rights of custody.  There were rights of custody possessed by both Ms C and the Portuguese court.  My conclusion, therefore, is that the retention of the children in England was a wrongful retention for the purposes of Art. 3 as of 28 July 2021.</p>

The idea that he would not return to the land of his birth and their home country for the relatively short time it will now take for the already well-advanced Portuguese proceedings to be resolved in one direction or the other is just not credible.  I conclude that from his equivocations at court when asked this direct question that, at the end of the day, the strength of his bond with his sons is likely to prevail.  Also, I note what he told Ms Gwynne, in terms, noted in her report at para.47:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I observe, of course, that this court cannot order his return, but certainly the children&#8217;s.  If he were to return, and that would be his choice, he could, as he indicated, stay with relatives, whether it is stepmother or an aunt, in Portugal at least on a temporary basis initially.  He did stay in Portugal, of course, for several weeks after his wife&#8217;s death in the summer of 2021.  The boys could stay and sleep at Ms C&#8217;s house which was their home for almost a year before Mr F secretly removed them.  The children can spend a great deal of time with him in Portugal until the Portuguese court makes its decision about arrangements for them.  Thus, I find there is a strong chance that if a return order were made, Mr F would, in fact, accompany the children back to Portugal.</p>

If, as is likely, Mr F does return with his sons, the separation basis of psychological harm falls away completely.  I find that this is very likely what will happen if a return order were made in respect of the children.  </p>

The children have settled in the United Kingdom to a significant extent and have received positive school reports which Ms Gwynne states is a reflection of the good parenting that Mr F has provided.  Does the combination of the uprooting effect broadly construed, along with any separation from Mr F if he refuses to accompany the children back to Portugal, amount to a grave risk of psychological harm?  I find that Mr F has not proved this on the balance of probabilities.  While the boys would prefer to stay with him, I do not find that their returning to their home country when they are native speakers, to the home they have lived in with their grandmother for almost a year before their covert removal from Portugal, and where they will be cared for again by their grandmother who loves them does expose the children to the grave risk of psychological harm.  The risk must be grave.  There is, it is recognised by the courts, a connection between the gravity of the risk and seriousness of the adverse impact (see below).  </p>

There are cheap flights available to Portugal as there are too many other European destinations if booked with budget airlines in advance.  The court can certainly take judicial notice of that.  It is just a matter of common knowledge and common sense.  Subject to mitigating the risk of further abduction, there is no reason why he could not have an opportunity in Portugal to be with his sons and to share fun times with them.  However, the ultimate arrangements, I emphasise, are a matter for the Portuguese court.</p>

What the Convention requires is a level of seriousness of impact on the child that would amount to an intolerable situation or the equivalent level of psychological harm.  Indeed, it would be puzzling if there were different standards.  There are not.  That is precisely why the words &#8220;or otherwise&#8221; are used in the construction of the Article:</p>

It may well dwindle again.  I am not convinced, as Mr Dodd submitted, that Mr F is committed to ensuring contact will take place in the future.  His track record speaks for itself.  It is the best way to judge this.  He simply did not promote contact for months.  No arrangements for contact with the Portuguese family were made until March 2022 when the UK was seized and made directions.  Ms Gwynne found that the lack of goodbyes before leaving Portugal and the lack of contact with the Portuguese family would have caused, as she put it, &#8220;emotional upheaval&#8221; in the children and also a &#8220;substantial emotional impact&#8221;.  That harm has exclusively been Mr F&#8217;s doing.  The court has not bound by Ms Gwynne&#8217;s conclusion.  But I weigh it, while recognising that it is not determinative.  She said, in terms, that it was &#8220;finely balanced&#8221;.  I find that Mr F has not proved that the risk of psychological harm comes anywhere near to the requisite threshold in the Convention.

In such cases, even though the taking parent&#8217;s return with the child would in most cases protect the child from the grave risk, any efforts to introduce measures of protection or arrangements to facilitate the return of the parent may prove to be ineffectual since the court cannot, in general, force the parent to go back.  It needs to be emphasised that, as a rule, the parent should not - through the wrongful removal or retention of the child - be allowed to create a situation that is potentially harmful to the child, and then rely on it to establish the existence of a grave risk to the child.&#8221;</p>

Is a parent to create a psychological situation and then rely upon it?  If the grave risk of psychological harm to a child is to be inflicted by conduct of the parent that abducted him, then it would be relied upon by every mother of a young child who removed him out of the jurisdiction and refused to return.  It would drive a coach and horses through the Convention at least in respect of applications relating to young children.  I, for my part, cannot believe that this is in the interests of international relations, nor should the mother, by her own actions, succeed in preventing the return of a child who should be living in his own country and denying contact with his other parent.&#8221;</p>

The source of risk cannot prevent the gateway from opening.  That must be the case.  However, during the discretionary evaluation, the court can and should take into account the conduct of the parent as one of the criteria in the balance.  It can be rationally connected, I judge, to two more classical Convention principles.  That is because if such flagrant and deliberate wrongful acts were completely ignored, the aforementioned &#8220;coach and horses&#8221;, would be driven through this international treaty.  One simply has to ask: what would stop any removing and retaining parent from refusing to return?  This is where the discretion and common sense of the court must surge to the fore.  The court must look forward.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Looking at factors in the balancing exercise against return, the court must weigh the fact that Claudio, whose views the court must take into account as I will come to, has stated that he wants to stay in the United Kingdom.  I find that return would have an adverse psychological impact on the children.  There would be an impact on the children from being uprooted in England and their school here.  Claudio is about to start a new school.  There would be the impact of separation from their father if he refuses to return with them.  But I do not consider it as creating a grave risk in Convention terms, as I have previously indicated.  Yet even if it was, there are other factors that weigh against it.  Therefore, in favour of return are the facts that the children would be returning to live to a home they know well and where they have lived for an extended period.  They would live with a grandmother who loved them and has looked after them for that extended period and who had fought very hard to have them back in Portugal, where their mother wished for them to live and grow up.  The children would be going back to friends they have in Portugal and although the court expressly told the children during the meeting with the judge that they should not provide evidence, almost immediately, Claudio could not help himself and stated that he missed his friends in Portugal - his &#8220;little friends&#8221; as he called them.  It was a genuine and heartfelt comment.  I have no doubt whatsoever that it is true and reflects his genuine wishes and feelings.  But I keep it in proportion.  It is simply one part of the picture.  It does reassure the court that the situation on return to Portugal would not be as dire as Mr F would have the court believe.</p>

The Convention does not provide that, when an order for return to the child's homeland is made, the child should stay there indefinitely.

Given the fact that children are still at school, they should finish the English school term.  There should not be a return until after the end of the English school year.

The court has found that if push came to shove, Mr F would most likely return to Portugal with his sons, although he cannot be compelled to do so by the court.

This is what the intervening year has unmistakably taught us.  There has been a delay in the decision as time has remorselessly advanced.  The children have become accustomed to living in England and are doing well at school.  It is difficult to gauge the extent that Claudio has been influenced by his father and I emphasise that I heard no evidence that Mr F has coached him or anybody else.  But Claudio cannot but know that Mr F wants them to stay in England.  He brought the children here very soon after their mother&#8217;s tragic death.  He has set up a life for them here.  Claudio can be in no doubt what Mr F wants for them.  I am certain that Portugal will be far better able to make decisions about the children&#8217;s welfare and the optimum arrangements for their future, and that is going to be more easily, effectively and efficiently done if these children are back in the country of their habitual residence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">All parties are nationals of the requesting State and speak Portuguese as their first language.  Indeed, two interpreters were needed for the court hearing.  The children do have an established relationship with their grandmother and with her home, which was their home, and a school they attended in Portugal when they were living with her.  There are advanced proceedings in Portugal.  There was prompt action by Ms C, the person with rights of custody, when there was removal.  Her daughter had issued proceedings in Portugal before her death.  For all these reasons, the countervailing factors significantly outweigh Claudio&#8217;s stated views and desires to remain in England.  This exception fails.</p>
