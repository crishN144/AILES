The mother&#8217;s evidence is that the father has had problems with alcohol and drugs and was, on occasions, aggressive and abusive towards her.  She asserts that these problems continued after I was born in 2010.  She further asserts that the father did not show any real interest in his son at that stage.  In autumn of 2011 they separated and the mother took I to live with his grandparents but the parties reconciled again shortly after.  </span></p>

She then realised she could not remain with him any longer and in May 2013 left and went to live with her parents in Belarus.  Significantly, she left I in the father&#8217;s care at that stage.  Her explanation for this is that I&#8217;s paternal grandparents, whom she asserts to be strong, dominant characters within the family, would not allow her to take I with her.  </span></p>

When the mother refused to agree to return I to Ukraine under any circumstances he decided to start these proceedings via the central authorities.

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Thereafter the matter came back to court on four occasions for directions.  The mother delayed in filing her response partly because of delays in obtaining public funding.  Directions were given by MacDonald J on 28</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt">&#160;July which recorded the defences on which the mother seeks to rely (acquiescence and Article 13(b)) and also records that if the court were to order I&#8217;s return to Ukraine she would not accompany him because she was suffering from postnatal depression.  Further directions were given leading to a hearing before me today, 11</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt">&#160;September.  The court directed that both parties should attend the hearing, the mother in this country and the father from Ukraine given that the defence of acquiescence had been raised.  It was further directed that the father should attend to give oral evidence subject to the judge&#8217;s determination.  Public funding was eventually extended to cover the mother&#8217;s representation at this hearing a week ago.  Miss&#160;Magdalen&#160;Case had been instructed to represent her which she has done with conspicuous ability for which the court is very grateful.  </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The mother attended a conference with counsel earlier this week but in the event did not attend court today notwithstanding the direction.  Her explanation given through counsel after her lawyers had contacted her at 10:15 to enquire about her whereabouts was that she was unwell and could not therefore make the journey from her home in Lancashire.  Miss&#160;Case thereafter applied to adjourn the hearing today.  I&#160;refused that application.  A medical report confirming the mother is suffering postnatal depression was produced yesterday which, whilst identifying that she had indeed suffered from that illness, did not suggest that her ill-health was at a level which would preclude her attending court.  Furthermore, the mother failed to notify her lawyers or the court that she would not be attending until contacted by her lawyers themselves at about 10:15 this morning. Given the urgency with which child abduction proceedings must be concluded and the delays which had already occurred since the proceedings were issued some 12 weeks ago, and the limited scope of a hearing under the Convention and the 1985&#160;Act, and the fact that no further hearing could be arranged before November, I&#160;refused to adjourn the hearing but suggested that efforts be made to enable the mother to participate in the hearing via telephone.  In the event she declined to take part either giving evidence or listening on the grounds that she was not well enough to do so.  In those circumstances Miss&#160;Case did not pursue her previous application for oral evidence to be adduced on the issue of acquiescence.  </span></p>

It is for them to produce evidence to substantiate one of the exceptions.  There is nothing to indicate that the standard of proof is other than the ordinary balance of probabilities.  But in evaluating the evidence the court will of course be mindful of the limitations involved in the summary nature of the Hague&#160;Convention process.  It will rarely be appropriate to hear oral evidence of the allegations made under Article 13(b) and so neither those allegations nor their rebuttal are usually tested in cross-examination.</span></p>

It is not enough, as it is in other contexts such as asylum, that the risk be &#8216;real&#8217;.  It must have reached such a level of seriousness as to be characterised as &#8216;grave&#8217;.  Although &#8216;grave&#8217; characterises the risk rather than the harm, there is in ordinary language a link between the two.  Thus a relatively low risk of death or really serious injury might properly be qualified as &#8216;grave&#8217; while a higher level of risk might be required for other less serious forms of harm.</span></p>

Every child has to put up with a certain amount of rough and tumble, discomfort and distress.  It is part of growing up.  But there are some things which it is not reasonable to expect a child to tolerate.  Among these, of course, are physical or psychological abuse or neglect of the child herself.  Among these also, we now understand, can be exposure to the harmful effects of seeing and hearing the physical or psychological abuse of her own parent.  Mr.&#160;Turner accepts that, if there is such a risk, the source of it is irrelevant: e.g. where a mother&#8217;s subjective perception of events leads to a mental illness which could have intolerable consequences for the child.</span></p>

As has often been pointed out, this is not necessarily the same as being returned to the person, institution or other body who has requested her return, although of course it may be so if that person has the right so to demand.  More importantly, the situation which the child will face on return depends crucially on the protective measures which can be put in place to secure that the child will not be called upon to face an intolerable situation when she gets home.&#8221;</span></p>

Her case is that the father subsequently acquiesced in I remaining in this country.  On her behalf, Miss&#160;Case relies in particular on the mother&#8217;s evidence that the father has, since I&#8217;s arrival in this country, repeatedly said that he has &#8220;come to terms with the fact that I will be living in England and that he was happy that I had a whole family and a little brother&#8221;.  </span></p>

Miss Case submits that this denial is expressed in equivocal terms, and much more equivocal, she suggests, than would be the case if the father had genuinely not acquiesced in I remaining in this country.  It is the mother&#8217;s case that it is the paternal grandparents who are driving this application not the father.  She suggests that the father himself, if left to his own devices, would agree to I remaining here and has in fact so acquiesced.  </span></p>

He points out that the father and his own father travelled to Belarus in February shortly after I had been abducted to this country to recover him.  Mr.&#160;Perkins also relies on the mother&#8217;s acceptance in her own evidence that the father subsequently refused to sign a letter of mutual consent to I&#8217;s place of residence being in England.

The evidence does not show unequivocally that the father acquiesced in I remaining here.  This defence therefore fails.</span></p>

The mother says that I has witnessed some acts of abuse perpetrated on her by the father.  To my mind, however, the strength of this argument is very substantially undermined by the fact that the mother was content to leave I in the father&#8217;s care when she went to Belarus.  Furthermore, she thereafter agreed that substantial periods of time could be spent by I in his father&#8217;s care in Ukraine &#8211; indeed, that this should be registered as his principal place of residence.  </span></p>

I&#160;accept Miss&#160;Case&#8217;s careful submission that this court must be cautious and alert to bear in mind the insidious effect of domestic violence.  Nonetheless, looking at the case overall, I&#160;find that the mother has failed to establish that there is a grave risk of harm to I if he is ordered to return summarily pending the determination by the Ukraine court of any question concerning his future. I has lived in his father&#8217;s principal care for substantial periods of time in his short life.  The evidence from mutual friends and more significantly his kindergarten adduced in evidence all suggest that I is well-cared for in the care of his father.  The mother raises various concerns about the details of that care, for example the sleeping arrangements.  She draws attention to the fact on her case that I has to share a bed with his grandparents whom she describes as &#8220;foul-smelling old people&#8221;.  To my mind this does not go anywhere near amounting to establishing a grave risk of harm applying the test as established in the authorities.</span></p>
