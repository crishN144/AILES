The application is supported by a statement from the solicitor instructed by R, and by a statement from R herself.   I granted that application after considering argument at the hearing, and invited R&#8217;s solicitor to act as her litigation friend.  R did not apply to the court for an adjournment of the case for her to prepare more fully; she and her lawyers realistically recognised the summary nature of these proceedings, and the timeframes within which the court is operating.</p>

At the outset of the hearing, I was told that S had come to court and wished to meet with me.  Having discussed with counsel the proposed purpose of such a meeting, and the parameters, I agreed to do so.  I saw her straight away (i.e. before hearing argument) and &#8211; as agreed &#8211; explained to her the procedure involved in the hearing. I did not discuss with her the substance of the case, or indeed her wishes as to outcome. She is, as the Cafcass officer independently and rightly observed, a &#8220;charming, polite and bright young woman&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The background can be shortly stated.  The father is French, and the mother English.  The parties married in England in 1996, and lived for the first years of their marriage in rural England.  In February 2007, when S was 4 years old, the family moved to northern France, where they have lived ever since.  The father works in business; the mother is an English teacher.   The marriage deteriorated towards the tail-end of 2015; divorce was, it appears, first discussed at or about Christmas 2015.  On 16 February 2016 the father presented a petition for divorce in the courts of France.   Against the background of a domestic &#8220;undercurrent of unease&#8221; (a description from the Cafcass report, acknowledged to be accurate by both parents), on 17 February there was a scene at the family home; the parents argued in front of R.  The mother called the police who advised her to leave the home and she did so, taking the two children with her.  She found a room at a local hotel, where she remained for several days; the mother&#8217;s brother (maternal uncle to S) joined the mother for a while to offer emotional and practical support; indeed, together they returned to the matrimonial home and collected items while the father was at work.  On 3 March 2016, the mother took the children out of school in France and brought them to England, where they have been ever since, living with her parents (maternal grandparents).  A &#8216;round table&#8217; meeting had been scheduled to take place in France between the parties and their lawyers on 9 March 2016; this did not happen.  Both girls have entered school here.  There has been minimal contact between the father and the children since 3 March.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am further advised that there is to be a hearing in the French Court on 23 June 2016 at 3pm; the hearing is described as a &#8216;conciliation&#8217; hearing before the &#8216;Juge aux Affaires Familiales&#8217; and is expected to deal with a range of interim issues, including maintenance allowance, occupation of the matrimonial home, and child arrangements.  The parties are expected to bring evidence of their income and expenses.  I suspect that it is no more than a first appointment, and it may be that little of substance is actually achieved at that time.  I am advised that at that hearing, the judge will consider whether he/she will meet the children, or either of them.  Both parents have retained lawyers in France.  </p>

It is further not disputed that my primary obligation is therefore to return S forthwith to France under <span style="font-style:italic">Article 12</span>.

But the situation in those cases was different from that which obtains here; I am not considering the participation of the <span style="font-style:italic">subject</span> child, but party status of a young person who falls outside the scope of the Convention but who is a full sibling.  To succeed in her bid for party status, R has first to demonstrate that he or she falls within the category of a &#8220;person who appears to the court to have sufficient interest in the welfare of the [subject] child&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic">Rule 12.3(1) of the FPR 2010</span>).  Secondly, she (as any child in her situation) needs to demonstrate that it is in his or her interests to be joined as a party to the proceedings under <span style="font-style:italic">rule 16.2</span> of the <span style="font-style:italic">FPR 2010</span>.  If the two threshold tests are satisfied, the door is open for me to exercise my discretion to join the young person to the proceedings, though, as Lord Wilson observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Re LC </span>(an observation which is probably germane here) that &#8220;&#8230; is the sort of discretion, occasionally found in procedural rules, which is more theoretical than real: the nature of the threshold conclusion will almost always drive the exercise of the resultant discretion&#8221; (see [45]).  </p>

In this particular case, I am satisfied that R is close to S, and has an undoubted and anxious interest in S&#8217;s welfare and future.  The more difficult question is whether it is in R&#8217;s interests that she be joined to the litigation.  R is determined to remain living in England whatever decision I make in relation to her sister; she is nonetheless (indeed perhaps for that very reason) concerned that I should fully comprehend the implications for herself and her sister if the effect of my decision is that they are separated by S&#8217;s return to France.  R and S currently benefit from real and mutual<span style="font-style:italic"> Article 8 ECHR </span>rights to respect for their family life together; these rights operate separately from (but simultaneously with) their joint and independent <span style="font-style:italic">Article 8</span> rights for respect for their family life with their parents.

Once the parents confirmed (on my enquiry) during the hearing that they would not, under any circumstances, pursue a claim for costs against R (see <span style="font-style:italic">rule 16.9(2)(c)</span>), R&#8217;s solicitor agreed to be her litigation friend, thus avoiding the involvement of another family member (a maternal uncle) who had otherwise volunteered.  One of the values of appointing a litigation friend was that I could ensure that R&#8217;s own participation in the proceedings was guided and regulated (see [155] of <span style="font-style:italic">Re M</span>): &#8220;He or she will no doubt determine which documents filed in the proceedings should be shown to the child and take decisions, in consultation with the child, about whether the child should attend the court hearing.&#8221;  There is nothing controversial about that: as Lord Wilson observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Re LC</span>, the joinder of a child can be qualified / regulated by arrangements as to her participation (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re LC </span>[55]), within the &#8220;wide discretion&#8221; of the court (see also Peter Jackson J in <span style="font-style:italic">A City Council v T, J and R </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2011/1082" uk:canonical="[2011] EWHC 1082 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] EWHC 1082 (Fam)</ref> <span class="hiddencitation1" style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9.5pt;color:#000000">[2011] 2 FLR 803</span>[2011] 2 FLR 803).  Where party status has been given to a non-subject child, particularly one who is a mature 17-year old, I would limit the extent of her participation only cautiously.   R has rights under <span style="font-style:italic">Article 6</span> which must be carefully observed.  However, for her &#8211; as for any party &#8211; an entitlement to a fair trial under <span style="font-style:italic">Article 6</span> of the ECHR does not mean an absolute and unqualified right to see all the documents (see, for a discussion of that proposition, Munby J as he then was in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (Disclosure)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 2 FLR 1017" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 2 FLR 1017</ref>).  </p>

R recognised that her participation would, perforce, be limited.  Therefore although Miss Clifford could access the documents once R was joined, R could not realistically do so; Miss Clifford acknowledged that there would be little material benefit in R having access to the parents&#8217; statements <span style="font-style:italic">after</span> the hearing, and such benefit as there may be is likely in my judgment to be outweighed by the potential detriment of exposure to her parents&#8217; dispute.

In the event that S is returned to France, the sisters will be able to see each other in holidays, for significant periods; although in different countries, they would be living reasonably easy travelling distance apart which would make even weekend meetings feasible.

I acknowledge that the mother is currently able to live rent-free with her parents, but this is only a short-term solution.  The mother has the scope to work in both countries; although she has given up her work in France, she indicates that her previous employer would try to provide agency work to assist her to build up her practice again should she return; when she was working, she was earning up to &#8364;1,000 per month.  The father has offered to provide to the mother (until the French Court can attend substantively to the issue) the sum of no less than &#8364;510 per month, in the event of her return to France with S, in addition to (i) covering the rental costs of a modest apartment for the mother and S in the local town, (ii) providing a deposit for the same and (iii) continuing to pay the mortgage on the former matrimonial home.  While there is an obvious disparity of accommodation for as long as the father occupies the former matrimonial home (a decision which may well, I recognise, aggravate relations) this offer seems to me to be reasonable, and neutralises the argument that S and her mother would be placed in intolerable financial hardship in the event of a return.  The father&#8217;s offer represents, in short, &#8220;adequate arrangements&#8221; to secure the financial protection of S in the event of a return (see <span style="font-style:italic">Article 11(4)</span> of <span style="font-style:italic">BIIR</span>).</p>

Although reflecting that S was &#8220;determined&#8221; that she does not wish to return to France, objects to being separated from her sister, and adopts a &#8220;strongly held position&#8221;, Ms Roddy nonetheless concluded that S&#8217;s views amounted to no more than a &#8220;clear preference&#8221; to remain in the UK rather than an objection to return to France.  That conclusion was intended to convey to the court that S&#8217;s views (&#8216;preference&#8217;) fell short of an objection (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re M</span> at [38]-[41], and see <span style="font-style:italic">Re LC</span> at [8] and [71] &#8211; accepting the distinction between these expressions of view). </p>

She was of the view that S had a reasoned and balanced view of the options, and had some sorrow and regret at the current situation; she was also angry at her father. Significantly, it became apparent in Mr. Perkins&#8217; questioning of Ms Roddy that she had considered and interpreted the word &#8216;objection&#8217; to mean something which was &#8220;absolute&#8221; in quality, something which &#8220;could not be contemplated, distasteful &#8230; not find favour under any circumstances&#8221;.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having considered the evidence as a whole, I am satisfied that S does object (per <span style="font-style:italic">Article 13</span>) to returning to France.  I draw, in reaching this conclusion, on the evidence garnered in, and reflected by, Ms Roddy&#8217;s helpful assessment, but not on her ultimate conclusion on this question.  I was particularly struck by the passage in the report indicating that S was &#8220;determined&#8221; that she does not want to return to France; in stating her view forcefully in this way, I recognise that S may well be conflating her feelings about returning to the country with her feelings about her father and the situation which she left behind, but consider this below when exercising my discretion.  It seems to me that Ms Roddy had probably attributed to the term and concept of &#8216;objection&#8217; a loaded quality which it did not deserve.  Her evidence that she understood &#8216;object&#8217; to be something &#8216;absolute&#8217; or not finding favour &#8216;in any circumstances&#8217; is reminiscent of the erroneous approach taken by counsel and the judge to the term in the trial at first instance in <span style="font-style:italic">Re F </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2015/1022" uk:canonical="[2015] EWCA Civ 1022" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWCA Civ 1022</ref>, in which Black LJ said at [35]:</p>

The exception is established if the judge concludes, simply, that the child objects to returning to the country of habitual residence. &#8230; Whether a child objects is a question of fact, and the word "objects" is sufficient on its own to convey to a judge hearing a Hague Convention case what has to be established; further definition may be more likely to mislead or to generate debate than to assist.&#8221;</p>

Those factors include: (a) S&#8217;s unhappiness at the thought of being separated from her sister and her mother, (b) her perception of a change in her father&#8217;s behaviour towards her and the family in the end of 2015, (c) her dislike of domestic disharmony between her parents (in particular her father&#8217;s shouting), (d) her blame of her father for the current situation (including his stance on financial provision which had caused the mother to leave France) and anger towards him, (e) her anger towards her paternal grandparents (in France) for allegedly &#8216;covering&#8217; for her father&#8217;s behaviours, (f) the influence (whether intentional or otherwise) of her mother who has (she accepts) spoken with S about the issues, and (g) her worry about not having anywhere to live in France.

If ordered to return, she would (I hope) be able to settle back reasonably easily into French schooling after the Whitsun break, having missed relatively little of her curriculum there.

However, I bear in mind that S had expressed the hope to Ms Roddy that her father would seek her long-term care (thus, poignantly, indicating his love for her: see [27] above), and am much encouraged by Ms Roddy&#8217;s description of the meeting between father and daughter outside court on the day of the hearing.  Geographic proximity of one another in France &#8211; at this crucial time even if not permanently &#8211; may encourage an easier re-establishing of the father/daughter relationship, which I am satisfied (having seen the messages and cards which have passed between them even in relatively recent times) has been extremely close and loving. </p>
