	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the commencement of this hearing, I was invited to make care orders in respect of three children: A, a young person who is approaching 16 years of age; T, a young boy approaching 6 years of age and S, a boy who will very shortly be 2 years of age. Despite their differing ages, each of the children has an August birthday. A was made subject to Child Protection plans in January 2015, identified as being at risk of emotional harm. T was initially accommodated for a short period, by Cumbria Children&#8217;s Services, in August 2016. A was removed from her mother&#8217;s care under the aegis of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 20</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> on the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2019. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the commencement of the proceedings, both these children were subject to interim care orders made by the Liverpool Family Court. Both T and A are placed together in a foster placement in which it should be recorded they are thriving. All agree that their relationship is central to their mutual and individual emotional wellbeing. There is also agreement that separating them at this point would be inimical to their respective welfare needs. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It has been submitted that these proceedings have <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;an exceptionally long and complicated history, involving multiple expert and other assessments&#8221;.</span> I do not entirely agree with that characterisation of the case. Certainly, the litigation history is lamentable and undoubtedly, the delay in achieving a final hearing has been entirely irreconcilable with the obligation to promote the welfare of the children. That said, the issues in this case are paradigmatic of many cases that are heard regularly in the Family Court by both District and Circuit Judges. The expert evidence, as it has evolved, is really focused on two witnesses, Dr Weir, Consultant Psychiatrist and Dr Hansen, Consultant Psychologist. Their reports reflect their complementary disciplines. Their conclusions are mutually supportive. Their analysis is entirely uncontroversial, within the parameters of their respective professions. Their evidence is unchallenged by any other expert. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is correct to say that there have been many assessments in this case. For reasons that I have struggled to understand, there have been 5 residential placements of Mother (M) and baby. That is not merely unusual but in the experience of every professional in the case, entirely unprecedented. Each of the assessments produced significantly negative information regarding M&#8217;s capacity to care for S in the long term. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is the fourth occasion on which the case has been listed for final hearing. Some of the adjournments can be explained, at least in part, by the exigencies of the pandemic. However, I am also left with the clear impression that a rather more robust approach to case management, by all concerned, would have avoided delay of this magnitude. Specifically, the plans for A and T ought to have been resolved at least 12 months ago. In the intervening period, there has been no coherently arguable alternative to the arrangements that I have endorsed today and which, I emphasise, proceeded by agreement at this hearing following discussions at a pre-hearing review, which I listed on short notice. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The significance of this delay is that both A and T have been anxious and unsettled by the lack of clear plans for their future. Rather than wait until the end of this hearing, I made final orders on the second day in respect of them both. I did so to signal that the Court recognised and was aware of the impact that the uncertainty had on them and to make at least some small gesture of reparation. It is right that I record that A, who has been very clear from her reception into care and consistently thereafter, that she wishes to remain in foster care, was manifestly relieved. The key social worker has told me that A has blossomed in her foster home. The changes in her are not merely emotional, in the sense that she has developed her self-confidence, but also physical. I have been told that she stands in a way that is now relaxed and confident and no longer cowed and apologetic. All who have encountered her describe a young person effervescing with talent and aspiration. Her sensitively expressed wishes and feelings about her future should have been respected much earlier. It is also important to note that on their reception into foster care A was observed to have established a parenting or caring role in respect of her much younger half-sibling. Gradually, and to their mutual benefit, they have each let go of these respective roles to a significant degree. Nonetheless, they remain the primary focus of their respective worlds. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The catalyst for these proceedings was an injury to A&#8217;s eye caused by M on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2019. On that day, Ms Melissa Swan, a social worker, arrived at the family&#8217;s address to conduct an assessment. M was described as being in an <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;erratic&#8217;</span> state. She was indicating that she could not &#8216;put up&#8217; with A anymore and said that she <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;wanted her gone&#8217;,</span> by which it was clear that she wanted her to be taken into care. The social worker took A to sit outside in her car to talk to her in private. A said that M had been <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;goading her&#8217;</span> for days, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;winding her up&#8217;</span> and that when she retaliates her mother records her so that &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">she can show people what she is like&#8217;</span>. When M was spoken to, she accepted that she had punched A in the face but contended that this was in response to A&#8217;s aggression. M&#8217;s position in the litigation is that she did not punch A but, as I understand it, slapped her on the face. She contends that the substantial ring that she was wearing at the time made contact with A&#8217;s face and explains the extent of the injury. She brought the ring to Court to show me. M also referred to &#8216;recordings&#8217; she had made, though she contended that they reflected the reality of A&#8217;s behaviour rather than the contrivance asserted by her daughter. The &#8216;threshold criteria&#8217;, pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 31(2)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, having been agreed and having regard to the wider issues in the case, it was not thought necessary to resolve these differences in account. If I may say so, I entirely agree with the correctness of that approach. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">One of the reasons which may illuminate at least some of the drift and delay in this case has been the failure fully to grasp the complexion of the identified harm and the character of future risk. Though there are many hundreds of pages filed in these proceedings, I have not found, in any of the statements, a clear analysis of either the nature of the contemplated harm or the likely risk of it. In a &#8216;Summary and Preliminary Report&#8217; prepared following A&#8217;s medical assessment at the Safeguarding Unit in Alder Hey Children&#8217;s Hospital, the examining doctor identified the following concerns. This was really the first and clearest iteration of risk and ought to have provided a good starting point for assessment:</p>

Indeed, I note that when His Honour Judge Sharpe came to consider whether there should be (a second) residential assessment, he made the following observation: </p>

As I have highlighted above, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;multiple concerns regarding emotional abuse&#8217;</span> had rightly been identified from the outset in this case, along with <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;historical physical abuse&#8217; </span>of two elder children and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;allegations of sexual </span>abuse&#8217; made by both of them. When contemplating the separation of a mother and baby, at an interim stage in care proceedings, it is misconceived, in my judgement, to divide concepts of &#8216;harm&#8217; into discrete silos or to evaluate risk only by reference to immediate physical safety. A child&#8217;s best interests cannot be evaluated in suspended animation. Assessing welfare is an exercise in a continuum, not in a vacuum. An assessment of risk confined to immediate physical harm is likely to be artificial and, inevitably, incomplete. When a decision is made, against a background of identified welfare concerns, to place a mother and baby together, it is one which requires recognition of the broad canvas of available evidence which is likely to illuminate both immediate and longer-term risk to the child. The decision to place mother and baby together in a residential placement, reflects not only recognition of their respective rights and interests, pursuant to Article 8 and 6 ECHR, but also a disciplined forensic focus on the objectives of such a placement and, accordingly, the proportionality of intervention. It is to be remembered that the legal framework providing for such assessment is found in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/38/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 38(6)</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/38" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 38</ref>(7A) and (7B) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. </p>

Following the negative conclusions of that first assessment neither the Local Authority nor the Guardian considered that a further assessment was either necessary or in S&#8217;s interests. Judge Sharpe took a different view. He ordered a further residential assessment. No party appealed that decision. From that point on, as best as I can understand it, the residential placements which followed (interspersed by foster care placements), appear to have been driven by a view that M and S should be kept together until a final hearing in which the plans for S&#8217;s future could be properly considered. </p>

These placements do not appear to have been directed towards any focused assessment on M&#8217;s care. They have been described before me as &#8216;holding placements&#8217;. That is not a concept that I am familiar with, nor am I attracted to it. It appears to me that the thinking behind it was effectively &#8216;to hold the ring&#8217; in the litigation, predicated on the view that this might keep options open for the future. Whilst this might, in some circumstances and within tightly constrained parameters, be necessary and thus desirable, it also carries the risk of elevating process above substance, guarding procedural rights at the expense of a child&#8217;s welfare. That, I regret to say, is what occurred here. The need for a residential placement will be indicated by consideration of the factors that I have set out above. Engagement in analysis of those factors will also illuminate the child&#8217;s welfare in the interim. Here S, now I reiterate approaching two years of age, has lived almost the entirety of his life in an environment in which he and his mother live communally; are observed on a 24-hour basis by either staff or video surveillance or both. These mother and baby units were inevitably restrictive of S&#8217;s potential to engage more widely with the world at a crucial stage in his development. I have asked Counsel on a number of occasions how this was permitted to endure for as long as it did. No party has sought to justify it. </p>

More broadly, they found her to be a disruptive influence on the day-to-day life of the unit, identifying her propensity to generate ill feeling amongst other residents. </p>

Dr Michael Weir, a highly experienced Psychiatrist was instructed and Dr Hansen, a Clinical Psychologist. Dr Weir emphasised, in his oral evidence, that he found M to be one of the most hostile, aggressive, and obstructive clients that he had ever encountered. He has been involved in a number of high-profile cases and his experience is, forensically as well as clinically, extensive. He was particularly struck by the extent to which M was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;controlling interviews by not answering questions&#8217;</span> and providing only <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;minimal information&#8217;</span> in order to<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;assert herself to those around her&#8217;</span>.

He did not exclude features of the other personality disorders set out above but considered that the paranoia predominated.

The respective professional skills from these two disciplines establish, to my mind, a confluence of information for Dr Weir&#8217;s conclusion, and I consider he was, logically and in the circumstances, entitled to take such an approach. In her report, Dr Hansen specifically suggested that Dr Weir had sight of the extensive &#8216;self-reported&#8217; information that she set out in order for him to consider any formal diagnosis. However, I doubt whether the distinction between the facets of behaviour pointing to a disorder of personality (as identified by Dr Hansen) and a formal diagnosis of Paranoid Personality Disorder (determined by Dr Weir) has any real forensic significance, at least in illuminating the outcome in this case. To some degree, the actual label strikes me as largely irrelevant. What is pertinent is the prognosis for significant change and the likely timescales for it. </p>

M told me that she was much more relaxed about it now but recent observations in the latest 247 assessment reveal it still to be troubling for her.  This is certainly associated with times of stress for M. I also note that M had recognised within the Independent Social Work assessment, conducted by Ms Amanda Walsh, that she <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;could be paranoid&#8217;</span>. She disavowed that, however, in her oral evidence. Certainly, she has a deep mistrust of the social workers and in particular, Ms C, the present social worker. Ms C told me that M is controlling of their relationship, obstructs day-to-day communications and behaves in a loud and intimidating manner. Though Ms C was at pains to emphasise that M had never been violent or threatened violence to her or indeed to any of the other professionals in the case, the height and level of verbal aggression seemed consistently to carry with it, a physical threat. There have been 5 social workers involved in M&#8217;s case. Three, including Ms C, have experienced strikingly similar behaviours.

Dr Hansen enquired of M whether she considered that she had learned from the social work assessment. M said she had learned that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;she must not trust social services again&#8217;. </span>She went on to say <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;this is her second run in with social services and &#8230; she is paranoid about things&#8217;</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;she has never had good experience of authority, government, or social services&#8217;</span>.

This resonates very strikingly with her earlier views of Q. It is clear (see paragraph 19 above) that Q accepted M&#8217;s narrative that all fault lay with him. The evidence before me is that A has been more resilient and was fortunate to find a placement with her brother that enabled her to move forward. I also note that in one of her interviews with Dr Hansen, M had spoken enthusiastically about applying for the foster carer&#8217;s notes which she believed would reveal that A had acknowledged that she had been the attacker and that accordingly, M would be absolved of responsibility. </p>

There has been some debate as to the extent of the therapy that M has received. It would appear, that it is now agreed that she has attended 12 sessions.

The objective of this would be to create a collaborative formulation which might enable her to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;contain her narrative of life&#8217;</span> and to reconsider repeating patterns and her own feelings. Dr Hansen told me that the length of therapy for such intervention varies but she was clear that M would need the maximum available. This may be in the region of 32 sessions. Additionally, Dr Hansen identified significant trauma in M&#8217;s own childhood. In her evidence to me, M was asked about her childhood and her own experience of parenting. She effectively closed down that line of questioning immediately but, in the few sentences she did speak, the pain generated by the issue was almost palpable and the intensity of her reaction notably greater than to any other subject that was raised with her. Dr Hansen had foreshadowed this in her oral evidence and in her report. She considered that these experiences indicated significant trauma which in and of itself, required additional specialist support and treatment. In particular, Dr Hansen considered Eye Movement Desensitisation Reprocessing (EMDR): Management of trauma, with a development of effective resilience. She made this observation in her report, which requires to be emphasised: </p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;The trauma intervention, such as EMDR needs to account fully for the potential for dissociative symptoms. Failure to do so could lead to trauma therapy, such as EMDR, failing to be effective if dissociative symptoms are not prepared for at the outset or mismanaged during treatment. Consequently, the identified EMDR therapist should assess the dissociative symptoms present with so that this can be managed effectively if required. Essentially the therapist needs to prepare for and accommodate such difficulties. Preparation for the management of any dissociative symptoms should include the treatment of these by the EMDR therapist before moving onto the other aspects of EMDR therapy. [M] may be able to access this via CMHT through a referral from her GP. In terms of length of treatment, this would be determined based upon how she engaged, the number of sessions available to her and her capacity to use the sessions productively.&#8221;</span></p>

Dr Hansen concluded that the programme of work she outlined would <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;at best&#8217;</span> take a period of 12 months from its start. Whilst I accept that timeframe, I feel bound to comment that as Dr Hansen outlined what was contemplated and the therapeutic distance M still has to travel, I felt that there was a degree of optimism underpinning her time estimates.

Insofar as there is a conflict of view in respect of prognosis and treatment between Dr Weir and Dr Hansen, I cannot resolve it, nor for reasons that I will explain below do I consider it necessary to do so.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It may seem inconsistent with much of what I have set out above to say that I have no doubt at all, that M loves her children very much. Even though, she has repeatedly blamed A&#8217;s complaint for the situation the family now finds itself in, she nonetheless describes A as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;her princess&#8217;</span>. She has told me expressly, that she loves her greatly. I do not regard this as manipulative, on the contrary, I see it as entirely genuine. To understand the apparent contradiction requires a careful understanding of what Dr Weir and Dr Hansen have analysed. M&#8217;s psychological functioning causes her to have a distorted perspective on the world in which her genuine and instinctive emotions coexist in parallel with her own carefully constructed and ultimately false narrative. For M, that which is real and that which coexists in consequence of her paranoia, can be accommodated at the same time. The two run separately and entirely disjointedly. The tension that creates causes M distress.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In cross examination, M was repeatedly confronted with occasions on which she has been an aggressor. Whilst she expresses some platitudinous acknowledgment of blame, these wilt under the heat of her unsparing and occasionally, vituperative criticisms of others. In truth she struggles to see any perspective on the world other than her own. It is inevitable and healthy for children to challenge their parents, but challenge causes unsupportable stress for M and, in my judgement, having listened carefully to her, this triggers the construction of a narrative which she finds it easier to live with. When confronted by A&#8217;s assertion of her own teenage autonomy, M perceives this negatively as opposition in which she is obliged to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;pull rank&#8217;</span>, to use her phrase. At similar times in their respective development and for similar reasons, this has caused M to resort to violence against both Q and A. I sensed that this is driven by fear and a need to control and is not simply malicious in the way that it may sometimes have been perceived to be. Thus, M has convinced herself that Q and A both have mental health problems. This is an easier option than confronting her own mental health issues which, on some level, I sense she recognises will expose her to considerable pain and, as Dr Hansen has identified, the reawakening of past trauma. </p>

This has not merely involved 24-hour scrutiny by assessors but has, for over 18 months, included video surveillance. Assessment of this nature and intensity over such a period of time, is, at least to my mind, dehumanising. It is corrosive of personal privacy. All this has occurred in a time of pandemic which carries further restrictions of its own. The fact that M has been prepared to put herself through such a process, reflects both her courage and resolve to reunite her family. She has readily sacrificed her own liberty and freedom. This requires to be acknowledged unambiguously. </p>

She is an intelligent woman. On a conceptual level, she has an educated understanding of the principles of good childcare. Her son has always been clean, appropriately dressed, properly fed, and bathed with love and affection. She has provided him with good, nurturing care and as I have been told, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;lots of eye contact and cuddles&#8217;</span>. At contact sessions (family time), her relationship with T has also been similarly warm and affectionate. There is no doubt amongst any of the professionals, that T loves his mother, although he has become increasingly unsettled by the artificial constraints of their relationship. A has also attended those contact sessions. I have been told that her motivation reflects her protective instinct towards T, rather than a genuine desire to meet with her mother. </p>

Her response remains to hit out, verbally, at others. Despite all this, she has cooperated with Dr Hansen&#8217;s marathon 19 hours of interviews and attended 12 therapy sessions. This leaves me with a clear impression that, at least on an intellectual level, she is highly motivated to care for her children. My assessment of her resonated with Dr Weir&#8217;s view that she is <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;reluctant to take ownership of her problems&#8217;</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;has a tendency to blame others for her difficulties&#8217;</span>. As Dr Weir makes clear, this reluctance to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;take ownership of her problems and tendency to blame others for her difficulties&#8217;</span>, renders her prospects of making <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;meaningful change in the medium term&#8230; extremely limited&#8217;</span>. </p>

Residential assessments most commonly involve parents and very young babies and for relatively short periods. It is important to emphasise, with even greater force, the impact on S. S has been continuously observed by professionals for the whole of his life, barring short periods in foster care. Latterly, and for the past few months, he has been in M&#8217;s care at her home on a supervised basis and then returned at the end of the day to his foster carer. Happily, the foster carer has been the same person throughout. </p>

M said that it was<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;not fair&#8217;</span>, she described S&#8217; routine as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;up the wall&#8217;</span>.

What is surprising, at least to my mind, is that it has not been articulated as unequivocally and more volubly by the professionals. Again, I confess that I am utterly perplexed as to how it was thought acceptable to continue these arrangements for as long as has occurred. I simply cannot reconcile them with S&#8217;s welfare interests. </p>

It is entirely illustrative of what Dr Weir and Dr Hansen have said, that alongside this insight into S&#8217;s needs, exists M&#8217;s own powerful and ultimately overwhelming personal distress. In a pattern which has been observed over many years, M manifests this distress by lashing out at others. She criticises the foster carer who she contends gives S <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;what he wants&#8217;</span>. This was in response to an occasion on which S was plainly fractious and crying.

It is important that I highlight that notwithstanding the advice and guidance M has been given about the dangers of co-sleeping and the fact that there was a serious incident earlier in the assessment process which put S in danger, M again, recently had to be reminded not to fall asleep with her baby. On the 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> April 2022, M had to be prompted three times before putting S in his cot. Reading the logs, I am sympathetic to M&#8217;s distress. M had been trying to get S to sleep and she was plainly tired herself. She did not want to risk waking her son to put him in the cot, but her judgement was compromised. I accept, as Mr Browne points out, that at approaching two years of age, S is no longer at quite the same level of risk were he to fall. That is, of course, not the same as being risk free in a situation which was avoidable. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, it is important that I address M&#8217;s physical health. M suffers from a condition known as extra-cranial arteriovenous malformations (AVM). She was assessed by Dr Stephen Mullin, Consultant Clinical Neuropsychologist. He reported that there was no intracranial component and therefore no risk of any central neurological problem. He considered that M had been <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;remarkably stoic&#8217; </span>about her condition. He found M to be highly articulate, friendly and entirely appropriate throughout the interview. She answered all questions put to her <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;eloquently and well and provided accurate information about the nature of her medical condition&#8230; good recall of information and demonstrated no impairment to reasoning&#8217;.</span> This meeting was the polar opposite to the combative encounter with Dr Weir. Mr Browne leans on it to advance the proposition that those who deal with the mother sensitively and creatively may secure her open cooperation, rather than the responses that have been charted above. Whilst I respect the point made, I am left with the clear view, on the preponderant evidence, that M is entirely capable of being charming when she wishes to be so and especially, when her own &#8216;false narrative&#8217; is not being challenged. Dr Mullin considered that there was no organic means by which AVM could affect M&#8217;s personality or psychological functioning. But, he did emphasise that it is a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;serious physical health condition&#8217;</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;knowledge of having such a condition&#8217;</span> as well as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;the accompanying pain and discomfort&#8217;</span>, may well be highly stressful. </p>

On an intellectual level, she articulates a willingness to participate in what is, on any view, a gruelling therapeutic regime. The first objective of such therapy is to challenge M&#8217;s distorted or delusional perspectives on the world. There is no evidence that process has begun. It is sadly all too clear that the timescales for M&#8217;s therapeutic journey simply cannot be reconciled with S&#8217;s pressing need for and entitlement to secure, loving, and settled family life. At two years of age, and in his circumstances, this can only be achieved within the framework of an adoption. In the not-too-distant future, A will most likely move on to college or university. T has a real prospect of being cared for by his father. Long-term foster care for S would therefore not involve a placement with his half-siblings. It would also not provide him with the security that adoption so frequently achieves for children placed at this age. </p>
