	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is a fact finding hearing in conjoined public and private law proceedings involving two children. They each have the same mother but different fathers. The proceedings have been very long and drawn out for a variety of reasons, not least because this is a retrial following an appeal last year.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The allegations relate to the oldest of the two children, a girl (A) who is now 9 but was only 6 at the time of the original allegations.  There are four adults who are relevant to the proceedings,  the mother, the father, the mother&#8217;s partner (who I shall refer to as SF) and the father&#8217;s partner (who I shall refer to as SM).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother and father were married but separated in 2018 when A was about 4, something that the mother found very difficult. She is somewhat vulnerable, having borderline learning difficulties, but has capacity to instruct solicitors and counsel directly.  A remained living with her mother, but spent time with her father.  The father began a relationship with SM in about 2019.  The relationship between the parents was very difficult with the father reporting the mother to the police for harassment because she visited his house and sent him so many text messages. She was cautioned for this but it is important to say that whilst she harassed the father and SM she was not threatening to them in any way.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There were a number of concerns about the mother&#8217;s care of A. The records state that  she took A to school late, used a pram and a dummy when she was too old for such things, and exposed her to her own distress at the breakdown of the relationship.  Despite a lot of work with her the mother found it difficult to move on.  A was developmentally delayed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In about March 2020 the mother met SF at a social event and shortly after that contacted him on Facebook. A relationship developed quite quickly.  As a vulnerable child A attended school throughout the pandemic.  Not long after the start of the relationship the school began to express worries that A was talking about SF, albeit in positive terms, saying that he took her out by herself &#8216;for treats&#8217;, that he had given her a cuddle or cuddles. He also picked up A from school on occasion. When spoken to, the mother rejected any suggestion that she should be more cautious about SF or that he could pose any harm.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Added to this, in June A was thought to be somewhat withdrawn. There were occasions when she wet herself, and was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection.   For Father&#8217;s Day she drew a card which appeared to be of a figure with a large penis.  In August the father reported that A had what he thought was a red mark on her bottom. A was visited by a police officer and social worker but said nothing of concern about SF, saying that he was fun and he made her laugh.   A s47 investigation was commenced by the local authority and in September by agreement A moved to live with her father during the week, spending weekends with her mother.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In October the father took A to the doctor because of redness in the vaginal area. The GP referred to the father being &#8216;candid&#8217; about A&#8217;s care in the mother&#8217;s home. The GP thought A&#8217;s vaginal area looked unusual and referred her to the SARC.  She also asked A directly whether anyone had touched or played with her and she said no.  The paediatrician at the SARC told the GP in a phone call that the diagnosis was likely to be vulvo-vaginitis.</p>

The father and SM believed it to be worse when A was returned from her mother&#8217;s house.  Swabs and blood tests were carried out but nothing of note was found.</p>

The problem, yet again, appeared to be redness/soreness in the vaginal area. That night the father and SM called NHS 111, the local authority out of hours service and 999 to report that A had said SF had put his finger into her bottom.</p>

She thought that the parents did not seem very caring and that she had the impression that &#8216;they almost wanted there to be something&#8217;.

A appears unwilling to engage despite considerable efforts on behalf of the interviewers, trying to prompt her about being kept safe, and about what she said to others about SF.  Towards the end of the interview the questions become very suggestive and in response to these A said she did not want SF to be at mummy&#8217;s.  She did not seem to want to say anything else about him. There is a marked contrast in A&#8217;s demeanour when she is asked about neutral topics such as her garden and toys.

The ABE Guidance is detailed and complex. But those details and complexities are there for a reason. Experience has demonstrated that very great care is required when interviewing children about allegations of abuse. The Guidance has been formulated and refined over the years by those with particular expertise in the field, including specialists with a deep understanding of how children perceive, recall and articulate their experiences. It would be unrealistic to expect perfection in any investigation. But unless the courts require a high standard, miscarriages of justice will occur and the courts will reach unfair and wrong decisions with profound consequences for children and families</span>.&#8221;</p>

These included A&#8217;s class teacher, her teaching assistant, and a number of other support staff.  I had the transcripts of all this evidence as well as the statements and records that were filed.   There was no challenge to the fact that A made a number of allegations, particularly to her teachers in late January 2021 and thereafter.  These witnesses also gave evidence about things that A had said about SF the previous year and how she had become withdrawn at school.  Although I did not hear from these witnesses I make it clear that I have treated this evidence in the same way as I would have done if they had given evidence before me.</p>

The social worker was challenged about a number of things that she said about the state of the father&#8217;s home and the attitude that she thought they demonstrated about what A had said.  I appreciate that the social work note we have of the visit is not the social worker&#8217;s own but that of her supervisor who spoke to her on the phone immediately afterwards, but it was a full and careful note of what must have been a reasonably long conversation.  The social worker had no dealings with the family before or since, and so her observations are helpful in that they come from someone without any views about one side of the family or another.  I accept what she said about the physical state of the father&#8217;s home, although it does not have any bearing on the findings I am asked to make. I also accept that it was a very busy household seen at a very busy time of the year, with other, boisterous children.  She was obviously struck by the attitude of the father and SM.  Her thoughts about them seeming almost to want there to be something (i.e. in relation to the allegations) are speculative but they are a helpful guide to their demeanour at the time, fitting with the transcripts of the calls to the agencies on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd. </span>. There were a number of things that the police officer did not notice which the social worker did but it does not lead me to the conclusion the social worker&#8217;s recollection was faulty, quite the contrary.  The two professionals had different roles.</p>

To some extent this is understandable given the mother&#8217;s vulnerabilities but I formed the clear impression that he found the concept of another man being involved in the life of his daughter difficult.  Before the mother&#8217;s relationship with SF began he was suspicious of a friend of the mother&#8217;s who babysat A during the evening, suggesting that, as he did not know him from Adam, he could be a paedophile.</p>

The GP was told that A was neglected in the care of her mother, and noted that the father was &#8216;candid&#8217; in his description of the mother in an appointment where A would have been present.  The father was angry about a red mark which he saw on A&#8217;s bottom which he thought showed the shape of a hand, not particularly because he thought she had been hit, but (as he told the court) because he thought she had been hit by SF.  A was asked straight away how she had got the mark (she is said to have said she fell out of bed) and then her bottom was photographed there and then in the bathroom. Even at her young age it seems likely she would have been conscious of her father&#8217;s concerns.  He says that he took two photographs of this injury, one of which showed the handprint that he says was there. Unfortunately he has not been able to find the clearer of the photos (the one which we do have is not clear enough to see anything significant at all).</p>

He went as far as to say that he did not enter the bathroom while A was having a bath even though she was only five years old at the time. His evidence about this did not sit well with the evidence that he had done such things as take a photograph of A&#8217;s bare bottom whilst she was bent over the side of the bath and put lubricant or baby oil onto her bottom by using a type of balloon syringe.</p>

In a different but almost contemporaneous call to social services he stated that SF had been &#8216;going near her bum section&#8217;.

Later in the call, he said that A had said that SF &#8216;touches my bum hole and puts his fingers in my bum hole&#8217;.

It was in some ways an extraordinary account. The father said that he had used baby oil that was put into something which looked rather like a balloon syringe or some sort of an enema device with a tube at the end. He suggested that he had used this device to pour the oil down the crack of her bottom but was adamant that he had not put anything into or near the anus itself. Like the evidence he had given earlier about not involving himself in A&#8217;s intimate care I thought he was dissembling.  The device would have taken a little time to set up and using it in the way the father described did not seem at all likely.  The event was obviously traumatic for A and whether it was the constipation, the use of the device or both, she suffered from pain in her bottom that night.</p>

Whilst he said that adult discussions were not held in front of A she can be heard in the background on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December when the father was on the phone. It is not a big house. I think it highly likely that both the father and SM failed to keep their views about SF hidden from A and that she was well aware of the hostility towards him.</p>

She said that the phone calls to the agencies had been made in a panic and &#8216;once the disclosures were made&#8217;.

As was the case with all the witnesses, she was hampered in her recollections by the passage of time and I thought she sometimes erred on the side of caution when she was asked questions by saying that she did not remember when perhaps there was more that she could say. Sometimes when she was questioned more directly she was able to give more detailed answers.  It took a long time for her to accept that SF could have had the opportunity at least to touch A inappropriately, because she did not believe that he had.   She gave an account of one occasion when SF had used the lavatory when A was in the shower, and she said that she had put a towel around the cubicle and that A was looking the other way.  I thought that this account was somewhat contrived and defensive albeit understandable in the context of the allegations made.  The deceit in relation to the events of 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January shows that she is capable of being dishonest with those in authority.</p>

The relationship between the parents was very difficult, so much so that they had no direct contact with each other.  They were arguing about child maintenance. The father was sensitive about other men being involved in the care of his daughter, and was by this time very suspicious of SF.  In harbouring anxieties about SF he was not alone, for some teachers at school were worried too.  A started talking about SF early in the relationship and the mother said that he took her out alone &#8216;for treats&#8217;.  When making cards for father&#8217;s day, A drew a picture of a figure with a large penis and did not respond when asked about it.  In the summer of 2020 when the relationship had started she had become withdrawn and was wetting herself.  The school deputy safeguarding lead said that A told her that SF went into her bedroom and that the mother had been defensive about this. The records suggest that the school were worried because SF picked up A from school (albeit there seems to be no evidence he did this more than once).</p>

Of course I note that this evidence was given a very long time later and it may have been that they either did not remember much of what happened that night or they thought they should keep the account short.  At this hearing I have had the advantage of having recordings from a number (albeit not all) of the calls made to the agencies that night, in addition to the notes from the police officer, social worker and the SARC. The picture painted by all of these records is of a much longer and more drawn out series of events.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The history that was recorded when A was examined at the SARC was that she made the allegation in response to being asked about why she was red or sore in her vaginal area. The transcripts of the various calls contain accounts of several things apparently being said by A and also reveal efforts being made to relieve her constipation.  At one point A is described as being on the lavatory and at another recovering downstairs. None of this could have happened in just a few minutes. In his oral evidence about what was contained in the transcripts the father spoke of A making some of her allegations when she settled down and they could &#8216;get some sense&#8217; out of her.</p>

The best guide to what happened is from the contemporaneous records but it is also instructive that in his police statement the father&#8217;s account was that A had made a remark which led him to feel that she had been sexually abused.</p>

It chimes strongly with what she said to the police and social worker two days later, and it also fits with the father saying things like &#8216;he&#8217;s been going near her arse&#8217; to the call handler.  It explains what the father said to the police. What I cannot find is that this comment was made spontaneously for it seems to me just as likely that it was made in response to a question.  That was the background explanation recorded in the SARC report.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">No doubt the statement by A was interpreted by the father as the allegation of sexual abuse which he believed had been happening all along.  He was plainly very angry indeed, making a series of calls to the authorities within a short time.  Neither the father or SM are reliable historians as to what they said to A, or she said to them, and in that context I think it very likely that the interpretation that each gave to what A said, and to what she said in response is likely to have been strongly affected by the views they already held.  This applies to everything that A is recorded by them as having said that night.</p>

She could have been in no doubt that the adults in charge of her believed she had been hurt by SF.  Nonetheless, when she told the police officer and social worker on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December that SF had put his finger up her bottom she described it in the context of toileting.  The social worker was right to be cautious as to whether A was in fact making an allegation of sexual abuse. It is notable that what A said that day about her mother and SF was very similar to what had actually happened with her father and SM, and that all three adults deny having touched her anus at all, in any context.</p>

But the circumstances affecting the reliability of her accounts remained. She was living with her father and SM.  After 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January she was no longer able to see her mother at home, something which upset her and needed to be explained.

Between 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>  December and 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January A was seen five times by a social worker with two of these visits also being attended by the police.  She was encouraged to share any worries she had and it was explained to her that she needed to be kept safe.  Whilst I understand that A needed some sort of an explanation as to what was going on it is unfortunate that all this happened in the absence of an early ABE interview.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The allegation made by A on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January shows she has an awareness of the views of adults that her mother had done something wrong although she said she did not know what that was. In the same conversation she then said that SF touched her private parts.   She was then seen again by a social worker on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, then on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January she was seen for a pre ABE discussion (which it plainly was, however labelled) by the police officer and the allocated social worker.   There are some notes of this discussion albeit they are not contemporaneous. The questions were not recorded in breach of ABE guidance but given that the same officer asked such leading and suggestive questions in the recorded interview a few days later it is not difficult to infer that the same happened here.  It is recorded in the notes that A said that SF poked her in the vagina over her dress  when her mother was in the room, and that it had happened twice.  On 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> February, after a lot of prompting by the interviewers  A stated that SF touched her with his finger on her vagina under her dress.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgement the allegations made on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January and thereafter are all affected by the same issues of reliability as those which were made on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> and 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December.  With the passage of time in her father&#8217;s home, the fact she could no longer see her mother at home and the intensive involvement of professionals would have been likely to embed in A&#8217;s mind the belief that it was not safe to go to her mother&#8217;s home because of SF, and that SF was a risk to her.  A was surrounded by adults who believed she had been sexually abused and it is hardly surprising that her accounts of SF became more negative and anxious, and that she repeated to teachers that he had hurt, touched and poked her.  As Hughes J (as he then was) recognised in the paragraph of <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B </span> cited above, past experience has told us that children in these circumstances can be suggestible, eager to please and poor historians whose words can easily be misinterpreted by adults.

There is no account of SF saying anything to her before or during an act of assault, or otherwise behaving in a sexual way in front of her, something which is sadly a feature of some cases.  She talks of being followed around, and being touched and &#8216;poked&#8217;.  Whilst I do not think much turns on the discrepancies between being touched on the bottom or the vaginal area, the accounts of where it has happened and whether or not her mother was there have changed as have her views of SF himself.</p>

The examination on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> December was normal, meaning that there is no medical evidence to support or refute the allegation. A suffered from redness in the vaginal area both before SF came on the scene as well as afterwards, and from some of what is written in the medical notes there may be a physical explanation for this. The GP referred A to the SARC in October 2020 but the paediatrician believed she was likely to be suffering from vulvo-vaginitis (albeit this diagnosis was made over the phone). A still continues to have some problems with redness, soreness and urinary tract infections although she has had no contact with SF for a considerable time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are some signs that A was unsettled and/or withdrawn during the course of 2020, but such observations are very non-specific and could be explained by a number of things, for example the tension between her parents, the arrival of a new boyfriend, or even problems in her father&#8217;s home (there seem to have been some problems involving SM&#8217;s children by a previous partner).  A was unwell with a urine infection in June which could account for the wetting.  She had a red mark on her bottom for which there was no clear explanation but she never suggested that SF or indeed anyone else was responsible.  The father and SM state that the mark was clearly a handprint but the photograph he produced does not show it and he cannot find the photograph which he says is clearer.  In any event the father is so fixed in his views about SF that I find his recollection and interpretation of what he saw is not reliable.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are no accounts of A demonstrating sexualised behaviour apart from one occasion when it is said she drew a picture of a figure with a huge penis. This happened around the time of father&#8217;s day (which would have been in June 2020).  It is difficult for me to place any reliance on this in circumstances where the picture was not retained by the school and there is no evidence specifically to connect it with SF.  She could have seen SF naked in her mother&#8217;s home, but equally there were a number of males sharing one bathroom with A and SM in her father&#8217;s home.</p>

I also thought that they each tried to minimise the number of times SF might have gone into A&#8217;s bedroom or used the bathroom when A was in the shower.  Nonetheless breaking orders or lying about these matters does not make the allegations of sexual abuse true, or even more likely to be true. In my experience people who are innocent do sometimes break agreements that they do not think are necessary, tailor their evidence or lie to try and cast themselves in the best possible light. There is no evidence about SF which suggests that he has a sexual interest in children or, aside from these allegations, that he has behaved in a sexually inappropriate way with anyone. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Therefore, taking into account all of the evidence I have heard and read, I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that A has been sexually abused by SF or at all.   It is more likely than not that her allegations have been brought about by the influence of the adults around her which in turn is likely to have affected her own perception of what had happened to her.  It is important to be clear that in saying this I am not for one moment saying that A is lying. In a case such as this involving a young and vulnerable child the proposal by anyone that that the only alternative to the allegations being true is that the child is lying is misleading and unhelpful.  Young children, especially children like A, are easily influenced by those in charge of them, and suggestible.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother is undoubtedly a vulnerable adult and the alarm of professionals at the arrival of a new partner was entirely understandable, although there is some force in Ms Sutherland&#8217;s submissions that the professionals seemed to be quick to criticise the mother and accept what the father was saying at face value. Nonetheless I would not wish to castigate the professionals&#8217; concern about A and what she was saying, as vulnerable women with young children can, very sadly, be a target for paedophiles. Allegations made by children in the context of bitter parental disputes are particularly complex, however, and the importance of professionals keeping careful records and an open mind cannot be over-emphasized.  Nowhere is this more important than when a child is being spoken to by a social worker and/or the police.  The ABE guidelines are there for a reason, and it is profoundly worrying that,  notwithstanding numerous judgements from the family courts, that there are still so many cases where they are not followed. The risk of contamination of evidence leading to an unjust result either way is grave for everyone concerned, most importantly of all for the children involved.</p>

I do not blame the father for being concerned that the mother might be taken advantage of but there is a fine line to be drawn between being concerned and being overbearing.  In his views about SF he has been dogmatic and opinionated from the beginning.</p>

It is very difficult to know what effect this will have on their relationship in the future, especially as she is likely to believe she has been hurt by SF.  There is evidence that A has found the arrival of her maternal half sibling and the fact that she lives with the mother full time very difficult, and this is hardly surprising.  These are all matters which will need careful handling in the future.</p>
