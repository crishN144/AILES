H said he did not think much of the videos his father had sent him, declined to write to F or to record a voice note, still less to engage in a video call.  He said it had been a long time since he had seen F, and that he could no longer remember what he was like or what it had been like when he did see him in the UAE.

In the intervening period the forensic landscape has changed out of all recognition. Amongst the many advances is the advent of the smart phone and of social media in all its forms. Of particular relevance in this context is the almost universal use of email as a means of instant communication. Another development of relevance is that as a result of the withdrawal of legal aid in the majority of private law cases, a large proportion of parents are unrepresented and therefore do not have, as the judge described it in the present case, the &#8216;steadying influence&#8217; of legal advisors.</span></p>

Such behaviour may be the result of anxiety but in other cases, as in this case, it is part of a campaign of behaviour by one parent against the other which amounts to a deeply disturbing form of oppressive behaviour on their part.</span></p>

All too often such communications are ill-considered and ill-judged with the consequence that every minor dispute or misunderstanding is met with an application to the judge. More importantly, the distress and anxiety caused to the other parent and to the children at the centre of such a raging dispute cannot be overestimated, nor can the damaging consequences where the focus of the litigation veers away from what, on any objective view, would and should be regarded as the real issues going to the welfare of the children concerned.</span></p>

The risk that harm may arise to a child under the age of 18 unless the making of applications is restrained is not qualified by words such as &#8220;serious&#8221; or &#8220;significant&#8221; and neither is the degree of harm that a child may experience. I observe that, insofar as the risk that harm may arise to a child is concerned, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/91" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 91</ref>A(2) sits a little uneasily alongside guideline 7 of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Garamond">Re P</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond"> guidelines which states that there must be a &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:Garamond">serious risk </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">[my emphasis]</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond"> that, without the imposition of the restriction, the child or primary carers will be subject to unacceptable strain&#8221;.

In fact, the CG would </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">&#8216;actually encourage [F] to make a further application to this court to spend time with H, in the future when he is older,&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> contemplating that there may be a time, away from the pressure of the court proceedings, as H starts to grow up, when </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">&#8216;he may start to ask questions about his identity and his father which may lead him to feel more open to contact with [F] in the future.&#8217;</span></p>

In that oral evidence, the CG confirmed her view that the proceedings had had a negative impact on H, leaving him frustrated, sometimes distressed, because he perceives that nobody is listening to him.  If a further application were made, the further emotional impact on him would be </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">&#8216;considerable&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.  It would not be appropriate, the CG thought, for F to make another application in the next year.

The CG confirmed her view that the emotional impact on M of these proceedings has also been </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">&#8216;considerable&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.  In cross-examination, the CG indicated that she considered that F had not behaved unreasonably during the proceedings in this country and did not consider his litigation conduct in the UAE to be a matter to concern this court, not least as the Dubai courts do not seem to have raised concern about his conduct there.  She was not troubled by the fact that F was telling the Dubai court that H was wrongfully retained and so should be returned to the Emirates, as that was different to what he was asking this court for, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">viz.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> indirect contact.  Pushed by Miss Miller to agree that it would be positively detrimental for H for a further application to be made not just during the next year but for a longer period, for example, two years, the CG said it would be difficult to know where H would be then, and did not move from her view that one </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">&#8216;can definitely say that the situation won&#8217;t have changed in the next year&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.

After the marriage, the abuse comprised a course of terrorising M through prolific court proceedings in the Emirates, in which F sought to control and punish M, not least by attempts to achieve outcomes which &#8211; if successful &#8211; would have acted significantly to H&#8217;s detriment (reducing alimony, seeking M&#8217;s imprisonment, making unfounded allegations in order to remove H from her custody).  Also after the marriage, F&#8217;s actions as found, were abusive not only to M, but must have impacted on H, both indirectly, through the impact on M&#8217;s capacity to provide attentive care, and, in some instances, directly, for example, by reducing M&#8217;s access to provisions and finances and by playing a part in her and H&#8217;s spending time in unpleasant conditions in a police station.</span></p>

He has demonstrated neither remorse in relation to nor insight into his behaviour towards her.  No less troublingly for the purposes of these proceedings, he has no insight in relation to the multi-layered impact of this on his son.  H will have been affected by what he witnessed of parental discord and his father&#8217;s abusive treatment of his mother.  He will have been affected by the difficulties of his life with his mother after separation.  He will certainly have been affected, in the view he holds of his father, by the impact on him, H, of the effects of his father&#8217;s ongoing behaviour on his primary caregiver.  Given what I have seen of the ongoing litigation in the UAE, it seems abundantly clear to me that F&#8217;s use of court proceedings in order to instil fear, upset and anxiety in M continues, largely unabated.  It so happens that these proceedings have been underway in the UAE rather than England; but that does not prevent there from being an adverse impact on M, albeit that she is currently safe from the fear of enforcement or civil or criminal penalty.</span></p>

Nothing resembling an apology to M has been forthcoming in the sixteen months since my judgment.

He has no particular physical or educational needs.  His other needs should be reviewed in light of his extraordinary life experiences to date.  He was initially brought up in affluent conditions, albeit that he was almost certainly exposed to some elements of his parents&#8217; abusive relationship.  He then lived in the UAE with his mother in separate accommodation to his father, before spending a significant period in significantly reduced circumstances in the equivalent of a women&#8217;s refuge, moving then to a hotel, then to an apartment building.  He spent overnight with his mother in a police station in highly traumatic circumstances.  He was almost certainly aware of both his mother&#8217;s financial difficulties and his parents&#8217; conflict.  During that time, by all accounts, while he saw fairly little of his father, he enjoyed a close and loving relationship with him.  He then moved, suddenly, to England and has not seen his father now for nearly 3&#189; years.</span></p>

The reasons for H&#8217;s sustained refusal are probably several in number and interlinked in a complex manner.  H is likely to have adverse memories of parts of his life in the UAE.  As he has grown older, he is likely to have become aware that his father was responsible for many of these.  It is likely that his mother has been unable to hide from him her own dislike of the father, or the fact that his father has also mistreated her.  It is likely that &#8211; whether intentionally, subconsciously, or somewhere between the two, the mother has found it simply impossible to promote H&#8217;s having a real relationship with his father, for the straightforward reason that, in herself and born of her own sustained abusive experiences of F &#8211; she does not believe that it is in H&#8217;s interests to have such a relationship.  It is not possible for me to determine in what proportion these various ingredients have combined to produce the current situation.  The simple fact, however, is that H is not prepared to have the contact with his father, which his welfare would otherwise dictate, and the process of adults and professionals seeking to force him into this has begun to cause harm in itself.</span></p>

However, looking more broadly, perhaps more purposively, at this potential criterion, it is important to note (a) that at the fact-finding I found F to have used court proceedings in another jurisdiction in a punitive and coercive way, to have engaged dishonestly in such proceedings at times, and to have sought in those proceedings results which would have positively detrimental to his son, (b) that I have found in this current judgment that F has continued to litigate unreasonably and with abusive intent in the UAE, and (c) that F does not accept at any level either any of my findings against him, or that he bears any responsibility for the position in which he finds himself.  The CG considers that F has not behaved other than properly in these proceedings.  I do not agree.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">I am struck by the duration and consistency of H&#8217;s obduracy, by the length of time for which he has been exposed to these proceedings, and by the extent, as I assess it, of M&#8217;s current (and largely subjectively justified) antipathy towards F.  I do not anticipate any particularly &#8216;quick fix&#8217;.  H has just turned nine years old.  It seems to me that, given that the vast majority of his consciously remembered childhood has been overshadowed by parental conflict, he should be afforded a fairly significant period of time in which, if change is to come, it comes from him.  I do not consider that a year is likely to be a long enough period for that.  Moreover, the danger of such a short period may be that, if emotions have not sufficiently calmed, the expiry of the term serves almost as an invitation to reapply.  There is no magic to numbers such as these, even if they are carefully chosen, but the appropriate term, in my view, is two and a half years.  On my reckoning, this would coincide with H being about to finish his last year at primary school.  At 11&#189; years old, H will be at or somewhere close to the point of beginning his adolescence, with all of the attendant drift towards independence of mind and opinion involved.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">In this case, there is no particular stellar factor which has caused me to impose the order, and so there is no single issue, the resolution of which would properly or necessarily open the way to a further application within the currency of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.91(14)</ref> order.  However, certain factors have weighed heavily in favour of my decision.  The resolution of some of these are beyond F&#8217;s reach.  Others, though, are within it.  F&#8217;s inability or refusal to acknowledge his abusive behaviour towards M, or the impact of this on M and, directly and indirectly, on H, represents a real and ongoing impediment to progress.  Further, F&#8217;s persistent litigation in the UAE is a factor which will stand in the way of positive change for as long as it endures.  This litigation seems to include, for no obvious beneficial reason to himself, the quest for the fine outstanding against M to reach ever higher levels (precluding her ever returning to the UAE, which can only reduce to infinitesimal levels the chance of H ever being able to travel there during his minority).  Moreover, given that F has accepted, at least as a matter of fact and law, that H is habitually resident in England, that the English court considers itself to have sole jurisdiction in relation to H, and that, given my unappealed findings, there is no sensible question but that H will continue to live with his mother, to continue to state otherwise, or at least to litigate on an alternative footing in the UAE, can only be counter-productive in relation to what should be the more important quest, that is to create an environment in which H (and his mother) can contemplate the rebirth of H&#8217;s relationship with his father.  At a more basic level, if F is able to settle into a routine of sending H messages, in whatever medium is most likely to engage him, and reflecting what F has been told by M or H currently interests him, if he is able to maintain this, even if there is little reciprocation for a prolonged period, then he will be doing his best to create fertile ground for positive change.</span></p>
