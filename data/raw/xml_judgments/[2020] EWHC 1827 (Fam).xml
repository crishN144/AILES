	      <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0.12in">This is an application by the local authority for an order under the inherent jurisdiction for a deprivation of liberty authorisation. The case came before me in the urgent applications list last week. The situation is so pressing that another hearing was arranged on Monday morning, 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June, and I give this short judgment on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July.   <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Background</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0.12in">This is a very troubling case concerning a young person (Z) who is just thirteen years old.   Until last October Z was living at home with the mother and father. Z came to the attention of the local authority as a result of absconding from school, and also failing to return home.  </p>
	    </content>

	  <paragraph eId="para_3">
	    <num>3.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0.12in">Matters quickly escalated, and Z needed to be accommodated by the local authority.  Three placements broke down because it was impossible to meet Z&#8217;s needs or to manage the behaviour associated with those needs. It is not necessary here to detail that behaviour but only to record that it included serious actual and threatened physical harm to others, self harm, and damage to property. The seriousness of the situations arising had led to involvement by the police. At one point Z was handcuffed to the bed. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0.12in">Unsurprisingly, the local authority commenced care proceedings and an interim care order was made on 14th November together with a secure accommodation order which was renewed on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December.   Z was placed at a Secure Unit (&#8216;the Unit&#8217;) and remains there to date.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0.12in">On 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March the Secure Accommodation order was extended by His Honour Judge Atkins for a period of 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"/>months until 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September. That order remains in force.  I note it was made on the grounds that the child had a history of absconding and that if Z did abscond was likely to suffer significant harm.  The order was unopposed by the parents and supported by Z&#8217;s guardian.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0.12in">Hopes that Z&#8217;s presentation would improve in the secure environment of the Unit have sadly not been borne out.  If anything Z&#8217;s behaviour has escalated . Again it is not necessary to recite the detail here but rather to record that the episodes involving actual and threatened physical harm both in relation to self harm and  harm to others have been at a more  serious level than those referred to above at paragraph 3.  Managing Z&#8217;s needs has also become more difficult and it is a matter of real concern that on one occasion when restraint was required, Z sustained physical injury requiring hospital treatment as a result. Another consequence of the escalating situation is that Z had not been able to have the opportunity to spend time with peers at the unit </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0.12in">This is a really troubling situation for such a young child. Z has been assessed by Dr T , a Consultant Clinical Psychologist, and also by a Consultant Psychiatrist, but it is not considered that Z is suffering from a mental illness. The underlying reasons for Z&#8217;s extremely dysregulated behaviour are unknown, but it may well be due to some sort of trauma, characterised as developmental trauma. Z has intrusive thoughts, hyperarousal, and avoidant behaviour.     </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0.12in">Throughout the time at the Unit, Z has expressed a wish not to have contact with the parents. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0.12in">On 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May, the Unit gave notice to the local authority that they wished to terminate the placement as they did not consider they were able to meet Z&#8217;s needs or to keep Z safe.   </p>
	    </content>
	  </paragraph>
	  <paragraph eId="para_10">
	    <num>10.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0.24in">Since that time the local authority has made very extensive searches to find a suitable secure placement for Z.  Over 30 institutions have been approached (including in Scotland) via a central agency, but despite daily calls and updates, nothing is available. It is said that there are some 40 children awaiting secure placements at the current time. The local authority has not confined itself to regulated secure accommodation but has also enquired with unregulated homes, to which they would propose adding a suitable support package.  Nothing has borne fruit. </p>

This has now almost come to an end. The local authority has come to the conclusion that the only possible contingency plan is to place Z in a council home rented, by them, together with four members of staff who are available to care for and contain Z at all times.  The restrictions that the local authority ask the court to sanction are set out in the statement of the assistant team manager, and further in a local authority document filed by counsel on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June. The proposal is that Z is not allowed out at all, save for appointments when there will be an escort of three staff.  Z is to be locked into a bedroom at night, and the house will be locked at all times.  Z will be stripped of all loose items, and restrained in the event of attempted self-harm, attempts to harm others, or to escape. All furniture within each room will be secured to the floor or wall.  </p>

She is clear that a secure placement is necessary to keep Z safe, and that there is a requirement for physical and emotional containment before any meaningful trauma focussed therapy can begin.  She is very firmly of the view that Z&#8217;s needs are far beyond the parents&#8217; ability at this moment and that they would not be able to keep Z safe or ensure the safety of others.  She set out a number of gaps that she believes are in the contingency care plan which she asked to be addressed. They are practical ones, but hugely important, such as how the property itself will be kept fully secure, and what will happen if, for example there are staff shortages.  Following on from her request, she has been taken on a virtual tour of the property, and has had time to discuss and consider the practical details of the plan with the social work team.  In her most recent position statement she has stated that she considers the present plan to be sufficiently safe and secure.  </p>

In its submissions to this court, the ALC was rightly anxious to preserve the use of what it called "imaginative arrangements" &#8211; the arrangements characterised by Hayden J in Re SS as "the creative alternative packages of support" &#8211; and was concerned they would be squeezed out by too wide a definition of "secure accommodation". The recasting of the interpretation of the relevant criteria under s.25 suggested in this judgment preserves the flexible approach advocated by the ALC. If the court determining an application under s.25 is obliged to conduct an evaluation of welfare and an assessment of proportionality, and in doing so applies the principle that a secure accommodation order should always be a last resort, the court will be under an obligation to consider alternative arrangements. </p>

I reject Mr Feehan's submission that the time for assessment as to whether the relevant criteria are satisfied is immediately before emergency protective measures are taken. That interpretation would have the consequence that, once a court was satisfied that the criteria had been met at the point where the application under s.25 was filed, the court would be obliged at a subsequent hearing to make an order under s.25 even if the likelihood of absconding and/or significant harm had abated. Such an interpretation would be plainly contrary to the terms of s.25 itself which prohibits a child being kept in secure accommodation unless the statutory criteria are satisfied. </p>

But by no means all of these children will fall within the criteria set out in section 25(1)(a) and (b), which are the gateway to the authorisation of secure accommodation. It seems unlikely that the legislation was intended to operate in such a way as to prevent a local authority from providing such a child with the care that he or she needs, but an unduly wide interpretation of "secure accommodation" would potentially have this effect. It is possible to imagine a child who has no history, so far, of absconding, and who is not likely actually to injure himself or anyone else, so does not satisfy section 25(1)(a) or (b), but who, for other good reasons to do with his own welfare, needs to be kept in confined circumstances." </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in;margin-right:0in">It is well established that a judge exercising the inherent jurisdiction of the court with respect to children has power to direct that the child be detained in circumstances that amounts to a deprivation of liberty. Where the local authority cannot apply under s.25 because one or more of the relevant criteria are not satisfied, it may be able to apply for leave to apply for an order depriving the child of liberty under the inherent jurisdiction if there is reasonable cause to believe that the child is likely to suffer significant harm if the order is not granted: s.100(4) Children Act.

I accept the recommendation of the local authority and guardian that returning Z to the care of the parents is simply not a safe or sensible option.  Z has refused to see the parents for many months. Moreover, it is hard to see that they could possibly keep Z from running away, self harming, or harming other people (including themselves).  This is what Z has repeatedly being doing over many months. This is how Z came to be the subject of care proceedings and then a secure accommodation order in the first place.  I appreciate how worried the parents are, but to make an order that permitted a return home would be reckless with Z&#8217;s safety and welfare.  I should say too that there are no creative, or other, solutions either which would not place Z at an unacceptable risk of harm.  </p>
