	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case has a range of complexities, both factual and legal.  The hearing occupied three days of court time.  I had to reserve judgment overnight following submissions.  As will become apparent (see discussion of children&#8217;s objections below) the relationship between the mother and T has become strained in recent weeks.  Therefore, by agreement between the parties, I reserved judgment for an extended period of four days so that the mother could have contact with T and her brothers here in England before either party (or the children) knew the outcome of the hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It appears that the family lived reasonably frugally; on the father&#8217;s account they were at times &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">completely broke</span>&#8221;, the father not earning greatly from his music, and the mother working only periodically, doing some translating and teaching; the couple received benefits and credits (see below re: e-mails), and (according to the mother) relied to some extent on borrowings.  It was nonetheless the family routine, certainly from 2002, for the mother to take the children to Spain for holidays during each summer, to see her family, often &#8211; indeed, as I understand it, invariably &#8211; without the father.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The children (as will be apparent through my later discussion of the &#8216;objections&#8217; of the older three) are bright, engaging and amiable.  T and N are inter-changeably bi-lingual in Spanish and English; L and A less so (for A English is probably his marginally stronger suit).  In July 2012, L and A were attending the junior school local to the family home; T had also attended the same school but in the academic year beginning in September 2011, she had moved to P senior school where she had obtained a scholarship.  A was said to be top of his class at school in the year to July 2012.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is relevant to the background history to note that (on the parents&#8217; collective account) T&#8217;s first academic year at P school (2011/2012) was affected by the fact that she was occasionally bullied.  This reached its peak in April 2012 when T joined a week long residential school trip; this trip was, from her point of view, an unhappy experience, and on her return she was miserable.   The father told me that she cried the whole journey home from O (from where the father had collected her at the end of the trip) to the family home at B.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parental relationship appears to have been a turbulent one almost from the early days of T&#8217;s life (2000), and on both parties&#8217; accounts deteriorated significantly after the birth of L (2002/3).  The father described home life as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">unbearable</span>&#8221; for much of the children&#8217;s childhoods, with endless &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">hostilities</span>&#8221; and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">aggression</span>&#8221;.  The relationship became, he said, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">destructive</span>&#8221;.  The father refers to the fact that the parents occupied separate bedrooms for most of the last 10 years of their relationship, the mother sharing a room with the three younger children; difficulties with communication are said to have endured throughout the relationship.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Relations appear to have become particularly difficult in 2011 when the father broke his wrist; this took its toll on him physically (given his professional occupation as a musician) and emotionally; he described how this had &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">almost destroyed</span>&#8221; him.  This caused or exacerbated depression for the father (as he recorded in his statement and acknowledged in his e-mail to the mother).  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The relationship finally disintegrated in early 2012.  The father described it in this way when giving oral evidence: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">[M] and I were in such a bad situation</span>&#8221; (evidence in chief); &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">we had broken up; tensions were very high; we were constantly arguing&#8230;</span>&#8221; &#8230; &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">it had been hell for years</span>&#8221; (cross-examination).  I accept those accounts.  The children were inevitably exposed to the discord, and, on the father&#8217;s case, T aligned herself with her mother against him.  The father&#8217;s case, which I accept, is that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the children were becoming increasingly disturbed by the home situation</span>&#8221;; the mother agreed, contending that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the children were starting to suffer psychologically</span>&#8221;.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Over the weeks of early 2012, the parties reviewed and, in my judgment, regularly discussed their options. The father proposed that the couple should separate (see the e-mails of 16 September, 18 &amp; 20 December confirming this below).  The father says that he suggested that he move out of the home leaving the mother there; the mother indicated that the father had told her to leave the house and obtain council accommodation, though he disputed this.  The mother&#8217;s evidence was that she had proposed that she should return to Spain with the children.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father acknowledged that the mother had in their many arguments &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">threatened</span>&#8221; to leave B, and return permanently to Spain, though recognised that in 2012 these &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">threats</span>&#8217; were qualitatively different.  He told me that he accepted &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">that the situation felt different to previous years because our relationship had essentially ended</span>&#8221;.  I must decide whether these were merely &#8216;threats&#8217;, or whether these were statements of clear intent, as the mother contends.  I must further evaluate the father&#8217;s response to them; the mother contends that the father agreed to the relocation.  I deal with this below. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Overall, I am satisfied on the evidence I have heard and read that there were a number of discussions &#8211; often fragmented and bad-tempered I expect &#8211; between the parties over the early months of 2012 about their longer-term futures.  During this period, the father describes himself as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">not really thinking clearly</span>&#8221;, and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">depressed</span>&#8221;.  In my assessment, that is probably right.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother maintains (though there is no written confirmation of this) that she told the headmistress of the junior school that the boys would be leaving the school, and on the last day of term took in the school uniform for re-sale; as she was friends with the headmistress, she was released from any need to give formal notification.  Somewhat to the surprise (and discernible irritation) of P School, the mother gave them written notice of T leaving only on the last day of their summer term.   </p>

He recognised that they would probably not be back before the beginning of term, as they had always been in previous years, and did not want to &#8216;pin&#8217; the mother down to a firm date or commitment about her return, as he wanted to maximise the prospect that she would choose in her own time to rekindle the relationship.</p>

The mother made arrangements for the children to commence school, telling me that the parents had earlier agreed to the children attending bi-lingual schools: accordingly, T joined the local Instituto , while the boys attended a local Collegio Publico .  Over the following weeks, unsurprisingly, the children made friends (at least this is what T told Ms Vivian, a point acknowledged by the father).  I note that at the end of term, T was reported to have had &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">a good school performance and always showed a perfect adaptation to the course and the Academy</span>&#8221;, she &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">can be described as an excellent student, very participative and has always shown a great interest in the different subjects</span>&#8221;.

In the circumstances, it has been helpful for me to review a number of contemporaneously generated documents in the relevant period to try to assess the true position.  The parties e-mailed each other in this period; a selection of these communications have been placed before me, and analysed by counsel, each seeking to draw from them points which (they say) support their respective cases.  </p>

The basis of objection is that of return to the State of habitual residence rather than simply to the care of the applicant (see per Balcombe LJ in </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re S (A minor)(Abduction: Custody Rights)</span><span style="font-style:italic"> [1993] Fam 242 [1993] 2WLR 775 sub nom </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">S v S (Child Abduction) (Child&#8217;s views)</span><span style="font-style:italic"> [1992] 2FLR 492 at 250 and 499 respectively.

In relation to this question and, in any event, in relation to the exercise of the courts discretion once satisfied the objection is established, the court analyses on the evidence before it the grounds on which the child&#8217;s objections are based in order to determine and weigh the strength, soundness and validity of those reasons against the background of the overall purpose of the Hague Convention, namely one of prompt return to the country of habitual residence so that the courts of that country may determine the question of custody and residence on the basis of a full welfare investigation.</span>&#8221;</p>

It is a well constructed, articulate, and powerfully argued plea to remain living in England.  In this e-mail, T identifies various aspects of her life in Spain which she found less than satisfactory, in particular: (a) the lack of notice of their removal; (b) poor educational standards; (c) low levels of &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">attention and care</span>&#8221; from their mother; (d) the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">temporary</span>&#8221; nature of their home; (e) the emotional pressure being placed on them by their mother who in the e-mail at one point T refers to by her first name.  </p>

Our education is looking positive and the boys will all have the chance I had to get a bursary at a good school, which I had but have now lost because of our mother.  All our needs are being addressed and we are content and settled.  None of us have anything against our mother, so I am sure that we would all be fine with going to see our mother every holiday, as she has made it very clear that she will never set foot in England again.

Unsurprisingly, in the circumstances, the mother raised issue with the authorship and derivation of that e-mail, and at the pre-trial review raised a question as to how this should be investigated.  I caused Ms Vivian to re-interview the children, directing that she should specifically discuss with T the authorship of the e-mail.  Ms Vivian conducted these interviews (even from reading the second report, I sensed a little reluctantly) on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2013.  </p>

I would, therefore, respectfully agree with Thorpe LJ in the passage quoted in para 32 above, save for the word "overriding" if it suggests that the Convention objectives should always be given more weight than the other considerations. Sometimes they should and sometimes they should not. </span></p>

The Convention itself has defined when a child must be returned and when she need not be. Thereafter the weight to be given to Convention considerations and to the interests of the child will vary enormously</span><span style="font-style:italic">. The extent to which it will be appropriate to investigate those welfare considerations will also vary. But the further away one gets from the speedy return envisaged by the Convention, the less weighty those general Convention considerations must be. </span></p>

It was not the policy of the Convention that children should be put at serious risk of harm or placed in intolerable situations. In consent or acquiescence cases, on the other hand, general considerations of comity and confidence, particular considerations relating to the speed of legal proceedings and approach to relocation in the home country, and individual considerations relating to the particular child might point to a speedy return so that her future can be decided in her home country. </span></p>

The exception itself is brought into play when only two conditions are met: first, that the child herself objects to being returned and second, that she has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of her views. These days, and especially in the light of article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, courts increasingly consider it appropriate to take account of a child's views. Taking account does not mean that those views are always determinative or even presumptively so. Once the discretion comes into play, the court may have to consider the nature and strength of the child's objections, the extent to which they are "authentically her own" or the product of the influence of the abducting parent, the extent to which they coincide or are at odds with other considerations which are relevant to her welfare</span><span style="font-style:italic">, as well as the general Convention considerations referred to earlier. The older the child, the greater the weight that her objections are likely to carry.
