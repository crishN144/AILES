	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am concerned with a teenager who is the subject of proceedings brought by a local authority and who is also a ward of court. I propose to say nothing more about the circumstances of the case &#8211; which is allocated to another judge of the Division &#8211; except to note that radicalisation is an issue in the proceedings.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The specific issue with which I am concerned arises out of the fact that the teenager was approached by an officer of the Security Service &#8211; see the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/5" uk:canonical="1989 c. 5" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Security Service Act 1989</ref> as amended &#8211; acting in the course of that officer&#8217;s exercise of functions as an officer of the Security Service. That approach, so far as I can see, was entirely proper. The concern about what happened arises solely because the officer&#8217;s approach was to someone who is a ward of court. When the local authority became aware of what had happened, it wrote to the Security Service suggesting that the approach should not have taken place without the prior authority of the court and that the officer was at serious risk of being in contempt of court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is quite clear to me, though I do not for obvious reasons propose to elaborate the point, that there is a pressing need, having regard both to the interests of the ward and of the operational requirements of the Security Service, that there should be no identification either of the ward or of the local authority. I have therefore taken the unusual step of concealing in this judgment the case number, the dates of the hearings (which were not listed) and the names of Leading Counsel and of those who instruct them. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue with which I am concerned lies at the intersection of two well-known principles of wardship law. One, long-established, is that no &#8220;important&#8221; or &#8220;major&#8221; step in the life of a ward can be taken without first obtaining the approval of the wardship judge. The other, more recently recognised, is that the wardship court cannot exercise its powers, however wide they may be, so as to intervene on the merits in an area of concern entrusted by law to another public authority. Not much reflection is needed to appreciate the potential for tension between these two principles. The present case is a good example.</p>

It matters not that the chosen public authority is one which acts administratively whereas the court, if seized by the same matter, would act judicially. If Parliament in an area of concern defined by statute (the area in this case being the care of children in need or trouble) prefers power to be exercised administratively instead of judicially, so be it. The courts must be careful in that area to avoid assuming a supervisory role or reviewing power over the merits of decisions taken administratively by the selected public authority.&#8221;</p>

If there is abuse of the power, there can of course be judicial review pursuant to RSC Ord 53: but no abuse of power has been, or could be, suggested in this case.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;When an infant becomes a ward of court, control over the person of the infant is vested in the judges of the Chancery Division of the High Court. It is for the judge to say by order from time to time where the ward is to reside and with whom, and disobedience to such an order is contempt of court by anyone who knowingly breaches or is party to a breach of that order. Moreover, even without any judge&#8217;s order forbidding it, it is a contempt to remove a ward outside the jurisdiction of the High Court. It is, however, quite obvious that there are circumstances in which control over the person of a ward is not committed or referred to the judge but is by the law of England committed or referred to another agency or person. As a simple illustration, it could not be contended that the judge would have any jurisdiction to order that a criminal ward be transferred from place of detention A to place of detention B, however much of the medical evidence before the judge suggested that the ward would be in better health at place of detention B. The reason is that the jurisdiction of the judge over the person of the ward is necessarily restricted by the fact that the law has given that aspect of control over the ward&#8217;s person exclusively to another agency. Similarly, the judge would have no right to complain of or countermand a lawful posting overseas of a ward who was in the armed forces. The law refers the military control of the ward to the military authorities. Similarly, any lawful deportation order affecting a ward must be outside the normal position which I have mentioned already, that a ward must not leave the jurisdiction without permission of the judge; indeed, it would override any existing express order of the judge in the wardship proceedings that the infant was not to depart from the jurisdiction.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;This principle we would state in the following terms. Children, whether wards of court or not, are citizens owing duties to society as a whole (including other children), which are appropriate to their years and understanding. Those duties are defined both by the common law and by statute. In the context of the conduct of criminal proceedings in court, the definition and enforcement of these duties have been entrusted by law exclusively to the court in which the proceedings are being conducted and it is not for the wardship court, whatever the theoretical scope of its jurisdiction, to use that jurisdiction to interfere with the performance by the criminal courts of their lawful duties. If it were thought that the criminal courts had insufficient discretion to enable them to balance the public interest in the welfare of child witnesses, whether or not wards of court, against the public interest in the achievement of justice between the state and the accused, the remedy lies not in the exercise of the wardship jurisdiction, which could only assist wards, but in the conferment of new and wider discretions upon the criminal courts.&#8221;</p>

Indeed, the result of it could lead to the direct involvement of the ward in criminal proceedings, a fact which could be regarded as detrimental to his or her interests. It is, therefore, clearly a step of considerable importance in the life of any child. Similarly, if the police are to interview and conduct medical examinations of the wards then leave of the court must first be given. Such medical examinations do not have a therapeutic purpose, but a forensic purpose and, as in the case of the disclosure of the medical records and the video recordings, they may lead to the wards&#8217; direct involvement in subsequent proceedings. But if leave is given for the disclosure of those records and video recordings it seems to me that it must follow that leave must also be given to the police to conduct interviews with and, if necessary, examinations of, the wards. Having enabled the police to start upon an inquiry it would not be realistic, save in exceptional and presently unforeseen circumstances, to impose such limits upon them.&#8221;</p>

Similarly, the police work in close co-operation with social services departments in whose care children have been placed and obtain the consent of the department (as in this case) before interviewing a child in care. It is accepted also that, in the case of a ward of court, leave should be obtained from the wardship court before an interview by the police takes place.&#8221;</p>

The Crown Prosecution Service will, of course, consider any representation that may be made by a parent or a local authority about the potential adverse impact upon a child of having to give evidence. This may be one of the matters to be considered in deciding whether or not to proceed with particular charges, but the discretion is vested in the prosecuting authority rather than the parent or the local authority. In the present case, it is said further, an extraordinary and anomalous situation would arise, if the wardship court were to intervene, because the minors might be &#8220;protected&#8221; from the operation of the statutory rules governing the compellability of witnesses, whereas the other children involved in the case would have no similar protection.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;I have no doubt that I should decline to exercise the wardship jurisdiction by either giving leave for the minors to be called as witnesses or by giving a direction in the matter in another form. In my judgment, it is neither necessary nor appropriate in child abuse cases for the Crown Prosecution Service to seek the leave of the wardship court to call a ward as a witness either before or after committal proceedings.</p>

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">It is necessary, first of all, to set my conclusion in its proper context. In many cases, the wardship court is likely to be involved at an early stage because leave will have to be sought for the police to interview a ward. In such circumstances it is inevitable that the court will have to perform a balancing exercise, weighing the potential damage to the child against the public interest, as a responsible parent would do. In reaching a decision, the best interests of a child may not be the first and paramount consideration, for reasons that I have sufficiently explained. It is clear also that the court will have in mind that, if leave to interview the child is granted, a prosecution based on the child&#8217;s evidence, at least in part, may ensue.&#8221;</p>

To do so would be to invoke powers not possessed by any responsible parent or custodian of a child. More seriously, it would involve the court ultimately in assessment of matters of policy and discretion that are vested by law in the prosecuting authority as a branch of the executive. </p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The argument against intervention by the wardship court is even more overwhelming, in my judgment, once the prosecution has been set in train. By that time the defendants will have been arrested and charged, and may (as in this case) have been detained in custody. The procedure to be followed is strictly prescribed by statute, as I have outlined earlier in this judgment, and the limits of the discretion in relation to the calling of witnesses whose statements have been tendered are closely defined. On the other hand, a defendant has a virtually unfettered right to call as a witness anyone who can give relevant and admissible evidence on his behalf. If the wardship court were to attempt to intervene in this process, it could lead to conflict between it and the Crown Court, to the prejudice of the administration of justice generally, and could result in disparate treatment of child witnesses, despite the express statutory provisions dealing with them. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">For all these reasons, therefore, I rule that it is unnecessary for this court to give leave for the minors to be called as witnesses in the pending trial of their parents, and that it would be inappropriate to do so. I prefer not to base my decision on consideration of the theoretical limits of the wardship jurisdiction because it is unwise and undesirable to attempt to define them. It is more correct, in my judgment, to refuse to invoke the wardship jurisdiction for the purpose of granting leave or giving a direction because it would be contrary to public policy to do so. In my view, this conclusion conforms with the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">In re Mohamed Arif (An Infant)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1968] Ch 643" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1968">[1968] Ch 643</ref>.&#8221;</p>

First, what if a policeman, having stopped a 17-year old, wants to talk to him on the pavement, or, having arrested him, wants to interview him at the police station, but is then told: &#8220;You cannot do this, I am a ward of court.&#8221; What is the policeman to do? Secondly, supposing that a sensitive ongoing police investigation relates to someone &#8211; the ward&#8217;s estranged parent for example &#8211; who is party to the wardship proceedings but is someone who, from the police perspective, should not be alerted to what is going on, is that person nonetheless to be served?</p>

The Registrar&#8217;s Direction of 18 July 1988 <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1988] 2 FLR 260" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1988">[1988] 2 FLR 260</ref> endeavoured to give guidance and instructions in circumstances where it becomes necessary for the police to seek to interview a child who is a ward of court either as a potential witness or as a victim of a crime or more particularly as a suspect. The Direction sought to take into account the practical difficulties arising where as a matter of urgency it was necessary that the police should take immediate action &#8230; However, I am told that the police are still in doubts as to what their duties are in relation to a minor who in fact is a ward whom they wish to investigate for alleged complicity in a crime, that is to say, to interview him as a suspect. It is strongly contended on behalf of the police that there ought not to be any special requirement laid upon them in those circumstances over and beyond the duties which are laid down as of general application to juveniles by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/60" uk:canonical="1984 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984</ref>.</p>

In the majority of cases there will be no time, in any event, to seek the court&#8217;s leave before the interviewing of a minor in such circumstances. Provided that the requirements of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/60" uk:canonical="1984 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984</ref> with regard to juveniles are complied with, the duty upon the police is discharged. They have no extra duty to perform. There is, of course, a duty upon those having the care of the minor to inform the court at the earliest practical opportunity of what has taken, place, but there is no further duty upon the police themselves in those circumstances. At this stage I do not consider that it would be appropriate for me to be thought to amend, as it were, the Practice Directions dealing with the interviewing of wards. It is my intention that the whole matter should be considered in the light of the representations and submissions which have been made to me today and I have indicated to counsel for the Official Solicitor and to counsel for the Metropolitan Police Commissioner that it would be helpful if representations were to be made administratively to me identifying the particular difficulties which are perceived at present. It is clear that there are misunderstandings and I am assured that the police are anxious fully and properly to discharge their duties. They are anxious for assistance in order to make their position clear. Accordingly, I do not propose to give an instant &#8216;Practice Direction&#8217; at this stage. I make it clear for their assistance that when they arrest a minor who in fact is a ward then they may properly proceed to interview him in accordance with their normal procedure provided of course that they comply with the provisions relating to all juveniles under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/60" uk:canonical="1984 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984</ref>. It will then be for the person having charge of the minor to notify the court of what is taking place or has taken place.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">It must be remembered, however, that the status of wardship is important and because the court is involved its interest cannot be overlooked. The court must maintain its authority over the minor and over significant events which affect the minor. It is for that reason that I believe the matter should be further considered so that a satisfactory overall direction may be given. It is probably desirable for the sake of clarity that the position of a ward as a suspect or potential defendant should be dealt with separately from that of a ward whom it is desired to interview for other purposes, for example, as a witness. I will, therefore, take time for consultation and consideration. In due course, I hope that a further Practice Direction may be issued which will clarify the matters which are at present giving rise to concern. For the moment, however, I wish to make it clear that the court cannot relieve the police or any other person from the general duty of seeking the leave or consent of the court before taking steps which significantly affect the life of a ward of court.</p>

It is contact in circumstances where the current protective arrangements for the mother remain in place. That outcome is directly contrary to the decision that has been taken by police, and it would require the police to act in a manner which overrides that very decision. Whilst it is submitted that that outcome may be achieved by a declaration or by an injunction &#8211; and I have already noted that counsel have avoided submitting that it should be achieved by quashing the decision &#8211; the reality is that this court would have to quash the police decision or otherwise set it aside or otherwise grant a mandatory judicial review order requiring the police to act in a way that is contrary to the decision that they have made. Such a claim is, in my view, a public law claim and the only procedure by which the claimants (the father and the grandparents) can bring that claim before the court is under the umbrella of judicial review.&#8221;</p>

With great respect, I think that Booth J was wrong to hold that there was, and the subsequent authorities, where the point was not in fact argued, take the matter no further. For the reasons explained in <span style="font-style:italic">Regina (Kadhim) v Brent London Borough Council Housing Benefit Review Board</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] QB 955" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] QB 955</ref>, even the clearly stated view of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">In re R (Wardship: Criminal Proceedings) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1991] Fam 56" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1991">[1991] Fam 56</ref> is not determinative.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The reality, of course, is that, in very large measure, the asserted principle or rule that judicial consent is required before the police can interview a ward of court has been hollowed out, almost to the point of extinction, first by the Practice Direction of 1988 (now PD12D, paras 5.4 and 5.5) and even more so by the subsequent decisions of Ewbank J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (A Minor)</span> [1990] FCR 469 and, even more significant in its impact, of Sir Stephen Brown P in <span style="font-style:italic">Re G; Re R Note (Wards) (Police Interviews)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1990] 2 FLR 347" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1990">[1990] 2 FLR 347</ref>.</p>

The concerns raised by the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police as long ago as 1990 (concerns which I can well understand and which prompted Sir Stephen Brown P to think that a further Practice Direction might be needed to clarify the matters giving rise to concern) have not been appropriately addressed, although they remain at least as valid today as 27 years ago; and the world continues to be presented with a Practice Direction which in significant part is, in my judgment, simply wrong and which in any event cannot properly be understood unless read in conjunction with what Sir Stephen Brown P said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re G; Re R Note (Wards) (Police Interviews)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1990] 2 FLR 347" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1990">[1990] 2 FLR 347</ref>.</p>

This is really a matter for another day, but in principle I cannot see how the fact that the local authority is exercising its statutory powers in either of these ways under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/5" uk:canonical="1989 c. 5" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> can either privilege the child over a child who is not the subject of such arrangements or prevent another statutory agency such as the police or the Security Service from exercising its powers in precisely the same way as they would in relation to a child who is not the subject of such arrangements. The fact that, in a sense, a local authority may be acting as a corporate, statutory parent, does not, vis-a-vis the police or the Security Service or any other agency, put the local authority in any different or more powerful position than a natural parent. So, unless the legislative framework governing the functions of the relevant agency requires, for example, consultation with or consent from a parent (as in <span style="font-style:italic">In re A (A Minor) (Wardship: Police Caution)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1989] Fam 103" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1989">[1989] Fam 103</ref>), a statutory agency is not required to consult with, let alone obtain the consent of, the local authority. It must, as a matter of principle, be for the relevant agency, not the local authority, to decide how it should act. This is the principle which, for example, we see in action where a child in care is living with its mother in a prison mother and baby unit (see <span style="font-style:italic">Islington London Borough Council v TM</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2004/2050" uk:canonical="[2004] EWHC 2050 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWHC 2050 (Fam)</ref>) or subject to immigration control (see <span style="font-style:italic">R (Anton) v Secretary of State for the Home Department; Re Anton</span> [2004] EWHC 2730/2731 (Admin/Fam), <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 2 FLR 818" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 2 FLR 818</ref>) or involved in proceedings in SENDIST (see <span style="font-style:italic">X County Council v DW, PW and SW</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2005/162" uk:canonical="[2005] EWHC 162 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] EWHC 162 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 2 FLR 508" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 2 FLR 508</ref>).</p>
