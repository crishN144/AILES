The mother was granted leave to withdraw the application to permanently remove the child from the jurisdiction. The Court ordered interim supervised contact with the father and adjourned the matter part heard. On 7 February 2019, the matter returned part heard. The mother agreed to parental responsibility for the father. The Court heard live evidence and found the father had adequately addressed the issues raised in the s7 report and did not need further therapy; that the mother would continue to expose the child to anxieties about the father and that she needed to take steps to move on beyond past events; that the poor parental relationship exposed the child to a risk of harm, and; that it was in her interests for contact to move on in a more natural form. The Court suggested mediation. The mother sought an opportunity for a summer holiday overseas but this was refused by the Court and the undertaking was repeated not to remove from the jurisdiction. Ultimately, the Court ordered contact moving to overnight unsupervised contact from June 2019. The application was further adjourned to consider the extension of contact and the mother&#8217;s request to be released from her undertaking with respect to travel.</span></p>

The first relates to the mother expressing concern as to the child returning from contact without underwear whilst at the same time permitting the child to sleep without underwear. The mother makes clear she is in no way suggesting this was sexual impropriety. The second relates to the allegations made by the child to the school. The mother does not seek to establish the truth of these allegations and accepts the account given of this being a dream. I am asked to consider a &#8216;YouTube&#8217; live stream from 18 December 2020 in which the father references the mother and child [</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">video 2</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">]</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">.</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt"> The father denies he was responsible for uploading the video.

The applications came before the Lay Magistrates on 16 April 2021. They recorded an agreement as to interim indirect contact and re-listed the matter before a District Judge with appropriate directions including a police disclosure order. At the hearing on 9 August 2021 the father asked the Judge to immediately return to the final order of HHJ Jacklin KC. The mother proposed a return to supervised contact in a centre. The issue of recordings being posted online was once again raised. The father was ordered to take all steps to remove any videos relating to the child from the internet. A section 7 report was ordered and DRA fixed. I heard evidence as to the mother &#8216;wrongly&#8217; removing the child from school on 20 March 2021 when the father planned to attend school to remove the child for contact. I will need to consider this but the mother&#8217;s case is that this happened on a day after the father had applied to the Court to enforce the DDJ Wicks order and prior to the First Hearing of the application. As such it was wrong for the father to propose to action the contact by turning up and taking the child. </span></p>

The Court continued the interim indirect contact and appointed a guardian to represent the child. At a hearing on 8 March 2022 a Recorder directed the appointment of a psychologist (Dr F) to undertake a child and family assessment.

The mother also agreed for the father to be put on the child&#8217;s birth certificate on the basis of his assurance that he would not seek travel documents for her or seek to change her name.

In any event the mother claims the child was unwilling to go as the father had been abusive following the last contact on 30 December 2023. The father argues this was the mother obstructing contact. I have previously expressed the view that I do not read the orders to require safeguarding as a pre-requisite to contact on this occasion. Contact was due to take place on 27 January 2024. On the day prior to this the mother claimed she was hospitalised and had to cancel the contact. There is a dispute between the parents as to whether this is (a) true, and; (b) a justification for cancelling contact.

Although the same were not available at the hearing, my understanding was that they did not prevent contact. My understanding was correct. In any event the mother complied with my order and the overnight contact took place. The father took the child to Brighton and there are a number of issues arising out of the contact. Following the contact, the child has expressed strong opposition to seeing her father. She has expressed an intention to self-harm to her school and on the guardian&#8217;s advice it was recommended she attend hospital. The mother duly took her to A&amp;E. These circumstances are a matter of dispute. The child was referred to counselling. The next contact on 23 March 2024 did not happen.</span></p>

Equally I understand the mother&#8217;s case to focus on the continuing misconduct of the father and I must be alive to the impact on an individual of such behaviour, and particularly so where that meets the description of being domestically abusive whether that abuse is at an emotional or physical level. Such abuse can cause an individual to lose confidence in themselves and can lead to decision making which may be viewed objectively as questionable but can be seen to be explicable in the circumstances subjectively faced by the individual.

The ordinary process of reasoning will draw the judge to consider a number of other matters, such as the consistency of the account with known facts, with previous accounts given by the witness, with other evidence, and with the overall probabilities. However, in a case where the facts are not likely to be primarily found in contemporaneous documents the assessment of credibility can quite properly include the impression made upon the court by the witness, with due allowance being made for the pressures that may arise from the process of giving evidence. Indeed, in family cases, where the question is not only &#8216;what happened in the past?&#8217; but also &#8216;what may happen in the future?,&#8217; a witness&#8217;s demeanour may offer important information to the court about what sort of a person the witness truly is, and consequently whether an account of past events or future intentions is likely to be reliable.</span></p>

Finally, I have regard to the fact that pursuant to participation directions all questions of the mother on behalf of the father were asked by the Court on his behalf. I appreciate this creates a sense of imbalance in that the father was professionally examined in a more combative manner than was the case for the mother. This may lead to the risk of the mother being viewed in a more positive light. However, I would note the following: (i) I consider the questioning of the father was both fair and appropriate, and; (ii) whilst I received 104 questions from the father subject to the removal of a very modest number, which were essentially duplication, and to some structural rewording I asked all of the questions.</span></p>

It is striking that he holds himself out in as a professional communicator yet he appeared wholly unable to follow the clearest instructions and requests from me to give his evidence in a direct and focused manner. He consistently responded in a discursive manner and I ultimately reached the conclusion this was evasive in character with him shaping his responses to fit his narrative rather than the questions being put to him. By the conclusion of his evidence, I was no doubt he was choosing to repeat his narrative as he did not want to answer the questions being put for fear they would damage his case. The father also appeared unable to contain himself at times. Whilst giving respect to the emotion of the hearing he at times felt compelled to stand when giving evidence (although I had not required him to do so) and often acted out in somewhat extravagant manner when giving his evidence. I did not find this helpful. The role of a witness is to provide focused and direct answers not to engage in rhetorical flourishes. The father seemed unable to appreciate this when this point was drawn to his attention. Additionally, I was also struck by elements of contradiction in his evidence and I was far from impressed by the manner in which he drip fed information into the hearing. I have other concerns in his regard which are more substantive in nature and which will be addressed in my analysis below.</span></p>

In this regard the father is correct. However, the mother&#8217;s point is a different one. She was shielding due to a specific medical vulnerability. I accept this. I heard evidence as to her suffering from asthma and this is plainly a respiratory condition which would have raised concern at that time. I also heard evidence from the father that he was volunteering during this period delivering parcels. It is not difficult to see how a combination of these factors would have impacted on contact. The guidance makes clear any decision making in this regard would be subject to later Court oversight. Having applied this oversight, I can understand the father&#8217;s feelings on the subject but the circumstances do not warrant criticism of the mother. In any event I am satisfied the mother modified her position when the guidance changed.</span></p>

There is no doubt the child did speak to a teacher suggesting her father jumped on her and strangled her. The mother does not seek to prove this allegation, the father denies the same and there is no supporting physical evidence, although the same might be expected. There is also no question the child within a brief period of time was making clear this was a dream not an actual event. It seems clear those involved in initial safeguarding accepted this revision and took no steps to stop the contact due to happen that day. What is less clear is as to whether the child had a motivation to mislead the school or exaggerate a genuine but innocent event. There is within the evidence a range of occasions when the child can be seen to give an account which does not chime with the supporting evidence and appears to be a possible exaggeration of events. I enquired with the mother as to her daughter&#8217;s personality in this regard but she denied there were any issues. However, by the end of the evidence she did appear to accept there were occasions on which the child had given an incorrect account. It seems to me the options for the Court are as follows: (i) the child gave a true and genuine account of an assault; (ii) the child gave a wholly misleading and untrue account for reasons unrelated to the mother; (iii) the child gave a misleading account at the instigation of her mother; (iv) the child was misunderstood in the first instance and this was cleared up on further consideration. As should be clear I am discounting option (i). In any event the contact proceeded. It might be thought this somewhat undermines option (iii) for if this was said at the instigation of the mother and presumably to stifle contact then it is surprising she did not make more of it.</span></p>

I have viewed and listened to these a number of times. In essence they amount to a process of the father recording the child whilst questioning her and obtaining answers as regards various allegations said to have been made by the child. The child is at times distressed and at other times demonstrates little emotion notwithstanding the content of the conversation. The father relies on this evidence as proving the mother told the child to say these things which were untrue. </span></p>

She said she had been panicking about this all night. She told the officer her father had told her he would not drop her back to her mother and would keep her for three months. She told the officer that things written about her mum were not true and that she had been &#8216;auditioned&#8217; so she knew what to say.

The purpose of this guidance is to ensure reliable evidence is obtained. The guidance recognises the very real risk if a careful and structured approach is not taken. It is well understood that a full recording of all interactions with the child is required and there is focus on open and non-leading questions.

I note the following: (i) I clearly do not have a full account of this process. It is evident there was some level of interaction prior to the recording. This raises the risk that the process has been staged as suggested by the police or that there has been &#8216;auditioning&#8217; as suggested by the child. Contrary to the father&#8217;s evidence the child suggests the process continued over more than 1 day; (ii) The questions are leading and highly repetitive. There is little benefit in getting information to be simply repeated as one cannot say whether the subsequent account is a consequence of the earlier account having been given or for some other reason. At points the father presses the child to provide information in a most unhelpful manner; (iii) The father introduces loaded observations around &#8216;bullying&#8217; and the mother &#8216;persuading the child.&#8217; The fact the child then uses these concepts is of no probative value. By the end of the recording the father is directing the child to speak of her mother as a &#8216;bully;&#8217; (iv) I am troubled by the child&#8217;s emotional state. It appears she is highly distressed at the start of the process and once again at the end. In between she appears to lack any meaningful emotion. I am concerned this supports the notion of this being staged. There is no sense in her answers that the child is reliving an actual experience. (v) I simply cannot know when the &#8216;three lies&#8217; recorded in the video were first discussed or what was said and done at that time. There is a real danger of the father having staged this process to obtain information he has already provided to the child. Plainly this fundamentally undermines any benefit from the same; (vi) At times the father can be seen to be in a somewhat elevated emotional state. This is unhelpful in that it may have caused the child to shape her answers to fix with the father&#8217;s wishes. At times he speaks about his own feelings and this has the obvious potential to impact on the information he receives.</span></p>

The child gives the police a clear account of this being staged by the father and this concern is shared by the police. Having viewed the video, I agree with this assessment. The problems with the process undertaken by the father are on their own so significant as to reduce any value that can be obtained from the recording.</span></p>

It is difficult to reconcile this report with the father&#8217;s case of the child volunteering the information and of him not making such a threat. Unfortunately for the father this goes some way to explaining why the child might say things to satisfy the father whether true or not. My views in this regard are supported by the evidence of the father. When I asked him as to what he thought might happen when the police attended he was clear he felt there was a real potential they would leave the child with him whilst investigations were undertaken. I am confident at some point the father said this to the child. This is why she reported the suggestion to the police. It is clear the father became irritated when the police did not support his approach and appeared to doubt his actions. I consider this reflects his growing understanding that the child would be returned home despite the evidence he had obtained.</span></p>

It is depressing to hear her tell him that she loves both her parents and does not want to hurt their feelings. This observation entirely bypasses the father.

Second, the father elsewhere describes himself as &#8216;straight&#8217; (meaning honest). The child uses the same word when prompted by the father to describe him during the recording.

This was a wholly inappropriate process and served no benefit whatsoever. That the father could not apply a child focused approach and avoid the temptation he succumbed to is a concern. It paints the father as an individual who prioritise the litigation (and succeeding in the same) over his daughter&#8217;s wellbeing. The father has not, and I question whether he has the capacity to do so, reflected on this event and how this might have shaped in part his daughter&#8217;s opposition to spending time with him. It should not require great insight as a parent or empathy with the position of a child to realise that child will seek to avoid contact which becomes an evidence gathering event.</span></p>

He names the mother and comments that she </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">will</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt"> watch the video. By this point the content is purely related to this litigation. He calls the mother &#8216;evil and twisted.&#8217; He refers to himself as a &#8216;straight&#8217; man. He tells the mother &#8216;she will pay the price.&#8217; He tells her to watch his eyes. He says, &#8216;he is a bad enemy.&#8217; He talks about previous behaviour where he has attended the property of people that &#8216;fuck with him&#8217; and &#8216;kicked the door off the hinges.&#8217; He says he is an &#8216;extreme character&#8217; and can easily come to the house and smash to the door off the hinges. Her car can be smashed up. It was wholly inappropriate for the father to discuss the case in the manner he did on this video. It is far from clear he had any meaningful control over those who could access the video. At the date of the hearing, it was still available to be viewed. The father gave me an explanation of some other unknown person uploading the video. I found this explanation unlikely. In any event it appears to have now been either removed or restricted as to accessibility. It is clear the father believed the mother would watch the stream. In such circumstances his words were threatening to her. Bizarrely the father criticised the mother for accessing this stream and placing the contents before the Court. I struggle to understand his complaint when in any event he stated he knew she would be watching the contents before proceeding to threaten her. The sense of the video is that the father has a high opinion of himself and he appears to look down on the mother. In the course of the hearing, he made a number of gratuitous references to his personal wealth. When listening to him my sense was that he was aiming this at the mother who lives under more financially strained circumstances. These various observations and actions bore a somewhat narcissistic quality.</span></p>

In video 3 he is recorded and can be heard to repeatedly say &#8216;where is my daughter&#8217; and &#8216;don&#8217;t hit my daughter&#8217;. He shouts to the child &#8216;are you safe,&#8217; &#8216;is your mum bullying you,&#8217; &#8216;is your mother forcing you to lie.&#8217; He repeatedly bangs on the front door. The police are called.

This attendance was in the midst of the single agency assessment and the father had only 7 days earlier spoke about how he might act. The sense is of the mother being anxious whilst talking to the police. Even allowing for a degree of frustration this was unacceptable. Once again, the father appears to have had no insight into how this might impact on the child. Further in the light of his comments during the YouTube stream his attendance would justifiably have caused the mother some level of concern. His words were entirely performative in nature and seemed to meet his own needs rather than those of his child.</span></p>

It had not arisen in a vacuum but out of the concerning events of October and December 2020. In the circumstances the mother was entitled to act as she did.</span></p>

As noted above contact had been planned for this day but had to be cancelled. I received an explanation for this attendance which I found to be wholly incredible. Whilst it is clear NK is a close friend to the father and is described as an &#8216;uncle&#8217; to the child he has no biological connection to her. The evidence as to his prior meetings with the child was somewhat unclear but it seems he had only met her on about three/four previous occasions. He had no relationship with the mother whatsoever. He told me he had been at the father&#8217;s home a few days earlier and whilst there a children&#8217;s party was taking place. The child was not present. Whilst in a particular room he saw some presents, some of which bore the name of the child. He decided it would be a nice idea if he took these presents and delivered them to the child on behalf of the father. He did not tell the father he was doing this. He thought this would be a &#8216;nice surprise.&#8217; The father agrees he was not told. He then went to the home but the mother would not allow him access to see the child and he left the presents and went away. He told me the father was angry when he found out what had happened.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">This was frankly incredible. After all the father was due to have birthday contact on that day and the contact was cancelled at the last moment. It is unclear on what basis NK would consider he had the authority to take the items (prior to that day) and deliver them himself. It seems likely if the contact had happened then the father would have delivered the presents. Yet I received no evidence as to any discussion when the father became aware some valuable items had been removed from his house. I am in little doubt NK attended the property at the direction of the father. It might be thought this was not the most concerning decision to take and it is clear NK in no way misconducted himself when at the property. Why then has the father denied having any involvement? The answer to this is tolerably clear. In a &#8216;Zoom&#8217; call the next day (</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">video 5</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">) the child references NK attending and that this had spoiled her party. The father denies any involvement in the same. I consider it is likely the father has become trapped in this account and feels he cannot now give a truthful account. In my assessment there would be room for a truthful account of the attendance without this placing the father in a position of significant criticism. In the course of the hearing there was debate as to whether the attendance could have delayed attendance at the party. The father makes the point that the attendance was only for a relatively brief period. What he appears to miss is that the mother might have been unhappy to leave the property for some time after this not knowing if NK was in the vicinity.</span></p>

But it does raise questions as to his decision making. Ultimately this contact session descends into a process of questioning as to what had happened and becomes somewhat confrontational. At 16mins 50secs he tells her he is tired of her disrespect. He then tells her she has been lying. The child terminates the call. The irony of all of this is that  I find it was the father who was in fact lying to the child during this call and I have the sense she may well have been aware of the same. Once again this will have undermined the relationship between the two. It would have been much better for the father to own up to the decision and explain why he wanted her to get her presents on her birthday. If this had been his response then I would not be required to analyse this event within this judgment.</span></p>

It would seem that for me to accept the father&#8217;s case I would have to accept the note but reject its content in this regard. I bear in mind there is little evidential value in the fact that the mother&#8217;s name is associated with the text message on the father&#8217;s phone. Plainly this arises because he has assigned her name to this number. But this does not answer the question as to whether the messages came from the mother. It is noteworthy this message is a stark lone communication between the parties. This is not a case in which I have been shown multiple communications of this type.</span></p>

The father terminates the call. It is clear to me the child was not being disrespectful when she referred to her father as &#8216;bro&#8217; whatever his feelings on the subject. It is disappointing he was unable to deploy an alternative strategy to move beyond this. Rather he became fixated in obtaining an apology at all costs. This can be seen to be a pattern of the father showing a lack of judgment and reflection and an inability to put himself into the shoes of the child. The father has only got himself to blame for the way in which this contact deteriorated. This was not the fault of the mother or child. But each of these experiences will have coloured the child&#8217;s attitude to her father.</span></p>

The child looks in the direction of the message as this is a natural response as the notification appears on screen. I accept her evidence as being both credible and likely.

She has in fact provided medical documents to the Court and guardian and these do explain her basis for believing she would not be available for handover on the Saturday. She explained how there is no third party who she can rely on to facilitate the handover and this is partly due to the father&#8217;s behaviour. She does not want to share private medical information with the father. I have previously explained to the father that the Court has received the disclosure and that there is no need for the documents to be disclosed to him. Whilst the father claims the mother has poor mental health it is far from clear the factual basis on which he bases this opinion given his limited relationship with her. Certainly, the medical documents do not relate to mental health concerns but more routine medical issues. They do not touch on child care. I made this clear to the father and made it clear I would keep this under review. However, in my view the father has sought to weaponise a level of ill health on the part of the mother and I can understand why she does not want to share with him personal information which frankly has no relevance to the issues before me. Further the mother gave evidence that she offered the following weekend in place of the lost weekend. The father did not challenge this.</span></p>

He appears to be holding a piece of paper (likely the Court order) and his phone; (ii) The video has audio. I can hear knocking at the door and other traffic sounds. Yet at no point do I hear the child shout out as claimed even though the father says he could hear this coming from the house; (iii) There is nothing in the father&#8217;s conduct to suggest he has heard his daughter should as claimed. Having seen him on other occasions I am surprised that were this truthfully the case that he would not have been making a point about this whether by shouting to the child or in some other way. He gives absolutely no sense of being worried for her wellbeing; (iv) On balance it appears he does kick the door, both with the front (38secs) and heel of his shoe (41secs). I have seen photographs of a damaged lock. It is likely the father caused this. The police have not charged but they operate to a different standard; (v) As to the knife allegation. I have seen the still photographs and I can see the basis on which this allegation is made. The picture quality is poor and there does seem to be a long item in the mother&#8217;s hand. However, on balance I am not persuaded as: (a) the quality is poor and I agree this may be a shadow rather than a knife, and; (b) the police have commented on this allegation and do not support the allegation of the mother having a knife. They certainly do not claim to have been scared as a result; (vi) However, even were I to have found the mother had a knife would this really advance the father&#8217;s case? He does not seem to have considered the impact he must have been having on her to arguably lead to her picking up a knife when she opened the front door. In any event there is no suggestion the mother was threatening in her behaviour. Given my rejection of so many parts of this account I am not satisfied in this regard either.</span></p>

In any event the contact took place. Sadly, there were real issues. I am told the contact started with the child swearing at the father. The mother told me her understanding was the child swore in response to the father swearing at her. The father gives an account of the child being physically frightened as shown by her physical response in cowering away from him. Apparently, the child when asked expressed the wish to go home and watch videos. Instead, the father drove to Brighton. It appears throughout this journey there was no conversation between the father and child. It is difficult to imagine what the child understood would happen. The father claims matters improved in Brighton although she would not permit a nice photograph to be taken and was acting. He blamed the mother for sending the child with a phone and smartwatch and there being communications between the mother and child over the course of the weekend. The father took the smart watch from the child and only returned it in the course of the final hearing.

They contacted me on 21 March 2024 to say that [the Child] was visibly trembling with anger; that she was in a distressed state and said that if she has to go to her dad&#8217;s this weekend, she will kill herself; that she will &#8220;never be able to escape him as he will never give up;&#8221; that her father sees her as his &#8220;possession;&#8221; that her life &#8220;isn&#8217;t worth living anymore and she would be better off dead.&#8221; [The child] was taken to A&amp;E that evening, where [the mother] was told that [the child] would be placed higher on the waiting list for CAHMS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services). A Safeguarding Referral was made by the school (and No Further Action taken by the Local Authority). [The child] was sent home with her mother. She returned to school the following Monday and has presented as ok in school since.</span></p>

He seemed to have no ability to reflect on what it would feel like for the child to travel to Brighton without warning or even a clear explanation of what they were doing. Taking her personal items from her will not have helped. This will have been seen as a sanction for no good reason. I do not find the father made the threats alleged as the evidence is not sufficient to do so. I consider there is a possibility the child may have either exaggerated this or made up this account to further reinforce her wish not to have further contact. The father suggests the mother has either encouraged or persuaded the child to make these threats of self-harm. I will return to this below.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">What the child would want at this time is very much in dispute. The father places responsibility for the child&#8217;s expressed views with the mother and considers she has instigated  or encouraged everything said by the child. As with all cases it is important to keep in mind that a child&#8217;s expressed wishes and feelings are not deterministic of outcome and must be assessed in the light of the child&#8217;s age and understanding. A child nearing 11 years of age has a voice that demands to be heard whether or not followed.  In this case I consider the expressed wishes are a function of this child&#8217;s lived experience. Having reviewed all the evidence and been taken through a number of recordings (largely at the request of the father) I can easily understand the stresses and anxieties that have come to be placed on this child&#8217;s shoulders and which are likely to have contributed to her own views. This is most unfortunate. There is within the evidence grounds for believing the child would welcome a positive approach to contact. I have viewed contact in which she has been willing to engage and my sense is that she does love both her parents. She expressed her dilemma as noted above in the October recording. Yet repeatedly she has been placed into an intolerable position. No-one should be surprised if she now opts for a stark solution which removes this from her. In bearing in mind her age and understanding I reflect on the child I see in the most recent contact sessions. She appears to me to be perhaps more mature than her chronological age and she clearly understands what this is all about. The guardian has naturally provided me with the clear views of the child and her current opposition to contact. As with the guardian I do not simply follow these wishes but I do give them real weight. I judge for contact to now work it will require the child to support the contact and to see evidence of a change on the part of her father. I am concerned that were I to simply ignore her views then contact would not proceed and the parents would be left to continue to pass the blame. I also consider the child&#8217;s understanding is currently shaped by the sense that she is not being listened to and she is viewing matters through the particular prism of recent events. I accept the mother&#8217;s evidence of being blamed by her daughter. It is important that this relationship is not undermined by my decision. The outcome I propose in this case is a change of direction and one which I hope will provide her with comfort and confidence through which she can enjoy contact.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">The child has shared needs with all children. These are being well met by her mother. I agree with the guardian that the fact that she shares a room with her mother whilst perhaps not ideal is not a cause for concern. The reality of modern life is that housing is costly and families often have to live in less-than-ideal circumstances. In any event I note she is not sharing a bed with her mother and there are real plans for her to move into her own room. I did not find the father&#8217;s contrast with what he could offer (a bedroom with en-suite) to be helpful. Further I question why he was only willing to offer support with some modest works on the mother&#8217;s home with respect to damp (which would allow the child her own room) if he obtained the outcome he sought. This suggests the case is about him not the child as far as he is concerned. The key concern for me is the child&#8217;s emotional needs. I accept her needs include a chance to have a relationship with both parents. Aside from meeting a basic need this will keep her in touch with her mixed identity and the cultures which underpin this. But this cannot be at the cost of her emotional wellbeing. I am very troubled by her recent expressions with respect to self-harm. As far as I am concerned it matters not whether this is a &#8216;cry for help&#8217; or something more. That this child has found her way to expressing a wish to kill herself at her age cannot be put to one side. At best it is the only way in which she can adequately express the strength of her feelings. This has not come out of a vacuum. Having reviewed the history of this case I note two things. First, this child has lived her life within litigation. When asked the father agreed this will have been terrible for her. I agree. She has not been offered the space to grow free from stress. Second, I have a sense of matters escalating in recent times. It is in that context that the child has expressed her feelings. This emotional need must be taken into serious consideration. That the father chose to blame this on the mother notwithstanding the guardian making clear she recommended the child be taken to hospital further demonstrates the progress the father needs to make in developing insight into his daughter&#8217;s needs. In my assessment obtaining emotional security for this child must be built into any outcome. I simply cannot countenance a possibility let alone a likelihood of further evidence gathering behaviour as shown in this judgment. In hindsight I can see I made the wrong decision when I ordered the contact to proceed overnight at the PTR. However, that was prior to the opportunity to evaluate the evidence which then came to be placed before me. I certainly would not have made that decision on the findings I have now made. I can only offer my apology for any distress this has caused to the child but I hope it is understood I was doing my best to fairly balance the available evidence at that point in time.</span></p>

I consider it will allow her to rebuild her confidence in contact and create a space from which she can once again engage in good and meaningful contact. The outcome I propose is one which reflects my findings and is consistent with PD12J by providing safe contact. I use safe here at an emotional level. This is not a case of direct physical danger. I consider the proposals put forward by the father would be inconsistent with PD12J. I cannot say with certainty that this will work and that the child will re-engage but I consider it has the best chance of working. I respect the guardian&#8217;s analysis and the broad approach she has taken. Her evidence was measured and reasoned. In many ways she had the benefit of being introduced to this case when all the information was available. When I commenced my reading for the case around the first PTR it seemed to me the mother had a much higher hill to climb to make out her case. Having now had regard to all the evidence my understanding has changed.</span></p>

I have reached the conclusion this is a case in which he has been largely responsible for the situation he finds himself in. He has demonstrated a wholesale disregard for his daughter&#8217;s needs and allowed his own feelings to get in the way of making the right decisions. It is concerning this has been a consistent failure. I note in January 2022 the father told the Court he would reflect on his &#8216;zoom&#8217; calls and yet I have the events of late 2023. I am far from persuaded the anger management course has had the effect that was intended and I consider there is a real need for a meaningful piece of parenting work to reshape the father&#8217;s understanding of his daughter&#8217;s needs. At this time, I doubt he will be able to contain himself given the opportunity to continue this behaviour. I consider the Court has to shape an order which whilst respecting the need for a relationship contains the father&#8217;s behaviour patterns. Having now viewed all the evidence I can find substance in the father&#8217;s allegation that the mother has to an extent obstructed contact however I interpret that in the light of my findings. This was not done in isolation and out of simple hostility but out of the father&#8217;s ongoing behaviour. Whether it was his approach to contact; his approach to her or his uploading of information onto the internet it seems to me this mother has faced an almost relentless battery over this history of litigation. As an example, the mother was plainly oppositional to the March 2024 contact proceeding. On my findings she was justified in holding this view. Yet she complied with the Court order. Such an approach can in fact be found in the papers. There are a number of occasions where she can be seen to be either compliant with contact or supportive of it (albeit on restricted terms). I do not find her to be obstructive for her own sake but out of her concern for the child. When I look back at the history of the case I can see it interspersed with complaints of the father acting in the manner I have now found him to be acting on occasion. On the information I have I am satisfied these complaints had foundation.</span></p>

They are related as the father puts his case on the basis that were the mother to travel to another country then she could and/or would travel onwards to XX thus defeating any order preventing the same. The mother disputes she has any intention to act in this manner. She gave evidence as to travelling to XX prior to Court proceedings and told me that her wish is to visit this country with the child and her mother (who is elderly and may not have another opportunity). She gave evidence as to the embeddedness of both her and the child in this jurisdiction. She explained things have moved on since the original application which was made prior to the child commencing school. She has no legal status in that country in any event. The guardian supports both the removal of the PSO and the permission to travel to XX. In her evaluation there is no basis for believing the mother will not return. I tend to agree with the linkage of the two issues. Plainly a person travelling to country AA could use that as a launchpad to travel onto XX.

Aside from the issues related to risk (to which I turn) there are obvious and real benefits in removing the PSO and travel to XX. In general terms it would plainly be in the child&#8217;s interests to be able to travel and experience overseas culture. There is little basis for suggesting there is a fundamental negative associated with the same. Furthermore, in relation to XX there are specific cultural and identity factors that make such travel of relevance and importance to the child. Other things being equal there would be strong grounds for acceding the mother&#8217;s request.</span></p>

I put to one side the suggestion of the father that the family home in XX has been damaged by rebels in 2023. The mother agreed it had been burgled at one point but denied the broader claim. I have no evidence to make such a finding and in any event the mother made clear the family would visit the property but stay in a hotel if they travelled. I accept XX has had some internal political challenges but they are not current and the more significant issues in that country were not local to the place to which the mother would travel. However, there is an obvious and significant risk of harm were what the father feared to happen. Such a decision would fundamentally undermine the stability the child has in this jurisdiction. It would transfer all her life to a country with which she is not familiar. It would damage if not destroy all her peer groups relationships and might have a profound impact on her education. Importantly, it would drive an emotional and geographical wedge in the relationship between her and the father. It is clear to me the harm is of a significant magnitude and the Court should not countenance an outcome which leaves this as a plausible outcome.</span></p>

In reality throughout this period the mother could have travelled albeit in breach of the order. This has some probative value because the counter argument is that if allowed to travel, she will break an order by not returning to this jurisdiction. The fact that she has not previously broken an order by doing the same is of some relevance. This is not a case in which the mother has not had the chance to travel.

In this regard I agree with the principles underlying the recommendations of the guardian. I consider that unsupervised contact will likely continue to be a damaging experience for the child. I also consider that setting contact at too high a level runs the real risk of a total breakdown in contact.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">I have reached the conclusion the contact should be supervised and should occur on one weekend day every other month, i.e., 6 times per year. The contact can be supervised by an agreed third party or in default by a professional supervisor. There was a suggestion that the father&#8217;s sister might undertake this. The mother&#8217;s only reluctance to this proposal was that the father had alleged that she had abused this person. I note there was little in the sister&#8217;s actual statement to support this suggestion and the contents of her statement were not overly critical of the mother and it may well be this is evidence from the father which is unreliable. Given the extent of contact and the father&#8217;s finances it would appear there should be no difficulty in funding a professional supervisor if required. The father will bear the costs. I can see no reason that contact should not be for a good period of time on each occasion and on balance would set it at 4 hours per day, increasing to 6 hours after the first 4 contact sessions. In reaching this conclusion I modestly move from the recommendation of the guardian (who set it at 4 times per year). I judge the level I set is manageable and will better maintain the relationship. I would hope the father can reflect and make changes to improve the time he spends with the child but the supervisor will assist in ensuring the contact is positive. If changes can be made then one should not rule out progress into the future. There is no reason this contact should not include wider family members to who the child has a connection</span></p>

I would propose the direct contact is in the even months of the year (which will likely capture the Easter and Christmas holidays and a contact around the child&#8217;s birthday) with the indirect contact in the odd months. The child will be free to contact the father as she wishes and a telephone number should be available to her for this purpose.</span></p>
