At a fact finding hearing (which dealt with other allegations as well as this) she found  that the appellant mother assaulted by the father in the course of an argument just before they separated.

She said that he grabbed her hand and her throat, held her up to the wall and then threw her to the floor.  She said she had fought back as best she could, by flailing her arms. The father then did give her a lift to the school event. The following day she rang the father&#8217;s parents to ask them to persuade him to leave the family home, and as a result he did so, going to stay in a hotel for two days.  </p>

He alleged that the parties had been arguing for most of the day on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2018 (he gave very specific details about what each of them had been doing and when) and that in the evening the mother was extremely verbally abusive to him and had refused to let him leave the bathroom. He said she had slapped him to the face several times, then punched him causing his lip to split and bleed. He also said that she scratched him hard to the neck with her fingers leaving deep marks. The mother had contacted his parents and they were so concerned to see his injuries that they advised him to leave the house, and he did so that very night.  In his statement for the court he identified the date as being 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November because he took photographs of his injuries which were dated. </p>

The photos the father had provided for the bundle were not date stamped.  In discussions with the mother at the submissions stage the judge put it to her that if the father had simply add a mistake about  the date of the photograph, his account would otherwise be accurate.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">The father gave a lot of evidence as to the context of the assault and the events leading up to it which simply do not fit with when he took the photographs.  In his oral evidence he disputed the mother&#8217;s account that he had assaulted her on the Friday evening and specifically said that nothing had happened then.  Both in his written evidence and his oral evidence he said a great deal about what he said had led up to the assault by the mother, including that the argument had gone on for most of the day. She had picked an argument with him in the morning, taken the children swimming, and resumed where she had left off when she brought them back.  He then said he left the home almost immediately because of the assault.  He certainly did leave on the 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> as the hotel records show his stay commencing then.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">Given the level of detail he gave surrounding the event which placed it on a nonworking day following which he immediately left the home,  I am satisfied that the independent dating of the photos would have undermined the father&#8217;s reliability and credibility about the whole incident, and would have been something the Recorder would have been bound to take into account in coming to her decision to make the finding she did.  The issue so far as the mother&#8217;s injuries, or lack of them, also depended upon that very issue.  </p>

The children are living with their mother and there is a contact order in favour of the father. I therefore think it </p>
