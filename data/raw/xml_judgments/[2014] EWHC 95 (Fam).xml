On 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2012, he amended the petition to allege that both parties are domiciled in England &amp; Wales.</p>

She pleaded that the court did not have jurisdiction as she was not domiciled here.  The issue was transferred to the Principal Registry for determination on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2013.

In April 2000, she obtained UK residency.  On 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2002, she became a British citizen and got a British passport.  To do so, she was forced by the Chinese Government to relinquish her Chinese nationality.  Since then, she has always travelled to China on her British passport.  Moreover, she has no right to enter China and has to obtain a visa each time to do so.  </p>

They did not do so.  I am not entirely clear why they did not.  It is right that the Wife&#8217;s mother became very ill and subsequently died, causing her much distress.  The Wife had a number of jobs here, including jobs in London and Reading.  The parties subsequently purchased a matrimonial home in joint names in High Wycombe and a buy to let property in Grantham. </p>

In 2006, the Wife made some enquiries with an acquaintance about schooling in Holland.  It is clear that both the Husband and the Wife thought the Netherlands would be a better place to bring up and educate their children than here.  They also thought their standard of living there would be higher, in part as a result of tax relief available for up to ten years for people in their position.</p>

The Wife had obtained a job with TomTom, who paid the costs of shipping all their belongings to Amsterdam.  They tried to sell the house in High Wycombe but could not do so due to the economic crisis.  They therefore decided to rent it out as they were already doing with the property in Grantham.  </p>

She knuckled down, however, and there was no question of the family returning here.  She gradually began to enjoy the life in Holland, particularly when she started with her current employers.  In April 2011, the parties purchased the house at Bakhuizen Van Den Brinkhof.  I am satisfied that they had outgrown their previous flat.

This is a description of the circumstances which create or constitute a domicil, and not a definition of the term. There must be a residence freely chosen, and not prescribed or dictated by any external necessity, such as the duties of office, the demands of creditors, or the relief from illness; and it must be residence fixed not for a limited period or particular purpose, but general and indefinite in its future contemplation. It is true that the residence originally temporary, or intended for a limited period, may afterwards become general and unlimited, and in such a case so soon as the change of purpose, or animus manendi, can be inferred the fact of domicil is established." </span></p>

Even though her Husband was British, he did not like this country and had not been residing here for six years when they married.  He only returned here because he could not be with her in Holland.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This main reason why she applied to become a British citizen was so she could reside not here but in Europe and, in all probability, in Holland.  It is something of a mystery why the parties did not emigrate shortly after she obtained her citizenship in 2002 although I accept that her mother became very ill and she then became pregnant with Sophia.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Nevertheless, in 2008, the family left this country.  They did not leave on a trial basis, albeit that, if the move had been a disaster, they might have returned, particularly if the children were unhappy.  The Wife told me, and I accept, that it was intended to be a permanent move, although as she quite properly said &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">you can never say never.&#8221; </span>Despite her initial discontent, the Wife stayed in the Netherlands and did not seek a return here.  She worked through her unhappiness and became thoroughly settled in Holland, even before the breakdown of the marriage.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I reject the suggestion made by the Husband that the family intended to review the situation after ten years, when the expatriate tax relief expired.  The family had moved to Holland in the first place in significant part for the children&#8217;s education.  It would make no sense to uproot them at 13 and 11, midway through their education and after they had lived the vast majority of their lives in the Netherlands.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have come to the clear conclusion that, by the time the marriage broke down, the Wife had no intention of ever returning to England.  The fact that her marriage to an Englishman then broke down makes the matter overwhelming.  As she told me in evidence, she had absolutely no reason to return here in May 2012.  She had a job in Holland.  She had formed a relationship with a Dutchman, who has no connection to this country.  She would not have been returning here with the Husband.  Her children were in Holland.  They had become fluent in Dutch and they were completely immersed in the Dutch education system.  She told me that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I intend to spend the rest of my life in the Netherlands.&#8221; </span>She added that she intends to acquire Dutch nationality in due course.  Circumstances do, of course, change but I accept that this is her definite intention and it was her definite intention on the day the divorce petition was issued.  It is fatal to the claim for domicile here.</p>

In fact, the reason appears to be simply that she did not need to do so.  Now that there is a need, as a result of her Dutch boyfriend and his family, she is beginning to learn. </p>

The Wife told me, and I accept, that she is thoroughly opposed to any such move.  She was unable to say whether or not she would return here if the Husband was granted permission to bring the children here.  She said she would have to think very carefully about it before deciding.  I consider that was a perfectly reasonable response.  I do not accept that the possibility that the Wife might have to return here if her Husband got permission to bring the children back here is sufficient to satisfy me that she has any &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">intention to reside here permanently or indefinitely.&#8221; </span></p>

It was either China or the Netherlands.  If I had to do so, given my finding as to the Wife&#8217;s intention to spend the rest of her life in the Netherlands, I would find that she now has a domicile of choice there.  In this regard, it is relevant that she has given up her Chinese nationality and cannot return to that country without permission.  </p>

In an email dated 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2012 sent by the Husband to the Wife, he said that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Regarding the UK (assets), I think we should keep that out of the Dutch courts, for a number of reasons&#8230;&#8221;</span> He clearly therefore anticipated the Dutch courts dealing with the divorce at that point.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The children are undoubtedly habitually resident in Holland, so the Dutch court has exclusive jurisdiction in relation to them.  I was told during submissions that the Wife&#8217;s Dutch petition indicates that English law is to apply to the Dutch financial remedy proceedings.  I do not, of course, know whether that is correct but the principle of equal division of the assets appears to have been conceded long ago.  It follows that I am not sure what juridical advantage to the Husband there would have been in litigating here.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">After conclusion of the oral judgment, I was told that the Dutch court will not deal with the English assets.  This is not a reason for these proceedings either.  The Husband could have written to the Wife and asked her to agree that, if this proved to be the case, she would consent to that aspect proceeding here pursuant to Part III of the 1984 Act (ie financial remedy proceedings after an overseas divorce).  He did not do so, nor as far as I am aware, did he ever say that the inability of the Dutch court to deal with English assets was his reason for applying here for divorce.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This does therefore seem to have been a particularly pointless dispute.  I do accept that it is improper to litigate in a convenient location if there is no jurisdiction to do so but that is not the case here.  It has always been accepted that the Dutch court does have jurisdiction based on habitual resident.  It may be that this lack of obvious justification for these proceedings will go to the issue of costs. </p>
