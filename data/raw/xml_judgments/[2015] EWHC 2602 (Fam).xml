It is, as a moment&#8217;s reflection will make obvious, a question of the most fundamental gravity and importance. What, after all, to any child, to any parent, never mind to future generations and indeed to society at large, can be more important, emotionally, psychologically, socially and legally, than the answer to the question: Who is my parent? Is this my child?  </p>

For the moment I merely indicate two fundamental prerequisites to the acquisition of parenthood by the partner of a woman receiving such treatment. First, consents must be given in writing <span style="font-style:italic">before </span>the treatment, both by the woman and by her partner. The forms required for this in accordance with directions given by the HFEA are Form WP, to be completed by the woman, and Form PP, to be completed by her partner. Secondly, both the woman and her partner must be given adequate information and offered counselling.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following Cobb J&#8217;s judgment, the HFEA required all 109 licensed clinics to carry out an audit of their records. The alarming outcome was the discovery that no fewer than 51 clinics (46%) had discovered &#8220;anomalies&#8221; in their records: WP or PP forms absent from the records; WP or PP forms being completed or dated <span style="font-style:italic">after </span>the treatment had begun; incorrectly completed WP or PP forms (for example, forms not signed, not fully completed, completed by the wrong person or with missing pages); and absence of evidence of any offer of counselling. At the time of the hearing, I did not know how many cases there might be in all, how many families are affected and how many children there are whose parentage may be in issue &#8211; so far as I was aware the HFEA had never disclosed the full numbers &#8211; but it was clear (see below) that some clinics reported anomalies in more than one case. Since the hearing, the HFEA in a letter dated 1 September 2015 has indicated that there are a further 75 cases.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As it happens, we are best informed about the St Bartholomew&#8217;s Hospital Centre for Reproductive Medicine, operated by Barts Health NHS Trust, which I shall refer to as Barts. It was the subject of a judgment given by Theis J on 13 February 2015: <span style="font-style:italic">X v Y (St Bartholomew&#8217;s Hospital Centre for Reproductive Medicine Intervening) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2015/13" uk:canonical="[2015] EWFC 13" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWFC 13</ref>. Moreover, it has been commendably open and frank about its failings (others seem to have been more coy), sharing its findings with the wider medical community as long ago as September 2014 when, at the instigation of the HFEA, they were published on the HFEA&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">clinicfocus</span> e-newsletter. Of 184 patients who had undertaken fertility treatment with donor sperm since April 2009, when <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref> was implemented, there were 13 cases (7%) where legal parenthood was in issue.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The picture thus revealed, and I am referring not just to Barts, is alarming and shocking. This is, for very good reason, a medical sector which is subject to detailed statutory regulation and the oversight of a statutory regulator &#8211; the HFEA. The lamentable shortcomings in one clinic identified by Cobb J, which now have to be considered in the light of the deeply troubling picture revealed by the HFEA audit and by the facts of the cases before me, are, or should be, matters of great public concern. The picture revealed is one of what I do not shrink from describing as widespread incompetence across the sector on a scale which must raise questions as to the adequacy if not of the HFEA&#8217;s regulation then of the extent of its regulatory powers. That the incompetence to which I refer is, as I have already indicated, administrative rather than medical is only slight consolation, given the profound implications of the parenthood which in far too many cases has been thrown into doubt. This is a matter I shall return to at the end of this judgment.     </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I start with rectification. As a matter of general principle, I can see no reason at all why a Form WP or Form PP should be said to be, of its nature, a document which cannot be rectified. The fact that it is a document required by statute to be in a particular form (that is, &#8220;in writing&#8221; and &#8220;signed by the person giving it&#8221;) is, in my judgment, neither here nor there: compare the many cases where rectification has been decreed of conveyancing or trust documents similarly required by various provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20" uk:canonical="1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5) c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Law of Property Act 1925</ref> to be in a particular form. Nor does it matter, in my judgment, that a Form WP or Form PP is used as part of, and, indeed, in order to comply with the requirements of, a statutory scheme. There is, for example, nothing in the language of any of the relevant provisions of Part 2 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref> to suggest that rectification is impermissible. Contrast, for example, the well established rule that the Articles of Association of a company will not be rectified because rectification would be inconsistent with the provisions of the Companies Acts: see <span style="font-style:italic">Scott v Frank F Scott (London) Ltd </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1940] Ch 794" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1940">[1940] Ch 794</ref>. So, in my judgment, if the criteria for rectification are otherwise established, a Form WP or a Form PP can be rectified.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Quite apart from the equitable doctrine of rectification, the court can, as a matter of construction, &#8216;correct&#8217; a mistake if (I put the matter generally, without any detailed exegesis) the mistake is obvious on the face of the document and it is plain what was meant. The reported examples of this are legion and stretch back over the centuries. They include cases of clear misnomer. Again, there is, in my judgment, no possible objection to the court taking this course in relation to a Form WP or a Form PP.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am conscious of the view which Cobb J expressed in <span style="font-style:italic">AB v CD</span>, para 70. But for my part I have no difficulty. Both the Barts Form IC and the MFS Form IC make clear that what is in issue is &#8220;establishing &#8230; legal parenthood&#8221; by W&#8217;s partner and that this is why the Form IC is being signed by W&#8217;s partner. In the MFS Form IC the word &#8220;consent&#8221; is used. Indeed, the phrase &#8220;partner&#8217;s consent&#8221; appears immediately below the space where the partner has to sign. True it is that the word &#8220;consent&#8221; does not appear in the corresponding place in the Barts Form IC, but what the partner is signing is an acknowledgement &#8211; &#8220;I acknowledge&#8221; &#8211; that he or she &#8220;will become&#8221; a &#8220;legal&#8221; parent and acquire &#8220;legal parenthood.&#8221; It is said that Casement was hanged on a comma, but I cannot accept that everything here turns on the use of the word &#8220;acknowledge&#8221; rather than &#8220;consent&#8221; when the purpose and effect of the words used in the Form IC is obvious. Why, after all, is W&#8217;s partner being asked to sign the Form IC at all, if not to make sure that he or she becomes a parent? By signing the Form IC, W&#8217;s partner is acknowledging in terms that he or she will become a parent and, by necessary implication, that this is something he or she wants. Taking the Form IC in context and having regard to its content and language, even a black-letter lawyer in Lincoln&#8217;s Inn would struggle to deny that what is being signed is a consent. In my judgment, this Part of the Form IC &#8211; both the Barts Form IC and the MFS Form IC &#8211; is, as a matter of content and construction, apt to operate as a Form PP and complies with the requirements of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/37/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 37(1)</ref>(a) and 44(1)(a).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn to the comparison between the Form IC and the Form WP. This is less clear cut. What <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/37/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 37(1)</ref>(b) and 44(1)(b) require is a &#8220;notice in writing&#8221; by W, &#8220;stating that she consents to [M or P as the case may be] being &#8230; treated [as &#8220;the father&#8221; or &#8220;a parent&#8221;, as the case may be].&#8221; That statutory language is tracked in the Form WP formula, &#8220;I consent to my partner &#8230; being the legal parent.&#8221; These words do not appear anywhere in either the Barts Form IC or the MFS Form IC. But this, in my judgment, is not fatal. The Form IC is, as we have seen, a single composite document which has accordingly to be read and construed as a whole, the first section or sections providing for W&#8217;s consent to the various stages of the IVF process and the final page providing for the signed consent of W&#8217;s partner. If W is consenting to the treatment and, in the same document, W&#8217;s partner is consenting to becoming the parent of the child resulting from that treatment, it seems to me to follow by necessary implication, even if not by express words, that W is consenting to her partner being the other parent. What otherwise, looking at the matter from W&#8217;s point of view, is the point of her partner signing the document, along with W, what is the point in W signing a document which is also to be signed by her partner, if not to record their joint acknowledgement that W&#8217;s partner is to be a parent? In my judgment, the Form IC &#8211; both the Barts Form IC and the MFS Form IC &#8211; is, as a matter of content and construction, apt to operate both as a Form PP and a Form WP and complies with the requirements of both <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/37/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 37(1)</ref>(a) and 44(1)(a) and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/37/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 37(1)</ref>(b) and 44(1)(b).</p>

It is noticeable that the statute does not, for example, use the words &#8220;in accordance with the licence&#8221;, or &#8220;in compliance with the licence&#8221; or even, to pick up the language of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37/section/23/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 23(3)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1990 Act</ref>, &#8220;in pursuance of the licence.&#8221; The word &#8220;under&#8221; is much less specific. It serves the important purpose of making sure that parenthood is conferred by virtue of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/36" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 36</ref> and 43 only where the child results from &#8220;treatment under the licence&#8221; of a licensed clinic, rather than treatment by an unlicensed clinic, or treatment outside the scope of the clinic&#8217;s licence, for example, treatment of a kind which <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1990 Act</ref> absolutely prohibits as being outside the permitted scope of any licence. There is also a quite separate matter which, in my judgment, points in the same direction. So long as the licence remains in force and has not been revoked it makes perfectly good sense to describe the provision of treatment of a kind within the scope of that licence as being treatment provided &#8220;under&#8221; the licence.</p>

Suppose that what are completed are copies of Form WP and Form PP which, in their operative parts, follow to the last dot and comma the text of the required forms, but which omit all the explanatory text which is included in those required forms. Can Parliament really have intended that to be fatal? Surely not. So, surely, what one is looking for is compliance with the substance, not slavish adherence to a form. Is parenthood to be denied by the triumph of form over substance? In my judgment, not.</p>

More important, much of this evidence related, in the nature of things, to intensely private and intimate matters which none of the witnesses had ever imagined would need to be exposed in a court of law, even a court sitting in private and, as it happens, without the attendance of the media, and in some cases revealing matters which, for understandable reasons, they had not shared, and did not wish to share, even with their closest relatives and friends. These are unusual cases where anonymisation alone may not suffice &#8211; some small and seemingly insignificant but nonetheless telling detail may suffice to enable a close relative or friend to pierce even a heavily anonymised account. I am not prepared to run that risk.

So far as concerns IVF Hammersmith Limited, readers of this judgment will appreciate that the case has not yet been heard and that there are as yet no findings. Barts, MFS and BH, on the other hand, each stands exposed as guilty of serious shortcomings, indeed, at least in the case of Barts and MFS, repeated and systemic failings. Why, in the circumstances, should their shortcomings be shielded from public scrutiny or, indeed, public criticism? I can think of no compelling reason. On the contrary, if public condemnation serves to minimise the risk that any future parent is exposed to what these parents have had to suffer, then it is a price well worth paying. I have not identified any of their staff, nor any of the treating clinicians. There is no need, and it would be unfair, to do so, for the failings are systemic and, ultimately, the responsibility of senior management and the HFEA.  </p>

In contrast, it told of the devastating emotions &#8211; the worry, the confusion, the anger, the misery, the uncertainty, the anguish, sometimes the utter despair &#8211; they felt when told that something was wrong about the parental consent forms, that, after all they had been through, all the joy and happiness, W&#8217;s partner might not legally be the parent. In one case, where the journey to a successful birth had taken the parents <span style="font-style:italic">twelve years </span>of what was described as grief and pain, it is hardly surprising to learn that they were &#8220;devastated and heartbroken&#8221; when told by the clinic that the mother&#8217;s partner was not the child&#8217;s parent. In another case, the comment was, &#8220;it is simply not fair.&#8221; The words may be understated, but the raw emotion is apparent. Another called the situation &#8220;terrible.&#8221; Another spoke of being &#8220;extremely distressed&#8221;, unable to sleep and &#8220;constantly worrying about the future.&#8221; </p>

It was, if they will permit me to say so, a humbling experience to watch them and hear them give evidence.  </p>

It will be recalled that, in contrast to the MFS Form IC, the Barts Form IC refers to the &#8220;Male Partner&#8217;s Acknowledgment.&#8221; Here, and appropriately, the word &#8220;Male&#8221; has been crossed out and the word &#8220;Female&#8221; substituted in manuscript. Even if that had not been done, the mistake would have been obvious, as also the &#8216;correction&#8217; required to remedy it, so this would not have been an obstacle to the declaration sought.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I add, lest it be feared that I have overlooked the point, that, having found the facts as I have, I am required in each case to make the declaration &#8220;unless to do so would manifestly be contrary to public policy&#8221;: see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/58/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 58(1)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref>. The declarations I propose to make do no violence to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1990 Act</ref> or <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref> and involve no &#8216;reading down&#8217; of any of the statutory provisions (there is accordingly no need for me to consider, nor do I, the very interesting submissions I have heard on that topic). I have proceeded in accordance with the strict letter of the legislation, applying long established principles of construction in cases of obvious mistake. There is no conceivable basis in public policy for refusing to make the declarations.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is not for me to provide guidance as to how these serious and systemic failings could better be prevented. That, after all, is the function of the HFEA and, within each clinic, the responsibility of the individual who is the &#8220;person responsible&#8221; within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37/section/17/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 17(1)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1990 Act</ref>. There are, however, three observations which I am driven to make in the light of the very detailed forensic examination to which these matters have been subjected during the hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The first relates to the material published from time to time by the HFEA in the aftermath of Cobb J&#8217;s judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">AB v CD</span>. I have in mind letters sent out by the Chief Executive of the HFEA dated 10 February 2014 and 1 September 2014, a letter sent out by the Chair of the HFEA dated 3 February 2015 and the April 2015 version of the HFEA&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">Consent forms: a guide for clinic staff</span>. While a careful reader who studies these documents with a critical and attentive mind ought not to be left in much doubt about the need to make sure that both Form WP and Form PP are completed properly, and at the right time, I cannot help thinking that it might be better if this <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT </span>requirement, and the potentially <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">DIRE LEGAL CONSEQUENCES </span>of non-compliance, were expressed in more emphatic, indeed stark, language and, in addition, highlighted by appropriate typography. By appropriate typography I mean the use of <span style="font-weight:bold">bold </span>or <span style="font-style:italic">italic </span>type, CAPITAL letters, or a <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">COMBINATION </span>of all three; the use, for example, of red ink; and the flagging up of key points by the use of &#8216;warning&#8217; or &#8216;alert&#8217; symbols. To be fair, some effort has been made to highlight particular points, but I suggest that the process could go further.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The final observation relates to practice within clinics. A completed Form WP and a completed Form PP surely needs to be <span style="font-style:italic">checked </span>by one person (probably a member of the clinical team) and then <span style="font-style:italic">re-checked </span>by another person, entirely separate from the clinical team, whose sole function is to go through the document in minute detail and to draw attention to even the slightest non-compliance with the requirements &#8211; all this, of course, <span style="font-style:italic">before</span> the treatment starts. I trust that the parties will not be offended by the comparison, but the approach to checking that the Form WP and the Form PP have been fully and properly completed is surely just as important, and demands just as much care, attention and rigour, as would be demanded in the case of a legal document such as a contract for the sale of land, a conveyance or a will &#8211; indeed, in the context of parenthood, even more important. </p>
