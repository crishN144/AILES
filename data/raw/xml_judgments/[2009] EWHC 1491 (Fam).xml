	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By an order dated 31 March 2009, Roderic Wood J directed that the matter be adjourned for a contested hearing before a judge of the Division in respect of whether the husband&#8217;s interest under the trust is a resource of the husband&#8217;s for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25(2)</ref>(a). The order also invited the trustees to &#8220;intervene and attend&#8221; and gave them permission to file a statement. The trustees &#8211; who are Mr Stephen Howard Woolfe, senior partner of Harvey Ingram LLP, solicitors, and Mr Philip James Tostevin, senior partner of Hardcastle Burton, chartered accountants, both appointed as trustees on 21 May 2008 &#8211; have responded promptly and helpfully, as one would have expected, They have submitted a written statement dated 13 May 2009, to which I must refer in due course. And Mr Woolfe attended court, both to give oral evidence if that was desired &#8211; as it was &#8211; and, generally, to assist, constructively and frankly, in any way he could. </p>

They have behaved in all respects as trustees should in assisting the court. And Mr Woolfe (I have not seen Mr Tostevin, which is why I say nothing about him) is a solicitor with, as he told me, well over thirty years of experience of dealing with trusts who, if he will allow me to say it, is not merely highly experienced in such matters but is also, as shone though his evidence, scrupulous, sensible, sensitive and pragmatic but appropriately cautious in exercising his responsibilities as a trustee &#8211; responsibilities which he clearly understands very well and which he would, I am quite satisfied, always perform as conscientiously and impartially as he would carry them out skilfully.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The trust arises under the will dated 10 July 1973 of the husband&#8217;s late father, RBC, who died in February 1976 in a hunting accident. He was born in November 1912 and was thus 63 years old when he died. His widow &#8211; his second wife &#8211; was born in December 1934 and was thus much younger than him: she was only 41 when he died. She is still alive, now aged 74. The deceased had four children, two by his first wife and two by his second wife. All survived him and all are still alive. The husband (the Respondent) and the First Intervener are his children by his first marriage. The husband was born in June 1957 and was only 18 when his father died. He is now 52 years old, that is, 22 years younger than his step-mother. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The trust fund consists of (i) quoted securities worth &#163;220,139 on 5 April 2009, (ii) chattels and (iii) a landed estate consisting of (a) the main S estate, including various buildings within the curtilage, (b) two cottages located at the entrance to the S estate, (c) another cottage and (d) a farm at D. Quite understandably in the circumstances, not all the land has been recently re-valued and the balance sheet values are not all up-to-date. It suffices for present purposes to indicate that the trust fund is currently worth in all &#8211; views differ &#8211; perhaps as much as (say) &#163;6 million, though probably less, not least in the light of recent and current economic events. The wife puts its value at about &#163;6.2 million, the husband at about &#163;4 million. Whatever its value, either now or when the reversion falls in, it needs to be borne in mind that there is likely to be a 40% charge to Inheritance Tax on the widow&#8217;s death. </p>

Each of the testator&#8217;s children, as I have said, survived him, so the substitutional provisions set out in the proviso to clause 9(vi) did not and cannot now take effect. The children have all attained the relevant age of thirty years, so they all have vested interests under clause 9(vi).

But their interests are, of course, all at risk of being reduced, potentially to nothing, by an exercise or by repeated exercises by the trustees of their power under clause 13 &#8211; not that this power has in fact yet been exercised. </p>

I do not agree. The letter was clear, accurate and quite consistent with Mr Woolfe&#8217;s oral evidence. As the letter spelt out, the trustees are not &#8220;required&#8221; to cover such costs out of capital, though that is not to dispute that they have power to do so under clause 13. And Mr Woolfe was clear in his oral evidence, as we have seen, that the trustees would indeed have to have regard to the widow&#8217;s own resources before deciding to exercise their power in her favour. </p>

Accordingly, the view of the trustees is that it would not be sensible to dispose of any parts of the S estate &#8211; a point reiterated by Mr Woolfe in his oral evidence. Thus, if it became necessary to sell any of the trust properties in order to fund the widow&#8217;s ongoing care &#8211; if &#8216;push came to shove&#8217; &#8211; the trustees would first sell D and then the cottages. The trustees would not contemplate selling S, where the widow has lived for many, many years, indeed since before the testator&#8217;s death, unless perhaps a time came when the need for permanent residential care meant that she could no longer live there.</p>

But it is, I think, unlikely (unless, that is, the widow were to end up requiring very expensive care for a protracted period) that any exercise of the clause 13 power would involve a realisation of any part of the S estate. This is, of course, very much in the realm of speculation, but I suspect that recourse to D and the three cottages would probably suffice to raise the necessary funds. </p>

Given my findings in relation to the widow&#8217;s expectation of life and what, as I have said, is the entirely speculative possibility of some further <span style="font-style:italic">Saunders v Vautier </span>arrangement in the future, it is quite clear that the time which is likely to elapse before the husband derives any further benefit under the trust once he has received the second tranche of the monies arising under the sale of H, is very considerably in excess of any period which could possibly justify an adjournment. The proceeds of sale of H apart, he is not looking to receive any further part of his interest under the trust in the near future. On the contrary it is likely to be something of the order of 15 years before he receives anything &#8211; a period significantly longer than the maximum suggested by Wood J and May LJ and significantly longer than the period which in <span style="font-style:italic">Milne v Milne </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1981) 2 FLR 286" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1981">(1981) 2 FLR 286</ref> was held to be too long for the court to be contemplating an adjournment.</p>

But on balance I have concluded that Ms Mather is correct in her contention that the husband&#8217;s interest under the trust is indeed such a resource. In other words, I am persuaded, though I have to say without much enthusiasm, that the question posed by the preliminary issue directed by Roderic Wood J is to be answered in the affirmative. </p>
