	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In 1993, Jon Venables (JV) and Robert Thompson (JT), both then aged 10, murdered two-year old James Bulger. It was a murder which shocked and horrified the country. James Bulger&#8217;s parents and wider family have had to live with the dreadful consequences ever since.</p>

The order containing the final injunction was made on 4 December 2001. Subject only to comparatively minor amendments, made by Bean J in orders dated 21 June and 23 July 2010, by Popplewell J in an order dated 31 August 2012 and, most recently, by Edis J in an order dated 7 February 2018, the injunction remains in force. The amendments reflected the fact that, as is well known, JV was convicted of further offences in 2010 and again in February 2018.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">What is the information sought to be protected and how important is it to protect it? The single most important element of the information is the detection of the future identity of the claimants in the community. All the other matters sought to be protected for the present, and for the future, are bound up in the risk of identification, whether by photographs, or by descriptions of identifying features of their appearance as adults, and their new names, addresses and similar information. That risk is potentially extreme if it became known what they look like, and where they are. The risk might come from any quarter, strangers such as vigilante groups, as well as the parents, family and friends of the murdered child. In the present case, the public authority, the court, has knowledge of the risk to the claimants. Does the risk displace the right of the media to publish information about the claimants without any restriction imposed by the court?</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">The evidence, which I have set out above, demonstrates to me the huge and intense media interest in this case, to an almost unparalleled extent, not only over the time of the murder, during the trial and subsequent litigation, but also that media attention remains intense seven years later. Not only is the media interest intense, it also demonstrates continued hostility towards the claimants. I am satisfied from the extracts from the newspapers: (a) that the press have accurately reported the horror, moral outrage and indignation still felt by many members of the public; (b) that there are members of the public, other than the family of the murdered boy, who continue to feel such hatred and revulsion at the shocking crime and a desire for revenge that some at least of them might well engage in vigilante or revenge attacks if they knew where either claimant was living and could identify him. There also remains a serious risk from the Bulger family, and the father was quoted as recently as October 2000 saying that upon their release he would &#8220;hunt the boys down&#8221;; (c) that some sections of the press support this feeling of revulsion and hatred to the degree of encouraging the public to deny anonymity to the claimants. The inevitable conclusion to which I am driven &#8230; is that sections of the press would support, and might even initiate, efforts to find the claimants and to expose their identity and their addresses in their newspapers &#8230; The response of some members of the public to emotive newspaper reporting has created highly emotional and potentially dangerous situations. The misidentification of a female member of the public, thought erroneously to be the mother of one of the claimants, was potentially very dangerous and demonstrates the probable reaction of members of the public to the knowledge that one of the claimants and his family were living nearby. I also bear in mind that the media coverage has been international as well as national. The information might be gathered from elsewhere and presented to an English national or local newspaper. Once in the public domain, it is a real possibility, almost a probability, that there would be widespread reporting by the press. If photographs are taken, and they would be likely to be taken, the claimants would find it difficult to settle anywhere safely, at least within the United Kingdom. It would, however, be fair to point out that there have also been, particularly recently, thoughtful and objective articles in the newspapers, and a reasoned debate over the correct period of detention for child offenders who commit appalling murders.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">I consider it is a real possibility that someone, journalist or other, will, almost certainly, seek them out, and if they are found, as they may well be found, the media would, in the absence of injunctions, be likely to reveal that information in the newspapers and on television, radio, etc. If the identities of the claimants were revealed, journalists and photographers would be likely to descend upon them in droves, foreign as well as national and local, and there would be widespread dissemination of the new names, addresses and appearance of the claimants. From all the evidence provided to me, I have come to the clear conclusion that if the new identity of these claimants became public knowledge it would have disastrous consequences for the claimants, not only from intrusion and harassment but, far more important, the real possibility of serious physical harm and possible death from vengeful members of the public or from the Bulger family. If their new identities were discovered, I am satisfied that neither of them would have any chance of a normal life and that there is a real and strong possibility that their lives would be at risk.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, there are compelling reasons to grant injunctions to protect, in the broadest terms, the following information. (i) Any information leading to the identity, or future whereabouts, of each claimant, which includes photographs, description of present appearance and so on. (ii) In order to protect the claimants on their release from detention, it is necessary to have injunctions to protect their present whereabouts, any information about their present appearance and similar information. That protection must include any efforts by the media to solicit information from past or present carers, staff or co-detainees at their secure units until the claimants' release from detention. (iii) In order further to protect their future identity and whereabouts, no information may be made public or solicited from their secure units that might lead to the identification of the units for a reasonable period after their release &#8230; (iv) It is not necessary, in my judgment, to protect other information relating to their period in the secure units when they were under 18 &#8230;&#8221;</p>

I should make clear that James Bulger&#8217;s mother is <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>a party to the application.

The purpose of all this is to ensure that the judge can embark upon the necessary pre-reading in a structured and focused way, making the best and most efficient use of limited time, so that when the case is actually called on in court everyone can proceed immediately to the heart of the matter, without the need for any substantial opening and with everyone focusing upon the previously identified issues. The objective is to shorten the length of hearings and thereby to increase the &#8216;throughput&#8217; of the family courts &#8211; with the ultimate objective of bringing down waiting times and reducing delay.</p>

It is the professional obligation of practitioners making a visit to some unfamiliar court or tribunal to identify in good time whether there is some particular Guide or Practice Direction or other document regulating practice before that court or tribunal and, if there is, to familiarise themselves with its requirements and then to carry them into effect. A family lawyer who strayed into the Chancery Division or the Queens Bench Division without having first assimilated the requirements of the <span style="font-style:italic">Chancery Guide</span> or the <span style="font-style:italic">Queens Bench Guide</span> would receive short shrift.

The MoJ is a vast data Controller and holds a substantial amount of personal data including material which is relevant for the preparation of our evidence. The material dates back to now over 25 years and is substantial. Some of it is highly relevant to what is needed to prepare out evidence.</p>

There has been no further communication received from Ms Mackie advising as to who has been allocated to deal with the matter for the MoJ. This is a matter of immense concern to us. We had hoped and expected that once a case-holder was appointed to act for the Ministry of Justice that there could be a channel of communication. As will be appreciated what is proposed with regard to the person known formerly/formally known as Jon Venables by the MoJ is of critical importance. It is of relevance to any consideration by the Parole Board in respect of which representations will need to be made by us/on our behalf. In the past we have had justifiable concern as to what the Government has done or has proposed &#8211; for example, in the proceedings before Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss it was suggested that new birth certificates would be issued.&#8221;</p>

Indeed, on any basis, the wording about the &#8216;whereabouts&#8217; needs to be reconsidered so as to avoid as has happened reporting thereof including by the Government prior to the variation of the injunction.

However, three months on, it is not clear what the applicants want: a change in the wording of the injunction; some kind of general review of that injunction; or its setting aside in its entirety insofar as it relates to JV?</p>

The applicants must formulate their application with greater particularity, setting out the order they seek and their basis for seeking it. They must then serve the lay evidence upon which they will seek to rely. If they seek to rely upon expert evidence they must identify the issues upon which such evidence may appropriately be led, and make proposals to the other parties.</p>

There is, he submits, a lack of clarity regarding the nature of the amendments to the injunction that are sought and a lack of clarity around the evidence that the applicants intend to rely upon in support of the application. With masterly understatement, he comments that this makes case management &#8220;difficult&#8221;. He suggests that, unfortunately, it will not be possible to set directions at this stage to take this matter to a substantive hearing. </p>

Time was allowed for it to be provided by the MoJ in accordance with its statutory obligations and thereafter time for preparation of the evidence. The fact that the MoJ has not complied with its obligations should not now be used against Messrs B. Attention should be directed to the MoJ and its compliance with its legal obligations and its co-operation.  There may be an alternative which will produce the end result required under the FPR.</p>

It was not clear to me to what extent the applicants were seeking either the variation or (though Mr Makin seemed to be indicating that this was no longer being proposed) the discharge of the injunction. I was still unclear as to precisely <span style="font-style:italic">why</span> and on <span style="font-style:italic">what legal basis </span>Mr Makin was contending for the joinder of the Ministry of Justice and the production by it of the extensive documentation he seemed to be seeking.

That said, my provisional view is that the stance being adopted by the Ministry of Justice is entirely understandable and that there is much force in each of the points made by Mr Price. There are, however, two matters which I put to Mr Makin during the course of argument that need to be repeated. The first is that it is, in the first instance, for his clients, as the applicants, to identify with proper precision what relief they are seeking and to put before the court, and in a manner complying with the relevant rules, the evidence, lay and expert, upon which the rely. As I observed, even in the Family Division, an applicant is not permitted to demand that others first provide him with the material needed to build his case. That is the world of Humpty Dumpty: see <span style="font-style:italic">C v C (Privilege) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2006/336" uk:canonical="[2006] EWHC 336 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWHC 336 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 1 FLR 115" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 1 FLR 115</ref>, para 50. Secondly, it is no proper part of the judicial function I am here exercising to police, let alone enforce compliance by it with, the Ministry of Justice&#8217;s obligations arising in relation to Mr Ralph Bulger&#8217;s subject access request under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/29" uk:canonical="1998 c. 29" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Data Protection Act 1998</ref>.

I am prepared in the circumstances, notwithstanding that the best part of three months has already elapsed since the matter was before Edis J, to give the applicants that further indulgence.

I directed that the hearing before me on 1 May 2018 should be in public, in open court. There were, in my judgment, overwhelming reasons why, in the public interest, that hearing &#8211; which was not going to involve the analysis or discussion of any sensitive matters &#8211; should be in public, so that the media, as the eyes and ears of the public, should be (subject of course to the injunction) unfettered in their ability to report proceedings which, of their nature, were of very considerable public interest. The same goes, as it seems to me, for the next case management hearing, which should likewise be in public. Whether the final substantive hearing should be either wholly or partly in private is a matter best considered at the next hearing.</p>
