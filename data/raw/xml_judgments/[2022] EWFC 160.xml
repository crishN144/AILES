The children are not parties to the contempt application but are today represented through their Children&#8217;s Guardian by Ms Helen Wilkinson of counsel. The substantive application before the court is application by Manchester City Council for wardship order in respect of the children, an order for summary return to this jurisdiction and location orders, issued on 13 October 2022.  Manchester City Counsel is represented by Ms Mann of counsel.</p>

This matter now comes before the court on the local authority&#8217;s application to commit the mother and the father of the children, Maryam Yusef and Farad Abdi, for contempt of court for failing to comply with the terms of those location orders.  The mother is represented by Mr Lord, solicitor. Whilst the father was granted legal aid by the court at the outset of these contempt proceedings and was represented by counsel at the last hearing before this court, at that hearing counsel representing the father applied to withdraw on the grounds that she was professionally embarrassed, which application the court granted.  The father is today unrepresented.  He informs me that he has now also dispensed with the services of his solicitors and indicated that he now represents himself.  He did not make an application to further adjourn this hearing.</p>

No party has sought to challenge the evidence of the police officers recording the exchanges that took place on arrest.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The children were born in the United Kingdom and were habitually resident in the United Kingdom at the time they were removed from this jurisdiction in March 2022.  The father shares parental responsibility for the children. The parents are Somalian, although the mother is understood also to have Dutch Nationality. The children also have Dutch passports, but are not on the Dutch National Register and the Dutch authorities report that the children are not known to the Dutch immigration and naturalisation authorities. It is not at present clear how the children and the mother came to be Dutch citizens.  The court has invited the local authority to inform the Dutch authorities as to the current circumstances of the mother and the children. The father&#8217;s nationality remains unknown as he has thus far failed to produce his travel documents, although he claims recently to have gained British citizenship.  The families immigration status in the United Kingdom is currently the subject of a request for clarification from the Home Office.</p>

At that stage, the mother alleged that the father would not allow her to leave her home, controlled her finances and had taken her passport.  On 6 March 2012 the mother allegedly ran away from the family home.  In her statement to this court, the mother alleges in respect of the father that:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother made further allegations of domestic violence and physical harm in September 2013.  In particular, the mother alleged that on Saturday 28 September 2013 she was feeding the twins when S started to misbehave and spit food, leading to the father to slap her on the left cheek causing a 1 cm red mark and resulting in S screaming and then choking on her food. During this incident the father is also alleged to have slapped the mother and, later in the day, to have grabbed the mother by the wrist, twisted it backwards and slapped her again.  On Sunday 29 September 2013 the mother is said to have left the house, gone to a friend&#8217;s house, and reported the incident to the Police.  The father was arrested and bailed away from the family home. S and E were made subject to Child Protection plans under the category of physical abuse until March 2014.  The police took no further action after the mother retracted her statement to the police.  The case was later closed to Manchester Children Services following Child Protection planning and Child in Need planning.   The father had completed a domestic violence course and had returned home with no further incidents reported.  </p>

However, on 16 December 2019, Manchester Children Services received a referral from the mother&#8217;s sister raising concerns for the welfare of the mother and the children. It was alleged that neither parent took good care of the children, that there was ongoing domestic abuse and that the father was abusing drugs.  Upon investigation, it transpired that the family had been in Dagenham since September 2019. Dagenham Children&#8217;s Services undertook a Strategy Discussion, a s. 47 investigation and an assessment in in January 2020.  The mother was said to have been very difficult to engage and uncontactable.  Whilst the local authority attempted three unannounced visits to the home, social workers were unable to gain access. </p>

The school were told by H that the mother had been taken away by the police, and the head teacher spoke to S and E the following day. On 15 March 2022 the children spoke about their lives at home, detailing their alleged exposure to the parents&#8217; volatile relationship and made a number of allegations of physically and emotionally abusive conduct towards them on the part of the parents and significant allegations of ongoing domestic abuse between the parents.  The children stated that they had been told that they must not say anything to anyone and that they would be in trouble if they did.  They described their parents as fighting a lot, and that they were &#8220;like a drama series&#8221;.  The children were fearful of their parents finding out what they had said and the parents were not informed of the allegations when they collected the children from school. A referral was made to children&#8217;s services by the school.  The children made further allegations to the school on 16 March 2022.</p>

The mother stated that she wished to speak to the father before agreeing to any counselling. The children did not attend school on 18 March 2022. A strategy meeting took place on that date and the father was spoken to about the domestic violence incident but not the allegations made by S and E.  The father accepted that there had been an argument and claimed that the mother was now in London with the children whilst she &#8220;calmed down&#8221;.  The children were again not taken to school and on 21 March 2022.   The school were again informed by the father that the children were in London.  He further claimed that the children would now be going to New York.  </p>

He refused to give the specific whereabouts of the children other than saying that they are in New York. The police spoke to the mother and the children on phone but the mother was not forthcoming with information. On the 25 of March 2022 a follow up strategy discussion was held whereby the Police shared that Border Force checks had showed that Mrs Yusef and all the children had flown to Istanbul on 18 March, not New York. Border alerts were implemented on the children so authorities would be alerted if the children re-enter the United Kingdom. </p>

This was for S to receive urgent medical treatment. I had been to Turkey previously on holiday in 2020 and I was aware that they offered a very good and efficient medical service. In 2020 we spent the whole summer staying with Mr Abdi&#8217;s sister, Shuruuq Abdi. S had been in pain for some time, complaining of stomach cramps. Teachers at school had noticed this and had informed me that the pain she was in was affecting her running and general movement. I had understood that Mr Abdi had spoken to the GP practice &#8230; but was told that S was fine and did not need any treatment. They said that she had a rash and might need some cream. We thought it was much more serious than that due to the level of pain she was in.</p>

I was extremely concerned about her deteriorating health and I was willing to pay whatever I needed to get her seen urgently. I flew to Istanbul and urgently sought medical attention. I was informed that if I had left it 24 hours later S&#8217;s appendix would have burst. Her appendix was immediately removed. I have provided medical evidence to the police which confirms this. This is all in Turkish however. We stayed with Mr Abdi&#8217;s sister for the length of that stay.&#8221;</p>

The mother further alleges that this course of action was taken as she was under duress from the father and the wider paternal family. The mother alleges that on arrival in Somalia she and the children were collected at the airport by the paternal uncle, Said Abdulqadir, and other males who the mother had never met before. The mother contends she felt extremely uncomfortable and intimidated, that her phone was immediately taken off her as was her passport and the children&#8217;s passports.  The mother states that she and the children were taken to a gated community in Mogadishu.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At this point, for reasons that are hard to fathom in light of the history recounted in this judgment thus far, a Service Manager for the local authority decided that proceedings should <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> be instituted in respect of the children in circumstances where the children had left the jurisdiction and it was believed, wrongly, that the court had no jurisdiction to make orders.  This was patently incorrect as the current application demonstrates.  Equally remarkably, the case was thereafter simply closed by Manchester City Council.  In due course, I shall be directing that the Head of Children&#8217;s Services, and the Head of Legal Services, for Manchester City Council write to the court to explain the apparent failure to pursue proceedings in respect of the children in a timely fashion. That decision of the local authority to take this course is thrown into even starker relief given the following analysis contained in the social worker&#8217;s statement in support of the application for relief under the inherent jurisdiction that was ultimately issued by the local authority some seven months after the children had been removed from the jurisdiction:</p>

Despite multiple local authorities being involved, historic child protection planning and [the father] completing domestic abuse courses it Is clear that this interventions have not reduced the risk to the children as the domestic abuse continued throughout the children&#8217;s lives which they have witnessed.  This will have been extremely distressing for the children and caused them to be fearful and feel unsafe at home and based on S and E&#8217;s last conversations with school it is evident that the children have been significantly impacted by violence and aggression they have witnessed from their parents.  Although H and D&#8217;s voice has not been ascertained at present, it is clear that they are highly likely to have witnessed the domestic abuse and are more than likely to share the views of S and E.&#8221;</p>

S and E have made significant allegations of physical chastisement throughout all the children&#8217;s lives and these concerns were what prompted the local authority to make S and E subject to Child Protection planning and despite this intervention, the children have continued to be subjected to physical harm by both parents.  The local authority have been unable to address the specific concerns with [the father] and [the mother] due to the perceived risk to the children as their whereabouts are currently unknown.  The local authority would be concerned if the full range of concerns were discussed with the parents at this time, this may leave the children at risk of further significant harm when parents discover that they have told professionals about the physical and emotional abuse that has occurred, and it is also not know whether the children are currently experiencing this harm.&#8221;</p>

The mother further alleges that she was thereafter taken to the airport and put on a flight to England, landing in Manchester where the father met her.

At that moment he may or may not be in contempt of a court order. If he is not in contempt then in my view there is no power to detain him further. The direction of the court has been complied with and there is nothing before the court to enable the further power of detention to be invoked. If the person is prima facie guilty of contempt but the proceedings are part heard and are continuing, I can see no reason, in certain circumstances, not to detain him pending the conclusion of the case if the court is satisfied that he will not voluntarily attend on the next hearing day. The purpose is to secure the attendance of the alleged contemnor for the next court hearing.&#8221;</p>

The father had still not surrendered his travel documents as at the hearing on 29 November 2022.  He again claimed at various points during the hearing that the documents had either been mislaid or stolen and then found at his home but then cancelled.  When it was pointed out to the father that on 22 November 2021 he had agreed to provide any travel documents and provided his keys to his legal representatives with a view to them visiting his home to retrieve the documents, the father claimed that he had provided his keys but his solicitor had since failed to contact him.  Whilst the father was represented by counsel at the hearing on 29 November 2022, as I have noted counsel sought permission to withdraw by reason of professional embarrassment, which application was granted by the court.  On 29 November 2022 I further remanded the father in custody pending today&#8217;s hearing on the grounds that he constituted a clear flight risk and that there was a real risk he would not attend this hearing if released.  I further directed that the statements and documents provided by the police in relation to the arrests of the parents on 18 and 21 November 2021 respectively in execution of the location order dated 14 November 2022, and relied on by the local authority in support of its applications to commit, be served on the parents and that such documents should form part of the court bundle.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, I am not able to find beyond reasonable doubt that the mother is in breach of the return order made by HHJ Singleton KC on 14 November 2022.  In order to comply with that order, the mother would need to know where the children are.  In that regard, I am satisfied that she does not at the present time have that information in her possession.  In the circumstances, whilst I am satisfied that she has continued to make efforts to locate the children with a view to recovering them to this jurisdiction, I accept that at the present time she is not able to comply with the return order.  It would not therefore be just to hold her in breach of that order at this point.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Turning to the father, having regard to the evidence before the court I am satisfied that at the time the location order was executed, the father knew the then current location of the children.  Notwithstanding his continued denials, the voice note sent by the father to the mother, which the father did not deny or seek to dispute, proves beyond reasonable doubt that the father knows where the children are, as does the fact that he travelled to Somalia in May 2022, as I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he did.  I accept the submission that the voice-message is incriminating and clearly suggests that the father knows the children&#8217;s whereabouts and had detailed knowledge of the mother&#8217;s actions in Somalia attempting to locate them.  In addition, I note that notwithstanding his purported worry concerning the children&#8217;s whereabouts, unlike the mother he has never reported them missing to the authorities nor sought the assistance of the court to locate the children in one of the alternative locations he has mentioned, namely Turkey or the United States.  I am satisfied that this is because he knows full well where the children are currently. When arrested and spoken to by police, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the father made no mention at all of the children being in Somalia, denying all knowledge of their whereabouts. The recording of the father&#8217;s statement on 18 November 2022 makes no mention of the children being in Somalia, the only reference to another country being to Turkey.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am further satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at the time the father was arrested he failed to provide his passport and any other document which would enable him to leave England and Wales.  The fact that the father flew to Addis Ababa in May 2022 shows that he had available to him travel documents as at that date.  Whilst the father&#8217;s story with respect to the travel documents continues to change and evolve (today a further element was introduced when the father claimed that his travel documents exist but others are not interested in collecting them), he concedes that he had travel documents as at 18 November 2022, albeit he asserts they had been cancelled.   Within that context, I am further satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that on 18 November 2022 the father failed to immediately to hand over to the Tipstaff every passport relating to him or other document which would enable him to leave England and Wales.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, in respect of the allegation that the father has breached the return order of 14 November 2022 by failing to return the children to the jurisdiction of England and Wales, the position is complicated by the fact that the father was arrested on 18 November 2022, four days after the order was made.  He has been remanded in custody ever since.  In those circumstances, it has not been possible for him to comply with the return order himself.  It also is not clear to what extent he has been able to communicate with members of his family to ensure the return of the children, although I take it to be unlikely that he has been able to communicate with Somalia from prison.  In the circumstances of those uncertainties, and whilst the continuing absence of the children from the jurisdiction is powerful evidence of the father&#8217;s failure to comply with the return order, I am not satisfied that it would be safe to conclude today that the local authority has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the father has failed to comply with the return order.</p>

First, it upholds the authority of the court by marking the disapproval of the court and deterring others from engaging in the conduct comprising the contempt. Secondly, it acts to ensure future compliance.  In some cases therefore, and in particular those cases where the contempt arises from the breach of a court order, a penalty will have the primary objective of ensuring future compliance with that order.  </p>

A further aggravating feature is the father&#8217;s persisting in this course notwithstanding the evidence now before the court that indicates beyond reasonable doubt both that he knows where the children are and that he has travel documents.  Within this context, the father has made no further attempt to assist the court by now indicating where the children are, in order that steps can be taken to recover them to the jurisdiction of their habitual residence. With respect to mitigating factors, the father has sought during this hearing to proffer an explanation to the court, albeit one that seeks to place responsibility for the abduction of the children solely onto the mother and an explanation the court was not prepared to accept.</p>
