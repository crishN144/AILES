The reporting restriction order prohibits the identification or of the surviving children or their mother, or their homes, schools or nurseries. It does not prevent the naming of Poppi, or her father, or reporting of the circumstances of her death, provided that any report would not lead to the identification of the surviving children or their mother. All persons, including representatives of the media, must ensure that this condition is strictly complied with. Failure to do so will be a contempt of court.</span></p>

I expressed the provisional view that it should be published at or around the time that the further hearing began, rather than being withheld until it ended.  I noted the  proper public interest in the course that these proceedings, and the other procedures surrounding Poppi&#8217;s death.  I observed that the media would be able to describe matters more effectively if the original findings could be described at the point when they come under review.  I also raised the possibility of the further hearing taking place in public</span></p>

I have taken account of the fact that no one has been charged with, still less convicted of criminal wrongdoing, and of the impact on the father in particular of publication at the point where a further investigation is about to begin. </span></p>

There has not yet been an effective Coroner's inquest, and the Divisional Court has by its order of 22 July 2015 ordered a fresh inquest: <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/admin/ch/2015/2465" uk:canonical="[2015] EWHC 2465 (Admin)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWHC 2465 (Admin)</ref>.  It was not possible for this court to publish wider information at an earlier stage because of considerations relating to possible criminal proceedings and because of the delicate circumstances of the surviving children.  Those matters are no longer the absolute barriers to publication that they once were.  </span></p>

The only exception is that my previous findings will not be made publicly available at this intervening stage but at the conclusion of the proceedings, which should be imminent.  Publishing them at the point when they are being reviewed is neither necessary nor fair, while publication of the narrative history does not have the same consequences.  </span></p>

However, given that the judgment cannot be published in full, it would not be right for the court to sit in public when it has no means of protecting information that should remain confidential. </span></p>

It is strongly argued for by the media, opposed by three parties to the proceedings, and supported by one.  It is said by the local authority that the children may be harmed by information being &#8216;drip fed&#8217; into the public domain on a daily basis and that it is better for them if they can be prepared for publicity at the end of the hearing in an orderly and predictable way. </span></p>

As has often been said, the reporting of legal proceedings is about the process and not just the end result.  Ms Gallagher also points out that there is no actual evidence showing that daily reporting would create real difficulties with children or their carers.</span></p>

I acknowledge that daily reporting might heighten the level of publicity, however technical much of the evidence is likely to be.  I also accept that it may well be easier for those helping the children if information was released at a particular moments chosen by the court.  However, the idea that this would bring order to the reporting of the case is illusory.  Once the narrative is in the public domain, the media is entitled to report as it chooses, provided it respects the reporting restrictions.  The children will need to be supported through this process, however it unfolds.  Giving full weight of their interests and those of the other family members, the public's long-delayed rights to know more about the circumstances of Poppi's death must now prevail.</span></p>

The second and third children are not aware of the further hearing.  The oldest child is, and is very anxious about the reporting of things that she thinks should be private.  The Guardian writes that the children </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt">"need to be in control of whether or not they share information around Poppi&#8217;s death with their friends and others involved in their lives.

Secondly, I have already described the idea that the court can control the reporting in this case as illusory.  If daily reporting is not allowed, the media can still pursue the story in other ways, including on a daily basis.  Thirdly, it is asserted that daily reporting will make the situation significantly more difficult for the children, but this assertion has not been established with reference to the sort of material that is likely to be published or the degree of harm that it is said would flow.  I accept that the entire process is likely to be distressing for the children in the immediate future, but their carers and teachers will be on the alert to protect and support them as much as possible.  Fourthly, it is sadly not possible to approach matters on the basis that these young children can be in control of information about their sister's death.  Lastly, the children themselves have a long-term interest in the issues arising from Poppi&#8217;s death being resolved justly and in a way that commands public confidence.</span></p>

It is a central component of the case and it would be artificial to withhold it.  It would also, as the media submits, be illogical to publish the narrative judgment without it, because the earlier part of the narrative contains a substantial amount of similar material.  Incidentally, Ms Gallagher is also correct to say that my proposal was always to publish the medical evidence: the decision goes no further than the indication given during the hearing.</span></p>
