Sam [not his real name] and his parents [&#8216;mother&#8217; and &#8216;father&#8217;] were all born in, and remain citizens of, X, however the family have lived in England for many years and have the right to remain here. Sam, who is now aged 16, was assigned to the female gender at birth, but has lived socially as a boy for some years. He does not regard himself as a trans-sexual and has been referred to throughout these proceedings as &#8216;he/him&#8217;.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The local authority application was heard before Judge A on 22 July 2022 as a matter of urgency as Sam and his parents were proposing to travel to X on 24 July so that Sam could undergo the operation. After a hearing attended by counsel for the local authority, a solicitor for Sam, a duty children&#8217;s guardian, a lawyer from CAFCASS Legal and the parents in person, Judge A granted permission to the local authority to invoke the inherent jurisdiction. The judge ordered that Sam was not to undergo any gender reassignment surgery without the permission of the court and he was not to leave, or be removed from, the jurisdiction for the purpose of undergoing any surgery until further order. Detailed directions were given for the further progress of the proceedings.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">After that first, short-notice, hearing in July 2022, the local authority has continued to prosecute its application for an order preventing Sam from travelling to X for surgery until he reaches the age of 18. The case was listed for a five day final hearing before me this week. On the first morning of the hearing the local authority, which only 5 days earlier had filed a 30 page Opening Statement presenting its case in strong terms, applied to withdraw the application on the basis that, on the evidence before the court, the authority could not discharge the burden of proving its case.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The local authority&#8217;s withdrawal application is not opposed by counsel acting for the parents and for Sam. Indeed, the authority&#8217;s change in stance has been greeted by the family with very considerable relief. There is no opposition from the children&#8217;s guardian who, as Sam is competent to instruct his own legal team, acts alone. Those representing the family members have, however, made costs applications against the local authority. In the course of full submissions made by each represented party, some points of general importance, over and above the costs issue and with possible relevance to other cases, have been raised. The dual purpose of this judgment is therefore, firstly, to record and report these more general points and, secondly, to determine the issue of costs.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In order to establish the context, it is necessary to give some short detail of the proceedings. This will be undertaken in a manner that maximises the cloak of anonymity that must surround Sam and his parents. Sam&#8217;s real identity and any of the granular facts in this case are of no relevance to the outside world. It has been &#8216;excruciating&#8217; [his leading counsel&#8217;s word] for Sam, who is a very private individual, to have his most personal details scrutinised by some 30 or more professionals over the past eight months. I will not therefore identify the local authority, any of the professionals (save for some counsel) or either of the two legal experts from Country X.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The final caveat to stress is that, as the application is being withdrawn, the court has not had to determine any of the substantive issues in the case. When, as I will, I may comment on some of the matters of general importance that have been raised, my words are no more than observations. It may be for courts in other cases to take up any points of relevance and to determine them in the course of contested litigation and after full argument.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The local authority&#8217;s application was supported at the first urgent hearing before Judge A by a statement from the allocated social worker. The statement is short, but contains a good deal of detail about Sam drawn from meetings with him and his parents. In order to trigger access to the inherent jurisdiction, a local authority must give grounds for reasonable belief that, if that access is denied, there are reasonable grounds for believing that the child is likely to suffer significant harm. On this topic the social work statement simply states that &#8216;the local authority is extremely worried about [Sam&#8217;s] physical and emotional welfare and wellbeing. This is on the basis that the proposed surgery which is due to take place in [Country X] on 26 July 2022 is unlawful and is likely to cause [Sam] serious physical and emotional harm.&#8217; Concern was expressed that the NHS had not been engaged and there were no plans for Sam&#8217;s aftercare back in this country.</p>

A report from that expert, Mr T [random letter chosen], dated 27 July was produced, translated and filed with the court. In that report, Mr T described that undertaking top surgery in such circumstances was not expressly prohibited by the law of Country X and that the practice was seemingly tolerated in that surgery of this type was undertaken in cases of young people who were in the process of gender transition or confirmation.</p>

The report gives the following accounts of the local authority&#8217;s position:</p>
	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">&#8216;The local authority does not intend to apply for a care or supervision order at this time. The risk of significant harm that we were concerned about has currently been substantially reduced by our involvement, namely through the existing court order to prevent [Sam] having the operation. Currently the parents are engaging with us and have agreed to a Child in Need process which is positive. It is considered that applying for any further orders at this current time is unnecessary and to do [so] could be oppressive. The local authority does not feel that it is in [Sam&#8217;s] best interests at this time and could cause more distress for [Sam] and his family.&#8217;</p>

This is a basic tenet of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> and should be well known to all lawyers who practice in this field. When measured against <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/100/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 100(4)</ref>, the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 37</ref> report is legally incoherent by, firstly, contemplating that the local authority could apply for a care order but, for the time being, has decided not to do so, and, secondly, by relying upon the existing inherent jurisdiction order as obviating the need to apply for a care order. The latter point distorts the legal structure by turning it through 180 degrees. If the remedy that a local authority seeks can be obtained by application for a order that is entitled to apply for then, by virtue of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/100/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 100(4)</ref>+(5), that is the procedural course that it must follow and the High Court will be barred from granting leave to apply for an order under the inherent jurisdiction. The fact, as this local authority has indicated, that the authority would prefer not to apply for a care order is of no relevance.</p>

My criticism is of the corporation, rather than any individual. Here the authority was embarked upon an unusual legal intervention, supported by solicitors and counsel. The responsibility of ensuring that the basic legal building blocks upon which the application was based were legally sound was a corporate one, and there was a duty to ensure that this was correctly set out within the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 37</ref> process.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">At a hearing before Judge A in October 2022 the parents were each represented by a full legal team, of two counsel and solicitors, all acting pro-bono due to the absence of Legal Aid for parents in inherent jurisdiction proceedings, save for the most impecunious parents, because of the application of a means test as well as a merits test. The local authority and Sam were also represented by a full team led, in each case, by leading counsel. At that hearing, Judge A heard an application by the M, F and Sam that the proceedings should be dismissed. By that time the court had received a substantial body of medical records tracking the various consultations and other interventions that the family had sought in the preceding months and years. In a change from the case that it had hitherto presented, the local authority moved its focus from the potential for &#8216;serious harm to [Sam&#8217;s] physical and emotional welfare and wellbeing&#8217; to the question of whether full and valid consent to the planned surgery had been given by Sam and/or his parents. Having considered the evidence that was by then available, Judge A was persuaded that there remained significant gaps within that material and further disclosure or investigation was required.</p>

The bulk of the 30 page document is devoted to a detailed analysis of these two issues, to the exclusion of other factors which, on a proper approach to an application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/100" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 100</ref>, one would have anticipated would be of prime importance.

He submitted firmly that the application had been properly brought when it was issued in July 2022 and that the local authority had properly resisted the application for the case to be dismissed before Judge A in October. The position had now, however, been reached when counsel reported that the local authority recognised that the balance of the evidence indicated that the application should not be pursued and should be withdrawn. The local authority had heeded the request made by the other parties that it should stand back and reflect on the evidence. Counsel drew attention to the fact that a good deal of detailed evidence had been filed during the past two weeks, including clarifying material from the two experts in the law of Country X, full statements from Sam and his parents and the assessment of the children&#8217;s guardian. The final expert material and family statements had not been received until some 10 days before the hearing (including weekends), and the guardian&#8217;s report only three working days before the hearing. This recent material had, said counsel, crystallised the local authority&#8217;s approach to the twin issues of (a) legality and (b) consent.</p>

Having reflected on the issue, the local authority had therefore concluded that it could not meet the burden of proving that Sam&#8217;s and his parents&#8217; consents were inadequate.</p>

In July the information before the court, both as to the medical intervention and as to the law in the other country, was sparse. Whilst there was, by October, more information available, Judge A had concluded that proceedings under the inherent jurisdiction should continue to a final hearing.

There was, understandably, a unity of interest and a degree of crossover in these submissions, each of which was very critical of the local authority and sought orders for costs.

The family evidence had been directed towards matters to do with the court process rather than the merits and the guardian&#8217;s record of Sam&#8217;s considered position was no more than a further presentation of his consistent position and was on all-fours with that given in the social worker&#8217;s statement at the beginning of the case;</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In response to the submissions of the other parties, and in particular with respect to the costs applications, leading counsel for the local authority stressed that the test is one of reasonableness. He prayed in aid the fact that on two occasions Judge A had held that the gateway in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/100/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 100(4)</ref> should be opened to permit the local authority to bring and then to proceed with an application under the inherent jurisdiction and had subsequently conducted a number of hearings. That important factor, and the fact that the application was at that time supported by the guardian indicated the reasonableness of the local authority position.</p>

Counsel was, however, unable to say anything in response to the court questioning why, if this was necessary and a central issue had always been legality, the local authority had not made an application to instruct an expert at any stage between July and October 2022.</p>

This seems to me to be entirely consistent with the aim being to confine matters to the statutory scheme in Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, the thinking being that a local authority needing the power to determine any question in connection with parental responsibility must seek it through the medium of a care order. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The local authority&#8217;s request for leave to withdraw its application, and therefore bring these proceedings to a close, where it is accepted that it is not possible to prove the case, is in the first category of such cases. It is not opposed and must succeed. Little need therefore be said at this stage by the court other than to grant leave and order that any continuing orders in these proceedings should be discharged. In doing so, however, I wish expressly to endorse the stance taken by the local authority, albeit on the first morning of the hearing, in making such a radical change of course. The decision taken by Sam and his parents in favour of surgery was a complex one involving consideration of a range of sophisticated factors. In the circumstances of this case I would have needed a good deal of persuasion before holding that the plan for Sam to go abroad for chest surgery was likely to cause him significant harm, or that to do so was not in his best interests. Further, as is now accepted by the local authority, in a case of two parents who are conspicuously well intentioned, law abiding, loving and child focussed, and in a case where Sam is plainly an intelligent and thoughtful individual who is so well settled in his life as a young man, the prospect of the court concluding that there was some defect in their approach to consent was remote.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Finally, I turn to the applications for costs. They are put on a different basis as between the parents and Sam. The parents representation by experienced solicitors and two counsel has been undertaken on an entirely pro-bono basis. This professionally and personally generous activity has been of benefit both to the parents and to the overall process. Those involved are entitled to respect and gratitude for all that they have done over many hours and days during these past eight months. The fact that representation has been pro-bono does not prevent an application for costs being made, but the recipient of any costs award will be to the relevant charity, in this case the Access to Justice Foundation [<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2007/29" uk:canonical="2007 c. 29" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Legal Services Act 2007</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2007/29/section/194" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 194</ref>].

It is a matter of particular concern that from the start of the case, and throughout, the authority&#8217;s approach has lacked the necessary focus on the twin lode-stars of &#8216;significant harm&#8217; and &#8216;welfare&#8217;. Whilst cause for concern and a lack of information might have been responsible for an understandable lack of clarity and focus at the start of the process, by November, when the gaps in the evidence that Judge A had accepted existed had largely been filled, there is no indication that the local authority at that stage undertook the exercise that was apparently undertaken on Monday morning of this week. On the contrary, by then the local authority case had seemingly lost any real connection with &#8216;significant harm&#8217; and &#8216;welfare&#8217;, through its misplaced fixation on two relevant, but subordinate, factors in the case, namely &#8216;consent&#8217; and &#8216;legality&#8217;. The Opening Note filed for this hearing is proof enough that this is so, with only passing reference to significant harm and to welfare. </p>

For the reasons given by the other parties, I do not regard the content of the recently filed material from the experts and family to have significantly changed the landscape in this regard. It is plain that, by December, by focussing on consent and legality, to the exclusion of the required factors of significant harm and welfare, the local authority proceeded with the application when they should, as their action on Monday demonstrates, have pulled out.</p>
