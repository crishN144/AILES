	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in">
 <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt;color:#000000">(1) The terms of Article 13(b) are by their very nature restricted in their scope. The defence has a high threshold, demonstrated by the use of the words "grave" and "intolerable".</span>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in">
 <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt;color:#000000">(4) When the allegations on which the abducting parent relies to establish grave risk are disputed, the court should first establish whether, if they are true, there would be a grave risk that the child would be exposed to physical or psychological harm or otherwise placed in an intolerable situation. If so, the court must then establish how the child can be protected from the risk.</span>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in">
 <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt;color:#000000">(5) In assessing these matters, the court must be mindful of the limitations involved in the summary nature of the Hague process. It will rarely be appropriate to hear oral evidence of the allegations made under Article13(b) and so neither the allegations nor their rebuttal are usually tested in cross-examination.</span>

 <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt;color:#000000">(6) That does not mean, however, that no evaluative assessment of the allegations should be undertaken by the court. The court must examine in concrete terms the situation in which the child would be on return. In analysing whether the allegations are of sufficient detail and substance to give rise to the grave risk, the judge will have to consider whether the evidence enables him or her confidently to discount the possibility that they do.</span>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in">
 <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt;color:#000000">(7) If the judge concludes that the allegations would potentially establish the existence of an Article 13(b) risk, he or she must then carefully consider whether and how the risk can be addressed or sufficiently ameliorated so that the child will not be exposed to the risk.</span>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.00in">
 <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt;color:#000000">(8) In many cases, sufficient protection will be afforded by extracting undertakings from the applicant as to the conditions in which the child will live when he returns and by relying on the courts of the requesting State to protect him once he is there.</span>

 <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt;color:#000000">(9) In deciding what weight can be placed on undertakings, the court has to take into account the extent to which they are likely to be effective, both in terms of compliance and in terms of the consequences, including remedies for enforcement in the requesting State, in the absence of compliance. </span>

Nor was informing her impossible or impractical; the reason he did not do so was to avoid her making a fuss or doing what she could to stop it.</span>

 <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt">The father&#8217;s case is based upon the fact, as he asserts, that if the court were to make a return order he would not accompany the children. He said that he and his wife (and the children) had made their lives here and that he has no funds in Austria, no job and nowhere to live. He had fallen out with his parents and could not live with them. Therefore he was simply not in a position to go back, and so if a return order was made the children would have to return to the mother. </span>

 <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt">The father was not a credible witness in relation to the issue of consent, and certainly the reasons he offered for refusing to return, namely that the family were settled here and he no longer had a job or somewhere to live, were not particularly persuasive for he has worked and lived in Austria for years. His parents live close to where he had been previously and seem to have a good relationship with the children. Nonetheless he has been made bankrupt and the mother&#8217;s suggestion that he moved suddenly because of difficulties with creditors, may well be right. I therefore proceed on the basis that the father is being truthful when he says he will not return.</span>

She has failed to see them regularly and neglects them emotionally. He says that she has an alcohol problem and that she has got drunk when she has had them in her care. In support of his case he produced two photographs of her lying on the floor, one of them showing that she had been sick. He produced a message in which the mother admitted having thrown a glass. He said that she lacks mental stability and lies to the court. She has problems with anger and aggression, and he pointed out that the Austrian court had followed the recommendation of the expert appointed in their case and concluded that the children should primarily live with the father. </span>

 <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt">On behalf of the mother, Mr. Perkins submits that the father has come nowhere near establishing the defence under Article 13b. First the photographs of the mother drunk were taken many years ago &#8211; on the mother&#8217;s case in 2014 and the father&#8217;s in 2017. The father does not give any examples of a recent incident where the mother&#8217;s care of the children has been found wanting. Although it was agreed by the parties in the Austrian proceedings in 2020 that the children would have their primary home with the father, they spent extensive periods of time with the mother. They had contact with her for four nights every fortnight, and holiday contact too, the last example being for three weeks in the summer holidays in 2021. There is no complaint at all about the children&#8217;s care during this lengthy period. During these Hague proceedings the mother has assiduously come over to this country every other weekend and had staying contact. The expert report from the Austrian proceedings did not include any suggestions in it that there were concerns about the mother&#8217;s drinking. </span>

 <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt">Having considered all the material before me, I accept Mr. Perkins&#8217;s submission that the assertions made by the father here, even if they are true, are not of a nature, or of sufficient detail or substance that they could constitute a grave risk of physical or psychological harm, or place the children in an intolerable situation. I can confidently discount this. This is a mother with whom the children regularly spend time with no recent examples of problems given (for example of drinking when she has the care of the children) or evidence of them coming to any harm at all when they have been with her. The photos the father produces of drinking predate the Austrian proceedings and indeed their separation. At their height the father&#8217;s allegations of emotional neglect and instability or aggression on the mother&#8217;s part would demonstrate that the children are better cared for by him in the long term, but that is something for the Austrian court to consider. I do not accept the submission made on his behalf that whilst the mother could be trusted to care for the children for a few days or three weeks at a time, once it was longer than this the mother&#8217;s care for them would become so deficient as to meet the test set out in Article 13b. Nor do I accept that the children would be placed at risk because the mother does not have enough money to keep or feed them. She may have accrued arrears with respect to maintenance to the father but this is a different matter. She and her partner are both working and have their own home where the children have stayed regularly.</span>

 <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt">The effect upon the children of a separation from their primary carer cannot be said to be so serious as to cause them psychological harm. Nor could it be intolerable for them. They are used to spending periods of up to three weeks away from him. They will be returning to a situation which is familiar to them. They will return to their old schools and they speak the language. In any event, the father suggested that it was likely there will be a hearing in Austria in about eight weeks, so that that court could make decisions about the children&#8217;s welfare then. No doubt if there were any concerns about the children arising more urgently the authorities would act. </span>
