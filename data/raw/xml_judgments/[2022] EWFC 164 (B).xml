From what I have read in the papers they are two delightful boys. By way of an order dated 1 March 2018 HHJ Oliver made a Child Arrangements Order which provides for A and B to reside with their mother and father on alternate weeks and for shared time to be split between the school holidays.</span></p>

By way of an application dated 26 November 2021 but not issued until January 2022  Ms D seeks a Child Arrangements Order and/or a Specific Issue Order which makes provision for the boys to relocate to reside with her in Somerset and to spend time with Mr D. These applications were conjoined and listed to be heard together with the mother as the applicant. Ms D has been represented by Ms Jones of counsel and Mr D has been represented by Miss Bayley of counsel. Both have provided considerable assistance to the court and I extend my gratitude to them for their constructive professionalism assisting the parties and the court in this difficult case.</span></p>

If they were to move to Somerset they would need to change schools and the new school term begins on 5 September 2022. A and B are entitled to know my decision and to absorb and understand it before they begin their new school terms. It was suggested by the Cafcass officer that they might not move until the October 2022 half term, but if I had decided it was in their best interests to move to Somerset, that would have entailed A beginning a new secondary school in London for half a term and then leaving and beginning school in Somerset, weeks after the rest of his peers. This would not be in his best interests educationally or emotionally. There were also related challenges for B. </span></p>

I am therefore providing an embargoed draft judgment to counsel and solicitors on 30 August 2022, but the substance of my decision can be communicated to Ms D, Mr D, A and B. Indeed, I ask that A and B receive the short letter I have written to them on Wednesday 31 August 2022 (attached as Appendix 1 to this judgment), when they are in their father&#8217;s care on a short camping holiday. I shall formally hand down judgment on 2 September 2022 and deal with the terms of the order giving effect to this judgment with the assistance of counsel. Given public criticism of previous welfare decisions in respect of A and B (see below) I have considered it prudent to provide a written judgment and to give permission for it be published in anonymised form. </span></p>

Private law proceedings were issued in 2017 and a District Judge made an interim decision that the boys should live alternate weeks with their mother and their father. After a final hearing in March 2018, HHJ Oliver made an order in very similar terms. Since then A and B have lived alternate weeks in the care of Ms D and Mr D at their separate homes in London. Mr D owns his home in London and Ms D rents a home. The boys attended the same primary school. I have seen their end of term reports, both are doing well educationally and socially. In January 2020 Ms D bought a home in Somerset. She continued with the rental in London and splits her time between these two homes.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">I have been concerned to read in the papers about the repeated involvement of social services and the police in the lives of A and B. These visits and assessments are not neutral acts. They may very well be upsetting for A and B however careful and un-intrusive professionals try to be. I asked counsel to provide me a chronology of these involvements. I have been provided with two chronologies as the parties were unable to agree each other&#8217;s. The reality is that A and B do not appear to need the involvement of social services or the police. They have been the subject of a child in need plan but that was largely driven by problems with their parents&#8217; communication rather than any particular need for support on the part of A or B. The involvement of outside agencies has mostly been requested by one of the parents, seeking some form of tactical advantage or because of an over-reaction to issues with the 2018 Child Arrangements Order. I  do however note both boys have had some therapeutic and mentoring support in school. Both Ms D and Mr D need to stand back and appreciate their boys are well cared for by both parents. From everything I have read, they are generally happy, healthy, well-educated and content boys. As I set out below, if they have frustrations it is with their parents and their poor relationship which at times is negatively visited on the boys&#8217; wellbeing, to their detriment. </span></p>

I was referred to there being abusive emails prior to 2018, but they were not in the bundle and this was denied by the father.  HHJ Oliver had  indicated that documentation in relation to events prior to the decision in March 2018 should not be included in the bundle.  Ms D felt that a text message sent in December 2021 was abuse by Mr D. Mr D says this was text sent by fraudsters. Certainly the police took the matter no further. I was not asked to make any findings of domestic abuse by Ms Jones and no special measures were requested for the hearing. I considered this issue myself and also determined no additional measures were necessary. </span></p>

There is not likely to be an unfairness to any party because the CAFCASS officer is required to give evidence remotely on the afternoon of the first day. The hearing will be timetabled to ensure fairness between the parties. It is not unjust to proceed. Furthermore, there are pressing best interests reasons which should be considered as part of the case management decision and they weigh against an adjournment, primarily the need for clarity over residence given the secondary school transfer.</span></p>

Miss Bayley&#8217;s position is set out in her helpful position statement. In summary she said the 2 day time listing was too short to fairly determine the issues given the amount of paperwork and the lack of judicial reading time. She was concerned about the challenges of hearing the evidence from CAFCASS at 2pm on the first day of the hearing and queries whether this was fair and referred me to  </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Garamond">L ( A child)</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> 2019  EWHC  867.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">I agree with Miss Bayley&#8217;s observations about the challenges of the hearing. I was presented with 2 bundles of papers for the hearing with 1, 332 pages. There were recent witness statements from both parties, with a copy of Mr D&#8217;s being provided to the court on the day of the hearing although it was filed and served and read by the mother&#8217;s representatives prior to the hearing. There was no witness template. The applicant&#8217;s position statement arrived at 9 am on the day of the hearing. The 2 day hearing required hearing from four (reduced to three) witnesses with apparently no reading or judgment time. It is not a happy background to make such a major decision for A and B. However, having checked with listing at the Central Family Court the parties would wait until the spring of 2023 for a three day trial.   As is well known there is a strong presumption against delay in 1989 Act proceedings. Child A will begin secondary school or move to middle school on 5 September 2022, depending on where he is living. I have already outlined above my concern that A and B know where they are to be residing and attending school as soon as possible. Having read the judgment of Sir Andrew McFarlane P in </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Garamond">L ( A child)</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> 2019  EWHC  867 I was not persuaded it provided a proper basis for adjourning this hearing. The CAFCASS officer in these proceedings gave evidence remotely after Ms D&#8217;s evidence. The father gave evidence after the CAFCASS officer on day 2. Ms Jones does not suggest there is unfairness to her client. In the end both parties gave full evidence and both parties were able to cross-examine the other party and the CAFCASS officer within the timescales. There was no unfairness and both parties&#8217; Article 6 ECHR rights have been at the forefront of my mind as I have been required to swiftly determine A&#8217;s and B&#8217;s arrangements. </span></p>

She paints a warm picture of rural life, of a wide circle of family and friends. She describes the boys making friends, their involvement in local clubs, particularly the rugby club. She  tells me about their summer holidays, fishing and on the beach. Her evidence is that the boys have their own bedrooms and have much more space than in London. She and the boys spent increasing amounts of time in Somerset during the pandemic. She considers the area where A&#8217;s secondary school is located to be unsafe. She refers to crime statistics. She said that the teacher gave a talk on the taster day which A attended which referenced crime in the area.  Ms D has sourced a primary school for B in Somerset. He has attended for a taster day and likes it. He would need to spend one year at the Somerset primary school before transferring to a middle school and thereafter moving to a secondary school.  A would attend a middle school for 2 years before transfering to a secondary school.  A has attended taster days at 2 middle schools in Somerset, as well as attending a summer camp at the school he would attend in London.</span></p>

Mr D&#8217;s second witness statement was provided in March 2022. Ms D did not remove the on-line petition. It appears to have been raised at a hearing before HHJ Oliver in June 2022 and yet it was still on-line on day one of the hearing before me on 25 August 2022. Ms D attempted to explain this, saying that she had closed the petition but had not realised that it could still be found on-line.  I considered that her explanations were inadequate and at the conclusion of the hearing, I was informed she had requested for the petition with her picture to be removed but it remained on-line as her request was being processed. I made clear how inappropriate it is for such a petition to be on-line which indirectly identifies A and B. After the hearing I was told it has now been removed.</span></p>

She wants them to have a life in Somerset. I raised with her that the CAFCASS officer reported the boys found having three homes somewhat confusing and  that they would like some stability. Ms D told me it is the first time she was aware of any such concern when reading what was said in the CAFCASS report. Ms D did not appear to think the current arrangements for the boys were confusing. They have two homes in London and their mother identifies a third home in Somerset as their home. She told me in evidence in respect of Somerset: &#8220;That&#8217;s where our life is&#8221;. Her evidence was full of examples of her registering A and B for Sea Scouts, of swimming classes and having them join and represent a local rugby club in Somerset. She considered A loved the rugby club in Somerset but disliked one in south east London his father had arranged.  Observing her, she did not appear to be able to reflect on whether the extent of the integration she had arranged with the boys in Somerset was consistent with the spirit of the order made by HHJ Oliver, giving effect to the boys&#8217; best interests in 2018.</span></p>

I would agree with this recommendation and would suggest that Ms [D] makes a financial contribution to such arrangements as they would be in [A] and [B]&#8217;s best interests. On weekends when [A] and [B] are returning to London, if travel is by car, the parents should meet at an agreed halfway point.

Clearly, however, the outcome of that approach will depend entirely on the facts of the individual case. At one end of the spectrum, it is not to be expected, for instance, that the court will be likely to impose restrictions on a parent who wishes to move to the next village, or even the next town or some distance across the county, and a parent seeking such a restriction may well get short shrift. At the other end of the spectrum, cases in which a parent wishes to relocate across the world, for example returning to their original home and to their family in Australia or New Zealand, are some of the hardest cases which the courts have to try and require great sensitivity and the utmost care.&#160;</span></p>

Its impact is upon whether the court sanctions an interference in family life by the state in the guise of the local authority.

As counsel before us agreed, in cases concerning either external or internal relocation the only test that the court applies is the paramount principle as to the welfare of the child. The application of that test involves a holistic balancing exercise undertaken with the assistance, by analogy, of the welfare checklist, even where it is not statutorily applicable. The exercise is not a linear one. It involves balancing all the relevant factors, which may vary hugely from case to case, weighing one against the other, with the objective of determining which of the available options best meets the requirement to afford paramount consideration to the welfare of the child. It is no part of this exercise to regard a decision in favour or against any particular available option as exceptional.</span></p>

She has been the primary carer or was the primary carer for the first years of their lives as she stopped work when A was born and did not return to work until 2016. Her roots are in Somerset and it is very familiar to the boys. Ms D has always wanted a move to Somerset and she is accepted as a local there. Indeed Ms D  points out that she and Mr D jointly had an offer accepted on a property in Somerset before they separated.. The CAFCASS officer&#8217;s view was that where there is very difficult communication, shared care is not a very good idea.  Ms D   gave evidence that  &#8220;she has done the best she can to make it work for the boys.&#8221; She has rented a property in the catchment area. Ms D had set up an account on a co-parenting app, Our Family Wizard, but Mr D had refused to use it.  She  had blocked Mr D&#8217;s email account in 2018.  She said  that Mr D sent abusive e emails  (There are no abusive emails identified to me in the court bundle.  I was told by Ms Jones that  HHJ Oliver had said that the exhibits should post date the hearing in March 2018). Communication is done via Mr D writing to Ms D.   She said that in future communication could take place between A and B and their father directly. Shared care will come to an end and the rotas produced by Mr D will not apply. Shared care requires much more communication because of lots of transitions. Ms D would prioritise the boys&#8217; relationship with their father. She can separate out the fact she thinks the father is a narcissist and a psychopath from their need to have a relationship with their father. The co-parenting arrangement is fraught with difficulties. Mr D is not supportive of Somerset. The application to relocate is a genuine one and that is supported by Ms Ingram. Caution is needed in respect of Mr D&#8217;s evidence given he accepted that he had  &#8216;cherry picked&#8217; the evidence, including the evidence  in respect of Ms D&#8217;s mental health.  Ms D dos not think that she will be able to continue to afford to rent and run a property in London.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Miss Bayley asks rhetorically is the current situation so toxic? She submits that HHJ Oliver&#8217;s order survives and both boys have close and loving relationship with each parent. They are doing well educationally. They have busy social lives and friends in both places. They are thriving despite the poor communication.  The intensity of the poor communication and the agenda which has fuelled much of the animosity, will reduce so the court can have confidence in there being an improvement. In summary 50:50 care had not yet reached the end of the road and there can be refinements to the order. Limited credibility can be given to Ms D&#8217;s evidence that she can sustain and nurture the boys relationship with Mr D. The application made in 2018 was refused and a final order was made, she was in court and was represented and did not appeal. When asked about what she thought about it, she said she had &#8220;pick[ed] herself up get on with it and make the most of it&#8221;. However, she did the opposite, she posted online petitions, identifying herself and the children, dragging the children&#8217;s private lives into the public arena. They have been public from May 2018 until now, even although Mr D&#8217;s witness statement was served in March. She submitted this was a serious issue that goes to the heart of the welfare checklist and that it was wholly inappropriate to air these matters publicly. Ms D complained about the social worker. She petitioned her MP Neil Coyle. She sought to undermine and criticise the social work and court process. She told the financial remedies hearing in August 2018 that she wanted to buy a house in London, she denied it and said her case was that she was moving to Somerset. Mr D then produced the witness statement that demonstrated she made no mention of Somerset. Her evidence is &#8220;utterly unreliable and this goes to the central issue of whether court can accept her evidence that she will promote Mr D&#8217;s relationship with A and B.&#8221; When she says in her evidence that she has no animosity to Mr D this is undermined by her evidence that she considers him a psychopath and a narcissist. In 2020 Ms D  did not ensure that B  came to London on his birthday, Ms D said he did not want to leave what he was doing in Somerset which was a breach of the Child Arrangements Order and which  will be repeated in the future and  will impact on the relationship. A and B&#8217;s relationship with Y will be jeopardised. Mr D  recently gave an iphone to A and Ms D posted the iphone back through the door and gave A a new iphone. The Court is only left with the mother&#8217;s word , but she is not credible. She has influenced the children and shared crime statistics,. It was questioned how can it be in child&#8217;s best interests to make a child feel nervous or scared of their own environment?  Ms D obtained  a final order in 2018 and in 2020 bought a family house 170 miles away. She had undermined and sabotaged HHJ Oliver&#8217;s order. She has set up a rival existence in Somerset which includes Sea Scouts, youth clubs and rugby clubs. This is contrary to A and B&#8217;s best interests before court had made a decision about relocation. She has put her own interests at the forefront to move to Somerset and the children are collatoral damage. CAFCASS recommend in their report that the children make the  170 mile round trip  between London and Somerset only once per month.  That is what Mr D agrees and proposes. It is onerous and tiring.</span></p>

First, relocation to Somerset for A and B to live with Ms D and to spend alternate weekends, two half term holidays, a three week summer holiday and alternate Christmas and Easter holidays with Mr D. The alternative option is continued shared care between Mr D and Ms D, with A and B attending London schools with holidays divided between Ms D and Mr D. I must carefully analyse these two options against the welfare checklist. I have not been particularly helped by considering who was the primary carer prior to 2017. I accept Ms D&#8217;s evidence she gave up her job and devoted considerable daily care to A and B but I also accept Mr D&#8217;s evidence that he played a full and meaningful daily role with A and B each morning and afternoon when he returned from work. Care has been split since 2017. Both parents have much to offer A and B and have been heavily involved in their care for many years.  </span></p>

There was no proper evidence of A&#8217;s and B&#8217;s wishes and feelings on this option. Having listened carefully to the evidence and observed Mr D in court, I do not think he was truly pushing for this option and it was in part a response to his fear that Ms D might give up her London home and thereby present the court with a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">fait accompli</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.

First of all they need each other. There was rightly no suggestion A and B should live otherwise than with each other. I agree. I have considered their needs separately but given it is manifestly in their best interests to be together, the competing matters in the welfare checklist can be approached in largely the same way.  Secondly, they need their mother. She loves her children very much and movingly describes them in her third witness statement as &#8220;the beat of my heart, the pulse in my veins, the energy of my soul&#8221;. There is no doubting her commitment to her children and they need her. Thirdly, A and B need their father. He forms a hugely important part of every aspect of their lives and meets a very significant range of all their needs but particularly their emotional needs. Fourthly, A and B also need, indeed, require, their parents to stand back and stop the conflict between them. The parents know this. Professional after professional has commented on it. Ms D and Mr D have put their needs ahead of A&#8217;s and B&#8217;s and this must now stop. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">The challenge in these proceedings is to seek to balance the frustration caused to A and B of continuing to be exposed to the parental tension and conflict as their parents seek to co-parent and manage the shared week around arrangements against the risk of significant emotional harm to A and B, of their important relationship with their father being marginalised and diminished should they live in Somerset. Having listened to the evidence I consider A and B are at risk of emotional harm if their relationship with their father did not continue in a full and meaningful manner, promoted by Ms D if she were to reside in Somerset. There are also risks in respect of their relationship with Y.  The frustration to A and B of the current arrangements is already present. A is entirely correct to describe it as &#8220;crap&#8221;. It has become worse in the last twelve months as both parents have sought to navigate advantages to improve the chances of a positive outcome in respect of this hearing.  In my judgement, it has also been made significantly more difficult as Ms D has been determined to fashion a life in Somerset to assist her in demonstrating to this court that A and B should be permitted to relocate. I agree with the Cafcass officer that Ms D&#8217;s wish to reside in Somerset with A and B is a genuine one. That is where she is from and plainly she wants for herself and her boys a rural, &#8220;organic&#8221; life, as she describes it. However, the fortnightly trips to Somerset and the long periods during the COVID pandemic when the boys were remotely educated from Somerset have added real and significant strains on the relationship between Mr D and Ms D. I do not go as far as Mr D in describing Ms D&#8217;s  attempts to create an alternative home for A and B in Somerset as &#8220;sabotage&#8221; of the order of HHJ Oliver prohibiting relocation to Somerset, but it is plain it is fraying the edges of that order and Ms D is deliberately creating a parallel home (to London) for A and B which is fuelling the communication problems and tension between the parents. That needs to stop.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">I observed the mother&#8217;s reaction to listening to Mr D&#8217;s evidence and his counsel&#8217;s closing submissions. She was consumed with anxiety and at times anger. She found it difficult to listen to the other side of this difficult family fissure. It is clear she found the shared care order difficult to accept in 2018. Her online petition, complaints about social workers and involvement of her MP demonstrate her inability to accept the court&#8217;s welfare analysis in 2018. I also consider her evidence before me has been less than honest and she was not truthful in respect of what she told me she had told the court in August 2018. As a result, I do have difficulty accepting her evidence that she is capable of prioritising Mr D&#8217;s relationship with A and B. I consider she does believe that Mr D is a control freak, a narcissist and a psychopath. She finds it very difficult to follow the court order made by HHJ Oliver and if A and B were to reside in Somerset, she may grudgingly provide Mr D with the contact the court ordered, but she would not embrace his involvement. She does not embrace what Mr D brings to enrich A and B&#8217;s life. She found that very hard to even listen to it in court. In my judgement, if A and B were to reside with her in Somerset she would not be capable of carrying out the steps that Ms Ingram said were necessary for her to advise the court that A and B should relocate. There is therefore a likelihood that Mr D will be frozen out of A and B&#8217;s lives in any meaningful way and that they are at risk of suffering emotional harm were there to be a relocation to Somerset. An important one half of their lives would become diminished. The emotional benefits from the relationship would become anaemic and under-nourished. It is contrary to their welfare for their relationship with their father to be damaged in this way. Given their ages they would likely suffer harm in the immediate short term future, but also be at risk of further harm growing up without the strong relationship they currently need and enjoy.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">I do not doubt that A and B have expressed the view that they want to move to Somerset. I consider, however, that they have been subject to quite significant influencing both from what their mother has told them and also by her actions. There has also been some influencing from Mr D. For some time, Ms D has created a pleasant rural life on the weekends and holidays that she has been able to. Naturally the boys have found this seductive. But in reality, given HHJ Oliver refused relocation to Somerset, A and B ought not to have been exposed to the level of integration in Somerset that they have been by Ms D. At this stage, until a court has properly considered relocation afresh, four years after HHJ Oliver, a responsible parent would not have sought to influence their children with a lifestyle which the court has not yet considered and approved. It also clear Ms D has undermined A&#8217;s confidence in his personal safety in London by being unfairly negative about his London secondary school and its location. Therefore, I approach the expressed wishes and feelings of A and B in the CAFCASS report with some caution, as Ms Ingram suggested I should. They are not their true ascertainable wishes and feelings. I place some weight on their wish to move to Somerset, but it is limited as A and B have not appreciated how marginalised their important emotional relationship with their father would become. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">As highlighted above, the welfare checklist matters that are pertinent here are: &#8220;the likely effect on him of any change in his circumstances&#8221;; &#8220;any harm which he has suffered or is at risk of suffering&#8221;;  &#8220;how capable each of his parents&#8230;.is of meeting his needs&#8221; and ultimately the boys&#8217; emotional needs. Overall, the relocation to Somerset is not in A and B&#8217;s best interests because they are at real risk of emotional harm because Ms D will not be capable of prioritising their need to have their relationship with Mr D nurtured and strengthened. The physical distance of 170 miles between A and B and their dad is likely to create a damaging emotional distance. I have considered very carefully, the poor parental relationship, and I am aware that I am proposing the continuation of alternate weeks of co-parenting, in the context of the poor communication. I am aware I am possibly requiring A and B to being subjected to frustration and upset by being co-parented by Mr and Ms D in circumstances where their parents seem incapable of speaking to each other. Having considered all the evidence, this is a less bad outcome for A and B than the emotional risks of relocation to Somerset. I reach this conclusion given that I believe the mother&#8217;s push to relocate by stealth before a court order, will now come to an end and the relationship between Mr and Mrs D may improve now it is clear Somerset is a place for holidays and the focus of the boys&#8217; life is their homes and schools in London. I also express the hope that the hearing and this judgment will assist Mr and Ms D to stand back and improve their communication to reduce A and B&#8217;s frustration with &#8220;the crap&#8221;.</span></p>

The risk of emotional harm to A and to B of the relocation is too great and is not in their best interests. In reaching this decision, I find myself in agreement with the advice of CAFCASS and ultimately I agree with Ms Ingram&#8217;s evidence that relocation to Somerset cannot take place in circumstance where it is very clear that Ms D cannot protect A and B from her own views of their father; cannot separate out and protect their relationship with their father, from her own strongly held views of Mr D. It would be quite wrong to expose A and B to the risk of emotional harm by permitting their much needed relationship with their father to be damaged by relocation to Somerset.</span></p>

It is also tiring for them and A in particular will needs his energies for the demands of the secondary curriculum and, soon enough, public examinations. Managing their lives in two different homes is sufficient challenge for them. Their fun time in Somerset should be appropriately preserved to Christmas, Easter, some half-term and summer holidays. A handful of weekend trips should also feature.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond">My name is John and I am a judge. I met your Mum and Dad at court in London last week. Your mum and dad have asked me to make decisions for you both about where you should live.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Your Mum asked me to decide that you should both come and live with her in Somerset and see your Dad only every second weekend and at holidays. Mum wants you to go to schools in Somerset.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Your Dad asked me to decide that things should stay as they are. That you spend one week with him and the other week with your Mum in London. Dad wants you to go to schools in London. </span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond">I think you met a lady called Shelley in July and you told her what you wanted. She told me you both liked the idea of living with your Mum in Somerset.  Shelley spoke to me as well last week.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond">I hope you both understand that I have made the decision and not your Mum or your Dad. Judges sometimes have to make decisions when parents cannot agree.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond">I have decided you should both continue to live in London with one week in the care of your Dad and then one week in the care of your mum. This means you will both go to school in London from next week. I have decided you should have nice holidays in Somerset and I will speak with your Mum and Dad again to sort that out.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond">I have made this decision after considering who you both are, what you both need and things like your education, happiness and your welfare. I have decided you need each other &#8211; I think you are good brothers to each other. I also think you need to spend time with your Mum and with your Dad. They both need to play an important role in caring for you. I was worried your Dad might not have a full and proper role in your lives if you lived in Somerset. Looking at all these things in the round I felt this was the best decision for your both, although of course I considered what you both wanted.  </span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond">I have also asked your Mum and Dad to behave a bit better. I know you both find the arguing that happens between them difficult. Although it is a naughty word, [A], you are right to describe it to Shelley as &#8220;crap&#8221;. I have told your parents to stop &#8220;the crap&#8221;.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Garamond">I hope you can both settle down with the new school term with week about with Mum and Dad in your London homes. I hope you will enjoy nice holidays in Somerset. I wish you both good luck.</span></p>
