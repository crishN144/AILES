As a result of enquiries made by the local authority and information received from the police that Mr. B was suspected of being involved in the possession of class A drugs, in public indecency offences and in driving with excess alcohol, the agreement was amended to ensure that Mr. B did not have unsupervised contact with A and that Mrs. B would be her sole carer.

Inevitably, therefore, this hearing has largely focused upon examining these further assessments and reports, but the errors and failings that occurred prior to and during the course of these proceedings continue to have relevance in view of the difficulties and delay that the father has had to face since the June 2013 hearing, particularly in securing vital elements of the necessary support package.  However, I&#160;do not propose to revisit areas that are no longer relevant or have little bearing on the issues now to be addressed and will not be drawn into detailed further scrutiny, examination and dissection of the local authority&#8217;s previous actions, inaction or attitudes in this case that led to the care or placement orders being set aside, save where it is necessary for me to do so. I&#160;have been driven to address, however, some of the failings and errors of this local authority and lessons to be learnt from these at the conclusion of this judgment, it being absolutely fundamental and crucial for the success of the rehabilitation plan that these attitudes, errors and failings are not repeated.</span></p>

Given the history of the number of different workers who have been involved with and allocated to this family, it is not surprising that these parents feel, justifiably, apprehensive and concerned about having to establish, yet again, further relationships with a new social worker.</span></p>

Both doctors agreed there is potential for some development and learning when some areas of missed learning are recoverable. They further agreed that the mother&#8217;s difficulties would not preclude adequate parenting but support and teaching would be needed to take account of her learning difficulties. She is able to think hypothetically and can anticipate consequences which would be important in teaching new skills and anticipating a range of responses. However, the mother tends to be somewhat literal and concrete in her thinking and she has a particular difficulty in retaining information, transferring anything she has learnt and maintaining new skills consistently. Her learning will be slow but not impossible.</span></p>

He found the mother lacks adequate ability to attune to A&#8217;s emotional needs. She also lacks an ability to protect A from harm because of her inability to protect herself from harmful relationships with others. The consequences of this are that A would develop insecure attachments if she was looked after by Miss&#160;G and may be at risk of harm due to any relationship the mother may engage in which could put herself at risk as well as A. A treatment plan would need to include counselling or psychotherapy to address Miss&#160;G&#8217;s own emotional needs. This would take a year, if not longer. Miss&#160;G&#8217;s emotional limitations are deeply rooted in her childhood development. A&#8217;s safety could not be adequately guaranteed if placed with Miss&#160;G during the time she is undertaking therapeutic work. Dr Willemsen concluded that his concerns are not necessarily related to Miss&#160;G&#8217;s cognitive abilities; although these limited cognitive abilities may have hindered the processing of emotional difficulties she endured during her childhood. Her cognitive abilities would probably also affect the pace at which she may be able to undertake therapeutic work.</span></p>

She has difficulty understanding the manner in which she engages with people and the trust she places in people. She lacks insight into her own relationships and also into the emotional needs of A. Initially Miss&#160;G would be happy to accept help but with time she would become overwhelmed with A and may seek to rely on professionals to the point where she may need them to look after A; as effectively happened during Dr Willemsen&#8217;s observed period of contact. Miss&#160;G first needs to undergo treatment, therefore, before rehabilitation of A to her care could be considered.  If rehabilitation was carried out in conjunction with treatment, this would put A at risk of neglect of her emotional needs and would expose Miss&#160;G&#8217;s limited ability to protect herself and, therefore, A from others. It is unlikely that the NHS would fund Miss&#160;G&#8217;s treatment, and this was because the prognosis for change was not significant enough.</span></p>

He was particularly worried about Miss&#160;G&#8217;s bonding with A, her relationships with adults and her ability to protect herself. He was disturbed and concerned by the two examples of mother being taken for granted by others to her own detriment, and of being unable to stand up to adults, again to her own detriment. She had not been able, for example, to stand up to a man who had befriended her and had engaged in sexual intercourse with him which she then described as rape. A further example was the mother feeling overrun and abused by her father and uncles.  Whether or not Miss&#160;G was in fact raped in the technical sense by the man who had befriended her, it was a matter that mother found deeply traumatic.  Dr.&#160;Willemsen said she still had not processed this and did not have an understanding as to why it might have happened.</span></p>

A ran away from Miss&#160;G; this he considered, was a manifestation of her not connecting with her mother. A struggled to find an effective connection with Miss&#160;G. The crucial question, said Dr Willemsen, was whether or not A could form an attachment to her mother. This is what would guarantee and hold A&#8217;s emotional development. Could A feel safe with Miss&#160;G?

There was something, he concluded, intrinsic in the mother that stops A from attaching to her. What he observed was that the mother&#8217;s world does not resonate with that of A. He stood by his conclusions which he noted were very much replicated in the work that had been carried out after his involvement:</span></p>

Again, there were positive points from these assessments.  Miss&#160;G attended punctually and tried her best for the majority of the time. There was no doubt, said Miss&#160;Ferdinando, that Miss&#160;G loves A wholeheartedly. Miss&#160;Ferdinando noted that, overall, contact was fairly positive. She did not find Miss G difficult to understand. That is important when one considers the difficulties that mother had in accepting the accuracy in some respects of Miss&#160;Ferdinando&#8217;s recordings. Miss&#160;Ferdinando and her team observed some warmth between A and her mother but, as with Dr.&#160;Willemsen, they also observed difficulties in this relationship and in A&#8217;s bonding. Miss&#160;Ferdinando&#8217;s assessment was carried out over a very lengthy period of time; the team had hoped to have seen some more emotional attunement and more warmth develop but this did not happen. There remain concerns in most areas of Miss&#160;G&#8217;s parenting, even in basic care - feeding, nappy changing, safety &#8211; as well as in communication, language and stimulation, reasoned stability and emotional attunement.  </span></p>

The fact she loves A wholeheartedly does not mean that she can care safely for her.  Love on its own, said Ms Ferdinando, is not enough and, although Miss&#160;G has made some improvement in some areas, these improvements have not been sufficiently significant. The assessment highlighted Miss&#160;G&#8217;s inability to take on board and apply advice. She continues to need fairly constant prompting.

Ms Ferdinando highlighted, as did Dr.&#160;Willemsen, mother&#8217;s vulnerability. There is a significant risk that this mother could befriend people who are not safe for A. At the moment, A is a very bright little girl and she needs to be able to develop but she would falter developmentally in mother&#8217;s care.</span></p>

They would not be consistent in their parenting. Not only do they live in very different geographical areas but they also have a different approach to parenting. Ms Ferdinando was further concerned that the relationship between the mother and grandmother had only been rekindled in very recent months. She concluded that, together, Miss&#160;G and her mother could not manage the care of A successfully. Even in a period of two hours problems arose. The grandmother was not, as Miss&#160;G contends, taking a back seat. Miss&#160;G lacks confidence in her parenting skills and to some degree she is controlled by her own mother. It was noted, for example, that Ms G made less progress when her mother was present. For future contact, Ms&#160;Ferdinando recommended a pre-contact session for Ms G a week before each contact to teach her and help her; for example, teach her a game, cook, talk about how to keep a child safe.  A will be developing and changing quite rapidly and Ms G will need help to try to move with her. Help and advice should also be provided for Ms G after contact sessions, as well as before.</span></p>

During the assessment Miss&#160;G also made serious allegations of abuse against her uncle, saying he had abused her throughout her childhood and that her mother allowed that to happen. Miss&#160;G had claimed her brother had joined in with this abuse. The mother described her childhood as lonely and isolated. As Miss Conn submitted on behalf of Mr.&#160;C, and as she put to Miss&#160;Ferdinando, either Ms G is lying or has convinced herself that these allegations are true. If they are true, it would be wholly inappropriate for the grandmother to be involved with caring for A. Miss&#160;G now denies she said these things to Miss&#160;Ferdinando and denies her family abused her in the way described.  Having had the benefit of hearing Miss G&#8217;s evidence and that of Ms Ferdinando and other witnesses, I find that Miss&#160;Ferdinando was an accurate witness who had correctly recorded what mother had told her during the course of her assessment. Where there were differences between what Miss&#160;G said she said to Miss&#160;Ferdinando and what Miss&#160;Ferdinando&#8217;s recollection was, I&#160;prefer and accept the evidence of Miss&#160;Ferdinando.</span></p>

As Miss&#160;Conn submits, this is reflective of the local authority failing to take on board the judgment of McFarlane LJ and the fundamental principle that, as a profoundly deaf parent, this father requires specialist assessment, that being a reasonable adjustment within the meaning of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Equality Act 2010</ref>, and such reasonable adjustment being a legal duty owed to him. Miss Marinnan&#8217;s instruction was not only erroneous and a complete waste of funds but it also resulted in the manifest waste of time Miss&#160;Conn describes. This delay was wholly disproportionate and contrary to the welfare interests of A and prejudicial to the father&#8217;s position. Ms Marinnan&#8217;s area of expertise could and should have been ascertained before she was even advanced as an expert of choice. A simple phone call could easily have established this.</span></p>

Ms Robinson did not share the mother&#8217;s concern that the father would return to Portugal in the near future. He had been consistent throughout with her that he prefers to live in Britain. He had said that the only reason he had been thinking of returning to Portugal was for the support of his parents but he now realises there is much more support for him here. Nor did Mrs Robinson agree with mother that once the local authority was no longer involved, the father would not promote contact. She accepted that her assessment revealed the father has limited understanding of mental health, and that he did not appreciated the mother&#8217;s difficulties after giving birth. Mrs.&#160;Robinson described how, when she explained to Mr.&#160;C that it was not good for A to hear from him that her mother was &#8220;bad&#8221;, it was like a &#8220;light bulb&#8221; moment for him - he had not thought about this in the context she put before him.

His lifestyle will need to change considerably. He has to adjust to being a single father, which is new for him and, although he has experience in caring for his niece and nephew, it will be a steep learning curve. The father is motivated and very willing to do whatever is asked of him. It is vital that professionals who are themselves deaf are involved in working with him and that these deaf professionals help give feedback to him as to how rehabilitation is going. The father needs a conduit so that he will feel he is being listened to and the local authority will understand his perspective. It is also important the father is not overloaded and for there to be bespoke awareness training for the social workers. This is not a case where &#8216;off the shelf&#8217; training will suffice as had been proposed by the local authority through their three and a half hour course. It was during this hearing that Mrs Robinson heard for the first time of the local authority&#8217;s proposals for such deaf awareness training. This had not been what she had recommended or intended. The social worker working with this family needs a bespoke deaf awareness training to help with the particular issues this father will have with parenting. These issues will be challenging for the father. It is challenging being a deaf parent, and the social worker needs to learn how to communicate with him. He needs the training broken down into a different format. As Mrs.&#160;Robinson highlighted in her report [p.16], Mr.&#160;C&#8217;s style of communicating requires a high level of cultural and deaf understanding; interpreters need to be aware of the need for cultural mediation when they are voicing over his signing. Mrs Robinson is able to deliver a bespoke training package and, by the end of the hearing, the local authority agreed that she should be the person to train the social workers who will be involved with the family and working with the father.</span></p>

The mother said she feared she might hurt her. Miss Gross was rightly concerned about that. The mother also reported that she had experienced physical and emotional abuse from the father and claimed she had been punched in the head by him during the previous incident. Extraordinarily, despite the mother&#8217;s making it clear that she intended to raise her child with Mr.&#160;C and despite the fact that Mr.&#160;C was registered on A&#8217;s birth certificate and has parental responsibility, Miss Gross did not attempt to have any conversation with him. This was, she said, because of Miss&#160;G&#8217;s allegations of domestic violence.  Ms Gross told me her remit was to support the mother with her unborn child but this does not begin to excuse or justify her failure to make any attempt to communicate with the father. Miss Gross&#8217;s failure to speak with the father represented, as Miss&#160;Conn submits, a major failure on the part of the local authority to assist this family and was the beginning of the father being excluded at that time from gaining access to essential information.

Carly Walsh confirmed she did not have any difficulty understanding the mother&#8217;s speech.

She was quite clear that&#8217; on 20</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> August 2012 the mother had left the hospital and did not inform anyone before she did so. The nursing staff only realised the mother had left when they found A alone and unattended by the mother. The mother claimed in evidence that she had been advised by the hospital staff to leave as she, the mother, was extremely tired. The mother told me she had been told to go home to rest and did not need to return until the following day. This was not what she had told Miss&#160;Walsh. New mothers do get tired. On these occasions, nursing staff care for a baby while the mother rests. It would be an extraordinary position if a member of the nursing staff advised a new mother to abandon her baby and go home. The mother was not truthful in her evidence about this. On this issue I&#160;accept the evidence of Carly Walsh. Mother effectively abandoned A at the hospital for a short period and left, not telling anyone she had done so. The staff did not know where she had gone and she could not be contacted.</span></p>

The psychiatrist and expert evidence to which I&#160;have already made reference, refers to the mother&#8217;s childhood and upbringing and the impact her own experiences have had upon her. It is difficult to know where the truth lies in respect of the various histories the mother has given about this. In evidence she sought to play down and minimise her earlier reports of a very difficult and troubled childhood. She had reported being seriously assaulted by her brother and uncle and claimed her mother had failed to protect her from that abuse. In her oral evidence, she minimised this abuse and sought to back-pedal. She said she had been assaulted on only one occasion, and there was &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">only one bad day</span><span style="font-size:14pt">&#8221; when her family had abused her.  She said there may have been a few &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">hiccups</span><span style="font-size:14pt">&#8221;. This was very different from the picture she painted of her upbringing during her assessments. During her evidence before Judge&#160;Turner QC, she claimed her family had neglected her, had controlled her and abused her; that was a reason for her severing ties with him (again matters she now denies). She explained to me she had told lies before Judge Turner QC because she was not in the right state of mind when she gave evidence. </span></p>

Looking back, she said she regretted this.  She did not know how to react or respond. She said she felt scared and terrified of what would happen and that she had felt terrified and powerless throughout.  I&#160;return to that matter in a moment when I&#160;deal with the allegations she brings about the father and, in particular, her new evidence that she said that she was under pressure from the father who signed to her during the course of evidence.  Her position in respect of the local authority&#8217;s threshold is that she disputes much of what they say about her and blames the father for the threshold being crossed.</span></p>

He even went out to purchase some milk so that she could give A the right formula but she still could not manage to feed her properly.

She says she lied about their separation before Judge Turner QC because the father had wanted her to lie. He had been physically and verbally abusive to her throughout the relationship. She feared for her own safety if she did not do as he said. She further claimed that her solicitor at the time knew what was happening but gave her no support. When challenged about that by Mr. Bain on behalf of the local authority, to the effect that there was no suggestion at the hearing in June 2013 that she was frightened of the father, the mother claimed she was trying to keep as calm as she possibly could but, deep down, she was frightened and terrified. It was at this point during the course of her oral evidence in this hearing that the mother said, for the first time, that the father had placed her under pressure when she was giving evidence and that, unbeknown to anyone in the court room, while she was actually giving evidence he had been signing to her behind the back of his counsel and telling her what to say. No one had seen or picked this up. Miss&#160;G had not alleged this before, either during the last hearing, in any of her statements for this hearing - not, for example, in para.5 of her statement when she explained why she had lied herself during the hearing in June 2013 - nor is it included in her schedule of allegations against the father. It did not arise and she did not make any reference to this until she was being cross-examined. She claimed father was physically signing, telling her what to say, what not to say. When it was put by Mr. Bain to the mother that she had given her evidence in two parts on 6</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> June and on 7</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> June, she claimed he had signed to her on both days.

The father&#8217;s BSL interpreter, an experienced court interpreter and indeed court trainer for other BSL interpreters was sitting next to him during the course of the hearing in June 2013, as she has been during this hearing. It is inconceivable that she would not notice, and if notice, would not stop her client from signing to a witness in the middle of their evidence. The simple fact is that the mother has fabricated her evidence about this during this hearing to try to advance a false explanation for her own lies on oath and in so doing advance a further allegation against the father.</span></p>

The father accepted in evidence that he had done so, although he denied any arguments at all. I&#160;find he minimised the extent of the friction in his relationship with the mother about this. He accepted he tapped her on the head because he wanted her to stop lying and wanted her to try to improve things with the counselling. He had tapped her to demonstrate the BSL sign for &#8220;think&#8221;. The mother&#8217;s allegation, however, goes much further than what is accepted by the father. She alleges he lost his temper and hit her hard with his knuckles on the forehead.</span></p>

This does not apply to the mother&#8217;s recent allegation that the father hit A, an allegation she knows is not true and is one she has deliberately fabricated against the father.</span></p>

She did not support A returning to the mother.  Her plan was for A to be rehabilitated to the father. She recognised the need for a bespoke care and support package. It was a difficult plan to advance. Miss&#160;Montack told me that she had not prepared such a plan before. It was her first attempt at a bespoke package but she would have been assisted and informed by the expert evidence, and in particular those experts who set out in detailed reports and in their oral evidence indeed exactly what was required to ensure that the plan of rehabilitation had the best chance of success. </span></p>

Sensitivity for this mother and this father who have been on an emotional roller coaster for over two years, facing the prospect of enforced adoption of their daughter and who now, both, have a realistic and sustainable opportunity to have a continuing and developing relationship with her. Clarity in respect of what needs to be done and must be done by this local authority in providing the necessary and essential support and resources to this family; particularly for the father.

The maternal grandmother cannot provide sufficient compensation for the mother&#8217;s deficits in these areas. Although the grandmother has the potential to be a support for the mother, the relationship between the mother and grandmother is not a stable one.

Most of these have now been addressed and, consequently, the support package has been amended and enhanced (even as late as this week) and will be incorporated into a further amended bespoke rehabilitation and support plan. It is plain to me that the current social worker, Ms Sheryl Montack (who will remain A&#8217;s social worker throughout the life of the supervision order &#8211; and this is important) and her line manager, Mr Young, who have both been in court throughout this final hearing are committed to the rehabilitation plan and want to see it succeed.

In the early stage of the proceedings, several hearings were affected either due to the misunderstanding of the father&#8217;s needs (eg hearing 11/9/2012)  or due to the unavailability / insufficiency/ inadequacy of British Sign Language Interpreters (eg hearings 27.09.2012; 05.10.2012; 17.20.2012; 06.12.2012; 18.04.2012).

If it is not addressed now and feelings become even more entrenched (if that is possible), A&#8217;s placement with her father and her contact with her mother could be prejudiced and jeopardized. The maternal grandmother needs to be included in this work. Supervisors need to be astute and alert to the possible undermining by the mother and maternal grandmother of A&#8217;s relationship and placement with the father. The need for and importance of this work needs to be reflected in the support package. It may be that the work with the mother and the maternal grandmother pre and post contact can be used as a starting point of this work for them but father also needs work in respect of his negative attitudes and feelings towards the mother. </span></p>

I give the failure as an example of Carly Walsh to speak with the father or even attempt to do so and the difficulties in providing for this father the necessary level of expertise, communication  and assessment when the case was transferred. The provision from the outset of BSL interpreters for parents in the position of this father is essential. It runs through every aspect of pre-proceedings assessment and the proceedings. The father&#8217;s ability to obtain and understand advice and to be able understand what is said about him is imperative.</span></p>

Dr.&#160;Cornes identified substantial shortcomings in the process undertaken by the local authority and by the court at first instance.  I&#160;accept those concerns. Furthermore, the local authority reached conclusions and made assumptions adverse to the father in respect of the allegations made by the mother against the father without giving him the opportunity to give his account; no proper account was taken of the extraneous evidence from the police report which contradicted the mother&#8217;s versions and concerns which they must have known about that the mother was not an accurate historian.</span></p>

He would be materially disadvantaged in trying to present his case to the court. When he is assisted by an interpreter he can communicate but it is unrealistic to assume that that removes all barriers to communication.

She need not have been. She is now 2yrs 3m. Far from these proceeding being concluded in 26 weeks, they are only now being concluded in just over 26 months. Had proper account been taken by the local authority of the disabilities of this father and the difficulties of the mother, prior to and during the proceedings and had the assessments been undertaken by those with the appropriate skills, and necessary use made of interpreters and intermediaries, the plan which is now before the court for A to be rehabilitated to her father could have been put into effect many months ago. A would not need to have been in care for so long, if at all. It is only as a result of the diligence and determination of the father&#8217;s legal team and, in particular, his Counsel, Miss Conn, that A has not been placed for adoption which would have resulted in the severing of all links with her birth family. This case has resulted in a plan for A to be reunited with her father. Had the father&#8217;s legal team not persevered, the outcome could have been very different to the detriment of A and her parents &#8211; and that would have been a tragedy.</span></p>

This will require not only dedication and patience from the local authority but also commitment and work from the father. Whilst it is right that the father needs to understand exactly what is expected of him and what he can expect of the local authority, he must also take responsibility for his part in this rehabilitation plan. He cannot sit back. I do not think he will do so. He is highly motivated and committed to care for his daughter. This next stage will be, as Ms Kelly on behalf of the Guardian highlights, a testing time for the father who will now experience a change in his lifestyle and will see demands placed on him of the most challenging kind. He must avail himself of the support to him and take on board advice. He will need to become more proactive in seeking suitable support and assistance. He will also need to work on developing his understanding and tolerance of the mother&#8217;s difficulties and present her to A in a positive light</span></p>

There remains much misunderstanding and inaccurate assumptions as to how those who are profoundly deaf communicate. It is through cases such as this that lessons can be learnt.

Local authorities must be astute in ensuring that assessments of parents with a disability, such as profound deafness and extremely limited speech, are carried out by those who have the understanding, expertise and knowledge to communicate with and assess such parents. If they do not, as this case has shown, that wrong decisions will be made and children will potentially be separated permanently and unjustifiably from their parents.</span></p>
