They drafted a will for her to consider, which left a legacy of &#163;25,000 to JB, certain other legacies, and her residuary estate to be held in a trust fund to benefit animal welfare charities.  No will was executed on the basis of this instruction. From manuscript annotations to the draft will it appears that PP considered revising her instructions so that 50% of the residuary estate would be left to JB and 50% to CH&#8217;s children (F63-78); the notes appear to be made by someone other than PP since they refer to &#8220;you&#8221; rather than &#8220;I&#8221;.

She told him that her money was being administered by PS&#8217;s firm.  She recalled that BB was her Attorney but did not understand the effect of the LPAs.  She described BB as a very nice man who she trusts implicitly.  She made several remarks showing distrust of JB.  She was concerned about JB&#8217;s influence on BB, which meant that she was unwilling for BB to continue to act as attorney.  She said that she had not agreed to the transfer of &#163;324,000 to JB.</p>

She considered the breakdown of the relationship between BB and PS&#8217;s firm.  BB had told her that PS had failed to recognise that PP lacked capacity to manage her money and that PS had acted unprofessionally by taking PP to the bank and demanding to see her accounts.  The investigator considered that it was in PP&#8217;s best interests that her investments should continue to be managed by PS&#8217;s company because of the rapport and trust between her and PS.  However she acknowledged that, if BB was unable to work with PS&#8217;s firm, the investments would have to be moved to a firm he could work with.</p>

While the effect of the PET is to reduce the share received by the grandchildren, the total pot has increased.  All the grandchildren of all ages have consented to the application.  BB and JB&#8217;s younger children are benefiting by living in the house to which PP has in effect contributed.

He drew my attention to paragraph 35 of Re M in particular. The Official Solicitor says that in making a best interests decision I must in particular have regard to PP&#8217;s wishes and feelings, the affordability of the gifts and the alteration in the devolution of her estate as a consequence of the gifts.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Counsel said that, as to PP&#8217;s wishes and feelings, the only evidence that PP wished to engage in IHT planning is PS&#8217; letter of 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2013 on which the Applicant originally relied.  She merely sought general advice and there was nothing to show a firm intention to give away almost 25% of her estate.  The Official Solicitor described PS as a neutral third party as well as financial adviser of long standing, so that his letter is of probative value.  He argued that PP expressed strong and consistent views of distress and unhappiness about the gifting over a long period thereafter.  He suggested that PP was affected by her wishes and feeling being ignored.  Her wish to preserve her assets in her lifetime was perfectly sensible and rational. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">As to affordability the Official Solicitor referred to the loss of investment income resulting from the reduction in PP&#8217;s assets and the decision by BB to invest for capital growth rather than income and capital growth.  He said that when BB and CD took investment advice, the analysis showed that PP would enter income shortfall in 2016 (E57).  As the Applicant&#8217;s counsel pointed out, this date will depend on the rate at which care charges increase over time; the calculations done by the care home were based on an assumption of a lower rate of increase than used by the investment adviser.  It is the Official Solicitor&#8217;s position that it is not in the best interests of PP to part with so much capital.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">As to the devolution of the estate, the impact of the gift is significantly to reduce the amount to be passed to PP&#8217;s grandchildren.  The income shortfall will also reduce the amount of PP&#8217;s estate which will pass under her will.  The children of BB and JB may obtain some advantage from the gift but AH and MH will receive no indirect benefit.  The Applicant&#8217;s proposal for JB to place money in trust for the grandchildren is inappropriate.  Depending on my decision on ratification, it may be necessary to consider whether a statutory codicil should be authorised to reduce JB&#8217;s share of the estate.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">In summary the OS does not consider that ratification is in PP&#8217;s best interests.  The Applicant&#8217;s case is based on PP&#8217;s purported wishes but neutral independent evidence does not support that contention.  The evidence from PS&#8217;s file note of 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2013 that PP did not want to reduce her IHT liability because her relationship with her daughter was not good is, in the Official Solicitor&#8217;s submission, a factor which approaches magnetic importance.</p>

Her annual income is &#163;39,245.  There would therefore be an annual income shortfall of &#163;17,431.  Over twenty years, this would amount to about &#163;350,000.

If her total expenditure were &#163;80,000 per annum (including items other than care) and income stayed at current levels, annual shortfall would be &#163;40,755, which over 20 years would amount to &#163;815,000.  This may be an over pessimistic calculation of the differential between income and expenditure but it reveals that PP&#8217;s care costs could absorb a considerable amount of her capital over a twenty year life expectancy.  PP has capital assets. She has clearly stated that she wants them to be available to meet her needs.  In my judgment it is right that there should be sufficient funds retained to keep PP in comfort and with a good quality of care for the rest of her life.  There should be a cushion over and above the likely cost of meeting PP&#8217;s care costs to meet unforeseen needs, for example the need for private medical treatment.</p>

There is no evidence that PP wished to privilege JB over her grandchildren by giving her a lifetime gift of almost one quarter of her estate.  The effect of the PET is to alter the percentage shares in PP&#8217;s estate so that JB receives about 63-66% of the estate (depending on the incidence of IHT) and the seven grandchildren about 33-37% to share between them.

I acknowledge that BB, JB and their family have taken the brunt of responsibility for PP since she moved to be near them in 2011 and that she derives benefit from the fact that they live so close to her. Therefore  I will not require repayment of the amount of &#163;160,000 used by JB and BB in the purchase of their current home. However it must be brought into hotchpot, so that it forms part of JB&#8217;s 50% share of PP&#8217;s estate.  A statutory will or codicil must be drafted to give effect to that decision.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"> It would not be fair to BB or CD for me to make a decision without giving them an opportunity to put forward their case.  However I have already heard evidence over one day of hearing in which an exhaustive investigation of BB&#8217;s actions was conducted.  My preliminary view is that it would not comply with the overriding objective to hold a further attended hearing, particularly as regards costs, timely resolution and proportionate use of the court&#8217;s resources.  Instead BB and CD should be given an opportunity to file a witness statement and position statement (in one form COP24) setting out their evidence and arguments and the order they seek from the court.  I will then consider whether to make a decision on the papers or to hold a brief telephone hearing to give my decision.</p>
