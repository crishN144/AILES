Surrey&#160;County&#160;Council is the first respondent, being the relevant Local&#160;Authority.  The Council is represented by Anna&#160;Tkaczynska.  Surrey Downs Clinical Commissioning Group is the second respondent.  It did not attend and was not represented at the hearing, certain issues concerning its role having been agreed.</span></p>

On 3&#160;October&#160;2014 the first respondent referred P to Surrey&#160;Downs&#160;Clinical&#160;Commissioning&#160;Group, the second respondent, for assessment for NHS continuing healthcare.  On 10&#160;October&#160;2014, following a safeguarding senior strategy meeting at the care home, P&#8217;s staffing ratio was increased from one to one during the day to two-to-one, and one-to-one at night.</span></p>

An urgent authorisation was issued on 24&#160;November&#160;2014, by which time P had been residing at the care home in circumstances where he was in fact deprived of his liberty for 11 weeks and four days.  The duration of the urgent authorisation, on the face of the document, is seven days, i.e. expiring on 30&#160;November&#160;2014.  Although an earlier date, 10&#160;November&#160;2014, is shown at C49 of the bundle, that date has been crossed through and a purportedly corrected date of 24&#160;November&#160;2014 was recorded on the urgent authorisation signed by the manager of the care home.  There was no evidence before me of any extension of the urgent authorisation.  Mr&#160;Mant has argued that the fact that the date 10&#160;November&#160;2014 appears on the document at all invalidates it but I do not accept that.  The date shown in the place on the form where the date is to be entered is 24&#160;November&#160;2014.</span></p>

A number of important issues arise from the best  interests assessment itself.  First, BR, who, as I have said, was the relevant person&#8217;s representative in respect of the standard authorisation, had told the social worker that she did not believe the care home was a suitable placement for P because it was large, lacked a homely feel and because of the contrasting needs of the other significantly older service users resident there.</span></p>

Thirdly, Mr&#160;Hill, the social worker, recorded his judgment that P&#8217;s current care and accommodation amounted to a deprivation of his liberty and that it was necessary and in his best  interests for a short period of time.  Fourthly, the social worker&#8217;s identification of a broad consensus that P needed to be found &#8216;a more homely placement with other people using the service being closer to his age&#8217;.  Fifthly, the social worker&#8217;s observation that the current placement, that is the care home, was the least restrictive option achievable &#8216;at present and in the short term&#8217;.</span></p>

She was of the opinion that the placement at the care home was not suitable for P, given the older age group of the other service users.  She believed other placements have more specialist services and a younger client group that would not require the then current extent of two-to-one staffing to care for P as was in place at the care home after the review.

Having regard to the period of time that P had been deprived of his liberty prior to the urgent authorisation, the ultimate decision on duration is drawn into sharper focus.  Furthermore, in my judgment, in deciding on the duration of the standard authorisation, Mr Butler placed too much weight on the desirability of avoiding further assessments.

Firstly, the deprivation of liberty authorisation relates to the circumstances in which P is deprived of his liberty, not to his condition, i.e. it is situation-specific, not person-specific.  It does not authorise P&#8217;s detention in any other location, and so, on moving P to a different care facility, a fresh deprivation of liberty authorisation would have had to have been applied for.  If the circumstances permitted there is provision in the rules to enable the application to be made in advance of the move.</span></p>

Considering that P had initially been unlawfully detained at the care home from 5&#160;September&#160;2014 and had been continuously deprived of his liberty at the care home, I do not consider it possible for the best  interests assessor and the supervisory body reasonably to conclude that P&#8217;s stay there for a period totalling one year and six weeks amounted to the short period recommended by the best  interests assessor, nor would it be reasonable to conclude that the standard authorisation actually issued was for a short period.</span></p>
