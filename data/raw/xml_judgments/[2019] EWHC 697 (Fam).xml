They have lived, it seems, in England for some years, certainly since around September 2015.

At roughly the same time the husband pronounced the Talaq in Oman and on 19 October 2017 the husband obtained an Omani divorce certificate which was presented to the wife the day after she had served her English divorce petition on him. </p>

He made further orders to timetable the principle application through to a final hearing on 11-15 March and at paragraph14 he provided that the time for compliance by the respondent with paragraph 1 and 2 of the May 2018 order is finally extended to 4.00 p.m. on 1 February 2019. </p>

Further supporting that submission, he referred me to the part of the judgment of Holman J of 24 July, which I have referred to earlier, in which the husband's team produced to the court a statement and made submissions to the court about the order that had been made on 1 May and the failure to comply with it at that stage.

Contempt will not be established where the breach is of an order which is ambiguous, or which does not require or forbid the performance of a particular act within a specified timeframe. The person or persons affected must know with complete precision what it is that they are required to do or abstain from doing. It is not possible to imply terms into an injunction. The first task for the judge hearing an application for committal for alleged breach of a mandatory (positive) order is to identify, by reference to the express language of the order, precisely what it is that the order required the defendant to do. That is a question of construction and, thus, a question of   law. Ideally the order should be contained in one document but where a subsequent order extends time for compliance it may be acceptable for the obligation to be contained in two orders; the obligation must be clear.  </p>

I do not consider FPR 37.4 (2) to be relevant; and I consider this would apply to a situation where the time for compliance was varied prior to the expiry of the time limit rather than where time was extended after the expiry of the time limit. The contempt crystallises as at the date of the failure to comply and continues until such time as a later order was made. If the alternative were the case each failure to comply would be wiped clean by a variation of time after the event which would have the effect of creating a breach only of the last deadline notwithstanding the fact that earlier failures to comply were also contumelious breaches </p>

In that decision, the Court of Appeal approved the approach of His Honour Judge Wildblood who had identified that the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment furthered a number of goals within the umbrella of the administration of justice, one of which is to punish an individual for contempt of court and another purpose is to encourage or coerce compliance.  In particular, Lord Justice Moylan endorsed the imposition of a sentence which identified which component was that which punished the respondent for failure to comply and that component which was coercive in its intent. </p>

This was not an individual who was unaware of the need for information to be provided to the court in order to progress the application.  The failure to comply with the order at that stage is continuing, as it were, to sound now because the final hearing is upcoming and I know from the material that the evidence is still not available to the court, and so that puts the court in a difficult position.  The failure to comply was a failure to produce it by 15 May and, as it were that failure to comply continued through until 24 July when Holman J extended the period in which compliance was required.  The husband was therefore in contempt of court for a period of somewhere in the region of two months, ten weeks, something of that nature. </p>

It seems to me that it is too serious to warrant a fine, in any event, from what I know from the husband's financial resources a fine would be unlikely to have any real effect in terms of punishment or in terms of encouraging him to comply with the order.  Therefore, it seems to me that it is so serious that a sentence of imprisonment is warranted.  The question is whether it is so serious that only an immediate term of imprisonment can be imposed. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.1in">Given that it is only one count of contempt over a limited period of time, it seems to me that it is not so serious that an immediate term of imprisonment is required but rather, the purposes of punishment and/or encouragement could be met by the imposition of a suspended sentence of imprisonment in the circumstances of this.  The term of imprisonment, it seems to me, six months would be too long, but a period of three months' imprisonment suspended is the appropriate term to impose. </p>
