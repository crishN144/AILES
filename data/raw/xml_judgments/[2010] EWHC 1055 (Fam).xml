	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="jus" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.27in"><span style="font-size:11pt">The couple had separated in 2005 after having been together for nine years, finally marrying in 2003, after an invalid marriage in Spain in 1998. The wife moved to her home town of Dublin with their daughter to live in a house awarded to her as part of the settlement. Also included in the settlement were periodical payments at an annual rate of &#163;135,000 from November 2006 until the judgment (March 2009) and &#163;125,000 thereafter. During the hearing, the judge had heard evidence that the wife was cohabiting with another man from the husband's father, and an enquiry agent who had been observing movements at the wife's house. This allegation was at first denied by the wife but the husband also revealed that the wife was now pregnant by her new partner, a fact she had not disclosed and which led her to admit that she did have a permanent relationship. However, counsel for the husband had not put before the judge any documentary evidence as to the alleged cohabitant's income or contributions. In his judgment below Singer J considered the relevant authorities, including </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">Fleming</span><span style="font-size:11pt">, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">Atkinson</span><span style="font-size:11pt"> and </span><span class="Emphasis" style="font-size:11pt">K v K</span><span style="font-size:11pt"> before concluding that "[t]he presence of L on W&#8217;s scene, and indeed the presence of their child, do not in my opinion affect at all the quantum of capital provision with which W should exit this marriage." </span><br/><span style="font-size:11pt">In this appeal counsel for the husband submitted that i) the judge had failed to make proper findings of fact regarding the alleged cohabitation and ii) the judge misdirected himself in law and failed to recognise that a new approach had emerged concerning the inter-relationship between pre- and post-marital cohabitation, it being argued that there was no logic in pre-marital cohabitation being added for the purposes of assessment when post-marital cohabitation is ignored. In allowing the appeal, Thorpe LJ first concludes that the judge was plainly wrong in his factual findings. Though he had been correct to say there was no evidence of financial contribution by the new partner, the question should be not what he is contributing but what he should be contributing and the judge was not bound by the evidence put before him in his search for fairness. On the second submission, he concludes that the analysis in </span><span class="Emphasis" style="font-size:11pt">Fleming</span><span style="font-size:11pt"> still stands and, in the absence of parliamentary legislation, while the argument put forward is "superficially attractive ..... [it] does not run unless and until the applicant has acquired a statutory claim against the new partner".&#160; However the judge had erred in law as it was plainly open to the judge to discount the periodical payments applying the "orthodox" authorities culminating in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">Fleming</span><span style="font-size:11pt"> as that decision is "sufficiently flexible to enable the court to do justice and to reflect social and moral shifts within our society."&#160; </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">To flesh out the background, these parties separated in February 2005 and divorce proceedings were commenced in January 2006. On 29th November 2006 H was ordered to pay maintenance pending suit at the rate of &#163;90,000 p.a. That order was made by consent, but on the basis of deliberately erroneous financial information provided to W and to the court by H. He concealed changes to his employment contract which enabled him by the time of the final hearing which took place in February 2008 to channel near enough &#163;1,000,000 of remuneration into an offshore pension scheme. He did not disclose the new arrangements or the pension until shortly before the final hearing. The effect was to understate his gross income for the year to end-March 2007 (as it turned out) by some &#163;750,000. </p>

This was retrospectively to remedy the wrong H did by failing to disclose his true position.</p>

For the period until 16th March 2009 for which it ran I allocated &#163;15,000 of the &#163;90,000 annual payments to the parties' child. From that date I ordered that H should pay &#163;125,000 p.a. (or rather, because W and child live in Ireland, its then equivalent of &#8364;137,500) to W and &#8364;16,500 p.a. (then the equivalent of &#163;15,000) for their child (plus school fees and reasonable agreed extras). Those orders have since remained in force, but all payments made by H since the first order took effect on 1st December 2006 are now for review.</p>

I accept that H's income only really took off from about 2003, but do not feel that either budget represented a helpful or accurate picture as at January 2008. Neither party put in any revision although H had pruned W's down to &#163;62,000, possibly over-vigorously in some areas.</span></p>

Needs are not the only or the strict test. H is to be treated as having earned average bonuses for the calendar years 2006 and 2007 of &#163;475,000, bringing the gross income which I shall attribute to him for current purposes as &#163;725,000 p.a. Applying a broad tax deduction of 40% reduces this to an approximate net spendable income of &#163;435,000. </span></p>

W's maintenance will net down to &#163;76,200 at the January 2008 Irish tax and euro exchange rates then prevailing, to augment which she will have &#163;28,000 from B's untaxed maintenance and from her own investment income. A spendable income for the household of about &#163;100,000 seems to me to be fair, and affordable for H who on the basis of his previous two years' average remuneration will be left with &#163;295,000 for himself (subject to any maintenance adjustment for currency movements). </span></p>

Maybe more than many human pursuits and endeavours they may embark tentatively or at full tilt. They may stop and they may start, they may founder and they may rekindle. Over days months or years they may wax and wane. They take innumerable forms and no one size fits all. And the language we use to describe relationships and those in them is also unsatisfactory, lacking in precision, frequently ambiguous, signifying one thing or different things to one pair of partners or cohabitants and another, and often quite different things again to those who observe and attempt to categorise them.

Hence for some time around and after her birth that is one reason why LT so frequently visited and stayed at her home. But in any event he has made a point of visiting his daughter on a daily basis, so far as practicable. Often (and how often was heavily disputed) he has stayed the night, at other times he has left in the course of the evening and driven back to his own house on the other side of Dublin. Usually, as LT described it, when he stays overnight he sleeps alone in one of the three bedrooms as H's daughter (six at the time of the 2008 hearing, now eight) still shares her mother's bedroom, and there is an overnight nanny many weekdays to assist with the younger child. He usually eats his evening meal there whether or not he stays the night.</p>

Over a period LT has produced evidence that he passed through an electric motorway toll barrier on the longer (but he maintains as fast if not faster) route from W's home to his, avoid Dublin&#8217;s city centre and traffic lights.

In fact the reduction in frequency is not all that striking and the relationship clearly continued unabated, in my view. When he gave his oral evidence on the first day of the hearing H was prepared to leave open as a possibility the theory (which hardened into a positive assertion by the time of formal submissions) that LT doubled back after passing the toll, a theory prompted by the discovery that at the time of the Court of Appeal proceedings and the press interest LT took to parking round the corner. H did not accept that LT drove to his own home on many or most evenings, whereas I have to say that I do. But I do not accept that that issue or the frequency (whether 50% per LT or 83% per H) of nights spent at W's home at the various stages scrutinised has any real impact on the outcome of the case.

Her lack of consistency on aspects of the developing relationship was skilfully but easily exposed in cross-examination. It is possible she has the retention of a sieve for such matters (and generally she does not demonstrate huge acumen upon a range of topics). I am sure that may be part of her problem. But another if not the main ingredient must remain that she has been desperate to hold on to a maintenance award, and has in large part presented a construct rather than the reality. This is so despite her expressions of candour when confirming the now long-term commitment of their relationship and in hoping for its indefinite continuation, and her repeated interjections that she was trying to do her best to remember and to be honest. </p>

To add to the pressures engendered and the lack of an end in sight to the English proceedings, both in 2008 and in 2010 it became apparent that there are contested proceedings re H and W's child ongoing in the Dublin courts. </p>

They probably do genuinely hold the view that they do not cohabit or live together, just as firmly as Mr Grey senior and H contend that they do. As I have already mentioned, all these conjunctive descriptions of domestic arrangements - cohabitants who live together, partners who comprise an item - are vague and imprecise at their edges. A couple who live together on a settled basis cohabit. But what if, as here I have found to be the case, they each have their own home and each spend time there without the other, as well as spending some of their time together at one of their homes. If that was their settled <span style="font-style:italic">modus vivendi</span> I would not classify them as cohabitees, but others maybe would. As for whether two persons are domestic partners, that again to my mind connotes a sharing, not necessarily just of space in a home but of time in each other's lives, and very importantly a degree of mutually-felt commitment to each other. The degree of their commitment is their subjective business: the opinion of observers as to whether they are domestic partners or not may coincide, but if it is different then the categorisation of the relationship should surely primarily depend upon the subjective (if honestly-expressed) view of those within it. </p>

But the news of the pregnancy led to a consolidation of their relationship, albeit (as he described it in his evidence) focused upon W as his child's mother. This evolution does not seem to me to be fundamentally improbable. Indeed I would think that discovery of W's pregnancy would lead to both of them taking stock. It is true that by now W had already brushed aside solicitors' letters enquiring about their relationship. She consistently withheld increasingly relevant information. That does not seem to me necessarily to demonstrate that prior to the discovery of her pregnancy there was the same degree of mutual commitment which for my part I regard as so important a benchmark in the ascertainment of the point at which it is reasonable to impute to LT a responsibility to contribute to W's home such as to alleviate the financial burden on H. That responsibility is of course moral rather than legal (in so far as it arises qua W rather than for LT's child) but is one which in fairness should, in my judgment, be imputed from November 2007 onwards rather than (as H contends) from an earlier date.</p>

His claim at its largest is for repayment of the entire sum which he has since December 2006 paid by way of spousal maintenance. In January 2010 he put this at &#163;418,750 (without at that point including any allowance for the six-month concession to which I have referred). He continues to maintain that where, as he claims is here the case, an ex-wife and a mother now form a new household they should finance it without input from the woman's former husband. The Court of Appeal has however reaffirmed that is not the law, however unhappily and illogically it may sit with what by statute is law: that a remarrying rather than a cohabiting wife automatically and irrevocably loses the maintenance to which she might otherwise have been entitled. In this context therefore cohabitation does not have the same effect as marriage. </p>

I have heard both parties to that relationship and have made full allowance for the artificiality of the situation, and the extent to which it has been glossed. But I have to say that that part of their evidence (and in particular that of LT whose house after all it is) concerning his desire to maintain his independence and his own home and space struck me as understandable and indeed genuine. And so I baulk at drawing the inference that part of what they conceal is an active desire or intention to fuse their household entirely. Their evidence of the extent and quality of the virtually daily contact, however jaundiced a view I take of it, does not leave me able to conclude that they are artificially holding up the moment when they will in fact merge their homes and their financial resources . </p>

His income has decreased over the relevant years, as again has not been disputed. The Irish tax year coincides with the calendar year, and in 2007 LT was earning at the rate of &#8364;200,000 p.a. gross. In 2008, including bonus, he earned &#8364;164,000. In August 2009 his employers imposed a 10 per cent cut in his basic salary, and for that year no bonuses were awarded: he earned about &#8364;130,000 gross, &#8364;77,500 net (equivalent to about &#163;70,000) in that year. So far as could be anticipated his employment income for 2010 was again set to decrease as the 10 per cent cut seems likely to continue throughout the year, and the burden of Irish taxation is set to increase.

I have conducted a calculation of what net spendable amount each year he would have after meeting these commitments. It is necessarily only an estimate, but not one which was conducted by either side during the course of the hearing before me. The results are in essence that in 2008 (when I have estimated that LT's &#8364;164,000 gross would have netted down to about &#8364;100,000, and when the mortgage was higher) he would have been left with about &#8364;5,000 each month. The comparable figure for 2009 (taking the reduced figure for the mortgage of &#8364;1,700 per month) was &#8364;3,600.

Were he to contribute for the current year at the same annual rate of &#8364;26,400 rate as I have fixed for the earlier period when his income was higher, he would be left for the whole of this year with only &#8364;7,200 with which to meet all his other standing and out of pocket expenses including running his car. Therefore to continue this year to be expected to contribute at the same rate is clearly beyond his means. I conclude that for the time being and in his current circumstances &#8364;16,000, slightly below 50% of the available residue, is the limit of his current capacity.</p>

Upon the evidence available in early 2008 I took the view that W's household should have about &#163;100,000 net p.a. coming into it. That was a value judgment based upon the totality of the evidence, and not limited or linked to the rival budgets then presented on either side. I reached that conclusion without incorporating any discount to reflect the relationship between W and LT. As I reject H's submission that W and LT should be left to manage within their own means, without input from him, I see no cogent reason why I should depart from that starting-point now. That does not follow from the fact that W&#8217;s household&#8217;s income was fixed by me on a 'generously interpreted rather than minimum' reasonable requirements basis. </p>

There are, of course, cases where a concise analysis of the identified concepts of &#8216;needs, contributions and sharing&#8217; is a necessary and helpful intellectual tool in written or verbal argument, provided these concepts are not elevated to the status of heads of claim. However (because ancillary relief cases tend to be fact-specific and depend essentially on the exercise of a broad discretion in the pursuit of fairness) there are also many cases where a lengthy over-sophisticated approach of this type is an unnecessary diversion, which burdens rather than assists the court. This may be particularly so as regards variation applications, given the clear authorities on the topic cited by my Lord.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I find it difficult to adopt, again, anything other than a broad approach to resolve the tension between the very significant increases in H&#8217;s income on the one hand, and the burden on W of dealing both retrospectively and prospectively with the impact of what may be only a deemed and notional contribution from LT. But I take the view that this is not a case where I should exercise my discretion to increase W's periodical payments in response to H's increased prosperity. As I have attempted to demonstrate, W should (notionally, at least, depending on the extent to which LT in fact contributes) have about the same 'more or less &#163;100,000' coming in to her admittedly expanded household. That &#163;100,000 definitely included some element of slack. I do not in these circumstances consider that it would be fair to H to increase his baseline input over and above the &#8364;144,000 p.a. which (now subject to the downward variation to reflect what I consider ought to be LT&#8217;s contribution) I ordered in 2009.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is however room for some neutral (in its effect on W) refinement to achieve taxation savings. H during the hearing canvassed an increase in the maintenance paid to his daughter from &#8364;16,500 to &#8364;20,000 or &#8364;25,000. I propose to increase them to &#8364;27,500 p.a. with effect from the beginning of 2010. That is an amount which is not untoward for a man in H's financial situation. The additional &#8364;11,000 will bear no Irish tax. However W's maintenance payments (as adjusted re LT) will from the same date reduce by the further amount which it is calculated would produce &#8364;11,000 in her hands if paid as taxable maintenance to her. Thus will be maintained what I have held should be H's baseline contribution, but at somewhat reduced cost to him. If on reflection both parties wish to project this adjustment further back in time then I will of course give that favourable consideration.</p>
