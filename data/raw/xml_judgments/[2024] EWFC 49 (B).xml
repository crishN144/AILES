The youngest child is &#8216;H&#8217;. This Court intends no disrespect to the children by referring to them by initials. Both children have their own unique characteristics and individual physical, emotional and educational needs. The children are parties to the case through their Children's Guardian.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:11pt">The Local Authority applies to this Court for a Care Order for both children, with the care plan that the children are removed from the care of their mother and placed in Local Authority foster care, together as siblings. The Local Authority asserts that both children have suffered and are at risk of suffering significant harm in the form of physical harm, emotional harm and neglect, attributable to the care given to them, or likely to be given to them, by their parents, not being what it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give a child.  The youngest child, &#8216;H&#8217;, has been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. He is insulin dependent and is prescribed both slow-release and quick release insulin. He is under a specialist diabetes clinic for which regular attendance at outpatient appointments is required. The Local Authority is concerned that his attendance at clinics has been poor and he often attends without a parent. There are reports that at school, where his food intake requires monitoring, he had refused to allow staff to monitor his blood sugar levels. &#8216;H&#8217; has described &#8220;hating&#8221; diabetes and blames it for Children&#8217;s Services&#8217; involvement. Within Year 6 at school, his behaviour was noted to decline, with reports of increasing rudeness to staff, walking out the classroom and an increase in frequency of reporting being tired and refusing to engage in schoolwork.  &#8216;H&#8217;s school attendance fell to 66%. It was noted that &#8216;H&#8217; is a bright student but he was not working at an age-appropriate level. Staff have observed a clear correlation between his positive engagement in class and the management of his diabetes. In short, the Local Authority asserts that the parents are not manging &#8216;H&#8217;s diabetes appropriately and are neglectful of his health needs, with concerns that he experiences persistently low blood glucose levels such that he is at risk of acute, long term health conditions. &#8216;E&#8217;s school attendance fell as low as 16%, with all absences unauthorised. &#8216;E&#8217; is reported to have a history of self-harm. Both children are reported to have had their dental needs neglected.  The Local Authority asserts that the father struggles with emotional regulation, impacting on his parenting of the children. The parents are reported to have a hostile relationship with each other.  Further, the home conditions are reported to be poor.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:11pt">The Local Authority&#8217;s application, issued on 16 August 2023 is strongly opposed by both parents. The mother seeks to care for both children. The father tells the Court that he is concerned about the mother&#8217;s care of the children, however, he does not seek to split up the family. He supports the mother&#8217;s position that the children should remain living with her. In the alternative, he puts himself forward to care for both children.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:11pt">The children have expressed the firm wish to remain in their mother&#8217;s care. Their Children's Guardian, appointed in the proceedings to promote the welfare of both children, to represent their wishes and feelings and to make sure the arrangements for the children are in their best interests, supports the Local Authority&#8217;s application for Care Orders. The Guardian supports the Local Authority&#8217;s care plan for the children to move together to long term foster care. Although the children&#8217;s wishes are in direct opposition to the views of the Guardian, no party advances a position that either child is competent to give instructions and to be represented independently.</span></p>

On 29 August 2023, the Court refused the Local Authority&#8217;s application for an Interim Care Order. An Interim Supervision Order was made until the conclusion of the proceedings, with the children continuing to live at home with their mother. Having found the interim threshold criteria to be met, this Court was not satisfied that the Local Authority had demonstrated that the very high standard had been established to justify the interim removal of the children from their mother nor that their immediate safety demanded it. The Court was not satisfied that interim removal of the children was the proportionate response to the risks of harm.</span></p>

The harm is actual; it is significant; and it is due to parenting that is not reasonable. Threshold allegations are separated out by Local Authorities for forensic purposes, however, there is only one threshold. The Court measures the effect of all its findings against it. Facts, which are minor or trivial if considered in isolation, when taken together may suffice to satisfy the Court of the likelihood of future harm. The Court attaches to all the relevant facts the appropriate weight when coming to its overall conclusion. The conclusion by the Court on the evidence before it is that the threshold for protective intervention is crossed. The harm suffered by the children in the past also gives rise to a real likelihood of future harm, both physical and emotional, that cannot be ignored.

In addressing this question, the Court must ask itself what type of harm might arise to &#8216;E&#8217; and/or to &#8216;H&#8217; in the care of their mother and/or their father. Each child is at risk of suffering harm based on their individual circumstances. There are also shared risks. In her oral evidence the Guardian told the Court that for &#8216;H&#8217;, the management of his diabetes in the care of either his mother or father may lead to an acute risk of immediate and long-term harm to his physical health. In respect of &#8216;E&#8217;, the risks to his physical health come from a failure to meet his health needs, including immunisations, optical appointments and missed blood tests. Both children are at risk from dental neglect and both children have experienced problems with their teeth.   Further, the Children's Guardian told the Court that both children have suffered and are at risk of suffering emotional harm due to the mother&#8217;s unmet psychological difficulties, due to both parents not being emotionally attuned or emotionally available and due to a long-standing lack of consistent engagement with professional services designed to support the family. Further, both children have suffered significant harm and are likely to suffer significant harm through poor educational attainment. The Children's Guardian described similar concerns in respect of the father&#8217;s capacity to meet the emotional needs of the children and through his use of illegal substances. </span></p>

The family has received a significant amount of support over the years from school, children's services&#8217; involvement and the Paediatric Diabetes Team. From an early age there were problems with school attendance, which the school addressed directly, and with attendance to meetings arranged with the diabetes nurses, clinic attendance and the follow through of advice given by the diabetes team. There has been the use of the TAF framework and safeguarding escalation to try and support [&#8216;H&#8217;] and his family. The family has changed in composition a number of times over the years with [&#8216;H&#8217;] living with his mother but varying involvement from his father. One of our long-standing concerns is that [&#8216;H&#8217;s] mother has had numerous health concerns of her own about which I do not have details but this has been a frequent barrier to her being able to carry out advice from the diabetes team or attending meetings / clinics. My concern at present comes from both the longevity of the time that we have been concerned about the supervision of [&#8216;H&#8217;s] diabetes care and also from acute concerns about recent lack of contact with the diabetes team and in particular over the school summer holidays when there is no school safety net for him&#8230;The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (&#8216;NICE&#8217;) Guidelines recommend that children should be seen a minimum of every 12 weeks (i.e. 4 times per year). Our regional&#8230;and local guidance for children with poor glucose control is that this contact should be increased according to their HbA1c, which is the outcome measure of glucose control. The target HbA1c is 48mmol/mol.  In January 2023, &#8216;H&#8217;s HbA1c was 69mmol/mol.&#8221;</span></p>

[&#8216;H&#8217;] should then receive some longer acting carbohydrate containing food, to prevent a rebound low blood sugar. There are multiple alarms that are set on his receiver to allow different opportunities to respond to his blood sugar levels, and these alarms repeat, so that if the initial alarm is missed, if the problem persists the alarm will sound again. Looking at the downloaded glucose sensor data in the last 2 weeks we have noted that [&#8216;H&#8217;] has had hypoglycaemia episodes on most days, including on most nights.

Not monitoring his blood sugar or food intake may be a way of unconsciously seeking caring responses from his parents and may serve as a way of him being noticed in the context of both parents being preoccupied. It may also give him a sense of control and power. [&#8216;H&#8217;] is therefore placed in a bind, he must either take responsibility of his diabetes and therefore his emotional needs may go unnoticed and unmet, or he continues to avoid and prevent attempts to care for his diabetes which leads to longer term stress in his social network&#8230;To support [&#8216;H&#8217;s] emotional development and wellbeing, it is essential for [&#8216;H&#8217;] that he is able to live in circumstances that are stable and predictable.&#8221;</span></p>

One set of strategies used appear to be oriented around positive feeling states associated with isolation and independence. These can&#8230;extend to&#8230;protecting [herself] from information which might trigger negative affect states and as a result, key information which may be distressing can be distanced or omitted from her thinking and narrative&#8230;She can hold a problem saturated narrative&#8230;She sees others as failing her and the family, often causing or contributing to the difficulties they are facing. In this sense, responsibility for problems and difficulties is shifted [towards others], who [have] not met her needs for support as she sees them. She can be biased towards seeing potential harms and risks in the social world&#8230;She spends much of her time seeking to avoid problems that may occur&#8230;In addition to these negative interpretations of the social world and interpretations of risks, she holds an understanding of [herself] and children as being in need of additional care and support. This combination of perceived self-need and perceived risk from others can appear to leave her stuck, feeling that she cannot move without help but that others cannot be trusted to provide help. </span></p>

She may be less able to accept help which is not under her control or does not exactly conform to her own understanding and expectations&#8230;She may do so by rejecting any disconfirming evidence&#8230;One consequence of this may be to shut down [her] capacity to access alternative sources of support&#8230;they come at a cost in terms of the missed opportunities and stresses associated with using this set of controlling strategies as opposed to more flexible, open and relaxed strategies&#8230;Her account often returns to understanding the social world in terms of potential risks and harms to [herself] and her family. There is therefore good evidence to support understanding [her] experiences and presentations in terms of trauma and attachment disruption. She has been diagnosed with Complex PTSD which is consistent with this approach to understanding. In part, her experiences appear to present as mood disturbance, both as anxiety and depression at times.</span></p>

She values times when the children provide care for her&#8230;She&#8230;places special emphasis on the closeness of her relationship with them. This may though mean that the children experience this relationship as particularly enmeshed and may find it more difficult to enter into other relationships since they are likely to be so different to their experience of their relationship with their mother&#8230;the impact of these disruptions on her day-to-day functioning remain relevant to the experiences of the children. It is likely that from the children&#8217;s perspective they will experience mother as unpredictable and difficult to engage closely with. At times, their experience of her will reflect the enmeshed characteristics of their relationship, she will be close and probably quite controlling of them. They may often find that their interactions with her are driven by her own needs in the moment rather than their own. At other times, she may be more distanced and unavailable. She may seek isolation and independence much of the time, leaving the children lacking access to an emotionally and psychologically available attachment figure. The children are likely to find it particularly difficult to predict how mother might act at any time. This is particularly concerning since it risks teaching them that others, even those they are close to, are unpredictable. Mother also has difficulties in terms of her capacity to mentalise regarding the children, failing at times to perceive each of them as a unique individual&#8230;She draws on a problem saturated narrative to understand [herself] and the children, which is likely to lead to them both being treated as &#8216;children with problems&#8217; rather than fully rounded individuals, but will also put them at risk of internalising an understanding of the self as faulty and problematic. There certainly appears to be evidence for this with [&#8216;E&#8217;] when he expresses that &#8216;I&#8217;m stupid&#8217; when he can&#8217;t do things. Additionally, the manner in which mother understands the wider social world as threatening also risks rubbing off onto the children, potentially leading them to have difficulties engaging openly and confidently with the wider social world around them.&#8221;</span></p>

Mother will need therapy that will take some time, probably at least a year or longer (two years or more is certainly a realistic possibility) for significant recovery. Additionally, the complexity and multi-faceted nature of the work required means that the nature and degree of progress that mother might be able to make cannot be accurately predicted. Consequently, whilst engaging with the C-PTSD team for therapy is absolutely the right next step for mother, the time that progress will take and the uncertainty of outcome must be borne in mind when thinking from the children&#8217;s perspective about her capacity to offer them good enough care now and for the immediate future&#8230;A C-PTSD team can provide support to people who have experienced long standing interpersonal trauma, especially early developmental trauma&#8230;as an alternative to what would have been called personality disorder services...There may be a range of interventions available via such a service. Importantly though, the service is likely to have a wraparound element to it, in that they can provide support beyond individual psychological therapies. Whilst these psychological therapies (i.e., CBT and EMDR for trauma, CAT/schema or psychodynamic for interpersonal functioning for instance) can all be provided outside of such a service, non-NHS services will likely struggle to match the full range of courses, individual and group support and therapy that might be available from a C-PTSD service&#8230;The core areas of intervention will likely be focussed on the impact of past traumatic experiences (widely defined and including early developmental disruptions) on&#8230; present day interpersonal functioning&#8230;In principle, [the mother] could undertake the recommended work whilst the children remain in her care. However, I am aware that there are some very practical deficits in the quality of care presently being provided to the children (i.e., diabetes management) which may in my view override this statement if immediate progress is not made in these areas&#8230;[the mother] needs to be willing to make this commitment &#8211; to engage with a service that can help her, but maybe not always on terms of her choosing.&#8221;</span></p>

He omits and dismisses information and denies knowledge or capacity to understand much of the time. The overall effect can be to cause [him] to present as lacking in understanding when perhaps more accurately he may be seeking to minimise discomfort in the moment by maintaining distance from emotionally threatening information&#8230;[he] relies upon strategies of distanced withdrawal and avoidance of close attachment relationships. He maintains distance from close relationships by choice but will also maintain distance from information which might threaten his internal emotional stability. The effect is as described, to markedly reduce the amount of information that [he] might feel comfortable discussing with others. [He] appears to have a very limited understanding of his own emotional world, which is in part likely to explain why he seeks to avoid material with high levels of negative emotional valence. He relies upon quite concrete understandings of the world around him. These concrete understandings largely reflect his underlying attachment strategies. In addition though, they also act to reduce the complexity of the world around him that he feels he needs to understand and with this done, he is able to feel that he is doing well and can understand what he needs to. They therefore also act to protect him from exposure to elements of the social world that he would feel less able to understand, predict or control. He does not appear to have any meaningful insight into his own patterns of thinking and feelings, relying instead on an apparent simplification of the world into concrete events that occur around him. </span></p>

He generally minimises their difficulties, his own role and their mother&#8217;s role in those issues&#8230;this likely reflects his rather limited conceptualisation of what it means to be a parent as he thinks in practical concrete terms&#8230;There is therefore a general absence of interpersonal connection with the children in his account, and he tends to leave a marked interpersonal space between them. This space is likely to be experienced by the children as a boundaried and unavailable form of caregiving&#8230;The children report enjoying their time with father&#8230;and they make clear that they would like to spend more time with him in future if possible. [&#8216;H&#8217;] does offer some negative reports regarding father especially when staying overnight with him. Overall though, father&#8217;s distanced attachment representations and very limited capacity to think about the thinking of self or other are likely to impact on the experiences of the children when in his care. Father can be relatively absent from the intersubjective space between himself and the children. This is likely to mean that the children experience one of their primary caregivers being unavailable to them&#8230;Additionally, his limited capacity to think about the thinking of the children (to mentalise) also impacts in that again the children will experience not having their own minds seen by their primary caregivers&#8230;in addition it is important to note that father&#8217;s areas of difficulty mirror some of those of mother and as a result he may not be able to provide the children with a form of care and interaction which may compensate for any deficits in mother&#8217;s care.</span></p>

This work would not be available with the NHS&#8230;father&#8217;s overall presentation strongly suggests that he would not want to engage in such work, or perhaps even see that there is a need for it. The prospects of him engaging with therapy and then being able to use it to support a process of change and growth is unfortunately in my view quite limited.

In general he appears to describe them as actors in the world around him rather than in terms of being people that he has close emotional and psychological connections with&#8230;He describes a relationship with mother which is much more positive than negative. He describes a relationship with father which is significantly less emotionally valent to him and is also more balanced in terms of positive and negative emotional experiences&#8230;he feels that [&#8216;H&#8217;] holds a range of positive emotional responses towards him and acknowledges that he also feels positively towards [&#8216;H&#8217;]. However, he also attributes a large number of negative emotional states to his relationship with [&#8216;H&#8217;], suggesting that there are both strong negative and positive feelings embedded in this relationship, more so than in any other close relationship that he has.

He appears to have quite low self-esteem which may at times be masked by his sense of practical ability&#8230;He may benefit from more focussed individual therapy in future, but as a starting point I would strongly suggest that fully engaging with school and accessing support through them would be a good starting point. Engaging with something that everyone else his age does and being well supported to do so will be ideal for him at this stage.  [&#8216;H&#8217;] does not present with the same level of individual disrupted interpersonal functioning. I understand that when he is at school then he has moments of doing very well in class. As with [&#8216;E&#8217;] though, his primary need is simply to be in school more consistently. This will support his developing social identity and sense of personal competence. For both children also, spending time with peers and away from each other will probably have a positive impact on their sibling relationship by taking the pressure off their relationship caused by only having each other as peer company much of the time.&#8221;</span></p>

In the event that the children continue to experience the same caregiving patterns as they have until now, I would be concerned that they would experience ongoing reinforcement of the disrupted attachment representations they already appear to have developed. In [&#8216;E&#8217;s] case&#8230;I have outlined the distancing and inhibited nature of his attachment representations. He has learned that care will not be responsive to his needs in the moment. He has learned that he should suppress his own needs and desire for connection, perhaps even that expressing such needs may be counterproductive leading to rejection by significant caregivers. [&#8216;H&#8217;] appears to have learned similar strategies to an extent, and the same concerns would be present in this sense. There are more positive signs to [&#8216;H&#8217;s] presentation overall, but I would be concerned about his capacity to build on these positive elements if his caregiving environment remained unchanged. For both children, these learned strategies carry long term risks for their future. Both children risk having difficulties forming close relationships as children but also as adults, this would carry through into their own possible future roles as parents. The sense of distance and isolation may also put at risk their long-term mental health and wellbeing.&#8221;</span></p>

However, it is clear that both children are close to their mother and that the relationship between the three of them can have a rather enmeshed quality to it at times. Removing them from this close and enmeshed relationship will likely be distressing for them, whether they express it or not. It would therefore be important for carers to be mindful of both children&#8217;s limited capacity to show their feelings in this situation. In this situation, therapy may be appropriate for both children. I would suggest that play therapy would be a good option and may be available via statutory services such as CAMHS at the time. If not, privately commissioned therapists could be located&#8230;School may also be able to offer options such as ELSA (emotional awareness) support and this would be ideal for both children if available.&#8221;</span></p>

[He] often appears down at school and currently we do not see him being particularly happy in school. When [he] is in school he is often not in lessons. Sometimes he will use his safe space well but at other times, he is truanting lessons, sometimes with other pupils from his year group. [He] does have a safe space and key adult which he does access but not consistently. [He] does not always have full school uniform. The school have provided lots of uniform for [&#8216;E&#8217;] since he joined us in Y7 but this often goes missing. At present, [the school] feel that they can meet the needs with [his] EHCP but the reason he is falling behind his peers significantly is attendance. It is challenging to put [his] EHCP into practice and ensure support for him when he is in school so little. There have been increasing concerns around the children that [he] spends time with in school, with possible connections to drugs. [He] has been found in school talking on the phone to an adult male who was unknown to us. [He] and friends have also been found to be shoplifting at local shops. We have seen an increase in [his] defiance in school since returning to school in September. [He] has been suspended twice this year. On both occasions [he] would not listen to reason or instructions from any members of staff.&#8221;</span></p>

The mother&#8217;s GP reported that the mother had a drinking problem in 2014. The father told the Court that the mother drinks a lot of alcohol and has parties on a frequent basis. &#8216;H&#8217; also mentioned that his mother has friends over and he is unable to sleep.  On an unannounced social work visit on 25 May 2023 a lot of alcohol was observed in the mother&#8217;s home. The mother told the Social Worker, and tells the Court, that the alcohol had been purchased for a barbeque. The Local Authority continues to have concerns that alcohol is a contributing factor to the variation in the mother&#8217;s presentation during home visits. Further, the Local Authority is concerned about the number of social work home visits cancelled by the mother. </span></p>

The Order included a caution that an adverse inference may be drawn from any failure to comply with alcohol testing. The mother did not comply with the Court&#8217;s Order. No application was made to discharge or vary that Order. At the Issues Resolution Hearing on 7 February 2024, the Local Authority gave notice that it intended to seek an adverse inference against the mother in relation to her non-compliance.  At that hearing, an oral application was made on behalf of the mother to extend the time for alcohol test results to be produced.  The Court granted that application, ordering toxicology testing to be made available to the Court by 23 February 2024.  The warning in relation to an adverse inference was repeated. The mother failed to comply with that Court Order. No toxicology test results have been provided. In her final statement, which itself was filed late, the mother expressed concern about hair loss and the impact of providing a hair sample for testing. She expressed concern that her health issues would impact the blood test results and she indicated a wish to first discuss this with her GP. In her oral evidence, the mother told the Court that she was worried the children would see her with bald patches if she provided a sample of hair for testing. She was tearful when giving this evidence. She told the Court that she had not spoken with her GP about the impact of giving a blood sample.  </span></p>

No good reason has been provided by the mother for that failure. There is merit in the Local Authority&#8217;s submission that the mother&#8217;s non-compliance with alcohol testing reflects a failure to prioritise the needs of the children. In this Court&#8217;s judgement, it is right to draw an adverse inference from the mother&#8217;s non-compliance with Orders in respect of alcohol testing. The Court finds that the mother has sought to conceal her level of alcohol use from professionals and from the Court. Further, the Court finds merit in the Local Authority&#8217;s submission that the mother&#8217;s use of alcohol increases the other risks to the children in terms of physical and emotional harm and neglect.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-size:11pt">What is the likelihood of harm arising? A Local Authority parenting assessment of the mother was completed on 19 December 2023. The mother engaged with only three out of ten possible sessions, the mother cancelling six sessions. The mother did not respond to a request from Social Workers to provide a list of the support she needed to complete the assessment. In her oral evidence the mother told the Court that she refused to engage in parenting assessment sessions in the home, as she perceived that she would have to discuss distressing events from her childhood in the presence of the children. The Local Authority submits that the assessment echoes concern from Dr Hardiman. The mother frequently cited her physical health as a problem in meeting expectations regarding her parenting but never talks about her mental health and the impact this may have on the children.  The mother was previously assessed by the Adult Social Care team but said that she did not require support. In addition to the troubling issues regarding the management of &#8216;H&#8217;s diabetes, the parenting assessment highlighted the mother&#8217;s refusal of a home visit from the diabetes nurse to address technical problems in uploading &#8216;H&#8217;s data and her failure to correctly estimate and report carbohydrate counts for his meals.  The Local Authority concluded that the mother minimised a very worrying extended hypoglycemic episode which &#8216;H&#8217; experienced on 9 December 2023. Additionally, as well as highlighting the mother&#8217;s failure to be honest in relation to the dental care of both children, the parenting assessment detailed two separate incidents in which the police were involved, where &#8216;H&#8217; broke into a school and both children were alleged to have been involved in bullying and physically assaulting a peer. The parenting assessment concludes that the mother, &#8220;is not able to make the necessary changes for [&#8216;E&#8217; and &#8216;H&#8217;] within the timescales of these care proceedings. They are emerging into their teenage years and need support now in terms of routine, structure, and therapeutic care by nurturing and experienced foster carers. [&#8216;H&#8217;] urgently needs support in managing his diabetes and developing his independence and confidence in this.&#8221;</span></p>

The father was noted to engage well with the assessment and there were other positives, including his willingness to attend meetings and his demonstration of warmth towards the children.  The parenting assessment noted that the father, &#8220;said during this assessment he hadn&#8217;t really thought about the reality and practicalities of having the boys in his fulltime care before. We are concerned about a lack of motivation and preparation on the part of [the father] to care for the boys full-time.&#8221;  The report further highlighted concerns about the father&#8217;s substance misuse. Although the assessment noted that the father responded well to [H&#8217;s] diabetic needs during observations, the assessment noted that, &#8220;[&#8216;H&#8217;] has spoken about [his father] not meeting his needs during the night times previously. There may be variation in [the father&#8217;s] awareness during the night-time and we wonder if this may be related to his cannabis use.&#8221; In his oral evidence the father accepted that, although he is working towards reducing his substance misuse, he takes cannabis in the evening to help him sleep. The assessment also identified the concern that, in light of the parents&#8217; relationship, the father would not be able to fully protect the children from parental conflict or communicate effectively with the mother.</span></p>

The safeguards in place, the Children's Guardian told the Court, were not sufficient to protect either chid.  The Guardian assessed the harm to &#8216;H&#8217; in his mother&#8217;s care as being &#8216;likely&#8217;, telling the Court that the risks were, &#8220;slightly reduced because [&#8216;H&#8217;] does not have the same risk associated with diabetes&#8221;. The Guardian assessed the harm to both children in the father&#8217;s care as being &#8216;likely&#8217; having regard to the father&#8217;s own vulnerabilities.

If he continues not go to school, there will be an impact on careers and prospects and concerns around mental health and antisocial behaviour, putting himself in risky situations.&#8221; The Guardian noted concerns that &#8216;E&#8217;, &#8220;may be using drugs.&#8221; In respect of &#8216;H&#8217;, the Guardian told the Court in stark terms that the consequences for him would be the same as those in respect of his brother, however, &#8220;on top of that, death. I am being realistic about that, given evidence and information from the diabetes team: Coma or death and the long term, lifelong implications for unmanaged diabetes.&#8221; Once again, this Court finds no reason to depart from the professional analysis of the Guardian in terms of her assessment of the consequences for the children if the harm of the type described arose.</span></p>

All professionals and parents were in agreement regarding this proposal particularly on the basis that [&#8216;H&#8217;] would soon be leaving&#8230;school and therefore it was felt very necessary to transition the family in terms of working with other professionals during this period given his significant health needs.</span></p>

This wasn&#8217;t the case as dad never attended these sessions. Dad was offered numerous opportunities to engage in 1-1 sessions but declined. Dad agreed to meet with&#8230;the family&#8217;s Social Worker at the time, and me to discuss how he could become more involved regarding parenting as well as working more collaboratively with mum. Dad stated that this would be impossible, stating that he needed to leave the room before he got very angry. Dad stated that he wanted to be a good dad, but that he couldn&#8217;t cope with mum telling him what he should and shouldn&#8217;t do. Dad then left the house. Through the passage of time dad agreed after some discussion with&#8230;the family&#8217;s Social Worker, followed by a separate discussion with myself that he would be prepared to commit to twelve 1-1 support sessions with me starting in March 2023. Dad expressed that he felt that this was a positive step. Mum stated that she felt very concerned as to dad&#8217;s reasons for participating in these twelve 1-1 sessions. Mum stated that she felt very doubtful that dad would ever be able to conduct himself as the adult parent, stating that she had great concerns and worries for both of the boys&#8217; emotional wellbeing whenever they were in their dad&#8217;s care.</span></p>

Mum was open about the traumatic birth that she had experienced regarding [&#8216;E&#8217;] and explained how this had greatly impacted on her ability to bond with him, which mum said had affected her relationship with him, although clearly stating that she loved him. Mum stated that she had a completely different bond with [&#8216;H&#8217;] because she&#8217;d had a very different experience with him, but this made her feel guilty simply because she was able to compare how differently she related to both boys. Mum stated that she found it easier to be more physically affectionate towards [&#8216;H&#8217;], and that communicating was him was also easier. Mum stated that she didn&#8217;t show this, but her tolerance towards [&#8216;E&#8217;] was different...Over the years we worked on many different areas of parenting and all-round wellbeing. I often revisited pieces of work so that we could review the content to ensure that it was appropriate in terms of [&#8216;E&#8217; and &#8216;H&#8217;s] growing development in respect of meeting their needs. Mum stated on several occasions that she found it extremely difficult to put all the discussed strategies into place saying that dad&#8217;s parenting approach was in complete contrast to her parenting approach, which mum stated caused disruption in being fully able to implement the discussed strategies. This remained the case through the years that I worked with both parents. Mum&#8217;s complex health issues appeared to become much more challenging for her, and in conjunction to several consecutive bereavements within the last three to four years this often-prevented mum from being both emotionally and physically able to fully participate in the necessary work/sessions. However, mum would answer and return my telephone calls if the school office had been unable to contact mum, which would then require me to either telephone or to carry out an unannounced home visit regarding a welfare check to ensure that all was well with both mum and her children&#8230;Mum stated that she often felt highly anxious, overwhelmed, and frustrated, and that in combination to her parasomnias she was often left a very exhausted state.</span></p>

Dad told me that he had no intention of going back with the reason being that he hadn&#8217;t been told that the facilitators were going to be a female &amp; male.

Although he was noted to have had a positive change in his presentation and willingness to engage with the school, &#8216;E&#8217; continued to receive suspensions from school, only returning back to school following a suspension on 31 January 2024. This was due to him absconding class and hiding from staff in the school, who spent between 3-4 hours trying to find him. On the second day of this Final Hearing, the Court was informed that &#8216;E&#8217; had been excluded from school again.  &#8216;E&#8217; has a diagnosis of &#8216;mild-moderate attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&#8217; (ADHD) and is on an EHCP plan. He is reported to have difficulties with poorly developed language skills, lack of confidence, significant struggles with spelling and difficulties focussing. The Guardian considered that the school can provide the level of support necessary for &#8216;E&#8217;, should he attend school consistently, which would support him to meet his educational needs. &#8216;E&#8217; has been consistent in his view throughout these proceedings that he wishes to remain in his mother&#8217;s care.</span></p>

However, ultimately, the decision is that of the Court and not of the child.

On the specific facts of this case, the overwhelming weight of professional concerns mean that the wishes of both children are not capable of being realised, without causing each of them further significant harm, for the reasons articulated by the Social Worker and the Children's Guardian. </span></p>

A glaring defect in that analysis is the lack of consideration of the impact on the children of being removed from their mother&#8217; care. The analysis of the Guardian, however, specifically addressed that important factor. The Guardian expressly took into consideration the expert opinion of Dr Hardiman. The Guardian told the Court, &#8220;Within the addendum report, Dr Hardiman was asked to give a view of the impact on the children on their emotional health and stability should they be removed into long-term foster care. He shared that both children&#8217;s rather distanced attachment representations may mean that they may not show significant superficial distress at the time, however it is clear both are close to [their mother] and the relationship between them can have a rather enmeshed quality to it at times. Thus, removing them from this close and enmeshed relationship will likely be distressing for them, whether they express it or not&#8230;Dr Hardiman recommends therapy for both children and that play therapy would be a good option and school may be able to offer emotional awareness support which would be ideal for the children if available. This would suggest that although there will be a significant impact on their emotional wellbeing if they were to be separated from [their mother], with the correct support in place, it is hoped that their emotional needs can be adequately met.&#8221; </span></p>

There has been a robust [working together agreement] in place whilst the children have remained on an Interim Supervision Order and despite this, [the mother] has failed to fully and meaningfully engage to ensure the children&#8217;s safety. Expert parenting assessments of both parents respectively and a global psychological assessment have been carried out&#8230;Both the parenting assessments and Dr Hardiman raise significant concerns in respect of [the mother&#8217;s] and [the father&#8217;s] parenting capacity. Dr Hardiman recommends long-term therapeutic input for both parents to address their own psychological needs. He clearly sets out the impact of both parents&#8217; psychological profiles on their parenting capacity and subsequently the children&#8217;s emotional wellbeing in which he shares his worries for the children, providing a clear analysis and conclusion as to what these worries are. Thus, if the children continue to remain in [the mother&#8217;s] care, or alternatively are placed in [the father&#8217;s] care, they will continue to experience harm and their holistic needs will continue to be unmet. For this reason, the Local Authority recommend[s] Full Care Orders and for them jointly to be placed in foster care. The balance here, is weighing up the risk of them remaining in [the mother&#8217;s] care (or moving to [the father&#8217;s] care) versus the emotional impact on them of being removed from [the mother&#8217;s] care, something that they have been consistently against; with both boys being at an age where they are able to clearly express their views. Dr Hardiman is clear that it will likely be distressing for the children if this is the decision the Judge makes, however he also recommends appropriate therapeutic intervention to support them in these circumstances. A further issue is, considering whether or not the children&#8217;s outcomes, if placed in Local Authority care until their majority will be better. In particular, due to both boys&#8217; more recent anti-social behaviours and [&#8216;E&#8217;s] vulnerabilities engaging with unhealthy peers, should an appropriate foster placement not be identified, further risks are associated with them being placed in a residential setting.</span></p>

There is some evidence-based reason to believe that both the father and the mother separately are beginning to show they are each committed to making the necessary changes. At this stage, however, there is no solid, evidence-based reason to conclude that either the mother or the father can maintain that commitment. The parenting assessment raised concerns regarding the father&#8217;s motivation to care for the children himself as he had said he had not really thought about the reality and practicalities of this. Past evidence of both parents&#8217; commitment to engage with professional support does not lead the Court to a positive conclusion about either parent&#8217;s ability to maintain such commitment. In reaching this conclusion, the Court acknowledges that both the mother and the father have their own specific vulnerabilities in respect of their physical health, mental health and in the case of the father, cognitive difficulties and substance use. However, on the totality of the evidence, having regard also to the timescales envisaged by Dr Hardiman, in this Court&#8217;s judgement, there is no solid, evidence-based reason to conclude that either the mother or the father will be able to make the necessary changes within the timescales of the children. </span></p>

The concept of &#8216;parenting with support&#8217; must underpin the way in which the Courts and professionals approach, wherever possible, parents with additional vulnerabilities and needs. It is incumbent on the Court to satisfy itself that there is no practical way of the authorities or others providing the requisite assistance and support before making an Order. In this Court&#8217;s judgement, the level of support offered by and provided by the Local Authority has been reasonable, appropriate and tailored to the specific needs of the family. On the evidence, the Court must reach the same conclusion as all the professionals that the mother&#8217;s care of the children, even with support, has not been good enough, the father could not alone meet the needs of the children, the father co-parenting with the mother would not fill the gaps in the mother&#8217;s parenting deficits and no amount of professional support could reasonably be put in place to bridge the gap between what the parents could offer the children and what the children need individually. Their need is simply too large to be capable of being bridged by even the most extensive support package under any form of Order, taking into consideration the range of powers available to the Court. </span></p>

Both children&#8217;s (particularly [&#8216;E&#8217;s]) school attendance is poor, both children&#8217;s emotional wellbeing is a concern, both have been engaging in anti-social and rebellious behaviours which could have had very serious implications, in addition to the acute risk [&#8216;H&#8217;] is exposed to due to poor management of his diabetes&#8230;Further to this, Dr Hardiman describes that if they continue to receive the same care giving patterns, they will experience ongoing reinforcement of the disrupted attachment representations that they already appear to have developed.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-size:11pt">Ultimately, is the welfare option necessary and proportionate? Are the risks bad enough to justify the remedy? </span><span style="font-size:11pt;color:#000000">In deciding issues in respect of the welfare of both children, the task of this Court is not to improve on nature. The best person to bring up a child is the natural parent, provided the child's physical and mental health are not in danger. The Court recognises that there are very diverse standards of parenting. Children will inevitably have very different experiences of parenting and very unequal consequences flowing from it. Some children will experience disadvantage and harm, while others flourish in atmospheres of loving security and emotional stability. The State does not take away the children of all the people who abuse alcohol or drugs or who suffer from physical or mental ill health. The Court makes clear expressly, if it needed to be said, that &#8216;H&#8217; is not being punished for having diabetes nor are the parents being punished for experiencing difficulties with their physical health and mental health.  </span><span style="font-size:11pt">H</span><span style="font-size:11pt;color:#000000">aving independently considered all the realistic competing options and having given them proper, focussed attention, on the facts of this case, this Court finds no reason to depart from the consensus of professional opinion that the balance falls in favour of both children being made the subject of Care Orders with the plan that the children move to Local Authority foster care. In this Court&#8217;s judgement, having considered the parents' ability to discharge their responsibilities towards the children, taking into account the practical assistance and support which the authorities or others would offer, having regard to all the evidence, the Court is satisfied that this is a case where a Care Order for each child is necessary and is the only option that would meet the need of each child individually. No lesser Order will do. In this Court&#8217;s judgement, the welfare of both children should not be compromised by keeping them within their family at all costs. The risks remain so great that the children could not be safeguarded adequately.  On the specific facts of this case, there is no other suitable course available which is in the best interests of each child motivated by the overriding requirements pertaining to the child's welfare. </span></p>

With that focus, the Court must conclude that a Care Order with the plan of placement of both children together in long term foster care is the only option necessary to meet their welfare needs and is the proportionate response to the risks.</span></p>

In respect of contact with their father, the Local Authority plan is for contact once in alternate weeks and then once every three weeks before moving to monthly direct contact. The plan is supported by the Children's Guardian. The aim of the plan is to allow both children time to adjust and settle into their new regime with their foster carers. The Local Authority acknowledges its legal duty to keep contact under review as part of regular statutory Child Looked After meetings to ensure that contact meets the best interests of both children. The Guardian expressed the hope of a move to unsupervised time spent by the children with each parent in the future, should no concerns be raised during the supervised contact sessions. The Guardian was not in support of a move to overnight contact taking place with either parent.  Respectfully, this Court endorses that professional opinion. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-size:11pt">Finally, but not insignificantly, it is imperative that the Local Authority properly and sensitively manages the transition of both children into foster care. The children will benefit from support from both parents in that transition, however difficult that may be. It is of the utmost importance that the foster carers identified by the Local Authority have urgent training to ensure they are equipped in the management of diabetes, noting the potential risk highlighted in the Guardian&#8217;s oral evidence of &#8216;H&#8217; being resentful towards and resistant to the foster carers and the impact this may have on his diabetes management. The Guardian was optimistic, however, that &#8216;H&#8217; would engage positively with his foster carers, reflecting his positive engagement with staff at school in his diabetes management.   The Guardian was confident that &#8216;H&#8217; knows how important it is to manage his diabetes. The Guardian further made plain that no move to foster care should take place unless the foster carer has undertaken that training. This Court wholly endorses that view. Furthermore, the Guardian expressed the opinion that it is imperative that the support provided to the children in Local Authority foster care meets their needs. The Guardian invites the Local Authority to update its final care plan for each child to include the therapeutic input available, including details of the proposed duration of therapy and when it can commence, in line with Dr Hardiman&#8217;s recommendations. Furthermore, Dr Hardiman is clear that both children&#8217;s schools play a key role in providing support to them. It is important for the care plans for each child to reflect the specifics of this support, even more so if the children are required to move to new schools. The Court endorses that view. The Local Authority is directed to file and serve updated care plans within 7 days.</span></p>
