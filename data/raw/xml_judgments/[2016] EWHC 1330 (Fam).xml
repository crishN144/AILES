Before the treatment began, X signed a Form PP. Y signed a Form WP. There is no problem with the Form PP. The problem arises because when Y signed the Form WP, which otherwise was properly completed, she omitted to place a &#8730; in the box in section 3 opposite the text &#8220;I consent to my partner (named in section two) being the legal parent of any child born from my treatment.&#8221; The central issue is this: Did Y give her consent to X becoming the father of her child? In my judgment the answer is clear: she did.</p>

And it is plain what was meant. After all, Form WP is headed &#8220;Your consent to your partner being the legal parent.&#8221; What did Y think she was doing when she completed and signed the Form WP, if not to give her &#8220;consent to [her] partner being the legal parent&#8221;? The answer is obvious: by signing the Form WP she intended to and believed she was giving that consent. The only defect in the completed document is, as was the defect in <span style="font-style:italic">Case I</span>, a simple undetected clerical error. In the present case, as in <span style="font-style:italic">Case I</span>, this obvious mistake can, in my judgment, be &#8216;corrected&#8217; as a matter of construction, and without the need for rectification.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the same day as she signed the defective Form WP to which I have referred, Y, at the invitation of the clinic, also signed another Form WP to &#8216;correct&#8217; an error which, she was told, had been made in the Form WP she had signed some years before in connection with earlier successful IVF treatment. The earlier Form WP had been wrongly dated. What ensued was quite remarkable, as the clinic committed itself to &#8211; blundered into &#8211; what, were these matters not so sensitive and grave, one might be tempted to call a comedy of errors. First, the suggested &#8216;error&#8217; in the earlier Form WP was quite immaterial for, as I noted in <span style="font-style:italic">In re A </span>(para 78), &#8220;the precise date is not material; what is vital is that the form was signed &#8230; <span style="font-style:italic">before</span> the treatment.&#8221; Secondly, it is quite clear that a mistake in a Form WP (or for that matter a Form PP) cannot be corrected retrospectively <span style="font-style:italic">after </span>the treatment by the signing of a substitute form. Thirdly, precisely the same error (the omission of the &#8730; in the box in section 3) appears in each of the two Forms WP signed by Y on this occasion. Fourthly, one might have thought that the clinic, having, as it thought, detected an error in the earlier Form WP, would have been more than careful to ensure that each of the new Forms WP was correctly completed. Not a bit of it!</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;the approach to checking that the Form WP and the Form PP have been fully and properly completed is surely just as important, and demands just as much care, attention and rigour, as would be demanded in the case of a legal document such as a contract for the sale of land, a conveyance or a will &#8211; indeed, in the context of parenthood, even more important.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">These administrative failures, which have been so characteristic a feature of every one of the cases I have had to consider, unhappily seem indicative of systemic failings both of management and of regulation across the sector. I can only hope that what all this litigation has revealed will by now have led to very significant improvements in understanding and practice.</p>
