It took the hospital to inform the applicant whereupon the applicant and police intervened and the child was removed into the care of the applicant. Initial appointments were held with both Psychologist and ISW without this fact being disclosed. Indeed the Psychologist&#8217;s interview with the father was interrupted by the attendance of the applicant and police to remove the child.</span></p>

She sought an adjournment to file a full statement and for this position to be put to the final hearing experts. I refused the request. My reasons can be found in an ex tempore judgment but in essence I pointed out the application should have been a request to reopen fact finding (which it was not); that in any event the explanation could not explain all the injuries which were contained within two mutually exclusive time frames, and; it would be inappropriate to take these points to the experts prior to the Court having considered the account and accepted or rejected it.</span></p>

I do not reject the mother&#8217;s evidence as to her own conduct which now fits with her broader account of loss of self-control. It certainly makes sense and fits with the now understood wider canvas. But there is no reason to believe it invalidates my previous finding. It is striking to now appreciate that when I was considering how Y had suffered injuries the father in combination with the mother deliberately misled me into understanding the mother was calm when caring for the children, whereas both knew something very different. Their only reason for withholding this information must have been to avoid the prospect of findings being made. In doing so they were clearly hampering my, the experts and all the parties ability to understand what had happened. The account of the ex-partner is no more credible now than it was previously. Nothing has changed in that regard. I consider the prospects of domestic violence from father to mother is not reduced by the admission of domestic abuse from the mother to the father. Rather I am now left with a clearer sense of a high pressure environment in which domestic abuse is both plausible and accepted. </span></p>

This was done at the particular request of the parents and was accepted by all the parties. In both cases the parents were willing to engage with the professional until they reached a conclusion contrary to their position. In the case of the psychologist the father led a case that he had only been seen for 30 minutes by the expert. Yet the expert had offered and continued to offer his direct records showing the meeting had been closer to 2 hours. I can appreciate how time estimation can be difficult but this did not justify the form of criticism directed at the expert &#8212; which was plainly incorrect. I do acknowledge the parents have had difficulties with the social work team. This has led to a second social worker being introduced to act as an intermediary. However I understand this relationship has either broken down or is fracturing. I do not accept the criticism of the social worker remaining allocated despite these difficulties. Continuity is very important in cases of this sort and is important for the children. It would be a dangerous path indeed to permit upset parties to be able to dictate a change of social worker. Parents must be expected to prioritise their children rather than their own feelings and emotions. These parents have struggled in this regard.</span></p>

I agree with the guardian that it is not a requisite of such courses that a parent admits to the violence found. However I agree with the psychologist that for many course providers wholesale denial on the part of a parent can be problematic. Ultimately on the facts of this case it is difficult to see how the evidence before me would be materially different had the father been referred given the manner in which his case on violence in the relationship has changed within this hearing.</span></p>

I recognise the father (supported by the mother) argue that this may now change but I have little if any evidence on which to base this belief. I appreciate this was likely contributed to by the cultural differences between their own lived experience and the system in which they find themselves. It may well be that in AA the issues that confront me might not lead to a state to intervene. It is likely contributed to by their relative social isolation. However, this does not change the fact that I have to assess what the future is likely to hold were I to make the order proposed by the parents.</span></p>

I have highlighted the factual findings of concealment on two occasions. This attitude is a continuing feature. An example of this is the failure of the parents to make any mention of the suggested accident on 7 July 2021. The rationale for hiding this event is difficult to understand given it would have provided a potential explanation for injuries suffered. Yet on their case the mother (throughout) and the father (from February 2023) were aware of the same but did not disclose the event until the father&#8217;s statement the day before final hearing. A second example is the non-disclosure of the extent of domestic disharmony in the parental relationship and the dishonest portrayal of a relationship without any issues. This position was maintained until the mother&#8217;s admission statement. A further aspect relates to the father&#8217;s evidence when he told me that but for the intervention of the police he had planned to mention to the psychologist both the existence of W and the 7 July accident. The interview was close to an end at this point. I found the father&#8217;s account incredible. It didn&#8217;t fit with his explanation elsewhere as to why he had not reported W&#8217;s birth. It was unclear to me why he would then have chosen to report this to the psychologist and then only in the last moments of the interview.</span></p>

I can only speculate as to whether I would have received the mother&#8217;s full admission if I had agreed to her application to vacate the final hearing. If I had favoured the parents account at fact finding then the parents would likely now be at home with the mother caring for four young children with limited day to day support from the father notwithstanding both had important information that the mother was emotionally struggling as a result and not withstanding the fact that they now accept it would be unsafe for her to be caring for the children. This approach to revealing only that which is required is deeply damaging to the ability of the court or professionals to evaluate a likely future surrounded by co-operation and transparency. </span></p>

The father then had an objective analysis bringing together the expert evidence and the wider canvas. At this point he was asked to reflect on my findings. He rejected my analysis in favour of an unevidenced case based on medical conspiracy. Moreover he had additional information which he chose not to share with the Court that put these events into a more explicable context. I do not accept it was only with the the admission statement that he could confront what had taken place. I accept at this point he had no choice but to accept this reality.

As the case moved towards final hearing the father made reference to an aunt who would be willing to travel to this country from AA to offer support. The ISW spoke to the aunt who made clear this support would be temporary in nature and that she neither appreciated or accepted the complex circumstances of the case. If she came to this country she would leave a child of her own behind. Further she typically spent part of her year working in a separate country and would need to return to this in due course. The ISW considered the family member would not amount to a credible support to enable the children to return home. The social worker was criticised for not speaking to the family member. For my part I struggle to see the requirement for this where the ISW had had a lengthy conversation with the family member and explained the challenges associated with that proposal. The social worker was entitled to rely on this evaluation. In final submissions and for the first time reference was made to the father&#8217;s sister. Consideration of this individual would require an adjournment of the proceedings and further significant delay for the children. These proceedings commenced on 21 August 2021 and have been through two sets of fact finding. This option should have been canvassed at a much earlier stage.</span></p>

They accept this might/will require a level of support whether from family or professionally. The father relies upon previous experiences in AA with an ex partner who travelled for work leaving him to care for two young children alone. He claims to have been left to bring up the children over a sustained period and in doing so demonstrated his capacity in this regard which can be applied to his children if they are returned to him. The mother endorsed this argument although I do not understand her to have had any first hand experience of what the father provided to these children. The applicant did not directly challenge this account. However, the applicant had limited if any material on which to do so. The details of the previous partner were not available. One of the children had been spoken to by the first ISW and expressed positive views about the father. However she did not provide a statement and was not called as a witness. How do I evaluate this piece of evidence? I do not consider there are grounds for simply rejecting this evidence but I also consider it has to be approached with a degree of caution and it needs to be evaluated in the light of all the evidence I have.

During fact finding he told me he had literally never handled Y prior to Y&#8217;s removal from their care. Further I was given an account of the father very much on the periphery of family life during the period. It is right to say I somewhat doubted this account and questioned why the father was being distanced from family life but I recognised some essential truth in the account. The combined evidence of the parents was of the father leaving the mother to care for the children alone for sustained periods. It is now understood both parents were conscious of the stresses this was placing on the mother. I struggle to see how such an experienced carer would respond in this way. His lack of engagement is suggestive of a lack of appreciation of the challenges of parenting which would be unlikely if he himself had faced the very same challenges on a sustained period as claimed.</span></p>

Whatever approach one takes the caring responsibilities of a parent for these four children would be significant. I have not seen evidence that the father has demonstrated a capability to meet this challenge. The ISW has concluded he could not meet the needs of the children in his care.

I agree this plan was an evolving proposition during the hearing. The hearing started with a plan of physical but not &#8216;romantic&#8217; separation. After the admission statement the mother proposed to relocate some distance away to live with a friend and her child. Little thought was given to the potential safeguarding issues attached to such a proposal insofar as the child in that home was concerned. By submissions the mother had tested this placement but found it to be unsuitable. Her revised plan was to return to AA until such time as therapy was available when she would return. I have to say little thought was given to the potential for obtaining the same whilst living overseas. It seemed to me likely the prospects of such therapy would be significantly diminished in such circumstances. Did this mean there was no likelihood of the mother returning?

In this context the evidence of the parents as to their relationship after the admission statement is a little concerning. Both were examined in some detail as to their interaction over the weekend after the statement. Yet both gave an account lacking in any detail as to any discussion about what the mother had revealed. One might have expected the father to want answers from the mother as to why she had kept this from him and the implications this had had for their family life. Rather they appear to have each largely ignored the other and the issue between them. My sense was of this remaining an unresolved issue between the parents and an issue that neither was willing to address or engage with at any level.

I do not consider I can simply view this behaviour as situational and restricted to the adult relationship. The previous evidence highlighted the importance to the father of his working role and this would have to take a back seat if he were to care for the children.

Whilst the children&#8217;s appreciation of the same is naturally limited it remains important for them in understanding who they are.

They are young and vulnerable and safe care is a central requirement.

The children will now have a need for their parents to prioritise their requirements over their own wants and needs. As set out above this would require separation for a sustained period. The children&#8217;s needs are inconsistent with parents who are unable to both subscribe to and maintain such a course until it is no longer required in the children&#8217;s interests.</span></p>

This would sever the children from their family on a permanent basis. I have commented as to the impact this would have in respect of identity issues. It would also impact on their emotional wellbeing. A time would come when the children would understand their history and they would undoubtedly wonder why they were not raised within their family. They might well question why this was necessary and what has become of their parents. They may question whether they were in any way responsible for this outcome. The manner in which these feelings might arise is unpredictable but I should not lose sight of the potential for this to undermine the emotional wellbeing of an individual child. There is a potential for emotional damage to be caused if these issues are not addressed with care and consideration. There is a danger of these potentially conflicted emotions unsettling any placement and jeopardising the successful transition to adulthood and independence. I appreciate adoptive carers will likely approach the relationship from a position of understanding and awareness as to this issue. This is why such candidates are strongly advised to be open with the child as to their history. Approached carefully and within a loving and supporting relationship the risks are likely to be reduced. But they remain risks nonetheless.</span></p>

This is more significant for the older children and X in particular but applies to all the children. The parents have been consistent in contact and their approach has been warm and positive. The criticisms made of the parents elsewhere in this judgment does not change the fact they have been assiduous in keeping to contact and seeing their children.  I have no doubt this relationship would continue so long as the parents have the opportunity to pursue it. This would for reasons set out above be valuable to the children and would offer them emotional support. The parents plainly want these relationships to continue and are fundamentally opposed to the plans placed before the court. The important related question is as to the ability and willingness of the parents (or either of them) to provide the children with a secure environment in which they can develop and have their needs met. The parents wish to provide such care. Do they have the ability to provide such a secure environment?</span></p>

If this is the case then the children will not only lose their parents but will also lose the physical and emotional support of their siblings, or some of them. I acknowledge there may be greater optimism as to the potential for sibling contact post placement but even this would likely be limited as to extent and cannot be guaranteed.

In reality I agree there must be a hierarchy of priorities but this simply confirms rather than removes the likely negative.

It is an account which sits uncomfortably with his case of not revealing the child because he was fearful if he did the mother would make further allegations to the police. I frankly find this explanation as unlikely as the other. Rather I am confident the parents colluded in a plan to convey W to AA for her to be cared for there awaiting the end of the proceedings.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.99in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">I also have regard to the late admission statement. Whilst the court welcomes the mother&#8217;s courage in making this statement it seems clear this was only provided when no other option was left. This cannot be seen to be an admission based on remorse and a wish to be open. It seems clear to me this was a strategically timed revelation when other options were unavailable and the final hearing was due to commence. That this is the case can be seen in the piece meal way in which the final evidence was provided. The initial revelation was as to the &#8216;accident&#8217; only. It seems clear this was provided in the hope that it would somehow distract the court from proceeding with a final hearing. It was concurrently associated with an application to vacate. It is deeply troubling to me that once again this was information which was &#8216;known&#8217; to the mother prior to the proceedings but was only brought forward at the doors of the final hearing. It is claimed the father knew in February 2023 but also chose not to reveal this detail until his final statement. For my part I am in some doubt as to whether such an accident occurred. It is most surprising this was not put to the experts as an explanatory rationale for the injuries. Standing back it is far from clear why the mother would have withheld such information which fundamentally cast no real blame on her. I strongly suspect this was developed as a deliberate ploy to distract the court. However, whether true of false it was deployed in a manner which was geared towards obscuring the real truth as to how Y came to be injured.</span></p>

I have a strong suspicion the mother has sought to elevate her own behaviour in an attempt to again distract from my findings against the father, or indeed to cause me to reconsider the same. I see this as part of a plan to effectively clear the father so as to leave open his path towards caring for the children. It has not had the desired effect. As noted I do not reject the mother&#8217;s account but I stand by my findings as to the father&#8217;s conduct. The concern for me is that the parents have both chosen to present a picture of everything being perfect in the home when they both knew this was not the case. Moreover they have chosen to actively mislead the court in this regard even thought this information was an important part of the wide canvas which sheds light on the circumstances in which Y came to suffer harm. In my fact finding I recalibrated the arguments as to the wide canvas available to me. The parents had relied upon it as demonstrating a case contrary to the medical evidence. On making my finding as to domestic abuse I expressed concern that the background was one in which stresses were more apparent and misconduct more likely. I now have a more faithful account of the dynamic in the family home. It would have assisted the court to have had this account from the outset. But the parents understood it whether or not they revealed the same. As such the father (and I focus on him given the realistic options) was much better placed to assess what had really happened.</span></p>

As noted earlier in this judgment I have had the sense of the details being revealed when it suited the parents. This leaves me questioning whether there are further details which are being kept from the court. In general terms it is not required for me to further speculate but in this context I place relatively little confidence on the parents case as to agreed separation. I gained no real sense from the parents of a true or considered separation. I was left with the strong feeling this was simply a further step in their plan to make the case for the father a better one. Their evidence of a total lack of conversation as to what the mother had revealed was very difficult to either accept or understand. It simply did not fit with expected behaviour patterns. The impression was of the parents having no interest or desire to explore the topic. I was left wondering whether this detail had been previously explored by the parents which might explain why they didn&#8217;t need to further discuss the topic. In any event I was not left with any sense that the parents had reached a significance changing point in their relationship. As with the advocates for the applicant and guardian I was struck by the simple non-engagement between the parents between the mother&#8217;s admission statement and their evidence in the case. I am confident there was more to be said.</span></p>

This has in fact been the reality for the professionals around the family. I do not see this changing.</span></p>

I have commented on honesty above. But co-operation has been seen to be an equal challenge. Throughout this case the parents have struggled to maintain working relationships with professionals charged with the care of their children. There has been ongoing criticism of foster carers and a complete breakdown in working relations with the social work team. The parents blame the clinical team as having conspired against them and the father wrongly blamed the psychologist for not doing his job despite the evidence being to the contrary. The very clear picture of this case is that the parents cannot work with those who are challenging of their views and the care of their children.</span></p>

All the evidence, including that heard during the final hearing suggests the relationship will be fractured and difficult to maintain. It will likely be overlaid by a strong sense of concealment of material information and opposition. It is very far from that which would be required to give confidence in the safeguarding of the children.</span></p>

For these reasons I have not been able to identify a route under which these children could safely return to either of their parents within their timescales. It further troubles me that the route suggested by the father is one which comes with no real level of confidence as to success. In reality the father&#8217;s proposal is for adjournment to test his ability to care for the children. In my assessment these children demand an answer now not a further period of assessment. They have been in proceedings for far too long. Now is the time to determine what is best for them.</span></p>

At the heart of this case is the mother struggling to cope in circumstances which were readily identifiable as problematic and surrounded by stress. Yet the father&#8217;s priority was not to stop to help the mother but instead to focus almost exclusively on his work. I consider this a telling indication of his actual aptitude for meeting the needs of the children. I have reached the conclusion that the option of return to the father is inconsistent with the welfare of the children when assessed as I must throughout their lives. It is understandably based on a wish to maintain family life but it lacks real foundations. It is an option which continues to carry an unacceptable level of risk to the children.</span></p>

In my judgment the children&#8217;s welfare demands a safe and secure home in which to thrive. In my assessment this is only compatible with the making of care and placement orders. I reach this conclusion notwithstanding an awareness that there will be real challenges with the adoptive route. Most importantly I cannot be confident the children will be placed together. The family finding evidence in this regard was not particularly helpful. The witness expressed caution based on her experience as to the ability to place four children together. But she also freely admitted she had only been asked to place four children on very few occasions and there had been some success. I am not critical but on balance reference back to statistics is unlikely to be helpful here. Intuitively it will be a challenge. But it will not be impossible having regard to the age of the children and their characteristics. However, in comparison this will be a safe option for them and as such finds my favour.</span></p>

In reaching my conclusions I am more than aware of the potential that these four children may not find a single home together. I am though more hopeful that candidates who come forward to care for the children will recognise the real benefit to the children of maintaining a relationship with separated siblings. I gauge such contact is likely to reinforce any placement rather than undermine it. These are children who include members who will remember their parents and each other. Maintaining sibling contact will provide significant emotional support and I would expect any carers to understand this point. </span></p>
