I am in no doubt at all that X&#8217;s welfare as been at the forefront of everyone&#8217;s minds.

This appears to be an infrequent occurrence although it should be acknowledged that most infants do not undergo CT or MR scanning after sustaining a short fall. Subdural bleeds within the head and spine are commonly the result of inflicted injury by shaking. The scans are not able to distinguish between accidental and inflicted injury. The limited available data suggest that intraspinal haemorrhage is frequently associated with inflicted injury and is rarely seen in accidental injury. Again, there is a limit to what can be known about this phenomenon in accidental trauma when most infants do not undergo MR scanning of the spine following accidental head trauma. &#8220;</span></p>

In fact, the parents were warm and attentive to their son, respectful and supportive of each other, and acknowledged that the local authority were entitled to be concerned as a result of X&#8217;s injuries.
