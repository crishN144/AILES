Her family were concerned that she was becoming frail and forgetful, and decided that she should move in with her sister-in-law, Maureen, with whom she stayed until February 2007. WD and MD bought a flat nearby, known as &#8216;The Lodge&#8217;, with the intention that AB would live there. She moved into The Lodge in March 2007 and remained there for six months until September 2007. Her attorneys-cum-landlords, WD and MD, charged her rent and also required her to pay the costs of refurbishing The Lodge. In September 2007 she returned to live with Maureen, because by then she had become incapable of living independently. She stayed with Maureen until July 2008, when she was admitted into residential care. </p>

There were significant problems with the tenant and the flat was used for illegal activities involving drugs and firearms. The housing association eventually agreed to evict the tenant and surrender the lease. In April 2009 Bairstow Eves valued the property in the region of &#163;230,000 and recommended marketing it at that price. In the event, the only offer received was for &#163;200,000, and the attorneys agreed to sell the property to their sister, CL, for that sum.  They sold it to her on 18 January 2010.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Christine Cooper is a barrister at Field Court Chambers and specialises in local government law. The London Borough of Brent instructed her to act for it in these proceedings and, in anticipation of the hearing on 20 June 2014, she filed a position statement in which she made the following submissions:</p>

The purported accounts exhibited to the witness statement served on Brent on 3rd June 2014 are not signed off by an accountant, as claimed in the body of the witness statement, and the underlying documents have never been disclosed. There are many assertions that solicitors and professional advisors were consulted before undertaking transactions but no details are provided and there is no such advice exhibited. Brent does not have any confidence in the figures provided.</p>

This was not in AB&#8217;s best interest.</p>

These include the loans to SD, the purchase of a car for Maureen, the transfer of &#163;15,000 to Maureen (when she already had free access to AB&#8217;s post office account into which her pension was paid) and the draw-down of the unaccounted for &#163;32,667.46 cash. There are, no doubt, other transactions that do not bear much scrutiny such as the alleged liability to pay for the refurbishment of The Lodge (with interest) when (i) it was owned by WD and MD, (ii) MD carried out the work himself, and (iii) she moved in as rent paying tenant.</p>

Brent does consider it is best placed to act as deputy for AB notwithstanding the attorney&#8217;s opposition, as she is in a care home and it will have ongoing input in those arrangements. Whilst a panel deputy could be appointed, Brent is concerned that vast costs will be incurred in a professional deputy having to deal with lengthy correspondence and complaints from the displaced attorneys who the deputy will have to pursue to recover AB&#8217;s funds. It is noted that AB has previously incurred a large legal bill of &#163;22,874.74 from Hamilton Downing and it would not be in her best interest to incur further unnecessary expense.</p>

This will make the process of recovering those funds somewhat simpler.&#8221;  </p>

But we would not wish this ground to be sustained merely because the attorney was not the sort of person that a particular relative would have chosen. It is our wish that the donor&#8217;s choice of attorney should carry considerable weight. Thus, for example, a mother might be content to appoint her son as her EPA attorney despite being aware of a conviction for theft. We would not want her choice of attorney to be upset simply because a particular relative would not want the son to be his attorney. The question should be whether the particular attorney is suitable to act as attorney for the particular donor. In short, the court should examine carefully all the circumstances, particularly the relationship between the donor and the attorney.&#8221;</p>

AB did go out in the new car; however it was not as often as we had hoped for two reasons. The first is because AB simply refused to go on trips. And when our mother and brothers persuaded her to attend family occasions at our mother&#8217;s, AB simply refused to go back to the home. These were distressing moments for our mother particularly because she often commented on her own sense of &#8216;guilt&#8217; that AB ended up in a care home.&#8221;</p>

Nor should they put themselves in a position where their personal interests conflict with their duties. They must also not allow any other influences to affect the way in which they act as an attorney. Decisions should always benefit the donor, and not the attorney. Attorneys must not profit or get any personal benefit from their position, apart from receiving gifts where <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> allows it, whether or not it is at the donor&#8217;s expense.&#8221; </p>

What is left of AB&#8217;s estate would rapidly be eroded by the professional deputies&#8217; costs. I agree with Miss Cooper that Brent Council is best placed to act as deputy, as AB is in a residential care home and the Council is already funding the lion&#8217;s share of her care fees.</p>
