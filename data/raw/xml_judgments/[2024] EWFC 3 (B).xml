However, what commences as a difficult decision is made harder where (a) the relationship with each parent is acknowledged as being valuable to the child in question; (b) the proposed relocation is distant from this jurisdiction leading to an inevitably high impact on regular contact with the left behind parent, and; (c) where the family are international in character and the applicant has a strong and understandable desire to return to their country of origin. It is in that setting that I am asked to either permit or refuse a relocation application.</span></p>

The respondent father (&#8220;R&#8221;) opposes this plan. I have to decide this issue and consider the contact arrangements whether or not permission is granted. In reaching my conclusions I have regard to the documents contained within the hearing bundle together with the limited number of additional documents copied to me during and after the hearing; the opening notes and submissions of counsel for each party, and; the live evidence of the reporting CAFCASS Officer, Ms Taylor, and the parents. I will not refer to all of that evidence within this judgment but I will continue to keep it in mind. The hearing was conducted on an attended basis over three days with only Ms Taylor giving evidence remotely. Submissions finished after 4pm on the third day and so I have reserved judgment. Within this judgment footnote references are to page and paragraph numbers with &#8216;SB&#8217; being a reference to the supplementary bundle. In this judgment I refer to the parties as R and P, and to the child as I. No discourtesy is intended by using their first names.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">I&#8217;s welfare is my central concern and is paramount from start to finish. I approach this via the welfare checklist found within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s1(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. It is not helpful for me to get mired in arguments as to who is the primary carer for I as a condition precedent to my decision making. However, I should give proper regard to the arrangements which are appropriate for I as a prelude to determining the relocation issue. It is only by doing this that I can conduct a proper comparative analysis of the impact on I of relocation or refusal of the same. I should not give either outcome priority over the other. To do so would be to slip into a linear analysis. The options must be weighed and balanced against other in a holistic manner by considering the positives and negatives of each. My decision will have an obvious and significant impact on familial relationships. Family members are entitled to respect for their private family life. The <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> presumes it will in the welfare interest of a child to maintain a relationship with both parents so long as the same is safe. Decision making which has the potential to seriously impact on this relationship must therefore be subject to a heightened level of scrutiny and a move of this nature should be subjected to a proportionality evaluation.</span></p>

In 2018 P and I travelled and remained in Australia for several months, with P arguing this was pursuant to an agreement that she and I would return to live there permanently whereas R disagreed and characterises this removal as an abduction. In any event P voluntarily returned to this jurisdiction in March 2018. On separation the parties considered contact and between 2018 and 2020 R was having contact every day after school and for both days at the weekend. Initial discussions reached agreement as to overnight contact but I was reluctant to stay overnight. The midweek contact took place in P&#8217;s home (without P present) and the weekend contact in R&#8217;s home unsupervised.</span></p>

P raised concern as to R&#8217;s mental health. At that time, I was seeing a child psychologist (Dr Slater) and P was advised to stop unsupervised contact. From this point contact continued on a daily basis but supervised by P. In 2021 R instructed solicitors who sought unsupervised contact. P agreed the same once R engaged with assistance to manage his mental health/anger issues. In June 2022, P issued this application. Within these proceedings contact has developed by consent and R currently has alternate weekend contact on a continuing basis together with holiday contact.</span></p>

R wanted to travel to Mauritius in 2021. P wanted to travel to Australia. P claims R obstructed her proposals. P claims travel to Mauritius was not possible at the proposed time due to her not having had vaccinations. She says she proposed a later trip that year but R did not agree. In 2023 the parties agreed for I to spend two weeks in Mauritius followed by an onward trip to Australia. On his return to this jurisdiction, he stopped over in Mauritius.</span></p>

She dealt with all questions in a head-on fashion and there was no evasion or obfuscation in her responses. I do not hesitate to accept her evidence as being an objective and fair analysis of the circumstances on her part. I have a reservation as to the limited opportunity available to her to meet with the parties and I; the fact that her report is dated from February 2023 (and thus was somewhat out-of-date at the point of final hearing), and; my sense that a significant aspect of her evidence and conclusions were generic rather than specific in character. I specifically addressed this with her at the end of her evidence. It seemed to me the points she was making as to impact of relocation on contact was a generic observation as to the difficulties that would arise in nearly every case from a relocation of this sort rather than a conclusion which was specifically shaped by the circumstances of this case. This is not a substantial criticism as I appreciate any analysis is by its very nature based on a speculative hypothesis given the move has not yet occurred and so conclusions will be drawn from expectations and experience drawn elsewhere.</span></p>

There were aspects of his evidence which did not fit with the surrounding extraneous evidence. I found his approach to be somewhat strategic in character rather than straightforward. That is not to suggest I found his evidence unreliable or that I found him to be a dishonest witness. Rather I formed the view that (in contrast to P) he had allowed his account of events to be shaped by what he was seeking whether or not this fitted with what actually happened. Sadly, I formed the view that he has allowed the adult separation to negatively shape his attitude to post separation decision making. He has not moved on from that time and this casts a shadow on the approach he takes. This is unfortunate as he has a valuable contribution to make.</span></p>

On any approach R misconducted himself towards P by assaulting her and sending troubling abusive messaging. Yet P has not sought to significantly limit contact by suggesting or requiring contact to take place in a third party supervised setting. She has not sought to weaponise the misbehaviour to restrict contact. In making this point I am not suggesting she should have done so. Rather I reflect from experience on many cases in which allegations of misconduct are relied upon to limit contact. In this case P not only agreed to contact but agreed to unsupervised contact (2018-20) and permitted the same within her home. Further, she facilitated contact sessions in which she personally supported the contact, e.g., at Christmas. Moreover, on my reading of the evidence she transported I to Paris for contact and paid for the travel costs. I find it puzzling in a case in which P might have sought to limit contact but really did not that R has become unjustifiably fixated on the point.</span></p>

I heard evidence as to events that had taken place which were felt to have impacted on I (showing him a photo of the man P had an affair with and speaking of him being responsible for R living alone) and I have formed the view it is likely R will have failed on occasions to moderate his words and behaviour in front of I permitting his own sense of victimhood at the hands of P to come to the fore. I am troubled as to R continuing to hold to the extreme view that a &#8216;hit man&#8217; was hired to kill him given the almost complete absence of any tangible evidence to support such a view. I do not find the same was said to I but it suggests R has a somewhat warped assessment of the reality surrounding him. R seemed to have no insight as to how such a bizarre viewpoint might come to impact on P when considering child focused decisions.</span></p>

However, on a fair assessment this does not appear to be the case. I have reached this conclusion in the light of the fact that much of what I describe above occurred well before the date of this application and cannot be sensibly causatively linked to this application.</span></p>

R considers these to be inappropriate and to overstep the mark and place upon him unjustified conditions. With this in mind I observe the first point should not have been controversial in any event given it has been accepted before me as the case. I can see why P sought this recognition as it had the potential at least to shape the parental interaction with I and would likely elevate a recognised need for stability and consistency in dealing with I. But as noted this is now agreed and is agreed on the basis of evidence which existed at the relevant time. The second condition related to misconduct on the part of R; a particular event in September 2020 which led to the police attending R&#8217;s home, and; a concern on the part of P as to R&#8217;s erratic mental health. I was at the time seeing a child psychologist and P claims he advised the supervision of contact. R disagrees with this decision making. I note correspondence in opposition to this did not arise until the next year and I also note R appears to have recognised a need for some change on his part as he engaged with a counselling programme. P modified her position to agree to unsupervised contact building to overnight contact when R confirmed he had undertaken such work. It does not appear she delayed at that point or sought to further obstruct by raising new points. On my assessment whilst I accept a different parent may have prioritised different issues in this regard, I cannot see within this point grounds of complaint against P. It may suggest she is cautious in her approach but it is not good evidence of an obstructive mother for the sake of it.</span></p>

P argued there was a need for consistency in the case of a child with a neurodivergent character and that contact was in any event developing during this period.

I accept this may at times have reflected a cautious approach on her part and this may have caused contact to proceed slower than it might otherwise have done. However, this needs to be seen in the context of the circumstances surrounding breakdown. Viewed fairly and objectively it would be wrong to form the conclusion that she has sought to obstruct contact or to limit R&#8217;s relationship with I. I do not accept that characterisation and I do not think it is likely she will take such an approach in future whatever decision I reach. I find she genuinely accepts the benefits to I of a good relationship with his father and will do her best to ensure this happens. It should be clear I consider this also requires R to make his own contribution towards this effort to make it a full success. In my assessment it is R who needs to pause and reflect on where he finds himself. In doing so I hope he will come to recognise the support P has given to contact.</span></p>

This led counsel for P to suggest that R had in fact latched onto a point made by the CAFCASS officer to improve his position, notwithstanding it was not his actual case as to the reality of their relationship. In his live evidence the issue remained somewhat vague. I asked him to explain when he felt the relationship had in fact deteriorated from the point of being &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">very strong&#8217; </span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">to the point at which he now describes it as being &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">not very meaningful</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">.&#8217; In answer he said it had in fact been very strong up to the return of I from Australia in September 2023. I have to say I found this overall argument difficult to accept. For a start it plainly left the relationship as being strong at the time of the CAFCASS report yet R had sought to rely upon the CAFCASS assessment to promote his case when in fact it did not chime with his own assessment of the relationship at the very point in time. Secondly, it was clear there were very obvious reasons as to why I might have been challenging immediately following a return from Australia given there is unchallenged evidence that I wishes to relocate to that country. On any reasonable basis the assessment of presentation at that point should be viewed as consequential upon this recent trip rather than evidence of a more sustained deterioration. Finally, it is clear this behaviour has been managed and contact has continued and developed. It seems R has managed it appropriately without needing to return to P. In my assessment R has fallen into the trap of adapting his evidence to fit a proposition that improves his case but does not fit with the available evidence. As a result, this has not been sustainable when it has come into contact with reality. </span></p>

But the evidence also supports a conclusion that I has a secure and positive bond with R. This can be seen in the positive holiday contact and the developing visiting contact. It is also represented in R&#8217;s argument for additional sabbatical time in September 2023. In reaching this conclusion I depart from the views of Ms Taylor but I bear in mind that her assessment was undertaken many months ago since which date contact has come on leaps and bounds. I also have the benefit of hearing all the evidence and some significant conclusions as set out within this section. I note the agreed proposals for contact if relocation is refused would be as to 3-nights per fortnight overnight and potentially additional mid-week and holiday time. I note that since separation I has been available to see R on almost every day of the week. It is difficult to reconcile this with a relationship which is not meaningful. I have struggled to understand how R came to label it in that manner.</span></p>

I have seen expert assessments which support this conclusion whilst identifying areas of concern and focus. There appears to be a remaining debate as to whether I is also dyspraxic. I appreciate P contends this has been diagnosed. I am unsure R accepts this to be the case. It was suggested to R that a confirmatory report exists although I am not sure I have seen it. I suspect there is some support for this additional diagnosis but again I do not think the resolution of the same is required as a condition precedent to the points placed before me for resolution.</span></p>

In many regards the response of P fits with such an analysis. Her case was that at around admission I was not showing significant signs of the impact of the condition such as to merit it being raised but that over time as learning has become more challenging it has become more noticeable and impactful. The recent engagement with professionals does tend to suggest the notion that more challenging direct learning is placing a focus on I&#8217;s areas of weakness. For my part I do not think the circumstances at admission help me in my analysis. </span></p>

Yet my sense from the written and live evidence is that he has degrees of scepticism around the issue. An example is his justification for not seeking to pursue professional support in preference to the suggested opinions of the head at I&#8217;s school. Examples can also be found in his categorisation of I as low on the spectrum and in the manner in which he recently engaged with the professional assessing I. He appears to approach this issue from the position of some minimisation. This may flow from an unwillingness to accept the challenges his son faces or may be due to the comparative limited role he has played in I&#8217;s life in the last period when it appears these issues have started to come to the fore. In making these points I do not lose sight of R&#8217;s strong wish for I to achieve and his willingness to provide and fund practical support around tutoring and indeed the funding of private education. However, in conclusion I find P is the lead in these matters and will continue to be. In this sense I doubt anything material will change whatever decision I reach.</span></p>

Against this I have the fact of ongoing significant unsupervised contact with R including whilst overseas and I attending school all the time (whether occasionally late or not). I am struggling to see how I can safely reach a conclusion of separation anxiety as a concept which is materially impacting on or likely to impact on the relationship between father and child. Overall, I am willing to accept there will have been occasions when I has struggled to leave a parent and particularly in the context of the start of the school day.

She therefore returned with I without the need for litigation. R disputes this account and continues to refer to the events as being an abduction. He complains P purchased one-way tickets (she denies this and evidenced that she purchased return tickets in November 2017 in her second statement) and he explains he was at the time devastated about P&#8217;s action (a reference I assume to her affair) and agrees he sent the messages relied on by P and that he paid the school fees.

Under this agreement I would spend two weeks in Mauritius with his father with his mother staying locally. It was agreed I would see P midweek in each week. He would then travel on to Australia with P. R complains P interfered with this trip in a number of ways. First, she changed I&#8217;s flight so that he would travel with her on the outward journey. Second, she interfered with the arrangements R sought to make as far as it concerned seeing the maternal grandmother. Third, at a point midway through the holiday P relocated to R&#8217;s hotel and in doing so undermined his contact time. P denies these suggestions and makes the following points. Shortly, before the trip she was informed the maternal grandmother had become very unwell to the point where she underwent an amputation. In pre-trip video messaging I saw the grandmother and was distressed to see her in that state. Understandably family emotions were heightened by this deteriorating situation. Then R made clear he intended to take I straight to hospital on arrival in Mauritius. P communicated objecting to the same on the basis that this would be emotionally challenging for I. She did not oppose I seeing the grandmother but argued this should be managed in a different way. She argued R was not only unwilling to adjust but by his response concerned her as to emotional state. As a result, she altered the arrangements for I to fly with her. In any event on arrival I was delivered to R who proceeded to take I to see the grandmother. Unfortunately, in the course of the trip the grandmother&#8217;s health further deteriorated and she died. P argued that she assisted R by looking after I to free him to deal with family affairs and rituals. Although R argued this stopped him taking I to the funeral P pointed out she asked R whether he wished her to take I to the funeral and he said not to. In any event as a result of her ongoing support she and R made arrangements for her to relocate to the hotel in which I was staying. As such this move was to give support rather than obstruct the relationship. R disputed this and said it was P who had changed the arrangements. </span></p>

It is clear P felt it was not a good idea for I to travel with his father on an extended journey for the first time and on arrival to immediately travel into a potentially emotionally charged situation in hospital. She relies upon the distress experienced by I on seeing the state of the grandmother in video messaging. It is clear R found this view to be one which sought to override his own parental decision making and in correspondence he appeared unwilling to modify the plans as suggested by P. It is clear this discussion arose at the very last moment and this restricted the time available for reflection and discussion. P then acted unilaterally changing the flight details only.</span></p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">I can find room for sympathy with both positions. R had an obvious desire to enable his mother to see her grandson (and importantly she did). These feelings were likely strongly held and understandable. P worried how this would impact I and thus the trip. I can see the foundation for this worry having regard to all I have heard about I. I cannot find a basis for criticising P in these circumstances. It is perhaps easier for me to identify the way in which this should have been resolved. I consider R should have been more open to P&#8217;s views. He could have travelled with I and then visited his mother alone so that he could fully assess the situation before arranging a more considered opportunity for I to visit. I consider he lost sight of the best way forward in the moment and in the light of the ongoing disagreement with P. But I do not wish to be unduly critical in all the circumstances of the case. This was a situation that could have been avoided but it was not. I have the benefit of emotional and temporal distance.</span></p>

It is quite clear P was required to journey between hotels to support R at this challenging time by caring for I. Sadly, R has now lost perspective on what was happening and does himself no credit by failing to recognise the help P was providing. I accept the evidence of P as to the quality of the roads between the hotels and the issue this raised with late evening travel. I find the account of P plausible as a likely solution to the issue. It is also noteworthy that R, as a Mauritian national, might have been better placed to negotiate this change given the circumstances. On the evidence available to me I prefer her account and find accordingly.</span></p>

The first concerns a party who seeks to start a new life in a country with which they have little or no connection. The second relates to cases in which a party effectively seeks to return to their country of origin. The first form of application will often raise significant issues as to the practicalities of the planning whereas in the majority of cases in the second category this is not the case. Here P seeks to return to Australia having left in 2004. Whilst Australia is not her country of birth it is where she grew up and it is where all of her family continue to reside. She left the country in support of R&#8217;s career progression. She is a national of that country as is I and she returned there to give birth to him. She continues to hold a strong connection to the country and has a right to return there without restriction. On the facts of the case her planning is to live with her parents in a property with which she and I are familiar. I did not hear any meaningful argument as to the suitability of that property. She would school I at the same school as was subject to the 2018 admission process. I have dealt with this above and notwithstanding the argument as to the 2018 trip it is clear the parents co-operated to an extent in such an admission. On any objective analysis the school would appear to be a good one. P has been offered a new job with her current employer working from Australia. As such she has a readymade post to assume were she to relocate. Issues of health care and ancillary matters were not relevant. Language is plainly not an issue. I did not hear any significant, if any, challenge to the practicality of the planning (I deal separately with contact planning below) and the arrangements that would be in place were P to relocate. I am satisfied the plans are sensible and realistic. Were I to give permission I am in no doubt the key arrangements necessary to make daily life workable would be in place and would be sustainable.</span></p>

The key focus of this assessment was to consider their respective ability to make contact work should relocation be approved. It should be recorded that both parents have a good level of net earnings. P has net earnings of around &#163;95,000. I understood her evidence to be that this would be maintained if she relocated but she would hope to improve this over time. R is a self-employed consultant with a net income of about &#163;110,000. My understanding was that he intends to continue working in the same manner and it appeared his income is likely to be stable at about that level. This has permitted both parties to successfully run separate households whilst living in an expensive capital city. They have additionally funded private schooling (R) and financed professional support for I (P).</span></p>

In his written evidence R comments on the cost to him of a trip to Australia each year as being &#163;12,000 for 2-weeks. This includes a &#163;6,000 business class return flight. In contrast P accepts she would be largely responsible for the costs of contact facilitation and proposes funding travel to London (or Mauritius if preferred) on three occasions per annum based around the Christmas, Easter, and summer holidays. She argues this will be within her financial capacity as she will make savings in moving to Australia (accommodation costs principally) and will be able to travel for work when she travels with I to London. She appears to estimate the cost at no more than &#163;12,000 per annum (3 return trips) and has set the same aside. In evidence she also told me that her brother has offered to make a property available to R when he comes to Australia.</span></p>

However, it seems clear there are sufficient resources available to enable the facilitation of contact should relocation be approved. The costs to P are likely to be significantly less than the savings accruing from the relocation. The costs for R are within his resources. In reaching this conclusion I bear in mind R may no longer pay school fees but may be responsible for equivalent child support. I appreciate P may be responsible for school fees but she may receive child support (which she does not currently). For my part I can see no reason why R would need to travel business class when visiting Australia. In my assessment the budget he sets for 2-weeks could fund close to two separate trips per annum.</span></p>

It arose out of concerns as to whether R would in fact be available for I to the level contended for were permission to relocate be refused. R works in Paris and will likely continue to do so into the foreseeable future. His consultancy role is likely to continue with respect to agencies of the European Union and as such contracting parties will be located within that economic bloc. R provides consultancy services in respect of various projects activated from time to time. These appear to proceed over fixed periods of between 3-12 months or so. They tend to commence at particular times of the year, for instance after the Easter break or the summer period and then run for the stipulated period. Engagement with the contract and the necessity for attendance in the office (or the availability for remote working) is difficult to predict and has on occasion been seen to be a whim of the individual in charge of the project. R also accepts the remote element is a function of the extent to which this facility is made available to employees linked to the contract; is a hold-over from Covid times, and; is therefore susceptible to political issues around return to the workplace. As such the future working patterns may be unpredictable but may or may not require enhanced time in the office. In November 2023, R was required to be in the office for most of the time leading to him being in Paris Monday to Friday. He expects this to change. He tends to take time off when his employee colleagues are themselves on national holidays and so currently this mirrors the French school vacation plan.</span></p>

Under this R was to have contact each Wednesday night. It then transpired he could not in fact be available for mid-week contact as he would be out of the country. As noted above R contends this will not be the case in the near future. This has led to questioning as to his availability to assume contact. When Ms Taylor was questioned about this, she expressed some concern that P was being asked to live in a country in which R was not himself living. She was left worried as to R&#8217;s availability. P echoed these concerns. R argued that his unavailability was temporary and he would soon be available for midweek contact. He challenged the notion of the centrality of Paris as his base making a case for it simply being a workplace with availability for him to work from home in the future. I think on any case there was no question of R being unavailable at weekends and holidays. </span></p>

His argument was that his availability in such circumstances reflected the European school vacation periods which did not entirely overlap with those in Australia. As such whilst P might be proposing extended stays at given vacation times that would not necessarily be periods when he could be available. He also asked me to reflect upon additional features which included reduced availability at times close to the conclusion of contracts (when he would be expected to be fully available to ensure a successful completion of the contract) and periods between contracts when he was able to take some time off work pending the next contact &#8211; an example of this being the sabbatical opportunity in September 2023. As I understood the evidence these periods would generally occur in about September; December; Easter, and August &#8211; when they did occur bearing in mind contracts are often for more than 3 months.</span></p>

His availability is dependent on the decision making of third parties who have no obligation to his family commitments and are not his employer.

He is dependent on the same being voluntarily applied to him. Having said this, I do accept there will likely be some scope for remote working going forward to reflect his role as a self-employed consultant.</span></p>

I do not comment in this regard as to whether R would in such circumstances prefer his travel to be to Mauritius rather than Australia, but either would be possible. Indeed, I consider there should be no fundamental reason as to why R could not accept the suggestion of an additional contact under which he travelled. In my assessment it would be entirely practical and consistent with my findings elsewhere within this judgment for R to travel to Australia and Mauritius on one occasion per annum each. In Mauritius I would imagine he would have family accommodation available should he want it. I therefore envisage the possibility for 5 sessions of contact each year with three in this jurisdiction and two divided between Australia and Mauritius.</span></p>

A fourth trip could be organised at a convenient time with R combining leave and working from home. I observe that this totals around 10 weeks on P&#8217;s case (the four trips) which is broadly consistent with R&#8217;s case of being available for half the current school holiday (around 9 weeks).

Many cases engage in an assessment of the psychological impact on the mental health state of that parent. There are cases in which the Court is asked to distinguish between simple upset and profound emotional harm. With the recognised ascendancy of welfare these cases seem not to be so common place. Plainly if one is considering the welfare of I then the impact on the parent will only have indirect relevance on the basis that refusal negatively impedes the ability of that parent to meet the welfare needs of I. In this case I have received competing views as to what a refusal might mean for P. To be clear she does not argue a likelihood of psychological harm. She does though make points as to the impact that being compelled to remain in this jurisdiction is having upon her. The sense of her evidence is that she is being worn down and although not at breaking point is moving in that direction. Part of her case reflects the argument that she has now on two occasions been at the point of relocation only for the same to be snatched away. She argues that she has no support in this jurisdiction and no real social network. She is alone and feels lonely. The difficulties in the parental relationship do not make this situation any easier to bear. In contrast R disagrees and paints a picture of P as a socially engaged and energetic individual. He disputes her relative isolation as suggested by her. In any event he addresses the sense of displacement from her family by arguing he would accept P travelling to Australia with I on two occasions per annum for a period of 3-weeks on each occasion. This would address the sense of being home sick.</span></p>

She is of course best placed to give this account. I found her evidence to be genuine and credible. From her perspective the relationships she has maintained are superficial school gate relationships. I accept this evidence. I also accept her evidence as to feeling increasingly worn down. I certainly do not understate the challenges of being a single parent whilst holding down a challenging career. I also (see my findings) accept that this is made more burdensome when it is associated with a co-parent who is at times oppositional in his approach and has been personally abusive. Further, I recognise the sense of unfairness that exists in circumstances in which P finds herself in this jurisdiction based on a choice to prefer R&#8217;s career and now fixed here even though he is free to pursue his career in another jurisdiction. Lastly, I appreciate the feeling of isolation from family which is found within P&#8217;s case. I am in no doubt that whilst these impacts fall short of impeding P&#8217;s ability to meet the needs of I, they are such as to make her daily life much harder than it need be. Over time this has the potential to have a more negative impact on P. Having heard the evidence, I cannot envisage a meaningful improvement in the attitude of R to P. In reality if she remains she will do so in an  atmosphere of challenge and conflict.</span></p>

This has permitted daily contact through the previously challenging period. It allows for generous regular contact. I do not overlook the significant impact upon  him were approval to be granted. I have noted above the practical potentials of P&#8217;s proposals but this would be materially different in scope from that which would arise but for the relocation. There would undoubtedly be a significant period of at least 8 weeks without direct contact. I am in no doubt R would find this situation hugely upsetting in its diminution of his relationship with his son. I acknowledge the real potential for video messaging to bridge the periods of direct contact and accept that in this day and age children of I&#8217;s age are adept at maintaining a range of communication tools through instant messaging that can keep alive a relationship at a distance. Still, this does not compare with a direct relationship. I bear in mind many of R&#8217;s concerns as to the capacity and willingness of P to support the relationship and what this might mean if a distance is added to the situation but I do not lose sight of my conclusions in this regard as set out above.</span></p>

But I do note P&#8217;s position as to his tendency to become fixated on matters. When a Court is considering wishes and feelings children can, it seems to me fall into three categories, with the boundaries between the three being somewhat fluid. There are young children who may express wishes but lack any real ability to fully understand the consequences of those wishes. Then there are older (teenage) children who are approaching quasi-independence whose wishes would deserve particular respect given decisions contrary to their viewpoint may simply be ignored. In between one has a group of children who are developing increasing autonomy and understanding but are still dependent and will lack full understanding. I consider I falls into this category.</span></p>

I appreciate this move is to a jurisdiction to which there are strong ties and I am in no doubt P is able to predict what the future will look like. However, for I the situation will be less clear.

If permission is granted the parents will need to be respectful of the impact this has on the other and will need to show I that they will make this work despite their previous opposition. Irrespective of the issues examined in this case I has an emotional need to feel attached to both parents. If permission is given it will be crucial for the relationship with his father to be seen as valuable to I and for it to be consistently promoted as such by the maternal family.

I do not intend to diminish R&#8217;s role in making this observation but there is not doubt it is upon P that central care duties fall. I see no basis for believing this will change. I consider I&#8217;s welfare is closely aligned with P&#8217;s continued emotional availability and resilience. Whilst not seeking to exaggerate my concerns I do consider there is a risk of P reaching a point where she is impacted by the continuing inability to return home and by the conflict in the separated parent relationship. I consider her care of I risks suffering without falling to a point where it is not good enough. Children are adept at picking up on adult difficulties and downturns in emotion.

I have outlined my observations and conclusions as to the practicality and workability of the plans and the commitment or otherwise of the parents to such plans. I have concluded the plans are workable and the mother has shown commitment to making contact work whilst at the same time recognising that such a change would have a profound effect on the time the father enjoys with I.</span></p>

This could not be maintained post move. Following a move there would be sustained periods during which he would not see his father at all other than remotely. R is concerned a combination of related features will lead to contact withering on the vine. That the mother would continue to be obstructive and should I not want to travel then it simply would not occur. I have to assess this suggestion in the light of my findings. I do so in the knowledge that P would be able to travel to this jurisdiction for work purposes. There was a level of dispute in this regard but P was clear (and I accept) that her employer has agreed she will be able to spend some time in the London office and this can be dovetailed with contact visits. I accept her evidence that she will retain a team here and will visit (as do other managers) on an occasional basis. This would be a significant force in favour of I travelling as well. I bear in mind I&#8217;s expressed wish to carry on seeing R. I do not consider I have an evidential basis for believing this is other than genuine on his part. I also accept there is at least a risk of I having competing wishes during holiday period which may conflict with seeing R but this could arise wherever he were located. The question is whether a combination of P&#8217;s commitment; bond to R and the reality of the mother planning the trip and travelling herself would counter these concerns.</span></p>

I note it would likely amount to contact every 8-9 weeks for periods of between 2-4 weeks. Taken over the course of the year, were 5 trips possible this might total some 12-13 weeks (or 25% of the year). Whilst this is significantly lower than that which would be expected were I in this jurisdiction it remains at a level which one would expect to maintain the father-son bond. I would expect interim periods to be filled with remote contact. I bear in mind the significant changes in this medium that have occurred in recent times and the familiarity of many children with contact by online video calls. I remind myself I is familiar with the same with respect to both his Mauritian and Australian families. Whilst I accept this is not the same as direct contact it is a very valuable form of contact to bridge periods of separation.</span></p>

He is not so open to co-operative coparenting as is P and at times appears to have favoured conflict over co-operation. I sense he has struggled to accept the circumstances in which the relationship ended. He needs to put this behind him and move on. He has the capacity to be a valuable contributor to I&#8217;s life. I have no doubt he can meet I&#8217;s needs for extended periods in his care. At this time I believe he would struggle to affectively co-parent with P to the level that I should be able to expect.

They are settled and deeply held and I am additionally concerned that the relationship between R and I will suffer in the fallout from a refusal. Whatever P may do to limit the impact I consider it likely I will blame his father and act accordingly. I note what happened in September but bear in mind that this would have the additional impact of being a final decision. I consider it realistic to predict a deterioration in the relationship based on resentment and blame.

She has continued to be positive and supportive but I am now considering the likely prospects over the future years of I&#8217;s minority. I consider there is a real likelihood that over time this will become increasingly difficult to bear and this will impact on P and thus on I. I consider that whilst she is able to remain engaged as a positive supporter of contact now this may become a harder proposition in the face of I&#8217;s response to refusal and in the light of her own significant disappointment at the decision.

It can be seen I have not found grounds for criticism of P despite wide ranging criticism levied by R. Whilst I have sought to take a moderate approach to enhance future parental engagement it is fair to say I have largely identified the challenges as coming from R. Whilst he accuses P of obstruction the reality is that it is R through his actions who has created instability in the relationship as separated parents. The Court regularly hears that separation is not itself a fundamental issue for children. The challenges arise when the parents fail to sensibly manage the relationship post-separation. It is when separated parents end up oppositional and all decisions become points of conflict that children become caught up in the conflict and damaged. Having listened to the evidence my sense has been of R finding areas of complaint in pretty much everything P does. I have been able to assess this objectively and have concluded he has lost sight of objectivity and I&#8217;s needs in an attempt to prove his case. I do not consider this is likely to change were I to refuse permission. This is likely to continue to impact on I in a significantly negative fashion.</span></p>

I endorse the proposal for a long visit at Christmas each year (rotating to include Christmas Day and to start just after Christmas). The proposal of around 32 days is a significant 5 week period for I and will have real annual meaning for him. There would then be a period of around 8-9 weeks before I sees his father at Easter for 2 weeks. This may well often synchronise with a post contract sabbatical for R and will enable quality time to include events which would not otherwise fit easily within a weekend schedule. The next visit will be in early July and could take place in Mauritius if R wished (otherwise in London). If it is Mauritius this will permit wider family contact. I note there is the potential for this to be 3 weeks duration. The next would be September/October for 2 weeks at least. I approve the suggestion of this being in Australia and I note this has the benefit of being associated with the period when R may well be on sabbatical. The gap between the July and September contact is just over 8 weeks. I note the gap between the Easter/July and October/Christmas gap is slightly longer and I agree there is both opportunity and available finances to permit R to undertake a second journey to Australia. This could well be up to 2 weeks bringing the potential annual time to almost 14 weeks.</span></p>

I judge it will also provide the parents some healthy distance which should permit them the space to rebuild their separated relationship. I judge this will fortify P and give her both the support and space to maintain her ongoing commitment to contact. In my judgment this is best placed to create a long term viable relationship through contact.</span></p>

He places real value on his relationship with I and he has the capacity to facilitate what is required of him under this plan. It appears to me he can make this work alongside his working commitments as there will be significant time between contacts when he can focus exclusively on his obligations thus permitting himself to be more accessible for I during visits. </span></p>

This has the attraction of appearing to preserve the status quo and permits more extensive contact. But I have questioned whether this would in fact materialise given the impact on I directly and medium term impact on P (and thus on I). Moreover, I consider it will maintain a likely continuing conflict which will colour I&#8217;s relationship and place unacceptable pressure on his home life.</span></p>

In doing so I note her final position was more balanced than matters first appeared in her written evidence. I have reached a different conclusion and in doing so note: (a) the somewhat dated nature of her report. Time and events have moved on considerably since that time; (b) I have the benefit of hearing the evidence and have reached conclusions on aspects of the case which Ms Taylor could not bring into her assessment. I have also made findings which conflict with some of the evidence given to her; (c) I have been able to undertake a far more child specific assessment. In contrast I found Ms Taylor&#8217;s assessment to be more general in nature. This is not to say I did not benefit from her evidence or her assessment. There were significant elements which can be found in my analysis.</span></p>

I will hand the decision down at 10am on 5 January 2024. Can I have any proposed corrections; requests for clarification and additional steps to anonymise the judgment (in addition to those contained within the anonymised version copied with this judgment) by 4pm on 4 January 2024. Can I have a draft order by the same time. If all matters are agreed then subject to their wishes I release the parties and counsel from attending the handing down. The hearing will in any event be held on a remote basis with a time estimate of no more than 30 minutes.</span></p>
