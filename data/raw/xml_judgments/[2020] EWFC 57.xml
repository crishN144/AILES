This would indeed be to reverse the burden of proof.  However, if the judge&#8217;s observations are understood to mean that account should not be taken, to whatever extent is appropriate in the individual case, of the lack of a history of injury from the carer of a young child, then I respectfully consider that they go too far. </p>

The absence of any history of a memorable event where such a history might be expected in the individual case may be very significant.  Perpetrators of child abuse often seek to cover up what they have done.  The reason why paediatricians may refer to the lack of a history is because individual and collective clinical experience teaches them that it is one of a number of indicators of how the injury may have occurred.  Medical and other professionals are entitled to rely upon such knowledge and experience in forming an opinion about the likely response of the individual child to the particular injury, and the court should not deter them from doing so.  The weight that is then given to any such opinion is of course a matter for the judge. </p>

While everyone knows that memory is fallible, I do not believe that the legal system has sufficiently absorbed the lessons of a century of psychological research into the nature of memory and the unreliability of eyewitness testimony. One of the most important lessons of such research is that in everyday life we are not aware of the extent to which our own and other people&#8217;s memories are unreliable and believe our  memories to be more faithful than they are. Two common (and related) errors  are to suppose: (1) that the stronger and more vivid is our feeling or experience of recollection, the more likely the recollection is to be accurate;  and (2) that the more confident another person is in their recollection, the more likely their recollection is to be accurate.&#8221; </p>

Is that the mark of a cautious man, whose statements are for that reason to be respected, or is he taking time to fabricate? Is the emphatic witness putting on an act to deceive me, or is he speaking from the fullness of his heart, knowing that he is right? Is he likely to be more truthful if he looks me straight in the face than if he casts his eyes on the ground perhaps from shyness or a natural timidity?

Still less does it follow that there is no value in oral evidence. But research confirms that people do not in fact generally rely on demeanour to detect deception but on the fact that liars are more likely to tell stories that are illogical, implausible, internally inconsistent and contain fewer details than persons telling the truth: see Minzner, "Detecting Lies Using Demeanor, Bias and Context" (2008) 29 Cardozo LR 2557.

However, the observations of Lord Hoffmann and Lady Hale, quoted at paragraph 12 above, make it clear that the same approach is to be applied to the identification of perpetrators as to any other factual issue in the case. This issue shows quite clearly that there is no necessary connection between the seriousness of an allegation and the improbability that it has taken place.

Sometimes it will desirable for the same reasons as those given above. It will help to identify the real risks to the child and the steps needed to protect him.

This is, as the President indicated, to set the bar far too high. It suggests that parents and other carers are expected to prove their innocence beyond reasonable doubt. If the evidence is not such as to establish responsibility on the balance of probabilities it should nevertheless be such as to establish whether there is a real possibility that a particular person was involved. When looking at how best to protect the child and provide for his future, the judge will have to consider the strength of that possibility as part of the overall circumstances of the case.&#8221; </p>

		      <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Drawing matters together, it can be seen that the concept of a pool of perpetrators seeks to strike a fair balance between the rights of the individual, including those of the child, and the importance of child protection. It is a means of satisfying the attributable threshold condition that only arises where the court is satisfied that there has been significant harm arising from (in shorthand) ill-treatment and where the only &#8216;unknown&#8217; is which of a number of persons is responsible. So, to state the obvious, the concept of the pool does not arise at all in the normal run of cases where the relevant allegation can be proved to the civil standard against an individual or individuals in the normal way. Nor does it arise where only one person could possibly be responsible. In that event, the allegation is either proved or it is not. There is no room for a finding of fact on the basis of &#8216;real possibility&#8217;, still less on the basis of suspicion. There is no such thing as a pool of one. </p>

		      <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.5in">It should also be emphasised that a decision to place a person within the pool of perpetrators is not a finding of fact in the conventional sense. As is made clear in Lancashire at [19], O and N at [27-28] and S-B at [43], the person is not a proven perpetrator but a possible perpetrator. That conclusion is then carried forward to the welfare stage, when the court will, as was said in S-B, &#8220;consider the strength of the possibility&#8221; that the person was involved as part of the overall circumstances of the case. At the same time it will, as Lord Nicholls put it in </p>

		      <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.5in">The concept of the pool of perpetrators should therefore, as was said in Lancashire, encroach only to the minimum extent necessary upon the general principles underpinning s.31(2). Centrally, it does not alter the general rule on the burden of proof. Where there are a number of people who might have caused the harm, it is for the local authority to show that in relation to each of them there is a real possibility that they did. No one can be placed into the pool unless that has been shown. This is why it is always misleading to refer to &#8216;exclusion from the pool&#8217;: see Re S-B at [43]. Approaching matters in that way risks, as Baroness Hale said, reversing the burden of proof. </p>

		      <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.5in">To guard against that risk, I would suggest that a change of language may be helpful. The court should first consider whether there is a &#8216;list&#8217; of people who had the opportunity to cause the injury. It should then consider whether it can identify the actual perpetrator on the balance of probability and should seek, but not strain, to do so: Re D (Children) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2009/472" uk:canonical="[2009] EWCA Civ 472" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] EWCA Civ 472</ref> at [12]. Only if it cannot identify the perpetrator to the civil standard of proof should it go on to ask in respect of those on the list: "Is there a likelihood or real possibility that A or B or C was the perpetrator or a perpetrator of the inflicted injuries?" Only if there is should A or B or C be placed into the &#8216;pool&#8217;. </p>

		      <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Likewise, it can be seen that the concept of a pool of perpetrators as a permissible means of satisfying the threshold was forged in cases concerning individuals who were &#8216;carers&#8217;. In Lancashire, the condition was interpreted to include non-parent carers. It was somewhat widened in North Yorkshire at [26] to include &#8216;people with access to the child&#8217; who might have caused injury. If that was an extension, it was a principled one. But at all events, the extension does not stretch to &#8220;anyone who had even a fleeting contact with the child in circumstances where there was the opportunity to cause injuries&#8221;: North Yorkshire at [25]. Nor does it extend to harm caused by someone outside the home or family unless it would have been reasonable to expect a parent to have prevented it: S-B at [40]. </p>

		    <content>
		      <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.5in">It should also be noted that in the leading cases there were two, three or four known individuals from whom any risk to the child must have come. The position of each individual was then investigated and compared. That is as it should be. To assess the likelihood of harm having been caused by A or B or C, one needs as much information as possible about each of them in order to make the decision about which if any of them should be placed in the pool. So, where there is an imbalance of information about some individuals in comparison to others, particular care may need to be taken to ensure that the imbalance does not distort the assessment of the possibilities. The same may be said where the list of individuals has been whittled down to a pool of one named individual alongside others who are not similarly identified. This may be unlikely, but the present case shows that it is not impossible. Here it must be shown that there genuinely is a pool of perpetrators and not just a pool of one by default.&#8221; </p>

It often relates to a mother who has covered up for a partner who has physically or sexually abused her child or, one who has failed to get medical help for her child in order to protect a partner, sometimes with tragic results. It is also a finding made in cases where continuing to live with a person (often in a toxic atmosphere, frequently marked with domestic violence) is having a serious and obvious deleterious effect on the children in the household. The harm, emotional rather than physical, can be equally significant and damaging to a child. </p>

As Aikens LJ observed in Re J, "nearly all parents will be imperfect in some way or another". Many households operate under considerable stress and men go to prison for serious crimes, including crimes of violence, and are allowed to return home by their long-suffering partners upon their release. That does not mean that for that reason alone, that parent has failed to protect her children in allowing her errant partner home, unless, by reason of one of the facts connected with his offending, or some other relevant behaviour on his part, those children are put at risk of suffering significant harm.&#8221; </p>

They show a variety of histological appearances that indicate that they most likely occurred at at least two different time points. Most of the anterior rib fractures show appearances that indicate that they occurred several hours before death and some fractures show features that indicate that they could have occurred either a few hours prior to death, at the time of death or, even after death due to attempted CPR (generally the amount of haemorrhage is small). Many of the posterior rib fractures show features that indicate that they occurred significantly earlier than the anterior rib fractures. Some of these fractures show an established tissue reaction that indicates that they occurred between 36hrs and 3 days prior to death.

Dr. Lockyer and Professor Al-Sarraj were both careful to restrict their opinions to their respective observations and examinations at the post-mortem and on the examination of the brain and of the spinal cord. Dr. Zeitlin, in providing the paediatric overview, felt able to offer a firmer overall opinion. I am immensely grateful to all of the expert medical witnesses for their reports and for their clear and helpful oral evidence. It was plain that in this complex case they had each given it earnest consideration and had reached measured and compelling conclusions. </p>

His long-standing addiction to cocaine cannot and is not condoned. I accept the mother never approved of his drug use and I accept that he almost invariably took cocaine at his mother&#8217;s home and not in the presence of the children. During the course of his evidence at the fact-finding hearing the father asserted that since May of this year he had stopped taking cocaine. </p>

A supervision order would have added nothing of value to the agreement of the parents to work co-operatively with the local authority under the terms of the Child in Need Plans: see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1(5)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>. </p>
