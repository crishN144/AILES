The child said she wanted to put the monster in a cage, but it was too big and angry, and it would not go in.  The name she attached to the monster is the forename of her father.  She said, &#8216;it was the scariest name she could think of&#8217; and her whole body began to tremble and shake.</span></p>

There is evidence which, on the face of it, is credible from Mr&#160;Ford describing the extent to which they are now settled in Alaska.  The father knew, almost from the moment when the children were removed, that he could take proceedings in Alaska under the Hague Convention, for he contacted the Child Abduction Unit here in London.  I have already referred in my previous judgment to the reason why he says he never took his application further forward;  namely, that he was told it would cost him &#163;20,000.</span></p>

I have not counted the number of sheets of paper, but they run probably to about 200 sheets printed on both sides.  In other words, there is very considerable material indeed on this file.</span></p>

The reason for that is that it seems to me that communications between an applicant in these circumstances and the Child Abduction Unit and, indeed, the contents of the Unit&#8217;s file must be governed by the same legal professional privilege as any other communications between a client and his or her solicitor. The Child Abduction Unit is located within the office of the Official Solicitor, who is, of course, himself a solicitor. </span></p>

It has been available during the course of this short hearing this morning for any light that it might throw on matters. But the father acts in person.  He has not waived the privilege, and it does not seem to me, in the end, that it would be right for me, or counsel for the mother, now to delve into that file, which I will return to the Child Abduction Unit unread.  If the father himself wishes to obtain all or any part of that file, it will be open to him to apply to the Child Abduction Unit, and I see no reason why they would not make available to him all parts of it to which he is entitled.</span></p>
