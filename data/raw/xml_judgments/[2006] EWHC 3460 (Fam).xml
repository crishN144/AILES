Those were proceedings (FD05P00944) relating to a woman of 32 called Pamela. I need not repeat the description of Pamela&#8217;s difficulties which I set out in my judgment, but as will be recalled Pamela lives in her own house, supported by a large round-the-clock care support team. Her package of care was, and is, more than usually complex.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At that time, the local authority, St Helens Borough Council, had indicated that it was proposing to commence proceedings under the inherent jurisdiction with a view to better regulating Pamela&#8217;s care and making &#8220;firm and stable plans&#8221; for her future. In the event the proceedings (FD05P01780) were begun by a Part 8 claim issued on 5 September 2005. The proceedings proved to be somewhat protracted and eventually came on for trial before me on 11 December 2006. In the event, and in circumstances in which everyone involved is to be congratulated for their sustained efforts and ultimate success in achieving the best for Pamela, I was invited to approve the terms of an order to which everyone was agreed.</p>

I was satisfied, in the light of all the evidence, and I granted a declaration to the effect, that Pamela lacks the capacity to make decisions about the organization, management and structure of her care package. The order sets out, in very considerable detail, the framework within which, and the principles by reference to which, her care package is to be organised and implemented.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As is well known the inherent jurisdiction was first exercised in relation to issues of surgical, medical and nursing treatment, a context where the doctrine of necessity as explained in <span style="font-style:italic">In re F (Mental Patient: Sterilisation) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1990] 2 AC 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1990">[1990] 2 AC 1</ref> is of crucial significance. In that kind of case, what the Family Division is doing when exercising the inherent declaratory jurisdiction in relation to an incompetent adult is to declare that something is lawful &#8211; lawful not because the court has given its consent but lawful, notwithstanding the absence of any valid consent, because and by virtue of the operation of the doctrine of necessity: see <span style="font-style:italic">Sheffield City Council v E </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2004/2808" uk:canonical="[2004] EWHC 2808 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWHC 2808 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] Fam 326" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] Fam 326</ref>, at para [97]. </p>

This is because the only justiciable issue in such a case is whether the person in question has capacity to marry.
