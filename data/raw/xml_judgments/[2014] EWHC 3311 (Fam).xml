	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">CH&#8217;s application &#8211; for permission to oppose the adoption application relating to her 8 month old daughter LRP &#8211; was listed on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October with a time estimate of one hour. Several important documents were filed at about 10.30 as I was about to begin my list which included four other cases. The two judgments from the care proceedings relating to CH&#8217;s two older children as well as LRP were not in the court bundle though had been supplied on the morning of 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October. The hearing occupied the greater part of the morning. Unusually, I heard oral evidence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">One of the reasons I did not give judgment at the end of the hearing was because a significant number of other litigants, some with commitments elsewhere during the afternoon, were waiting to be heard.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">An additional reason for adjourning before delivery of my judgment was because the application inevitably has, as Mr Squire suggests, &#8220;huge implications.&#8221; Either the adoption application will proceed unhindered towards final determination or it will become a dispute of considerable proportions. Whatever my decision, the impact upon CH as well as LRP&#8217;s prospective parents will be immense.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The grant of leave is a two stage process. The first question is whether there has been a change of circumstances. The change must be relevant or material to the questions of whether leave should be granted. It must be of a nature and degree sufficient to reopen consideration of the issue but the statute does not require that the change be significant. Whether or not there has been a relevant change in circumstances since the placement order must be a matter of fact for the good sense and sound judgment of the tribunal hearing the application (<span style="font-style:italic">Re P supra).</span></p>

It will be necessary to evaluate the parent&#8217;s ultimate prospects of success in opposing the adoption application. Are they more than just fanciful? Do they have solidity? In that connection, the judge must remember that the child&#8217;s welfare throughout her life is paramount. The judge will bear in mind events from the past, the current state of affairs and what will or may happen in the future. There will be cases where despite the change in circumstances, the demands of the child&#8217;s welfare are such as to lead the judge to the conclusion that the parent&#8217;s prospect of success lacks solidity (<span style="font-style:italic">Re W; Re H <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2014] 1 FLR 1266" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] 1 FLR 1266</ref>).</span></p>

He argues that CH is able to synthesise new thoughts, acknowledges the findings made against her and that decisions made in the past were appropriate. Mr Squire suggests there is a subtle and nuanced decision to be made and that I am now faced with a very different situation &#8211; a changed woman with a definite support system around her. In all the circumstances, submits Mr Squire, I can and should find there has been a change of solidity; that the mother is motivated in a way rarely seen; and that although it took her a long time until &#8220;the dam broke&#8221; she has finally understood how much of a danger RP is.</p>
