	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is a public document.  The hearing was held in public and no reporting restriction order has been made.  It was held to address the preliminary issue whether the proceedings issued by Mrs Briggs were properly brought under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/21" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 21</ref>A of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> (the MCA).  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That issue turns on the question whether the dispute about whether it is in the best interests of Mr Briggs for him to be given clinically assisted nutrition and hydration (CANH) is one that can properly be determined in proceedings brought under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/21" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 21</ref>A of the MCA.  The MoJ and the DoH (together the Secretary of State), the LAA and the Official Solicitor argue that it cannot and as a result Mrs Briggs is not eligible for non means tested funding through legal aid for representation in respect of that best interests issue.</p>

But it asserts that non means tested legal aid is (and has only been made) available  in respect of matters that &#8220;relate directly to the discharge or variation of the standard or urgent authorisation&#8221; and that providers should always apply for a separate certificate to carry out non means tested  services as and when these arise alongside a non means tested matter.

It would be very artificial and in my view callous to say that this was irrelevant to the issues relating to his physical liberty, or the termination of the exiting DOLS authorisation, because during the period after the cessation of the CANH leading up to his death his physical liberty would not change even if (as is at least likely) he moves from the hospital to a hospice.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">indicate the importance  of the distinctions between authorising a deprivation of liberty created  by a regime of treatment, support and care through the best interests test (applying s. 5 and 6 or s. 16) and the intention (per Baroness Ashton) that the MCA should lead to greater involvement in decision making by the person involved and ensure that what is decided is genuinely in the person&#8217;s best interests and that, as far as it can be, the decision  made is similar to that which the person would have made if they were able to.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.49in">And, in my view, these points indicate that it would be surprising if Parliament had considered that the issues to be taken into account by the COP should be different if the case came before it following a DOLS authorisation, or in a case in which such an authorisation could have been but was not given, or pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss. 4</ref>(A)(3) (the making of a welfare order)  or <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 4</ref>B (necessary for life sustaining treatment whilst a decision of the COP is sought).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Rather, it seems to me that these factors show  that Parliament would not have intended the COP to be concerned with the distinctions advanced in this case by the Secretary of State, the LAA and the Official Solicitor.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Absent the issue relating to the availability of non means test legal aid, which it is common ground is irrelevant, these distinctions are not agreed between them, give rise to fine, difficult and potentially emotionally draining issues (e.g. whether a decision that leaves out of account the views etc. of P on whether he should be detained at place A or place B relates to his personal liberty or a deprivation of his liberty within Article 5 having regard to its subjective element)  and are irrelevant because the COP can deal with all issues in this case in an application brought in reliance on <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/21" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 21</ref>A or an application brought seeking orders under ss. 15 and 16 of the MCA (see paragraphs 28 and 29 above).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">To my mind therefore the passages relied on by the Secretary of State support the view that Parliament intended that the best interests condition and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/21" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 21</ref>A should be applied in the way I have set out above rather that the limitations on their application urged by the Secretary of State, the LAA and the Official Solicitor.</p>
