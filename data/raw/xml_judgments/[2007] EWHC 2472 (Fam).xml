The value of the office suite was agreed to be &#163;300,000.00 with an equity of &#163;264,081.00.  The office suite was held in a pension fund and the parties agreed on a division of the equity on the basis that the husband would retain the pension and pay to the wife her half share of &#163;132,041.00.  On that basis, the wife was due to receive the sum of &#163;360,000.00, as to which there was a timetable for payment.</p>

If the husband did not receive a loan of &#163;900,000.00 from Northern Rock on or before 30 April, the property was to be sold forthwith on the open market, the husband having the conduct of the sale, including the appointment of appropriate estate agents and solicitors, the proceeds being applied to pay the wife her lump sum of &#163;360,000.00, with the balance to the husband.</p>

It appears that, in the period between mid-February and mid-April 2006 the husband, rapidly put in hand, some &#163;60,000.00 &#8211; worth of work, consisting of roof repairs, creation of a roof terrace and other works of redecoration, refinishing and cleaning, thus enabling  the property to be marketed in an attractive state.  Of the cost of the works effected, he paid out some &#163;12,000.00 to the workmen whom he  employed directly on the works, and postponed payment of some &#163;46,000.00 to main suppliers until the sale proceeds were available.  He also contracted in the sale to obtain and assign the benefit of the freehold of the property, a 3 year parking agreement at a local parking garage, and an indemnity in respect of roof repairs.</p>

It was in a shabby condition, as a result of both wear and tear and a leaking roof.  As a property professional, the husband did not consider the valuation realistic and obtained for himself two estate agents&#8217; market appraisals to establish whether he should go to the trouble and expense of commissioning his own valuation report.  Those two later appraisals, dated 25 October and 14 November 2005 respectively, were for &#163;1.2 million, (with offers expected in the &#8220;region of &#163;1.1 million&#8221;), and &#163;1.25 million (&#8220;to achieve a price of &#163;1.15 million&#8221;). </p>

Weighing against this however are a number of negative points, mainly: three story (sic) walk-up and no lift, no car parking, and the surrounding Council estate.  Purchasers in the higher price bracket do care about such matters.  Additionally you have a problem with the roof which, although it may cost &#8220;x&#8221; to repair, the reality is that most purchasers do not understand construction matters and will therefore attribute a figure of &#8220;x&#8221; times 2 or 3 as a discount on market price.&#8221;</p>

He kept the wife informed of what he was doing.  As soon as the roof had been put in order, and most of the work completed, he went to well-known agents in the area, Hurford Salvi and Carr, who on 24 March 2006, having discussed the marketing in their expert team, advised:</p>

The test is whether the appeal would be certain, or very likely, to succeed: see <span style="font-style:italic">Barder v Barder (Caluori intervening)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1987] 2 FLR 480" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1987">[1987] 2 FLR 480</ref> at 495.  That was a case in which, on very different facts, a husband who had entered into a consent order in full and final settlement of all claims between the parties following the break-up of the marriage, was permitted to appeal out of time on the basis of the changed circumstances arising from the suicide of the wife following her killing of the children.  The relevant passage from the judgment of Lord Brandon of Oakwell in the House of Lords reads as follows:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;A court may properly exercise its discretion to grant leave to appeal out of time from an order for financial provision or property transfer made after a divorce on the ground of new events, providing that certain conditions are satisfied.  The first condition is that new events have occurred since the making of the order which invalidates the basis, or fundamental assumption, from which the order was made, so that, if leave to appeal out of time were to be given, the appeal would be certain, or very likely, to succeed.  The second condition is that the new events should have occurred within a relatively short time of the order having been made.  While the length of time cannot be laid down precisely, I should regard it as extremely unlikely that it could be as much as a year, and that in most cases it would be no more than a few months.  The third condition is that the application for leave to appeal out of time should be made reasonably promptly in the circumstances of the case.  To these three conditions, which can be seen from the authorities as requiring to be satisfied, I would add a fourth, which it does not appear to has needed to be considered so far, but which it may be necessary to consider in future cases.  That fourth condition is that the grant of leave to appeal out of time should not prejudice third parties who have acquired, in good faith and for valuable consideration, interests in property which is the subject matter of the relevant order&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The leading authority governing applications of this kind relating to a change in asset value is the decision and comprehensive analysis of Hale J (as she then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">Cornick v Cornick</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1994] 2 FLR 530" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1994">[1994] 2 FLR 530</ref>.  The position in <span style="font-style:italic">Cornick</span> was that it was accepted on the facts that the change in value relied upon was unforeseeable, there having been a sudden and dramatic rise in the value of shares belonging to the husband and forming a substantial part of his assets.  In reviewing earlier decisions, Hale J pointed out that the principle which permits an order to be set aside because new events have occurred since the making of the order which invalidate the basis or fundamental assumption upon which it was made, is more akin to the doctrine of frustration than mistake.  She repeated the observation of Lord Brandon in <span style="font-style:italic">Barder</span> that it raises a difficult issue because it involves a conflict between two important legal principles, namely that it is the public interest that there should be finality to litigation on the one hand and that justice requires that cases be decided so far as practicable on the true facts and not on assumptions or estimates that are later shown to be erroneous.  Having reviewed the authorities, Hale J summarised  the position as to a sudden rise in asset value in this way:</p>

In that case, a final order had been made in November 1981 upon a valuation of the former matrimonial home (derelict at the time) of &#163;52,000.00.  The wife received an order of &#163;16,000.00, representing about a third of the assets under the &#8220;one-third rule&#8221; prevailing at the time.  Subsequently, unbeknown to the wife, the husband set about doing up the property and putting it on the market.  It subsequently sold in July 1982 for &#163;92,000.00 (a 78% increase in eight months).  The appeal was allowed on the basis that, in view of the substantial discrepancy between the valuation and the sale price of the matrimonial home, there had been a gross error and the judge had computed the lump sum order on a wholly erroneous basis which rendered it just and proper to re-open the matter.  Sir Roger Ormerod observed that, &#8220;where there is a gross discrepancy as it turns out between valuation and fact, this court should be prepared in a proper case to exercise its discretion to re-open the matter&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his skeleton argument Mr Ewins for the applicant put his case under three heads.  First under paragraph (2) of Hale J&#8217;s analysis in <span style="font-style:italic">Cornick</span> (see paragraph 15 above), namely that this is a case where a wrong value was ascribed to the asset at the hearing which, had it been known about at the time, would have led to a different order.  His argument is effectively put upon the basis of <span style="font-style:italic">res ipsa loquitur</span>.  The order was made on 3 February 2006 on the basis of a valuation of &#163;1.25 million; yet within seven weeks the husband had consulted estate agents and obtained advice to market the property at &#163;1.85 million with a view to achieving a sale price of &#163;1.5 million to &#163;1.6 million.  Mr Ewins accepted that the latter &#8220;valuation&#8221; was on the assumption that the husband&#8217;s programme of works was completed; however he submitted that the extent of the uplift of &#163;350,000.00 in such a short space of time plainly indicated a substantial mistake in valuation at the time of the consent order.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Upon the facts of the case as I have recounted them, I found that submission unconvincing.  Valuation, particularly in a rising market, is an inexact science and, in the case of a tired and poorly maintained property in a problematic location, much depends on the impression a discerning purchaser may receive of its potential.  On the other hand, if, prior to sale, that property is put into an &#8220;as new&#8221; or &#8220;walk in&#8221; condition, the price obtainable may increase well out of proportion to the costs of works of refurbishment.  The extract from the estate agents&#8217; letter set out at paragraph 10 above, makes clear that the property was not one which would be instantly attractive to a high price purchaser, either by reason of its situation or its then condition.  However, the property market was on the move, substantial and effective works were carried out by the husband to achieve a better price, and he also entered into obligations to obtain the freehold and improved facilities for the new owner such as a parking space.  In those circumstances, following questions from the court in argument, Mr Ewins conceded that the doctrine of <span style="font-style:italic">res ipsa loquitur</span> was not available and that he could not show any good reason to suppose that the valuation adopted by the parties and the court at the time of the consent order was wrong, let alone subject to some fundamental error.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following some correspondence about the figures generally and the amount of the work done, during which the wife&#8217;s solicitors received a copy of the husband&#8217;s application to Northern Rock, it appeared that the husband had in his application form asserted his income as being &#163;155,000.00 per annum, whereas the consent order had been agreed on the basis that he was earning &#163;50,000.00 net per annum.  Before me, that discrepancy has not been relied upon in support of the allegation of misrepresentation, it being unchallenged that the figures supplied to Northern Rock were &#8220;gross&#8221; income figures prior to deductions for expenses and tax from the husband&#8217;s business as a property developer.  However, that was not appreciated at the time and the wife&#8217;s solicitor wrote as follows:</p>

The Order was made on 3 February 2006 on the basis that the property was worth &#163;1.25 million but it was only around a month later, very much at the beginning of the renovation works, that the property went on the market for &#163;1.85 million.  Furthermore, I note from your client&#8217;s mortgage application form that he is asserting his income as being &#163;150,000.00 per annum.  If we had been aware of either of these facts it is most unlikely that I would have advised my client to accept the deal that was made.  It seems to me that the wrong figures were put before the court with the result that the division of assets was unfair and it is therefore reasonable for my client to seek to set aside the Order on any one or more of the following basis&#8217;s:</p>

Your client was unwilling to entertain discussion about making any improvement to the property prior to the sale.  My client wanted to take his time improving the property and his preferred option to facilitate this was to secure a re-mortgage of the property at &#163;900,000.00 from which he would pay your client the agreed lump sum of &#163;360,000.00 and clear his other outstanding debts, thus leaving him with time to deal with the refurbishment.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not consider that the evidence demonstrates such deliberate concealment on the part of the husband.  Certainly, it is clear from the evidence which I have set out that nothing which the husband said or did justified any assumption by the wife or her advisors that he <span style="font-style:italic">lacked</span> the intention to refurbish and enhance the purchase price of the property so far as he might be able.  Rather it shows that, in the event of a sale, the husband would if he could improve the condition of the flat whilst the wife <span style="font-style:italic">assumed</span> he was in no position financially to do so.  Much argument has been directed by Mr Ewins to demonstrate that the wife and her advisors acted reasonably in assuming that to be the position and that they were entitled to proceed on that basis because, on the figures, if the husband carried out his obligations under the consent order, he would lack any ready funds to carry out immediate works of refurbishment.  Upon that basis, they discounted the likelihood of any sale at a substantially enhanced value, preferring to secure the wife&#8217;s entitlement to a risk-free fixed sum with a deadline for its payment by the husband, thus leaving to him the burden and risk of later sale.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If it was indeed the fact that the husband always intended to carry out substantial refurbishment in the hope of improving his position, the highest it can be put is that, in failing so to inform his wife of such firm intention, he failed to fulfil the obligation of frankness required of parties to an ancillary relief application to disclose all those matters which go to the court&#8217;s task of fairly dividing the assets under s.23 of the <span style="font-style:italic">Matrimonial Causes Act</span>.  In such circumstances, if the court is satisfied that an element of bad faith or non-disclosure has been involved in relation to matters which were not foreseeable by reasonable anticipation or enquiry at the time the order was made, that may properly be treated by the court as the prism through which it should view the question whether the discrepancy between the valuation and the subsequent sale price achieved is so great that events have invalidated the fundamental assumption on which the original order was made.  However, such non-disclosure will not be sufficient if the event or events which have since occurred were foreseeable, or if the effects of the non-disclosure were avoidable by reasonable enquiry.</p>

Whether or not the case involved an element of non-disclosure on the part of the husband as to his immediate intentions, I do not consider that, on the evidence before me, the <span style="font-style:italic">Barder</span> requirements have been made out or that, on appeal, the wife is likely, let alone certain, to succeed.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is clear that the increase in the value of the property at the time of its sale was essentially the result of two factors, firstly an increase in the value of the property since it was valued in July 2005 as a result of the rising property market and, second, H&#8217;s refurbishment of the property which increased its value to an incoming buyer by far more than the costs of the refurbishment.  Whether or not these matters were foreseen, they were certainly foreseeable.  [I leave aside the undoubted additional attraction to a purchaser of a share in the freehold and a 3-year garage space]. As to the first factor, the rising property market was a matter of common knowledge.  As to the second factor, there is no reason to suppose that, if inquiry had been made of him, the husband would not have made clear his intention to refurbish prior to sale by use of direct labour in a project which, as an experienced property developer, he was in a position to manage personally, whilst deferring payment of such supplies as he could.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A significant element in the background to the negotiations was the desire of the wife for satisfaction of her claim after a delay of some years, thanks to litigation affecting the property as a result of claims made by the husband&#8217;s father.  Her desire was for speed and certainty in relation to the sum she was to receive.  This is apparent from the terms of the order itself.  The husband was to be given an opportunity to raise a mortgage on the property, failing which the property was to be sold and the wife was to receive her share in preference to the husband.  The order protected her from the &#8220;downside&#8221; of a sale at less than the valuation agreed.  To that extent the risk lay with the husband.  On the other hand, he was a property developer who, in the event of a failure to obtain the anticipated mortgage would naturally seek to take all the steps he could to secure a price on the sale required under the agreement which would improve his position.  Certainly, when he embarked on that course and told the wife of his intention following rejection of his mortgage application, she raised no objection and, at the time, made no assertion of entitlement to any share in a result which might yield the husband a larger amount than originally anticipated.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst I accept that the price obtained following refurbishment was plainly higher than any anticipated by the wife (and it may well be the husband) it was by no means inordinate given the value of the works effected by the husband, particularly if, as the wife was prepared to concede, a sum falls to be included for his own time and labour in directly managing the project.  This case yields figures which notably contrast with those in <span style="font-style:italic">Warren v Warren </span>where, due to the exceptional circumstances, the property had increased in value by 78%.   Mr Thorpe has submitted an HBOS house price calculation which suggests that, between July 2005 (the date of the agreed valuation) and May 2006 (the sale of the property) the actual increase in property prices over the period was some 11%.  If one adds &#163;90,000.00 for the costs of works and the value of the husband&#8217;s labour to the &#163;1.25 million valuation prior to calculation of the increase, the increase in the value of the property over the course of the year was some 19%.  On that basis, there was a &#8220;bonus&#8221; over reasonable market expectation of no more than 9%.  Mr Ewins has argued that these figures are too generous to the husband&#8217;s case and he may well be right; but not to an extent which substantially affects the issue in the round.</p>
