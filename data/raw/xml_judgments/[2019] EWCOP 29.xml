This makes absolutely no difference at all to MB or anybody else but it is a signal of the level of conflict which has existed throughout these proceedings. MB&#8217;s mother will not even agree with the doctors, even on the name of her son&#8217;s condition. </p>

There is no doubt MB is aware of the litigation and that its impact upon him has not been positive. It is not really the litigation, that is the problem. It is the level of conflict within the family which runs very deep and I suspect is probably intractable. </p>

This occurred because the mother considered it to be her responsibility to put MB&#8217;s interests before her other children. In order to focus on MB she considered it necessary for them to be placed in the care system. I am not going to comment on this, I do not know what distress she must have been in at the time. I record it as a fact simply because it signals, as clearly as anything could, her absolute devotion to MB. This has never abated. She has repeatedly and quite recently expressed the view that she would find life unbearable without MB. He, she says, is <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;her oxygen&#8217;</span>. By this she again signals how much she needs her son. That he needs her is self-evident. I note that in her detailed and careful judgment in July 2017 Her Honour Judge Hilder, concluded, upon the basis of expert opinion, MB and his mother were emotionally enmeshed. I am entirely clear that this remains the position. </p>

The maternal grandmother also lived there. It is clear that MB is a delightful and engaging young man who until his relatively recent decline, was able to display a mischievous sense of humour, a real ability to relate to people, notwithstanding his communication difficulties, and a diffident willingness to be teased, gently, by those who had come to know him well. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The admission to St Mary&#8217;s came about in consequence of a sepsis. Although as a child MB was able to attend school and to walk with the support of a frame, his decline has been progressive with worsening difficulties relating to swallowing, nutrition, and advancing weakness. It is a long time now since he was able to walk. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0in">The sepsis necessitating admission in December 2018 was originally thought to relate to a urine infection, or PEG site infection, but he suddenly suffered a sudden drop in haemoglobin levels early in his admission which may have been consequent on gastro-intestinal bleeding, but it caused a cardiac compromise that was very close to cardiac arrest. His general condition was such that he thereafter developed severe pneumonia to his left lung and he has remained either in the intensive care unit or the acute respiratory unit since. At present, he is on the intensive care unit. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.03in">34% weight change in a five-month period. His current weight is approximately 25kg, or around 4 stones. Self-evidently, he is properly described as emaciated. He has a very fragile skin tissue, which renders him vulnerable to infection, which in his situation could quickly become life-threatening. He also has severe loss of muscle, and as a consequence of his malnutrition he is vulnerable to further skin breakdown. In a detailed and helpful report prepared for this application, Dr Chris Lambert, a consultant in intensive care at St Mary&#8217;s Hospital, has noted that there are two suspected deep tissue pressure ulcers to MB&#8217;s sacrum. This has caused there to be a change to his sleeping arrangements. Dr Lambert told me in evidence that a new, pressure relieving mattress was brought in to provide better support on the specific recommendation of the tissue viability team. It is interesting and disturbing that MB&#8217;s mother disagreed with this provision, having taken an alternative view as to what is in her son&#8217;s interests. </p>

Not only does it provide an environment which is not conducive to meeting MB&#8217;s emotional needs, but it provides an arena in which professional confusion becomes more likely, as well as hesitation and procrastination about treatment.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">MB has very poor gut mobility. This is a facet of his condition. It has been lifelong, but as his recent decline in weight testifies, it has progressed. The poor gut mobility and consequent slow gastric evacuation has led to recurrent episodes of gastric reflux and aspiration of feed into the lungs. I pause to say that may have been associated with the sepsis leading to the admission, in December. His swallow is unsafe, and he has in order to address that, been provided with a percutaneous gastrostomy tube (PEG tube), to allow feeding directly into his stomach. Feeding directly to the duodenum was unsuccessful. So, he is currently on parenteral nutrition, which despite the efforts of his clinicians, has not been able to reverse his physical decline. </p>

It is manifest that those have been distressing to MB. His present arrangements i.e. intubation with an orotracheal tube have been described as distressing to him, both by his solicitor Ms Mackintosh QC (Hon), and Dr Lambert. He is unable to clear his lungs without direct suctioning through his tube, and has repeatedly deteriorated due to respiratory problems. He is just plainly very uncomfortable with this. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The lung problem is due to an absent cough, an absent gag, the diminishment of the respiratory muscles as a consequence of the malnutrition, a high secretion load, a recurrent gastro-oesophageal reflux due to the gut problems I have alluded to, a fragility in the upper airways tissues, and a significant decline in MB&#8217;s general posture such that his head is now almost permanently tilted upwards at a right angle. As Dr Lambert commented this is consequent upon the hyper-extension of the rear neck muscles. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Added to this is the progressive curvature of the spine, which affects his ability to breathe and to cough up his secretions. The consensus, from which there is no departure, is that MB&#8217;s needs in terms of his lung function and respiration can only properly be met by the insertion of the tracheostomy. There are clinical advantages to this in terms of his general ability to address the removal of secretions from the lung. It is thought that the tracheostomy will not be in itself essential for his breathing, and thus the immediate consequence more or less to MB is that he will achieve what Dr Lambert described to me as &#8216;liberation&#8217; from the mechanical ventilator. I think that term is carefully chosen, and accurate, for it permits, at least theoretically, the possibility that MB might return home. Certainly, it would secure his liberation from the intensive care unit. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">One of the few benefits of this corrosive and protracted litigation is that MB has had the benefit of an extremely experienced solicitor. Today, she gave evidence in order that I could get to know something of MB&#8217;s character and personality. It is plain to all that the years in which she has been representing her client have enabled her to communicate very effectively with him. She tells me that one of the effects of the orotracheal tube presently in place is that it actively inhibits MB&#8217;s already very limited capacity to communicate, in itself a very powerful indicator of its continued unsuitability. The tube is rigid. It simply doesn&#8217;t allow him to move his head, or his eyes, which is the primary way by which he communicates. MB&#8217;s head is almost permanently, as described to me, to one side.  </p>

There are very few negatives to it, particularly having regard to MB&#8217;s general situation as a whole, but the potential benefits, if successful, are striking. It is difficult to see how anybody could objectively recoil from such an opportunity. I am not entirely clear whether MB fully understood what was involved in that secondary procedure but I do accept from Ms Mackintosh that he showed no opposition. I can&#8217;t help but notice that it is perhaps not dissimilar to the position of his mother. In any event, I am entirely clear that he was able to communicate the response he intended to, and it was received by Ms Mackintosh. </p>

He said he wanted to eat meat. This also revealed, in my assessment, his continuing fortitude in the face of his condition, as he believes that will enable him to get stronger and better. </p>

The simple feeling of having clean teeth, and for his mouth to be cleaned, perhaps reflecting something of his continuing self-esteem. He also was clear that he wanted to see his Uncle Sam in particular and, his Aunty Amy. He appeared apprehensive about how his parents might react to this, for this extended family have been chest high in conflict for so long.  </p>

We are in early May, and he has been in hospital since December. I have no doubt his mother has visited regularly, but I think it may be tentatively encouraging that he has been prepared to put his head above the parapet of conflict and indicate he wishes to see his Uncle Sam. I am profoundly determined that he should do so and after the discussion with Mr Bagchi QC, I have decided to make a declaration to that effect. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">MB has needs which are plainly complex in every aspect of his daily life. He has had in recent years, and I am not entirely sure of the timescales, a succession of case managers. The desirability of continuity in his care is obvious. Not only in relation to the practicalities of the medical treatment, but because he is entitled to be afforded the best possible opportunity to communicate. I have the strong sense that even now, and at this stage, he has greater potential to communicate than is realised. This can be improved if there is continuity of case management at a senior level. It is also a fact that he did not have a lead clinician. Sometimes the courtroom can be an informative venue for treating clinicians, just as listening to treating clinicians is informative to the Court. I think Dr Lambert realised that there needed to be a clear framework of clinical continuity, just as there requires to be continuity in every aspect of MB&#8217;s welfare. Ms Rickard of counsel had a conference with her team over the luncheon adjournment and she told me that Dr Lambert, having thought about it, considered and I emphasise that the idea was generated from him, that he should act as the overall lead clinician, by which was meant he would consult with the clinicians on duty so that information was shared seamlessly from day to day and week to week. He would be the single point, and this I emphasise, for discussion with the family. He would feed back to them the information that came to him from the consultant on duty. Moreover, he emphasised, because he struck me as entirely sensitive to the needs of the family, that a single point of contact would likely make things easier for </p>

Any plan for his welfare has not merely to absorb this, but to place it at the centre of the process, because in the context of this life expectancy, the planning is, in truth, palliative. That has a direct impact upon what will be appropriate for him. </p>
