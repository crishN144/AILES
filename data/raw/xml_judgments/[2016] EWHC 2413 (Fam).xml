The concept operates in the expectation that, when a child gains a new habitual residence, he loses his old one.  Simple analogies are best: consider a see-saw.  As, probably quite quickly, he puts down those first roots which represent the requisite degree of integration in the environment of the new state, up probably come the child&#8217;s roots in that of the old state to the point at which he achieves the requisite de-integration (or, better, disengagement) from it.</span></p>

This discovery led her to leave the father after only 3 days. The mother and D only spent 7 days in total in Australia before flying back to England.</span></p>

The father said that it had been through &#8216;troubled times&#8217; but was at its most stable in 2016. I disagree with that description. In my view it was always an unstable relationship with deep problematic fault lines. Not only was it long-distance and with a history of break-ups but neither party trusted the other and the father certainly, as he accepts, was not open and honest with the mother. I find the mother&#8217;s description that the relationship was &#8220;turbulent&#8221; to be more accurate. I also accept that the state of the relationship caused her much stress and anguish. The state of the parties&#8217; relationship is clearly relevant to the question of integration. </span></p>

I accept there was a certain amount of pre-planning of the move but also find that there were not many plans about D&#8217;s day to day life in Australia. However I also accept that the mother was apprehensive about the move and unsure that the relationship would endure. I also accept her evidence that at the time she was taking time out to consider what she was going to do with her life. Her emails/messages at C43, C70, C73, C115, C223 and C224 support these conclusions. </span></p>

The father&#8217;s intention is less clear. Although he said he saw this as a permanent move; the report to the police on 12.04.16 [C84] and the letter from his then solicitors dated 13.04.16 [C93] suggest that he was contemplating a 3 month trip, at least in the first instance. In my view it is significant that the solicitor&#8217;s letter states that one of the purposes of the trip was &#8220;to explore the possibility of cohabiting.&#8221; In answer to a question from the court, the father accepted at one point that this was the case, which I find clearly confirms the mother&#8217;s case that this was a trial move. I do not accept that the mother left England with any intention of emigrating and certainly she had not made all the necessary plans to do so. I find that the mother left England in ambiguous circumstances. I do not find that there was any clear plan to move permanently. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">In any event, even if the intention was for a permanent move this was on the basis of the parties&#8217; relationship being based on trust and openness. The father admits he was in a sexual relationship with one of the four identified women up to February 2016 (i.e. after the date he says the parties&#8217; had agreed a move to Australia and started planning it) and he accepts that the mother did not know about this. The father&#8217;s denial that he had had recent sexual relationships with the other three women was, in my view, unconvincing although I do not make specific findings in this respect. He struggled to explain the content and tone of the email messages, some of which were suggestive and some intimate and explicit, that had been discovered on his computer. But in addition, the father also admits that an objective onlooker could reasonably conclude that the messages between him and at least two of the other four women indicated a sexual relationship. The father accepted that on any reckoning his personal life was &#8220;a very complicated one;&#8221; that &#8220;it was very difficult to balance the different female interests in his life&#8221; as &#8220;his decks were very crowded.&#8221; Another way of putting this is that the father&#8217;s personal relationships with these women involved a high level of deceit and dishonesty. My conclusion is that any agreement by the mother to move to Australia was based on a fundamentally flawed premise and therefore also vitiated by material non-disclosure and untruthfulness. If the mother had known the true state of affairs I am satisfied that in all likelihood she would not have moved to Australia with D even for a trial period. </span></p>

Its lease was held in the joint names of the father and F1 and the computer messages referred to above strongly indicate that F1 was unhappy with the mother living there, considered the property to be her home and that there was a plan discussed with the father whereby the mother would move out. Although the father denied this was the case he accepted that is how the messages read and also that F1 had keys to the property. In oral evidence the father also revealed for the first time that he had actually given up this tenancy and was shortly to move somewhere else apparently because the landlord had not done any work to the property for some time.</span></p>
