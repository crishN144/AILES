G&#8217;s parents have separated, she sees them separately each month for supervised contact.

He learned of G&#8217;s position initially via the allocated social worker. As candidly explained in the document statement filed on his behalf for this hearing, he has struggled with coming to terms with this information but has indicated he is supportive of G seeking the assistance she seeks. He attended this hearing in person as a litigant in person and repeated this position in eloquent terms. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0.03in">G is represented in these proceedings by Ms Stanley, through her Guardian Ms Julian. At the court&#8217;s direction, Ms Julian conducted an assessment of G. She concluded G is Gillick competent in matters relating to these proceedings. No issue has been taken with that assessment. Ms Stanley submits on G&#8217;s behalf the declaration is not needed, as the Local Authority can make the decision not to inform the mother of the referral and the likely therapeutic assistance under the existing provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/22/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 22(4)</ref>. This is because G is Gillick competent, her wishes have remained consistent that she does not want her mother to be informed and there is evidence to support the conclusion if she was informed G is likely to suffer psychological harm.  </p>

The precipitating event was when H telephoned the out of hours team to disclose that she was afraid to go home that evening as she feared what her mother would do, alleging that she had been slapped by her mother that morning and that she was regularly chastised with implements, such as a belt and a slipper. The evidence at the final hearing indicated such chastisement started in 2010. There followed a further referral in 2013, following which the case was closed and then the incident that precipitated the care proceedings being instigated took place.  </p>

He was referred to GIDS. P&#8217;s adoptive parents struggled to come to come to terms with P&#8217;s decision and the placement broke down. P moved to live with foster carers and did not want his adoptive parents to be involved in his new life or receive any information about him. Whilst P&#8217;s adoptive parents accepted his position, they sought quarterly updates in P&#8217;s life and welfare. P sought an order that prevented such information being shared with them and Keehan J concluded that the balance between P&#8217;s Article 8 rights fell decisively in favour of P&#8217;s strongly held wishes and feelings so that the order sought was in P&#8217;s best interests and made orders that authorised the local authority not to inform P&#8217;s adoptive parents in the way that they sought.

They would wish to explore the information that may or may not be provided through the therapeutic process. They consider that ultimately the mother will find out and so consideration will need to be given as to how this can best be managed. Thought will also need to be given to appropriate safety plans which need to be put in place having regard to the assessed risks. It should be said that the local authority agrees with the GIDS opinion that it is likely that [G&#8217;s] parents may, in due course, find out the information through their contact sessions, or because [G] has an ongoing relationship with her [sibling H]. It is the local authority&#8217;s hope that during the therapeutic stage of her work with GIDS [G] can be supported in feeling able to tell her parent&#8217;s in a planned way but this is something which is only likely to evolve over time and with support.&#8217; </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0.03in">Ms Stanley submits the Guardian considers that it is vital that G receives appropriate therapeutic intervention at this time without being fearful or anxious about her parents, and in particular her mother&#8217;s potential reaction. G needs to be assisted to recognise the likely need for her mother to know at some point about her gender identity given that it is likely that her mother will continue to play an important and regular role in her life. It is important that any steps taken before her mother learns about any matters concerning G&#8217;s gender identity do not make it more challenging for G to share this information with her mother in the longer term. </p>

In that case he made a declaration which would prevent the parents being given any information, including relating to medical intervention for the reasons he gave. In this case the declaration sought is limited to the therapeutic intervention, which is a matter, in my view, for the professional judgment of the local authority in considering whether <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;it is reasonably practicable&#8217;</span> to ascertain the wishes and feelings of the mother in this case. </p>
