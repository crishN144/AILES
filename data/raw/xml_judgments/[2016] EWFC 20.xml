The Local Authority subsequently made applications for care orders in respect of all three children and on the 8 and 9 December I heard evidence at a fact finding hearing where I indicated my general findings, but reserved Judgment until this hearing today.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At this hearing the Local Authority seeks final care orders in respect of all three children. They are currently placed with the maternal grandparents where they have been since the 6 August of last year.  The Children&#8217;s Guardian supports those orders, being satisfied that the placement is meeting the children&#8217;s needs and meets the risks identified in this case.  The mother now, to her credit, does not oppose the children remaining with the maternal grandparents under the auspices of a care order, but understandably cannot bring herself to consent to the same.  She does not seek any specific orders in relation to contact.</p>

He was however acquitted of that charge following a trial at the Old Bailey. The father, DT, is believed to have left this jurisdiction in March 2013.

The mother&#8217;s initial account was that she and the children were taking a holiday to see their father in Munich from where they were to travel to France.  Information however located in the mother&#8217;s luggage showed an itinerary which contradicted this and showed onward travel from Munich to Istanbul where she had booked three nights&#8217; accommodation with the children and her husband. </p>

An initial examination of the mother&#8217;s mobile phone provided the police with sufficient evidence to arrest her with one message reading, &#8220;Are you going for good?&#8221;. The phone also contained images of children with firearms, and wearing balaclavas, bearing the emblem of &#8220;Islamic State of Iraq&#8221; and the emblem commonly known as &#8220;ISIS&#8221;.  </p>

The mother had destroyed or disposed of many items relating to the children, but she had with her their birth certificates and her marriage certificate.  She had made plans to sell her car to her brother. </p>

Those devices, along with the mother&#8217;s mobile phone, were examined. The results of those examinations indicated that the mother had been in conversation with a large number of people known to be linked to Islamic State.

As I indicated at the conclusion of that hearing I found that the mother was lying throughout almost the entirety of her evidence. I was left in no doubt that the mother intended to travel to Syria with or without the father. The mother had been in contact with Jihadists, in particular SAJ, solely for the purposes of going to Syria. I found that it was plain that if the mother had succeeded in her attempts to enter Syria, and in particular to join Islamic State, the children would have been put at extreme risk of very, very significant harm, if not death.  She had been provided with funds by persons unknown. I concluded that I was bound to draw the inference that the money found in the mother&#8217;s possession had come from Jihadist supporters.</p>

That is an entirely understandable wish but one which the Court cannot accede to. The Court has to take into account - their overall welfare best interests.  I am satisfied at the moment they would be at risk of harm were they to return to their mother&#8217;s care and accordingly I am satisfied that it is appropriate for me to make care orders in respect of each of the three children in favour of the Local Authority.</p>
