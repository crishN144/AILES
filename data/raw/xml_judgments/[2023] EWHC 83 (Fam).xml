The father is aged 44, also of Nigerian origin and has lived in Ireland since 2007. The parties commenced a relationship and began cohabiting from 2011. Their son J was born on 11 February 2012 and their daughter E on 5 March 2014. Both children were born in Ireland. The relationship was greatly turbulent and the dysfunction was not limited to the parents. According to the father, the maternal grandparents have evinced great hostility towards him at all material times, and have even assaulted him on occasions.</p>

The mother says that their date of separation was August 2020. The father says that the mother made his contact with the children difficult after their separation. Therefore, he applied to the Irish court for contact, which was granted in an order made on 22 June 2022, and which provided that he was to see the children every Saturday for 6 hours. The court further ordered that the mother was not to remove the children from the jurisdiction and granted the father joint guardianship of the children. The matter was adjourned for a further hearing on 8 September 2022.</p>

She confirmed that if a return order were made that she would accompany the children back to Ireland.

In stark contrast to her stance before Morgan J it is now the mother&#8217;s position that she cannot return to Ireland and that if a summary return of the children is directed, she will remain in England. The mother has relinquished her housing in Ireland and claims she has no means of supporting herself or the children were she to return. In relation to the children&#8217;s objection to a return to Ireland, the mother relies on the Cafcass report, which she says records an authentic objection to a return by both children expressed with an appropriate degree of maturity.</p>

As for housing, the father has suggested that if accommodation were not provided by the state the maternal grandfather&#8217;s or maternal aunt&#8217;s properties would meet the children&#8217;s basic housing needs in the short term. Ms Ramadhan submitted that the former would be quite untenable. Her brother who is a heavy smoker lives at her father&#8217;s property. She has a distant relationship with her father. Her sister lives in her partner&#8217;s property, a one-bedroom flat. That too would be quite untenable as a solution to meet the housing needs of mother and children.</p>

So unless the material available to the court at the hearing of the application for an interlocutory injunction fails to disclose that the plaintiff has any real prospect of succeeding in his claim for a permanent injunction at the trial, the court should go on to consider whether the balance of convenience lies in favour of granting or refusing the interlocutory relief that is sought.&#8221;</p>

In his opinion, such a rule would stultify the purpose of the power to award an injunction and clog the discretion to do so.

Although Lord Diplock does not put a figure on it I expect that he would have said that a probability of no less than 25% would be needed to satisfy this standard. If so satisfied the next step is to ask if damages would be an adequate remedy for the applicant should it succeed (in which case the injunction should be refused) or if damages would be sufficient recompense to the respondent if the injunction was later discharged at trial (in which case it should be granted).

As to what&#160;degree of likelihood makes the prospects of success &#8220;sufficiently favourable&#8221;, the general approach should be that courts will be exceedingly slow to make interim restraint orders where the applicant has not satisfied the court he will probably (&#8220;more likely than not&#8221;) succeed at the trial. In general, that should be the threshold an applicant must cross before the court embarks on exercising its discretion, duly taking into account the relevant jurisprudence on article 10 and any countervailing Convention rights. But there will be cases where it is necessary for a court to depart from this general approach and a lesser degree of likelihood will suffice as a prerequisite. Circumstances where this may be so include those mentioned above: where the potential adverse consequences of disclosure are particularly grave, or where a short-lived injunction is needed to enable the court to hear and give proper consideration to an application for interim relief pending the trial or any relevant appeal.</p>

Past facts must be proved to have happened on the balance of probabilities, that is, that it is more likely than not that they did happen. Predictions about future facts need only be based upon a degree of likelihood that they will happen which is sufficient to justify preventive action. This will depend upon the nature and gravity of the harm: a lesser degree of likelihood that the child will be killed will justify immediate preventive action than the degree of likelihood that the child will not be sent to school.&#8221;</p>

The former is not, because to embark on such an exercise when determining a case under Article 13 (b) would encroach "on both the summary aspect of the jurisdiction, and on the welfare jurisdiction of the requesting state, and which can be a difficult exercise on balanced written evidence if the parties are not heard orally." The latter is a fact-finding exercise and one in respect of an issue which, Mr Setright submitted, goes to the "heart of the case" when consent is relied upon.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This passage highlights the fundamental distinction between the two exceptions. The exception of consent requires proof of past facts, whereas the Article 13 (1)(b) exception requires the making of a prediction about the likelihood of a future event. However, each requires the court to make a probabilistic assessment, in the former case as to whether past events have happened and in the latter as to whether future events will happen. As explained above, an essential difference between the two processes, is the standard of proof required to reach the decision. But, as I have sought to suggest above, in almost all Article 13(1)(b) cases the standard of proof required for the prediction should be the normal civil standard. Further, when making the prediction, the court in almost every case will have to make some findings about past events,  since, as Lord Byron put it, "the best prophet of the future is the past". </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So, under the Article 13(1)(b) exception the court will usually be undertaking an exercise of finding both past and future facts. The passage I have cited above says that such a fact-finding exercise is either impossible or, if possible, very difficult. I do not understand this. Plainly, if the protective measures sought do not nullify the risk, or if protective measures cannot be imposed, the court is going to have to conduct a form of fact-finding exercise about the past events on the written evidence, amplified by written and oral submissions, as best it can. Were it to be suggested that in the absence of functioning protective measures the court should simply assume that the allegations pleaded in support of the exception by Parent X are true and then go on to refuse the application, then I would say that such an approach would be unlawful. This is because the burden is on Parent X to satisfy the court that it is more likely than not that if the child is returned he will have to endure an intolerable peril. That decision can surely only lawfully be made by weighing the evidence of both parents.</p>

FPR 22.6(2) in effect removes the right to give oral evidence-in-chief as in all cases a witness (other than a summoned witness) will have been required to provide a witness statement, which will stand as evidence-in-chief. Oral evidence-in-chief now requires the permission of the judge be given. FPR 22.11 provides the right to cross-examine a witness on his or her witness statement. Thus, the general rule is that facts in issue are to be proved by written evidence-in-chief and oral evidence given under cross-examination. Of course, facts may also be proved by hearsay evidence pursuant to the Civil Evidence Act 1998 and FPR 23.2 &#8211; 23.5, but the general rule is that oral evidence given under cross-examination is the gold standard.</p>

It commands, not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination. The Clause thus reflects a judgment, not only about the desirability of reliable evidence (a point on which there could be little dissent), but about how reliability can best be determined. Cf. 3 Blackstone, Commentaries, at 373 ("This open examination of witnesses . . . is much more conducive to the clearing up of truth"); M.

This does not mean that oral testimony serves no useful purpose &#8211; though its utility is often disproportionate to its length. But its value lies largely, as I see it, in the opportunity which cross-examination affords to subject the documentary record to critical scrutiny and to gauge the personality, motivations and working practices of a witness, rather than in testimony of what the witness recalls of particular conversations and events. Above all, it is important to avoid the fallacy of supposing that, because a witness has confidence in his or her recollection and is honest, evidence based on that recollection provides any reliable guide to the truth."</p>

To be frank, cross-examination is often a largely pointless and futile exercise if it amounts to little more than counsel putting disputed facts to a witness.

There is what is sometimes called the &#8220;gateway stage&#8221; and the discretion stage. The gateway stage has two parts in that it has to be established that (a) the child objects to being returned and (b) the child has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of his or her views. If the gateway elements are not established, the court is bound to return the child in accordance with Article 12. If the gateway elements are established, the court may return him or her but is not obliged so to do. This approach has not been challenged before us.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;In child's <span class="normaltextrun" style="color:#00000A">objections</span> cases, the range of considerations may be even wider than those in the other exceptions. The exception itself is brought into play when only two conditions are met: first, that the child herself objects to being returned and second, that she has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of her views. These days, and especially in the light of article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, courts increasingly consider it appropriate to take account of a child's views. Taking account does not mean that those views are always determinative or even presumptively so. Once the discretion comes into play, the court may have to consider the nature and strength of the child's objections, the extent to which they are "authentically her own" or the product of the influence of the abducting parent, the extent to which they coincide or are at odds with other considerations which are relevant to her welfare, as well as the general Convention considerations referred to earlier. The older the child, the greater the weight that her objections are likely to carry. But that is far from saying that the child's objections should only prevail in the most exceptional circumstances.&#8221;</p>

The mother&#8217;s primary argument is that the likelihood of an intolerable peril to the children arises principally because of her change of mind about her willingness to accompany them if a return was ordered. The court is always extremely hostile to having a gun held to its head and sceptical of forensically self-generated facts which are claimed to meet the legal test. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Let me be clear. All of the supposed grave risk of intolerable peril is a result of the mother&#8217;s unlawful and wrongful conduct. It would be a remarkable example of the triumph of injustice over justice, of wrong over right, if a mother could clandestinely relinquish her housing, pluck the children out of school, remove them to England in breach of a court order and then state that she will not accompany if they are returned, thereby enabling her to present them to this court as prospectively abandoned, homeless, unschooled and destitute with the result that a return order is refused on that basis.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Where assertions of grave risk based on economic or developmental disadvantages upon the return of the child are made, the analysis should focus on whether the basic needs of the child can be met in the State of habitual residence. The court is not to embark on a comparison between the living conditions that each parent (or each State) may offer. This may be relevant in a subsequent custody case but has no relevance to an Article 13(1)(b) analysis. More modest living conditions and / or more limited developmental support in the State of habitual residence are therefore not sufficient to establish the grave risk exception. If the taking parent claims to be unable to return with the child to the State of habitual residence because of their difficult or untenable economic situation, e.g., because his / her living standard would be lower, he / she is unable to find employment in that State, or is otherwise in dire circumstances, this will usually not be sufficient to issue a non-return order.&#8221;</p>

On the contrary, I am satisfied that they would not be either thus exposed or thus placed. I do not therefore need to weigh the parties&#8217; respective cases to evaluate the mother&#8217;s prospects of success of proving the exception as her case taken alone comes nowhere near doing so.</p>

The fact that E is aware that her mother&#8217;s stance is that she will not return with them should a return order be made is very telling. This factor significantly reduces the weight of the children&#8217;s objections. But even if that factor were not present I would not exercise my discretion in favour of a refusal to order their return. The life experience of children of this age is largely one of enforced submission to decisions taken by adults in their best interests, whether they like those decisions or not. Adults decide where they live, where they go to school, who their friends are, where they go on holiday, what they eat, what they wear and how they are allowed to entertain themselves. So if the court decides that they should be returned to their place of habitual residence for decisions about their home to be made there, they would naturally expect that to be yet another decision about their lives which they would have to accept, again, whether they liked it or not.</p>

That decision reverses the mother&#8217;s wrongful and unlawful conduct and puts her back in the position from where she must approach the question of relocation lawfully and responsibly namely by making an application to the Irish court.</p>
