Already, in proceedings in these courts, whose jurisdiction is anyway challenged, they have run up costs of very nearly &#163;1.3m. They are also currently litigating in State A.  </p>

After a without notice freezing order was initially made on the papers on 2 October 2020 by DDJ Hodson, the matter then came before him on return dates on 8 and 15 October. A without notice non-molestation order was then made on 3 November 2020 but discharged on 4 November on procedural grounds &#8211; a discharge against which the wife appealed. A further order staying the suit was then made by DDJ Hodson on paper on 9 November. On 17 November, Holman J listed the husband&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">Hemain </span>application for hearing. On 23 November, the parties gave cross-undertakings in relation to further injunctive proceedings. On 1 December 2020, I made a consensual order comprising an <span style="font-style:italic">Hemain </span>injunction. On 7 December HHJ Roberts made a further order seeking to regulate the financial arrangements between the parties, and discharging the extant non-molestation applications on the grounds of crossundertakings. The interim financial arrangements were not compromised and listed before Moor J on 16 December. </p>

Amongst other directions he determined that the husband was to provide a letter setting out the basis upon which the rental valuation evidence for the former matrimonial home which he had submitted was obtained, and the nature of the instruction given to the lettings manager who provided it. On the 21 December 2020, DJ Barrie dealt with the Children Act proceedings between the parties, but declined to make any order for contact between the children and their father.  </p>

Her case is that the parties have lived off capital during the marriage. If that has been so, it has evidently been to a very significant extent. However, she does not urge any pressing need of her own as a counter-balance to the husband&#8217;s claims.

She rejects the document which, without permission of the court, or even purported compliance with Pt. 25, the husband seeks to adduce. It is clear that that letter has not been produced in a way that complies with any of the requirements of FPR 2010 Pt. 25, so the weight that I can attach to it must be very limited indeed. In those circumstances, I place far more reliance on the property particulars I have from each party and in relation to the former matrimonial home as comparators, as opposed to the contents of the letter, for the purposes of this interim adjudication.

One, for example, was being actively marketed by its owner, and had been reduced in price on the basis that regular viewings would be accommodated. I am satisfied, however, that with a budget of &#163;2,500pw, or &#163;11,000pcm, the husband can find entirely appropriate accommodation in the area of London where all of the parties&#8217; particulars are to be found. </p>

None of this is currently required, and whilst some provision may become appropriate in due course, it is quite impossible to anticipate with precision when that might be.

In addition, the wife should provide as required for the husband&#8217;s rental deposit, which payment should be on account of his eventual entitlement in these proceedings. I have not backdated the order as the payments for living expenses made to date will have been sufficient in a period of lockdown; and I have not been told what the actual rent payments which the husband has been making have been. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0.04in">This relates both to historic and prospective costs and is a factor which I must bear in mind here, just as I do in relation to the question of interim provision, as there are currently in issue substantive jurisdictional arguments between the parties both in relation to the suit, and in relation to jurisdiction under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. Indeed, it is to fund the husband to engage in those arguments, as well as interim issues in relation to the children, that this application is substantively focussed; it being agreed that the costs of any subsequent financial proceedings cannot fairly be awarded now, before questions of jurisdiction have been determined. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.64in;margin-right:0.04in">I also remind myself again that one of the issues within those financial proceedings, if they take place in this jurisdiction, is that the wife asserts the existence and validity of a post-nuptial agreement effected in State A, by which she says that the husband disavowed the making of any claims against her in the event of divorce. I cannot judge the force of those arguments now, but do keep in mind that if the husband in the event receives only an attenuated award, full recovery of the amount of any LSO provision may not be practicable if the basis of the award is predicated only upon need, however assessed. </p>

So that produces a total of &#163;705,944, run up since their involvement in these proceedings from mid-October 2020. This may be compared to the overall figure of &#163;589,672 claimed by the husband as the full amount of historic costs owing to his solicitors. Whilst I do not have sufficient information to make an exact comparison, it is clear that the husband&#8217;s costs expenditure has not been by any measure disproportionate when compared to that by the wife, and I will approach CRS&#8217;s costs schedule on that basis.</span></p>

This is to be on the basis that a loan will be taken against the security of the family home in the total amount of &#163;1.5m &#8211; which Mrs Carew Pole acknowledged could be extended,  and from which each party would take their costs on a pound for pound basis. </span></p>

I do not know from where she has already paid &#163;465,944 to her solicitors. I am aware that there is a second property next door to the family, in her name, which the wife says she holds for her brother. If she has no interest in that property, then security in this jurisdiction for the court&#8217;s eventual award, if jurisdiction is established, may be limited. This would risk the same prejudice that was identified by Moylan J in </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#212121">BD v FD (Maintenance)</span><span style="color:#212121"> at paragraph 40 (set out at [8] above).

Firstly, in relation to the historic costs, I do not consider it reasonable that the wife make no contribution whatsoever to the outstanding amount, currently a little over &#163;394,000, to CRS, although I will make no award in relation to the costs outstanding to the husband&#8217;s former solicitors. I am not satisfied that the discharge of those latter costs is reasonably required to enable him to obtain appropriate legal services. I also bear in mind that by the time this interim application was made in mid-December 2020, the costs bill with CRS had already reached a significant &#163;291,781, and I am not persuaded that all or even the majority of that amount need now be discharged to achieve a fair balance between the parties.  </p>

I am satisfied that that amount, coupled with adequate provision going forward, will be sufficient to enable their continued representation of their client without undue tension in the relationship, and would therefore be reasonable, and appropriate to procure legal services for the husband. </p>

This is made up as to &#163;300,000 in relation to the divorce jurisdiction proceedings, &#163;400,000 in relation to the children proceedings, to include any collateral criminal hearings, and &#163;50,000 in respect of the proposed mediation.
