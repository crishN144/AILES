They are nationals of the Russian Federation and married there in 2002. In 2012 they were living in London. The marriage, of which there are no children, had broken down. On 29 March 2012, and again on 30 April 2012, they attended at the Consulate of the Russian Federation in London and there went through the formalities for divorce required by the law of the Russian Federation. </p>

The document reads in material part as follows (there are slight differences, none material, between the translations of the two documents; I set out the translation of the husband&#8217;s document, any differences in the translation of the wife&#8217;s document are shown in { &#8230; }:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is no doubt that, by the time they left the Consulate on 30 April 2012 in possession of these documents, the husband and the wife had been divorced in accordance with the law of the Russian Federation. The question I have to determine is whether that divorce is recognised under the law of England and Wales. In my judgment, it is not. So far as concerns both England and Wales (and indeed, as we shall see, the entire United Kingdom) they remain married.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The wife has since remarried, in the United State of America. She remains in the United Kingdom with her new husband on a spousal visa. So it would seem that the United Kingdom immigration authorities at that stage accepted the validity of the divorce. Subsequently, however, when the husband sought to marry his fianc&#233;e here, the authorities took the point that the divorce was not recognised (see a letter from the General Register Office dated 15 May 2013). She has, in consequence, had to leave the country, at least temporarily.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 12 September 2013 (the application was not formally issued until 7 November 2013) the husband applied for a declaration of marital status. The application was served on the Attorney General in accordance with FPR 2010, rule 8.21 by letter dated 17 September 2013. On 1 October 2013 the Treasury Solicitor wrote confirming that the Attorney General did not intend to intervene. </p>

He adjourned it for hearing before me on 13 November 2013. The husband was represented by Mr Matthew Long and the wife by Mr Christian Kenny, who made common cause in seeking to persuade me that the divorce ought to be recognised. As had previously been indicated, the Attorney General did not appear and was not represented. </p>

I adjourned the hearing so as to enable the parties, if they wished, to adduce further evidence. I indicated that, if they were content (as they were), I would consider any additional material without the need for a further hearing. I subsequently received a witness statement of the husband and further written submissions from Mr Long to supplement those he had put before me previously. </p>

The evidence was in the form of an expert&#8217;s report, dated 11 September 2013 and written in English, by Dr Ekaterina Kalashnikova. She describes herself as a Doctor of Law and a barrister, having been a member of and practising at the Moscow Bar since 2000. She deposes to being familiar with the practices of divorce in Russia and (as her report bears out) fluent in both spoken and written English. Her report is, if I may say, very clear.</p>

A paper and electronic record of what occurs in the Consulate is kept there. The Consulate, however, regularly sends its records to a central archive in Moscow. The husband&#8217;s mother was able to obtain from the Archive and Information Department of the Civil Registry Office Directorate of Moscow City on 19 November 2013 a &#8216;Certificate of Dissolution of Marriage&#8217; showing that the documents in the present case had been received from the Consulate in London on 28 March 2013.</p>

The expert evidence, from Dr Mujahid M Al-Sawwaf and Mr Ian Edge (see paras 9-10), was that, although, as a matter of modern administrative practice in Saudi Arabia, divorcing husbands usually went to a court to register their divorce, there was no legal requirement to register a divorce in order for it to be valid and effective in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

The question argued was whether or not the talaq was an &#8216;overseas divorce&#8217; within the meaning of s 45(1). I held (paras 35-36) that the talaq quite plainly was not &#8220;obtained in a country outside the British Islands&#8221;.

What the deputy judge was surely doing, and, if I may respectfully say so, correctly doing, was to identify the particular aspect of the relevant foreign system which was crucial to the characterisation of what had happened in the case before him as &#8220;proceedings&#8221; within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/46/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 46(1)</ref>. The judge&#8217;s handy aphorism, &#8220;no registration, no divorce&#8221;, was not simply a description of the kyogi rikon. It was an essential element in demonstrating that there had indeed been &#8220;proceedings&#8221; in <span style="font-style:italic">that </span>particular case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">With the second sentence of that I have absolutely no quarrel. The evidence before me on the point was indeed materially different. I would not, however, describe my observations on the point as obiter dictum. They were part of my reasoning. What needs to be borne in mind, however, is that the point before me was <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>the point before Judge Horowitz. In <span style="font-style:italic">Sulaiman v Juffali </span>the question was whether the divorce, whether it was a &#8216;proceedings&#8217; or a &#8216;non-proceedings&#8217; divorce, had been &#8220;obtained in&#8221; a foreign country, given that the talaq had been pronounced in this country. In both <span style="font-style:italic">H v H </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">H v S</span>, where all the steps said to constitute the divorce had undoubtedly occurred in the foreign country, the question was whether those steps amounted to &#8220;proceedings&#8221; within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/46/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 46(1)</ref> and 54(1).</p>

I am therefore here concerned with a &#8216;proceedings&#8217;, not a &#8216;non-proceedings&#8217; divorce. There is also no doubt that the divorce was &#8220;obtained&#8221; in accordance with the law and process of the Russian Federation. The critical question however, as I have said, is <span style="font-style:italic">where</span> it was &#8220;obtained.&#8221; Was it &#8220;obtained in&#8221; the Russian Federation, in which case, as Mr Long and Mr Kenny submit, it is entitled to recognition in accordance with section 45(1)(a)? Or was it &#8220;obtained in&#8221; this country?</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Long and Mr Kenny seek to avoid this by submitting that the divorce was &#8220;obtained&#8221; in what Mr Long calls &#8220;Russia&#8217;s centralised bureaucratic system&#8221;, the Consulate merely providing a certificate to record this and acting as &#8220;the administrative conduit&#8221; by which registration was received. The divorce, he says, was obtained from &#8220;the state of Russia&#8221;, if not on 30 April 2012 then on 28 March 2013 when the documents were received in Moscow. They seek to distinguish <span style="font-style:italic">Sulaiman v Juffali </span>on various grounds having to do with the very different divorce process involved in that case compared with the process in the present case. Despite their best endeavours, however, none of this, correct though it may be, takes them anywhere. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Of course, the divorce was obtained from the Russian Federation by an administrative process of the Russian bureaucracy. But that is not the point. In the final analysis the matter comes down to two questions: When was the divorce obtained? Where was it obtained? In the light of Dr Kalashnikova&#8217;s evidence there can be only one answer to the first question: the divorce was obtained on 30 April 2012 when the Divorce Certificate was handed to the parties, not on 28 March 2013 when the documents were transmitted to Moscow. Given this, the answer to the second question &#8211; a matter to be determined ultimately by English law &#8211; is equally clear: given the rule in <span style="font-style:italic">Radwan v Radwan </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1973] Fam 24" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1973">[1973] Fam 24</ref>, the events of 30 April 2012 which culminated in the legal dissolution of the parties&#8217; marriage that day, all took place in London, albeit in the Russian Consulate, and not in Russia. It follows that the divorce was &#8220;obtained&#8221; in London and therefore cannot be recognised.</p>

I acknowledge all that, but there is no room for any discretion. If, in a case such as this, a divorce does not fall within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/46" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 46</ref> it cannot be recognised &#8211; see the mandatory language of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/44/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 44(1)</ref> and the words &#8220;if, and only if&#8221; in section 45(1)(a).</p>
