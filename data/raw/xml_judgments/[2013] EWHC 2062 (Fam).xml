Proceedings were commenced on 4 March 2013, following the Child being taken into police protection on 1 March 2013. This was done due to injuries (including bruising) being observed on the Child&#8217;s back at school, which he indicated had been caused by his step father. He has been with foster carers since, pursuant to a series of interim care orders made in favour of the Local Authority (the LA).</span></p>

The Child&#8217;s biological father SP (the father) lives in Slovakia. He has not been formally served with the proceedings, but is aware of their existence and the fact that the Child is placed with foster carers.

In the event that can&#8217;t be established jurisdiction is established by presence, pursuant to Art 13 (1). Art 12 (3), she submits, is not applicable as the Slovakian jurisdiction had not been accepted in accordance with Art 12 (3) (b). In any event, she submits the court has jurisdiction under Art 20 to make interim protective measures. The LA initially supported the mother&#8217;s request for the proceedings to be transferred to Slovakia under Art 15. However, their position moderated to some extent in their oral submissions to support the Guardian&#8217;s position, that the fact finding should take place here, followed by re-consideration of the Art 15 transfer request at the conclusion of that hearing.</span></p>

He acknowledges the court can still have jurisdiction under Art 13 or Art 20. He seeks a transfer of the proceedings to Slovakia, pursuant to Art 15. The mother returned to Slovakia (apparently without warning to the other parties) 3 weeks after these proceedings commenced. She was pregnant with her daughter, who she gave birth to in May in Slovakia. The step father is the father, although he remains in this jurisdiction as his immigration status does not enable him to travel to Slovakia.</span></p>

It was not the focus of the previous directions made by the court; the focus was on Arts 12 and 15. In any event, he submits, the court can determine habitual residence on the information available, which is established in this case so the court has jurisdiction under Art 8. If the court cannot do that jurisdiction is established under Art 13 (1), by the Child&#8217;s presence. He resists the application to transfer under Art 15. He submits the balance comes down, at this stage, on this court determining the discrete facts upon which these proceedings are based and to then re-consider the Art 15 request for a transfer at the end of that hearing. Under Arts 21 and 2 (4) he submits the judgment of the court regarding the fact finding would be enforceable in Slovakia.</span></p>

There was an issue between the parties, in any event, as to whether the proceedings to change the surname would be sufficient to invoke Art 12 (3). The LA and the Guardian said not, as those proceedings were excluded from BIIR by virtue of Art 1 (3) (c).

There is little dispute about the core facts in this case. There is no issue that the mother came to this jurisdiction with the Child in order to pursue her relationship with the step father. She married him in a religious ceremony within 9 days of her arrival, followed a matter of 10 weeks later by a civil ceremony. There is nothing in the evidence to suggest they were planning to return to Slovakia, either before or after the birth of their child. The step father would not be able to go to Slovakia and he does not speak Slovak. They set up home together here with the Child and he attended school, with no suggestion it was time limited. He was registered with a GP and a dentist. There is nothing to counter the conclusion that this was a long term relationship which was going to be pursued in this jurisdiction. The mother quickly fell pregnant with the step father&#8217;s child.</span></p>

He took no steps to require the mother and the Child to return to Slovakia prior to 1 March 2013, despite the fact that they had been here for 9 months.

The English court should leave such matters to the Romanian court, respecting the fact that under Brussels II Revised the Romanian court and authorities were the appropriate decision-makers (see paras [63], [64], [67], [82], [84], [89]).[emphasis added] </span></p>

For the reasons outlined above, whilst I consider the Child clearly has a connection with Slovakia, the courts there would not in my judgment be a better place to determine the cause of the injuries to the Child, this jurisdiction is, and his welfare requires that to take place here.</span></p>
