He is almost two years old.  He is the son of M and F, who are now 36 and 35 years of age respectively.  They were married in 2003.  In June 2007 they separated, and divorce proceedings are in progress.  In February 2005 C1 was born.  He was the first child of the mother and father.  On the evening of 22 April 2005, when in the sole care of the father, C1 collapsed and was taken to hospital.  On 23 April 2005 C1, then being two months old, sadly died.  </span></p>

She noted the bruising to C2&#8217;s eye.  The father indicated that he had kicked the baby gym into C2&#8217;s face two days previously.  Dr Papworth documented the injuries.  She found bruising to the right side of the face in the periorbital area from the nose to the right ear.  She also saw bruising and swelling around the eye on the upper and lower lids.  She was concerned that the explanation given did not account for the injuries.  She said nothing to the parents as she wanted to speak to Dr Paul Davis, who had had contact with the family both before and after the death of C1.  Dr Davis felt that a full investigation was warranted.  Consequently Dr Papworth contacted the Community Paediatrician, Dr Alicia Rawlinson.  A referral was also made to the social services at the relevant Local Authority. </span></p>

The parents were asked to identify any marks on C2 other than to his face.  The mother indicated that he had a bruise on his right leg.  It was thought to have been caused by C2 kicking on his cot bars or from a changing mat which formed part of a travel cot.  The parents also identified a mark on C2&#8217;s left upper arm which they thought was caused by the car seat.  It had never looked like a bruise.  The mother described it to Dr Rawlinson as she thought it had looked like &#8220;a love bite a couple of days ago&#8221;.</span></p>

Photographs were taken of C2 by the police.  C2 remained on the ward in hospital until 30 June 2006.  All tests carried out at the hospital were normal, i.e. there was no medical reason for the bruising to C2.  Dr Rawlinson was of the view that the explanations offered for the three areas of bruising were not consistent with the injuries.  She also had concerns as to the nasal bleeding that had been reported to her by the parents.  It was her view that child protection procedures needed to be invoked.  A strategy meeting was held at the hospital that afternoon, and arrangements were made for C2 to be accommodated.  He was initially placed with foster parents, but then moved to the care of his maternal grandparents, MGPs, with whom he has lived ever since, except for two very short periods in 2007.</span></p>

In respect of C1, the court must look at the overall clinical picture.  There is no evidence of any natural cause of death.  The pathological, neuroradiological, ophthalmological and other evidence suggest that C1 died of an inflicted head injury.  He had massive brain damage, such that he would not have behaved normally after suffering such an injury.  He was last seen by the father behaving normally on the evening of 22 April 2005.  At the outset of the hearing the local authority asked me to find that on the evening of 22 April the father assaulted C1 by shaking him.  The mother was said to have failed to protect C1, but that allegation in respect of the mother, after the evidence had been heard, was no longer pursued.  </span></p>

The father, it is said, has been inconsistent in his explanation for C2&#8217;s eye injury.  At the end of the evidence and before final written submissions were given to me (for which I express my great gratitude) the local authority circulated a document headed &#8220;Outline findings sought by the local authority&#8221;.  The local authority&#8217;s case at the end of the evidence is that if the court makes findings that the father assaulted C1, then its case is that it is improbable that C2&#8217;s injuries, if inflicted, were inflicted by both parents.  In those circumstances the local authority asks the court to find that the father inflicted the three bruises and that the mother failed to protect C2 in circumstances where she knew, suspected or ought to have known that C2 was at risk.</span></p>

Therefore both, it is said, are within the pool of potential perpetrators.  The father categorically denies inflicting any injuries whatsoever and certainly not shaking C1.  He categorically, together with the mother, denies inflicting any injuries on C2.</span></p>

When assessing the probabilities, the court will have in mind as a factor, to whatever degree is appropriate in a particular case, that the more serious the allegation, the less likely it is that the event occurred and, hence, the stronger should be the evidence before the court concludes that the allegation is established on the balance of probability.  &#8230;  Deliberate physical injury is usually less likely than accidental physical injury.  &#8230;  Built into the preponderance of probability standard is a generous degree of flexibility in respect of the seriousness of the allegation.  Although the result is much the same, this does not mean that where a serious allegation is the issue, the standard of proof required is higher.  It means only that the inherent probability or improbability of an event is itself a matter to be taken into account when weighing the probability in deciding whether on balance the event occurred.  The more improbable the event, the stronger must be the evidence that it did occur before, on the balance of probability, its occurrence will be established.</span></p>

The mother left the home at about 7.15 or 7.30pm.  He knew that the mother had her phone and he knew its number.  He told me that if C1 had shown distress, he would have rung the mother.  When the mother left, there was nothing wrong with C1.  The mother had fed him at about 5.00pm and there was nothing wrong with his appetite.  Between 7.30 and 8.00pm the father bathed him.  C1 was cheerful and happy.  At 8.00pm to 8.30pm the father put him to bed, after giving him about one and a half ounces of feed.  The father then went downstairs.  He had the baby monitor, which was switched on.</span></p>

He did not worry about it.  C1 hiccupped for about 20 to 25 minutes.  He then went upstairs to look at him.  When asked by Miss Mifflin why he did not go up to see C1 after about five minutes and have a quick look, the father said he had the monitor on.  The hiccups began to change.  They became slower and rasping.  The father went into C1&#8217;s bedroom.  He was quite bluey and grey.  The father went to pick him up.  His head, legs and arms were limp.  He was like a rag doll.  The father told me in examination-in-chief that he put C1 on the changing mat on his back.  He thought something was seriously wrong.  He was in a state of panic and shock.  He bolted downstairs, and returned upstairs with the hands-free telephone, and rang 999.  The ambulance arrived and he and C1 were taken to hospital.</span></p>

The father says that he went upstairs 20 or 25 minutes after the hiccupping started at about 10.30pm.  That would mean that the father went upstairs at about 10.50 or 10.55pm.  Miss Henke, leading counsel for the mother, asked the father what happened between 10.50 or 10.55 and 11.05.  The father said that in that period of approximately 10 minutes, he picked C1 up and tried to find out what was wrong with him.  Miss Henke then put to the father the statement of Julie Jenkins, the paramedic in the ambulance.  Miss Jenkins was not required to give oral evidence.  Miss Jenkins remembers the father saying to her, &#8220;He didn&#8217;t wake for a feed at 11 o&#8217;clock, so I came up to see if he was awake.&#8221;  The father in his evidence denied saying that to Miss Jenkins.</span></p>

The one immediately surrounding the brain is the pia mater.  The next one is the arachnoid.  Between the pia mater and the arachnoid is an area known as the subarachnoid space, in which is located the cerebrospinal fluid.  The third membrane, the dura, is a much tougher thicker membrane which surrounds the brain and continues down the body surrounding and protecting the spinal cord.  It is commonly said that between the arachnoid and the dura membranes lies the subdural &#8220;space&#8221;.  However, I was told that the &#8220;space&#8221; does not in fact exist in a healthy infant.  It is a potential space.  Between the arachnoid and the dura membranes are veins which are called bridging veins.  The brain is divided into two halves or cerebral hemispheres which are separated by the falx, which itself is part of the dura.  Below the cerebral hemispheres the brain is joined to the spinal cord at the craniocervical junction.  The spinal cord extends from the brain and into the spine.  Below the back of the cerebrum is the cerebellum or &#8220;little brain&#8221;.  The tentorium cerebelli is a fold of the dural membrane that separates the cerebrellum from the main cerebral hemispheres.</span></p>

In my opinion, the post-mortem photographs show bruising extending to the galea (a layer of the scalp) and also bleeding within the periosteum (intraperiosteal bleeding) (membrane covering the skull bones).  I have undertaken surgery on hundreds of acute head injuries, and these operations involved &#8220;peeling back&#8221; the scalp in exactly the manner shown in the photographs.  I have often seen similar patterns of scalp bruising, with intraperiosteal bleeding, in patients who have suffered witnessed accidental falls onto soft yielding surfaces (e.g. thickly carpeted floor).  I acknowledge that these bruises were not documented ante-mortem but would comment that subtle bruising behind the hairline, particularly at the back of the head, is often missed on clinical examination; it is equally possible that the bruising was not clinically evident at the time of examination, but nevertheless involved following an injury occurring hours before.  This bruising could be attributed to three causes:  (i) a blow to the back of the head on a soft yielding surface such as a mattress or possibly carpet (depending on the force used), (ii) pressure on the back of the head during resuscitation, particularly in the presence of a coagulopathy, (iii) post-mortem artefact.&#8221;</span></p>

The generalised low attenuation and loss of grey white differentiation is secondary to extensive hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury.  This, somewhat unusually, involves the basal ganglia, thalami and brainstem, and the fact that these areas are involved is likely, in my view, to reflect the severity of the injury.

Whilst severe hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury (from whatever cause) can lead to oozing of blood into the subarachnoid space, the amount of subarachnoid blood and its distribution on C1&#8217;s scan is, in my view, more in keeping with traumatic aetiology for the subarachnoid haemorrhage.</span></p>

In some places this acute blood appears somewhat irregular in outline and this too is likely to be due to blood in the subarachnoid space.  However, particularly posteriorly, the appearances are more suggestive of the presence of acute subdural blood lying adjacent to the falx, with blood extending inferiorly to layer over the upper surface of the tentorium slightly more on the left than the right.  There is also a little high attenuation material seen in relation to the falx cerebelli, suggesting some posterior fossa subdural blood.  It is not possible to estimate the age of any of this acute blood on the basis of the neuroimaging appearances alone, as blood can appear bright on CT scans from soon after an episode of bleeding for up to 7-19 days; very occasionally longer (but see comments regarding timing of injury below).</span></p>

These other collections are of low attenuation (i.e. are darker than the underlying brain).  The low attenuation collection on the left is slightly larger than the collection on the right.  Whilst traditionally low attention subdural collections would be most likely to have been thought of as chronic subdural haematomas (i.e. evidence of older episodes of bleeding), it is increasingly recognised that low attenuation subdural collections can be seen in the context of acute injuries when the arachnoid membrane has been torn, as this can allow cerebrospinal fluid to leak into the subdural space and either collect there or dilute any acute blood present.  Given the extent of the rest of the brain injury, in my view it is most likely that the lower attenuation fluid seen represents the result of an acute injury which has involved tearing of the arachnoid membrane.  The scan appearances therefore are in my view explicable on the basis of being the result of a single event.  The lack of any pathological evidence of older bleeding or a subdural neo-membrane would, in my view, support this conclusion.</span></p>

There is no soft tissue swelling evident to suggest a recent impact injury against a hard or unyielding surface.  There does not appear to be significant sutural splaying at the time of this examination.  This suggests that, although some cerebral swelling is evident as the basal cisterns are effaced, this has not caused any sutural splaying and suggests that the causative event is likely to have occurred very close to the time of the CT examination, in my view, i.e. before major swelling has had the opportunity to develop.  I note that the post-mortem skeletal survey (which I have not seen) was reported as showing some probable sutural splaying.  Given the extent of the hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury evident on the CT scan, I am not at all surprised that there may have been some sutural splaying by the time of the post-mortem skeletal survey, as brain swelling would have continued to develop in the period between the CT scan and the time of C1&#8217;s death.</span></p>

I note that at autopsy this was found to be bloodstained fluid without evidence of old haemorrhage.

Any insult of sufficient severity which causes reduced blood and/or oxygen supply to the brain can lead to hypoxic-ischaemic brain damage and, as stated above, severe hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury from any cause can lead to patchy subarachnoid haemorrhage.  However, in my view the pattern of subarachnoid haemorrhage seen on C1&#8217;s scans is much more likely to be due to a primary traumatic cause rather than to be due to a secondary phenomenon of hypoxic-ischaemic injury.  Given that the scan was perform only a few hours after C1&#8217;s collapse, it would be very unusual, in my experience, to see this degree of subarachnoid haemorrhage in the context of a primary acute hypoxic event such as an apnoeic event.</span></p>

I note that there was evidence of a blood clotting abnormality (thought to be secondary to C1&#8217;s clinical condition).  I am aware that brain injury itself can lead to clotting abnormalities, but it will be important to obtain expert haematological advice regarding the nature of C1&#8217;s acute clotting dysfunction.  In any case, from the point of view of the neuroradiological appearances, in cases of intracranial haemorrhage secondary to blood clotting abnormalities, the bleeding usually occurs into the substance of the brain itself rather than being subarachnoid or subdural bleeding over the surface of the brain.  The pattern of subdural blood is therefore also more in keeping with a primary traumatic cause rather than being due to any secondary effect.</span></p>

In view of the extent of this injury, it is virtually inconceivable that C1 could have behaved in any way normally after the event which caused this degree of brain injury, and he is, in my view, likely to have become obviously and severely unwell at the time of the causative event.  Very occasionally in clinical practice, a child who has stopped breathing for some reason at home or elsewhere is brought into hospital having been resuscitated by carers and/or paramedics.  It is very unusual, in my experience, to see any degree of hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury in any of these cases on such early scans, and I cannot recall ever having seen such a degree of hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury as is seen on C1&#8217;s scan in such a clinical situation.  Infants and children who stop breathing for various reasons or who, for example, suffer seizures are not infrequently resuscitated by carers and professionals with various degrees of training and experience.  Those infants and children who have head scans following such events do not, in my experience, show the features demonstrated on C1&#8217;s scan.  In addition, in such circumstances it would be extremely unusual to see this degree of change in the cerebellar hemispheres secondary to such a primary hypoxic insult.  Evidence of hypoxic-ischaemic change in the cerebellum on scans is occasionally seen in cases of non-accidental head injury, especially in injuries toward the more severe end of the spectrum of severity.  In my view, therefore, the head injury is likely to have been the cause of C1&#8217;s collapse and the reason he required resuscitation, rather than resuscitation being the cause of these appearances.</span></p>

Dr Squier had asked rhetorically why, if fluids which showed a higher attenuation in the subarachnoid space, when they had gone through a tear, if they did, in the subarachnoid membrane, then in the subdural space showed a low attenuation?  She said she would expect to find the same level of attenuation and the fluid in both the subarachnoid and subdural spaces.  Dr Stoodley answered that it was not blood but cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that was passing from the subarachnoid space through the tear to the subdural space.  He told me that if one sees an obvious difference in attenuation between the subdural and subarachnoid spaces, then one can be confident that there is abnormal fluid in the subdural space.</span></p>

She could not think why trauma could cause a tear at one point in the arachnoid membrane and not at others.  Dr Stoodley said that he could not demonstrate a tear from the scan, but it was not difficult to see in this case the CSF in the subdural space.  It is the CSF and not the clotted blood in the subarachnoid space which goes through the tear into the subdural space.  CSF is not found in the subdural space in a healthy child.  It is found only in the subarachnoid space.  Thus, if CSF is seen in the subdural space on the scan, there must be a mechanism by which it gets to the subdural space, and in his opinion that is by a tear in the arachnoid membrane.</span></p>

He told me that it would give rise to hypoxic-ischaemic damage.  If that was all the scan had shown, then that would be consistent with cardiac arrest.  If there had been a simple cardiac arrest, then the hypoxic-ischaemic damage would take much longer to show up on a scan, possibly days, but not within hours.  The unusual feature in C1&#8217;s case is that if he had suffered a simple cardiac arrest, then according to Dr Stoodley it is surprising that the scan showed quite extensive hypoxic-ischaemic damage three or so hours after his collapse and also evidence of acute subarachnoid haemorrhage at that time.  In his view, hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury would not give rise to scan evident, acute subdural haemorrhage.  In patients that are scanned after cardiac arrest, in his experience, followed by resuscitation efforts, hypoxic-ischaemic damage is seen, but not either subdural haemorrhage or low attenuation collections.</span></p>

The additional finding of retinal haemorrhages is also in keeping with trauma, and completes the &#8216;triad&#8217;.  This pattern of brain injury and haemorrhage is one that we associate with a rotational acceleration/deceleration injury such as might be caused by shaking.  It is believed that rotational acceleration/deceleration of the head results in (a) stretching and tearing of bridging veins passing from the brain to the skull causing small volume subdural and subarachnoid haemorrhages; (b) stretching and damage to nerve fibres in the brain stem causing apnoea of variable duration (cessation of breathing) resulting in hypoxic insult to the brain; (c) in severe cases, tearing of fibres within the brain substance, or shear injuries.  That rotational trauma can cause such injuries is generally accepted.  However, the strength and nature of the forces required to cause the injuries is more in dispute.  Confession evidence exists that suggests that shaking alone is capable of causing brain injury [1] but confessions are not always reliable.  It has been suggested that the rotational forces generated by shaking are insufficient to cause brain injury, but are greatly increased if there is impact at the end of the rotational movement [2].  Arguments revolve around whether the biomechanical models used in experiments are sufficiently true to real babies, and whether the impact needs to be with an external object or could be with the infant&#8217;s own back/chest [3].  Certainly in cases of this kind, evidence of impact is not always found [4], and this is one of the reasons prompting workers in the field to search for alternative explanations for the constellation of findings.  Even if it is accepted that the &#8216;triad&#8217; may be caused by shaking a baby, the presence of the &#8216;triad&#8217; does not automatically prove that shaking has occurred, and other possibilities should always be considered.</span></p>

Could a cardiac arrest on its own, from whatever cause, be responsible for all of the intracranial findings in this case?  It could account for the extensive ischaemic damage to the brain.  It might result in a small amount of oozing of blood into the subarachnoid space from damaged capillaries.  It has been suggested that it might also account for subdural haemorrhages.  This controversial hypothesis (or theoretical possibility) was advanced by Geddes et al [5].  It does not fit with our clinical or radiological experience of babies with hypoxic brain damage of any known non-traumatic cause.  The hypothesis was considered and rejected in the Court of Appeal in 2005.</span></p>

Could this, added to the brain ischaemia, account for the intracranial haemorrhage?  It might explain why the subarachnoid haemorrhage was extensive (rather than a tiny amount of oozing).  However, if there were a significant amount of haemorrhage from reperfusion of damaged capillaries, it is surprising that there was no evidence of haemorrhage into the brain substance.

She told me that the radiological pattern in C1 is not at all typical of intracranial infection.  There was no patchy change.  Within infection one will not find extensive subarachnoid haemorrhage or dense subdural haemorrhage.  When cross-examined by Mr Tillyard, she told me she would not expect to see the amount of subarachnoid haemorrhage with hypoxic-ischaemic damage.  She would be surprised if the hypoxic-ischaemic damage had caused the amount of subarachnoid damage, but if it did, then the cause could be coagulopathy.  So far as the falx was concerned, some of the blood she saw on the scan was adjacent to the falx.  So far as the subdural blood found at post-mortem was concerned, Dr Gawne-Cain told me that she could not exclude the possibility that it had been caused by oozing of the blood vessels together with coagulopathy, but she was confident that CSF in the subdural space shows up on the scan as low attenuation.  She told me that she thought it pretty unlikely, but possible, that the fluid seen in the subdural space was from leaky blood vessels because the scan was performed two or three hours after the event causing C1&#8217;s collapse, which is a very short time.  She is used to seeing effusion occurring over days and not hours.  In her neuroradiological experience, she had never seen subdural haemorrhage come after hypoxic-ischaemic damage.</span></p>

There was no evidence of old blood in the subdural space and there was no inflammation.  Mr Tillyard suggested to her that in C1&#8217;s case there may have been asymptomatic bleeding at birth.

There was no other explanation for the presence of CSF being in the subdural space than that it got there through a tear in the arachnoid membrane.  He told me that, in his opinion, subarachnoid bleeding can occur in the presence of both brain swelling and coagulopathy.  He has seen a similar amount of blood in other cases of trauma.  Furthermore, in C1&#8217;s case the degree of subarachnoid haemorrhage was no worse at the time of the post-mortem examination than it was in the scan.  Thus, as the clotting anomaly was not corrected for at least three and a half hours after the scan (that is to say, by the administration of fresh frozen plasma) were the subarachnoid haemorrhage to be a direct result of oozing from the encephalopathic brain, he would have expected to see an increased amount of subarachnoid haemorrhage present.  </span></p>

None were found to have a subdural haematoma at autopsy.  I am aware of the more recent abstract presented at a recent neuroradiology conference.  The authors undertook a retrospective case note and imaging review of all infants under the age of three years, dying in the emergency department or admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit after a cardiorespiratory arrest, over a six year period.  Of the 60 children evaluated, 45 had a combination of post-mortem examination, CT brain imaging or both.  None of these infants had a subdural haematoma.  It should be noted that the abstract would have been subject to peer review, but the full details of the study have not been published.

The results are reported as follows:  prothrombin time 15 seconds (prolonged), activated partial thromboplastin time 32.8 seconds (within the normal range) and fibrinogen 0.8 g/L (NR 2-4 g/L).  A thrombin time, a measure of functional fibrinogen, was correspondingly prolonged at 19.6 seconds. These are also recorded in a laboratory report (F100).  Dr Collins has concluded that these results are compatible with the clinical picture of collapse and hypoxia, reflecting an early form of disseminated coagulation which is a condition in which a trigger (such as hypoxia, infection or inflammation) activates the coagulation cascade systemically and causes consumption of clotting factors and platelets resulting in prolonged clotting tests and decreased platelets.

As to that latter matter, she accepted, when cross-examined, that any bleeding could not have been a post-mortem artefact because, as per Dr Smith at GQ24 and 25, the BAPP accumulation is an active process which requires cellular energy, i.e. it will not occur after death.  Dr Squier told me that pulling out the spinal cord at post-mortem examination could cause the axonal damage.  Dr Smith told me that the removal of the spinal cord would not necessarily cause axonal damage but, in his experience, the technique of removing the spinal cord is not an explanation for the bleeding around the damaged nerve roots in the spinal cord.  Dr Smith told me that the presence of damage to the nerve roots has no relevance to coagulopathy.  He believes that it is a coincidence that there was damage to the nerve roots and there is also localised bleeding.  Furthermore, it was a remarkable coincidence that blood had gathered at the site of the damaged nerve roots and nowhere else in the spinal cord.  If, as was suggested by Dr Squier, there was leakage of blood as a result of the coagulopathy, he was careful to say that the localised area of bleeding around the nerve roots must be cautiously interpreted.</span></p>

This appears more severe at the proximal ends of the optic nerve (i.e. in the region immediately behind each eye).  Here is macroscopically visible blood within the orbital soft tissue adjacent to each optic nerve and further back within the orbital fat.  No views of the anterior surface of the eyes are provided, so I am not able to comment on the front of the eyes, conjunctivae and corneas.  The eyes have been opened in the coronal plane, and a diagram provided on the copy of the neuropathology request form confirms that this is approximately at the equator of each eye (the mid-point from front to back).  There is extensive bleeding over the surface of the retina of each eye in all retinal areas.  There is widespread retinal thickening due to oedema and, in addition to post-mortem retinal folding, there also appear to be broad perimacular folds present in both eyes.  Widespread intraretinal bleeding amounting to retinoschisis (splitting of the retina) is evident along the cut margins of the retina of each eye.  Haemorrhage in the posterior portions of the eyes, associated with the perimacular folds, obscured the optic nerve heads in both eyes so that these structures are not visible.  In one of the eyes &#8211; it is not indicated whether this is the left or the right in the information provided to me &#8211; there is quite marked detachment of the anterior vitreous gel which can be seen appearing to &#8216;billow out&#8217; behind the lens.

There is some degree of autolysis, which may be a reflection, in part, of the considerable damage to these retinas.  There is extensive pre-retinal blood, as well as subhyaloid (beneath the vitreous) bleeding and focal bleeding into the vitreous.  Many areas of retinal detachment, with subretinal blood, are present and, in some areas, there are small foci where there has been retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) detachment with sub-RPE bleeding.  However, much of the RPE in both of the eyes is detached by artefact.  There is extensive vitreous detachment.  Whilst vitreous detachment may occur due to post-mortem artefact, in both of these eyes it is associated with, in the area of the vitreous base, detachment of peripheral anterior retina and ciliary body.  Here some areas of haemorrhage beneath the detached ciliary body epithelium are evident, indicating that this is an ante-mortem phenomenon.  Somewhat oblique cuts have been prepared through the histology blocks which include anterior segment.  Here the anterior chamber of each eye can be seen to contain proteinaceous exudates, but no blood.  There is some artefactual detachment of the corneal endothelium and some artefactual lifting and detachment of corneal epithelial cells. There is no evidence of conjunctival, subconjunctival or episcleral haemorrhage.  The cornea, iris and lens do not appear to have been disrupted, but the histological view is quite restricted because of the orientation of the tissue blocks.  In both eyes there is extensive bleeding within the sclera in the area of the vascular circle of Zinn adjacent to the optic nerve insertion into the eye.  In the left eye this bleeding is linked to a focus of choroidal haemorrhage.  In the central retinal vein of the right eye, at the optic nerve head, there is a collection of blood clot adherent to the vessel wall.   In two veins within the orbital tissue adjacent to the right eye there is also more blood clot.  In further sections prepared in the Manchester laboratory, this clot is seen to extend to the branching point of a large vein.  Many of the peripheral nerves within the orbital tissue adjacent to both eyes contain blood beneath their external sheaths.  Bleeding has also occurred free within the orbital fat and within the eye muscles.  There is very severe optic nerve sheath bleeding (most marked in the anterior parts of the nerves) with intrasheath blood, subdural and subarachnoid bleeding, and bleeding external to the optic nerves.&#8221;</span></p>

Looked at in isolation, they told me, the causes of retinal haemorrhage are numerous.  But there is no history of accidental trauma.  No natural cause of the retinal haemorrhages has been identified.  Coagulopathy and CPR may be associated with retinal haemorrhages, but in these situations the bleeding is typically in the posterior retina and is limited in extent.  Although there was a blood clot within two orbital veins of the right orbit and within the central retinal vein within the right eye, Dr Bonshek understood that C1 suffered from secondary coagulopathy.  He found no clotting elsewhere.  The post-mortem and histology report give no description of excessive/intravascular clotting elsewhere in the body.  C1 was given fresh frozen plasma.  Dr Bonshek thus interprets the blood clots to be due to coagulopathy.  Meningeal coccal meningitis and septicaemia have been described as associated with retinal haemorrhages, but in his opinion there was no evidence of any infection.  Birth is a recognised cause of retinal intracranial bleeding, but with C1, he said, the retinal bleeding was recent.</span></p>

The view of the working party of The Royal College of Ophthalmologists was that CPR alone was very unlikely to cause retinal haemorrhage, even if carried out by unskilled people.  Dr Bonshek also excludes the injuries being caused by C1&#8217;s immunisation.  [See G80].  Most experts, Dr Bonshek said in his report of 30 July 2007, agree that the combination of retinal haemorrhage, subdural haemorrhage and acute encephalopathy, is very suggestive of NAI, if other causes cannot be identified.  Taking all the findings, both ocular and non-ocular, Dr Bonshek is left with NAI as the most likely cause of the irregular findings.  Findings within the eyes and the orbital tissues are at the severe end of the spectrum in cases which he has examined.  In his opinion, the likely mechanism for the injuries was shaking.  Dr Bonshek was careful in his report to state that the &#8220;triad&#8221; of injuries cannot be taken in isolation as conclusive of C1&#8217;s death, but it is a strong indicator.

The epithelium is a single layer of cells between the retina and the choroid.  In C1&#8217;s left eye the choroid itself has had haemorrhages, but there were also haemorrhages in the fat, muscles and nerves outside each eye.  The retinal haemorrhages were seen two hours after his collapse, which was very quick.  In his opinion, the retinal haemorrhages had occurred at or before C1&#8217;s arrival in hospital.  His coagulopathy occurred after his brain was damaged.  He told me that the combination of retinal haemorrhage, optic nerve haemorrhage and subdural haemorrhage is quite closely associated with trauma, however that trauma may have been caused.  He also told me that the presence of perimacular folds in both eyes is an indicator of the severity of the injury but it was not an indicator whether the injury was accidental or not.  There was no evidence of infection over the surface of the brain in C1.  As I have said, he told me that the findings in C1&#8217;s eyes were very suggestive of trauma.  If no history of accidental trauma was given, then non-accidental injury was left as the only possibility.</span></p>

I know of no verified accounts of cardiac arrest resulting in the triad of features as seen in this child.  This suggestion appears to be based on a hypothetical situation and perhaps has been reinforced by fairly recent medical literature, which hypothetically regards the features of the triad as being secondary events subsequent upon some other causative event.  These have variously been suggested as Pertussis infection, bouts of continuous coughing, retching and vomiting, and other non-specific events that result in raised venous pressure within the brain and within the eyes.  Apnoeic events and trivial injury have also put forward as suggestions, as have other events. &#8230;</span></p>

In C1&#8217;s case he saw no evidence of infection or septicaemia.  He accepted that, if there was infection, it could cause brain swelling which, together with cranial and resuscitation pressure of a secondary coagulopathy, could give rise to retinal haemorrhage.  As to the possibility of blood vessels leaking as a result of raised venous pressure from resuscitation together with coagulopathy giving rise to retinal haemorrhage, he told me he had never seen it.

But where retinal folds are seen and they are, as in C1&#8217;s case, associated with retinal haemorrhage or retinal damage, then the retinal folds are a pre-mortem event.  In his opinion, the findings in both of C1&#8217;s eyes are not explicable by any cause other than trauma.  The retinal haemorrhage in C1&#8217;s eyes are of the type seen in baby shaking cases.  That is known because they are seen in cases where the perpetrator has admitted shaking an infant.  For Dr McCarthy, the degree of haemorrhage in both eyes was most striking.  The haemorrhage went all the way round the retinas in both eyes, from the front of each eye to the back, and of the optic disc.  Further, the haemorrhages were through the full thickness of the retinas.  The retinal detachment was at the outside where the retina joins the eyeball.  He told me that what was so striking to him was the confluence of haemorrhage from the front to the back of both eyes, or haemorrhages through the full thickness of the retinas, with equal magnitude of haemorrhage on both sides of each eye.</span></p>

The clinical presentations vary from a pure shaking incident, where the child is violently shaken;  blunt force injury, where the child is thrown or receives a blunt impact injury to the head; and, finally, as a component of other injury in the battered child syndrome.</span></p>

The relative incidence of brain injury due to the shaking or the impact injury remains unknown; in many cases both forms of injury may be present.

		      <p style="margin-left:0.7in;margin-right:0.7in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The SBS apparently results when a young child is shaken by holding the thorax, shoulders, or abdomen.  This shaking must be done by an individual much larger than the child, usually an adult, in order to achieve sufficient acceleration of the body of the child.  During the shaking it is assumed that the head can be whipped back and forth because of the relative inability of the infant to control its neck muscles and because of the relatively large mass of the head in relation to body. This mechanical instability perhaps explains why whiplash-shaking deaths are uncommon in children older than one year.  In addition, the infant skull has the flat base and still not developed fossae (that typically hold the adult brain in place) permitting more rotation to the brain than in adults during acceleration-deceleration.  Finally, the underdeveloped myelinisation of the neuronal axons of the child&#8217;s brain predisposes to laceration of long neurons which is a typical injury/finding in SBS.</span></p>

In relation to the bruises on the back of C1&#8217;s skull, they could be attributed to the three causes as set out in Mr Edwards&#8217; report at paragraph 5.03.1, namely a blow to the back of the head on a mattress or carpet; pressure on the back of the head due to resuscitation; and post-mortem artefact.  Dr Vujanic was taken to task by Mr Tillyard for not mentioning this opinion in his report.  Dr Vujanic told me that post-mortem artefact could be excluded.  Contact with a soft surface was more likely than bruising following resuscitation attempts, but he did not rule out the latter.  He agreed with Dr Smith that the hypoxic-ischaemic injury was second to the cardiac arrest, but that the whole picture had to be looked at.</span></p>

This ruptures small communicating veins on the surface of the brain that are the source of the subdural haemorrhage.  These haemorrhages are important only as an indicator of the mechanism of injury.  They do not form significant space occupying lesions, as do the more extensive collections of blood (subdural haematomas) mostly seen in older patients.  The subdural and subarachnoid haemorrhages in this case clearly form only thin films as indicated by the post-mortem photographs.</span></p>

It did not explain the intracranial haemorrhage nor the retinal haemorrhages.  With SIDS babies, one does not have significant findings at post-mortem examination.

He agreed that hypoxic-ischaemic damage could arise from cardiac arrest, but you cannot just block out all the other factors, i.e. intracranial and ocular findings.  Mr Tillyard put to him the hypothesis of cardiac arrest, hypoxic-ischaemic damage, coagulopathy and resuscitation leading to oozing of vessels into the subdural and subarachnoid spaces.  Dr Debelle was not dismissive, but in his opinion the subdural haemorrhage and subarachnoid haemorrhage were present (that is to say, looking at the scan) before there was evidence of hypoxic-ischaemic damage.  He agreed that the degree of blood in the subarachnoid space was unusual in a setting of NAI.  He agreed that the idea of a tear in the arachnoid membrane was a fairly recent one, within the last two years.  If septicaemia was present in C1, he would not expect C1 to behave normally and then suddenly collapse.  He could find no evidence of overwhelming infection.  There was no evidence of suffocation.  He accepted that Prolonged QT Syndrome can be the cause of cardiac arrest, but that in C1&#8217;s case it is inconsistent with the presence of subdural and subarachnoid haemorrhage.  Babies with Prolonged QT Syndrome do not have subdural, subarachnoid and retinal haemorrhage.  It was extremely unlikely that C1 was suffering from that syndrome.</span></p>

He plainly believes that the &#8220;shaking hypothesis&#8221; is wrong.  He referred to research papers at H1 and again at H16, which involve neck injuries in children involved in frontal collisions in road accidents.  He referred to an email at H29, which he says sets out the biomechanical case that shaking does not cause trauma in infants.  In his report he said that he could not exclude trauma, but he had cited mechanical research that questions the shaking theory.  He could not exclude suffocation.  But this he subsequently retracted in cross-examination.  He could not exclude infection, by which he said in his evidence he meant septicaemia.  What led him to septicaemia was C1&#8217;s raised white cell count and seeing the presence of petechiae on C1&#8217;s tummy.  As I understand his evidence, he did not suggest that C1 was a SIDS baby.  In his evidence-in-chief he explained that a SIDS baby was a dead baby who was, in life, completely normal and where at post-mortem examination no abnormality was found.  Thus C1 could not be a SIDS baby.  I shall refer later in this judgment to further aspects of the evidence of Dr Sunderland.</span></p>

There may also be other pathological signs such as subarachnoid bleeding and injuries at the cranio-cervical junction.  Further, there may be injuries to nerve tissue (axonal injuries) and external signs of broken bones, bruising and other obvious injuries such as extradural oedema (bruising).  Determining these findings requires medical experts from a number of different disciplines interpreting often very small signs within the complex structures of an infant&#8217;s brain and surrounding tissue.</span></p>

The hypothesis was that brain swelling combined with raised intracranial pressure (ICP) could cause both subdural haemorrhages and retinal haemorrhages.  Thus, is was argued that any incidents of apnoea (cessation of breathing) could set in motion a cascade of events which could cause the same injuries as seen in the triad.  It will be appreciated that there are many events which could accidentally cause an episode of apnoea.</span></p>

Thereafter they too carefully analyse the medical evidence.  They rightly draw attention to what they describe as &#8220;the wider canvas&#8221;, namely the evidence of the father&#8217;s devotion and care of C1 and C2, his love for the mother and the good home conditions.  (See </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Re B, Children</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2006/1186" uk:canonical="[2006] EWCA Civ 1186" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWCA Civ. 1186</ref>).  I have set out the evidence upon which they rightly rely.  They go on to make the point that in the light of the doctor&#8217;s beliefs in 2005 about C1&#8217;s death, had the father shaken C1, surely he would have let sleeping dogs lie and not challenged them to come up with a cause for C1&#8217;s death.  The father&#8217;s obsession with immunisation was not the action of someone who knew full well why C1 had died.  Mr Tillyard and Mr Parsley submit that the improbability of the father inflicting injury on C1 is &#8220;very high indeed&#8221;, and why on this particular night when (I paraphrase) there was nothing untoward in himself or about C1?  </span></p>

They invite the court to start with what happened in 2005 and 2006.  Dr Leadbeatter and Dr Davis both came to the conclusion that they could not exclude Sudden Infant Death Syndrome as being the cause of death, and that the bleeding that was found at post-mortem and on the scan was attributable to the abnormal coagulation, the prolonged period of hypoxia, together with attempts to resuscitate over a period of about an hour.  They submit that this cannot lightly be dismissed as being plainly wrong.  Dr Leadbeatter and Dr Davis are both very experienced experts in their field, and had in mind the possibility that this may have been an inflicted non-accidental head injury.  SIDS does occur, and when it does, the baby&#8217;s heart stops and there follows an hypoxic-ischaemic insult to the brain.  What is unusual in this case is that after such a long period of time, the child is resuscitated and is then kept alive for another 15 hours.  When C1 arrived at hospital, he was clinically dead, and it was Dr Vujanic who said that it was a miracle that they revived him at all.  This is very unusual, notwithstanding the evidence of Dr Risdon that it was likely to give rise to very unusual intracranial findings.  Mr Tillyard and Mr Parsley went on to submit that:  </span></p>

I have been in many situations where infants have been resuscitated using intraosseous needles.  Intraosseous needles access the central part of the tibia bone which contains the &#8216;bone marrow&#8217;.  This part of the bone has a rich blood supply and in an emergency setting can be used for the administration of drugs and fluid when blood vessels access cannot be obtained.  It is my opinion that the elevated white count on the first specimen sent from the intraosseous needle is entirely consistent with a &#8216;normal&#8217; intraosseous specimen.  The bone marrow is responsible for white cell production and therefore normally contains more white blood cells than venous blood.  Therefore, I am not surprised that the white cell count is elevated and do not think this is of any significance.

This is a case of bacterial meningitis and bacterial meningitis is a rare but recognised cause of retinal bleeding.  The cases which have been reported in the literature, however, have not shown such extensive retinal bleeding as found in the case shown by Prof Luthert.

Dr Stoodley and Dr Gawne-Cain stated that cardiac arrest could give rise to hypoxic-ischaemic damage, but it would not lead to a pattern of acute subdural haemorrhage, acute subarachnoid haemorrhage and intraventricular haemorrhage in the interval of time between C1&#8217;s collapse and the CT scan, nor could it account for the low attenuation fluid collections.  Dr Bonshek stated that he was not aware of any published literature regarding any association between the syndrome and retinal and optic nerve sheath bleeding.  Dr Debelle agreed, and said that Prolonged QT Syndrome would not cause subdural haemorrhage.  He describes the syndrome as &#8220;extraordinarily rare&#8221;.

Each restricted themselves to their expertise.  Each, in my judgment, was very careful in the manner in which they gave their evidence.  In my judgment, Miss Mifflin and Mr Furness have accurately analysed the evidence of Dr Stoodley and Dr Gawne-Cain.  Dr Stoodley was careful to look at all the neuroradiological evidence, as was Dr Gawne-Cain.  As to the hypoxic-ischaemic injury, both agreed that this could occur after cardiac arrest as well as trauma, and so by itself it was non-specific.  As to the subarachnoid haemorrhage, both they and Mr Edwards agreed that if the subarachnoid haemorrhage was due solely to hypoxic-ischaemic injury, it would take much longer to develop.  Subdural haemorrhage would not be present if the hypoxic-ischaemic injury was due to infection or cardiac arrest but are common in inflicted head injuries.  The low attenuation collection was as a result of a tear in the arachnoid membrane.  Neither the neuroradiologists nor Mr Edwards accepted Dr Squier&#8217;s assertion that these collections were naturally occurring childhood collections.  It is also to be noted that on post-mortem examination Dr Leadbeatter found no pathological evidence of chronic or older bleeding, and no evidence of neomembrane in the dura.</span></p>

Such a neomembrane was not found on post-mortem examination.  Furthermore there was no evidence of old haemorrhage on the post-mortem examination.  In addition to this the low attenuation collections had significantly reduced in size at the time of the post-mortem examination.  This would be consistent with the fact that the low attenuation collections are of bloodstained cerebral spinal fluid, rather than clot, as the blood stained spinal fluid would have been dispersed by the progressive brain swelling that occurred in the hours after the CT scan.

It is a very unhappy experience for a judge to have to choose between two experts, particularly as distinguished as Dr Smith and Dr Squier.  But I am driven to the conclusion that Dr Smith&#8217;s evidence is the more reliable.  In my judgment, Mr Furness puts it succinctly and accurately in paragraph 13.4 of his submissions where he says that Dr Smith does not accept the hypothesis put forward by Dr Squier that the bleeding may be unconnected to the nerve root damage because, he says, the coincidence of location is too strong.  He cannot understand why the blood would accumulate just in that position rather than run down the spinal cord.  If Dr Squier&#8217;s hypothesis was correct, then there should be blood all down the spinal cord, but there was not.  He rejected the suggestion that the brain swelling may cause traction on the spinal cord, causing haemorrhages.  The significant difference between that case and trauma is the repetitive process.  With trauma it is very rapid, whereas brain swelling would be a slow process.  &#8220;In a swollen brain, with no trauma, haemorrhages have never been described.&#8221;  He said that Mr Edwards made similar points with regard to this finding, as did Dr Bonshek in relation to retinal haemorrhaging.</span></p>

But the reality, as she had to accept when cross-examined by Miss Mifflin, is that in the interpretation of the CT scan, she had to defer to the neuroradiologists and, as to the eyes, to the ophthalmologists, and to the haematologists in respect of bleeding issues.  Nevertheless, her evidence-in-chief showed little, indeed scant, deference to the experts in fields in which she is not an expert.  Mr Furness accurately summarises the point at paragraph 13.6 of his submissions.  First, Dr Squier had difficulty seeing the low attenuation collections in the subdural space which the neuroradiologists and Mr Edwards did not.  Second, she did not understand how the material could be of low attenuation, whereas this was convincingly, in my judgment, explained by Dr Stoodley, Dr Gawne-Cain and Mr Edwards as being CSF which has got into the subdural space through a tear in the arachnoid membrane.  Third, that the fluid could be explained as a natural collection often seen in babies, whereas the neuroradiologists and Mr Edwards said that the choice was between a tear in the arachnoid membrane and an old subdural haematoma.  Fourth, she went on to suggest that the fluid could be a birth injury, but in my judgment this was pure speculation and went wholly contrary to the other medical evidence.  Fifth, she said she deferred to the ophthalmologists&#8217; evidence, but nevertheless disagreed with them.</span></p>

In her evidence Dr Squier had to retreat into saying that the cause of C1&#8217;s death was &#8220;multifactorial&#8221;.  She said:  &#8220;The factors were severe hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury, coagulopathy and pressure caused by brain swelling&#8221;.</span></p>

He accepted he relied upon biomechanical research evidence, specifically crash dummies.  He conceded that this area was outside his expertise.  I agree with the submissions of Miss Mifflin and Mr Furness that the opinions of Dr Sunderland are of much less value than they might otherwise have been because he is not really prepared to accept that the shaking hypothesis has any validity at all.  He relied on biomechanical research, but no biomechanical consultant was called before me.  Furthermore, as I have demonstrated, he was compelled to abandon suffocation as a cause, and his evidence relating to infection as a possible cause was shown to be, in my judgment, completely flawed.  The fact of the matter is that Dr Sunderland&#8217;s evidence was not objective, but started from a preconceived position that shaking cannot cause the injuries seen in C1.  </span></p>

After all, there is no dispute that the event which caused C1&#8217;s collapse happened at about 10.30pm when he alone was caring for C1.

At about 10.30pm the father shook C1 with sufficient force that not only caused his collapse and subsequent death, but also, which he would have instantly realised, was quite inappropriate.  Having shaken C1, he put him back in his cot and went back downstairs.  He heard the hiccupping, which was the beginning of C1&#8217;s collapse.  I suspect he was very worried indeed, having shaken C1 and hearing him hiccupping and hiccupping for so long, that he might have done something to C1 which he hoped would not materialise.  After much too long a period, he went upstairs and saw C1 blue and grey and, on picking him up, he was limp like a rag doll.  I am sure that he must then have felt dreadful and very apprehensive for C1 and indeed what he was going to tell the mother.  That must be the only credible explanation for why he did not ring the mother at any time whilst C1 was hiccupping or for just about one hour after he says he discovered C1 in such a parlous condition at 10.50 or 10.55pm.</span></p>

She left a well baby in the care of the father, who, although stressed, had shown no previous inclination of violence towards C1.

There was slight soft tissue swelling present under the eye; there was a full range of eye movements, and no subconjunctival haemorrhages visible, although the sclera (white of the eye) looked slightly injected laterally.  The bruising below the eye was in a roughly triangular distribution over an area approximately 2cm by 2cm by 2cm.  Petechial bruising extended in a patch about 2cm above the right eye.

She told me that this was all nearly two years ago.  Nevertheless, she came out of the witness box and demonstrated with the baby gym.  The father had placed the baby gym on the floor.  He had stood at the front of the frame with the baby&#8217;s feet nearest to him, with C2&#8217;s head furthest from him.  C2 had been lying on his back.  The father had then walked forward and walked into the baby gym.  Mr Tillyard put to her that the father told her that C2&#8217;s head, not his feet, was nearest to the father.  Dr Rawlinson emphatically rejected that.  She told me that from what the father had told her on 23 June and what she saw being demonstrated on that day, she could not understand how the injury had occurred.  Dr Rawlinson told me that she had asked the father more than once during the examination whether his foot had hit C2&#8217;s face.  The father was clear, she said, that his foot had not hit C2; it was the frame of the baby gym.  Mr Tillyard pointed out to Dr Rawlinson in his cross-examination that she had made no note of asking the father whether his foot had hit C2.  Dr Rawlinson could not explain why there was no such note.  However, she did tell me that had the father told her that his foot had hit C2, she would have made a note of that.

In her statement at G65 she said:</span></p>

He shows evidence of bruising to three sites of the body, some of which is petechial (tiny blood vessels).  Further investigations have shown a normal coagulation screen and a normal CT scan of the brain, with no evidence of retinal haemorrhages on fundoscopy.  The coagulation screen is normal, i.e. no medical reason for him to bruise more easily, had been detected at this time on baseline investigation.  Such medical conditions are rare, and in any case both inflicted injury and bleeding disorder may coexist and the diagnoses are not mutually exclusive.  I do, however, understand that his sibling C1, who died at eight weeks of age with a sudden unexplained death in infancy, was said to have abnormal coagulation following his collapse, but that this returned to normal before he died.  I understand that Dr Collins, Consultant Haematologist at University Hospital of Wales, was involved in his management, and I will therefore write to him to ask if he feels any further haematological investigations in C2 are warranted.</span></p>

		      <p style="margin-left:0.7in;margin-right:0.7in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In my opinion, however, the pattern and distribution and extent of bruising around the right eye in C2 is not consistent with the explanation being offered of the incident with the baby gym, and although this may well have occurred, I do not think that this is the mechanism by which he sustained the bruising as seen.  The fact that this baby has had three areas of documented bruising, including his face, is of concern.  (Ref: Maguire, Archives of Disease in Childhood, 90(2) 196 &#8211; &#8216;Those who don&#8217;t cruise, rarely bruise&#8221;).  It is generally accepted that a young non-mobile baby would not be able to bruise themselves by kicking against cot bars or changing equipment.  The petechial bruising on the left upper arm was suggestive of a possible pinch mark.  Overall therefore this presentation of unexplained bruising in a young non-mobile baby raises concerns regarding non-accidental injury.&#8221;</span></p>

The father told me that the health visitor had said that many cases of baby&#8217;s vomiting involved vomiting through the mouth and nose.

At about 7.30pm on 20 June the mother told me that she went out to her aqua aerobics, leaving C2 in the care of the father.  There was no mark on C2&#8217;s face.  At about 9.00 or 9.15pm she came home and came into the sitting room.  She saw C2 lying under the baby gym, which was placed between the two settees.  She saw the father come out of the kitchen door.  She walked over to the table, shown on the plan with her marking &#8211; See E2238a.  The small matchstick person represents C2 lying under the baby gym with his feet nearest the V, formed by the two settees, and his head closest to the kitchen door.  The mother was unpacking her bag on the table with her back to C2 and the father.  She heard a noise of the bells hanging down from the baby gym.  C2 started crying.  She rushed over to C2, who had been picked up by the father.  C2 was upset and crying.  The father was consoling him.  Once C2 was quiet and asleep in the father&#8217;s arms, the mother noticed a redness on C2&#8217;s right cheek.  The father told her that he had kicked the baby gym into C2.  By the time they had taken C2 to the hospital, the mark was puffy and swollen.  The mother told me she did not know which leg of the baby gym the father had kicked.</span></p>

He actually gave it a forceful kick, and the baby gym and the foot hit C2&#8217;s face.  C2 was on his back and slightly rolling to his right.

The father then walked forward &#8220;kicking&#8221; the strut.  But what was immediately obvious to me and indeed to counsel watching the demonstration was that the baby gym, upon being kicked, was turned in an anticlockwise direction, and the strut, instead of moving in to where C2&#8217;s face would have been, moved in the very opposite direction; that is to say, out and away from C2&#8217;s face.  The father did the demonstration again.  This time it could be said that the strut might just have moved into C2&#8217;s face.

Dr Sunderland told me that the rolling of C2 into the cot bars would not create enough momentum to cause such bruising.  It was unlikely that a baby kicking out and his leg hitting the cot would cause such a bruise.  Furthermore, it is an important point that the cot bars, as seen in the photographs, would have been at right angles to C2&#8217;s legs if he had rolled into them.  The cot bar at right angles to the linear bruise would be most unlikely to cause such a bruise.  Furthermore, Dr Sunderland told me that, to him, it was some sort of pinch mark.  Dr Rawlinson did not consider the parents&#8217; explanation to be satisfactory.  She told me that cot-bound babies do not injure themselves.  Mr Debelle said that the parents&#8217; explanation was plausible, but bruising in infants was rare and it should have been witnessed.  Both parents in their evidence were completely unable to relate the bruise on C2&#8217;s leg to any incident at all.

Dr Rawlinson told me that there was nothing to suggest any chafing because the mark on the arm had not been abraded or rubbed.  Dr Debelle told me that if the seatbelt had in some way caused the bruising, a carer would have witnessed C2 being in pain at the time, but there is and was no clear and consistent explanation.

I am satisfied that the strut of the baby gym never came into contact with C2&#8217;s right eye and/or right cheek.  There is no incident other than the baby gym which is put forward by the parents to account for his injuries.  The short point is, in my judgment, that the father has not told me the truth.  Whilst I am prepared to accept that the father on the evening of 20 June did accidentally walk into the baby gym, I specifically find that it did not hit C2&#8217;s face.  </span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0.11in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The father&#8217;s demonstration of kicking the baby gym established that not only is it very likely that the baby gym rotated away from C2&#8217;s face, but also that the strut of the gym, which is said to have hit C2, was pushed along the floor and did not rise up from it.  Dr Sunderland, in his evidence, postulated and demonstrated to me that the leg would have had to have been lifted up off the ground and the </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman'">bottom</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> of the strut would then have had to have impacted into the eye orbit.  After the kicking, he said the gym would have travelled over the baby&#8217;s face.  He did not think that the father&#8217;s trainers would cause such bruising.  It would have had to have been the force of a kick on a football field.  </span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0.11in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">What was so striking to me is that Dr Sunderland&#8217;s suggestion as to how the bottom of the strut struck C2&#8217;s right eye was nothing like the mechanism described and demonstrated to me by the father in his evidence.  Again what was so noticeable to me, from the father&#8217;s demonstration, was that the movement of his left foot into the baby gym could scarcely be described as a kick.  It was more of a stumble.  The baby gym, from his demonstration, never left the floor, and thus the very foot of the strut could not have struck C2 on the face or in the eye.  The demonstration also showed that the baby gym did not travel over C2&#8217;s face, as postulated by Dr Sunderland.  Dr Debelle told me that if the strut had struck C2, it would have affected the bony prominence around the eye, but the bruising on C2 was above, below and in the recess of the eye.  The distribution and pattern of the bruising was unusual, given the explanation put forward.  He found it difficult to say what had caused the injury, but as he graphically put it, &#8220;it should not be there&#8221;.  A foot in contact with the eye made no difference.  The pattern was still not explained.  Dr Rawlinson told me that the impact of a wholly lightweight, tubular, plastic structure and/or a foot could not produce such an extensive distribution of bruising.</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0.11in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Furthermore, in my judgment, the father has put forward inconsistent explanations.  I believe Dr Rawlinson to be accurate in her description of what the father demonstrated to her on 23 June, which is quite different from what the father demonstrated to me.  He did not tell Dr Rawlinson that his foot had struck C2&#8217;s face.  If he had, I am satisfied that Dr Rawlinson would have made a note of it.  The father told Dr Papworth that he had kicked the baby gym which &#8220;fell&#8221; against C2&#8217;s face.  She was sure that the father had not said anything about his foot coming into contact with C2&#8217;s face.  Mandy Morris, a social worker, noted (see D82) when going to the parents&#8217; home on 23 June, that the father told her that he had &#8220;walked past and accidentally kicked the gym into C2&#8217;s face&#8221;.  She told me that had the father told her that his foot had hit C2&#8217;s face, she would have recorded it.  Louise Atkins told me that on 19 July 2006 at the case conference, the parents said that when the father accidentally kicked the frame, the force of his foot was still behind when the frame made contact with C2&#8217;s face.  A year later, on 8 August 2007, the father told the police that his foot had hit the baby&#8217;s face and the bar together.  It was quite a forceful kick, and he felt the impact.  The gym moved quite a bit from its position.</span></p>

First, the baby gym was knocked into C2&#8217;s face.  Next, the baby gym hit C2&#8217;s face and his foot was behind it.  Finally, the baby gym and his foot hit C2&#8217;s face together, and his foot was hurt.</span></p>

The answer to the rhetorical question is the evidence which I have recounted.  The father has at no time suggested the mother caused this injury.  The explanation advanced is that of the father.  I regret to have to say that the father&#8217;s explanation is untrue.  His lies are designed to cover up an incident which happened when he was alone with C2, either deliberately or accidentally.  He did come into contact with the baby gym moments after the mother had come home.  The baby gym did not strike C2, but the father saw that incident, particularly when C2 cried no doubt from the shock of the baby gym unexpectedly moving, as a way of explaining away what he had done to C2 sometime earlier that evening.  In my judgment, it was a nasty piece of deceit practised on the mother.  He tried it on with the doctors and it did not work.  So he tried to add to his story by saying that his foot had hit C2&#8217;s face.  The doctors did not buy that either, and neither do I.  I regret to have to say that the father has persisted in these lies right the way through his evidence before me.</span></p>

There was no viable explanation.  There was no viable explanation for the bruising to the arm.  In my judgment, it is much more likely that the father is the perpetrator of the bruises to C2&#8217;s arm and leg than the mother.  I say that because first I have found that the father shook C1, and second he caused the injury to C2&#8217;s face and eye, about which he has not told the truth.</span></p>

She told me that she knew that the bruise was on C2&#8217;s arm before they visited Dr Papworth on 22 June.  She told Dr Papworth, but she did not tell Dr Papworth about the bruise on the leg, even though she knew it was there.  She knew that neither she nor the father had any viable explanation as to the bruising on the leg and the arm.  She herself had never witnessed any incident which could remotely account for the bruising on either the arm or the leg.  In my judgment, she must have known that the father was giving vague explanations.  Further, the mother knew that the father knew that the bruise to the leg had been caused prior to the visit to Dr Papworth and yet he said nothing to Dr Papworth about it.</span></p>

Furthermore, if the father&#8217;s account to the mother of him kicking the gym into C2&#8217;s face was true, why then did she go along with the father saying to Dr Papworth that the gym had fallen on C2?  The mother did not tell her parents about any of C2&#8217;s bruises until C2 was in hospital.  According to the mother, by 21 June C2&#8217;s eye injury looked worse, and it was black and bruised by the time C2 was taken to Dr Papworth on 22 June.  The mother admitted in cross-examination that she did not tell her parents about C2&#8217;s eye injury until after his admission to hospital.  </span></p>

MGM was then in plaster with a broken ankle and so was housebound, and yet C2 was not brought over to see her.  MGP has had paramedic training in the past, yet the mother sought no advice or reassurance from him about C2.  Both Miss Mifflin and Mr Furness submit that the only inference is that the parents did not want C2&#8217;s grandparents to see any of his injuries.</span></p>

That is so, but she did not point out the bruising to the leg.  It is also submitted that Dr Papworth did not tell the parents of her suspicions, which is correct, and that there was nothing at that time to put the mother on enquiry.  I respectfully disagree.  Here was a non-ambulant child who had suffered three injuries, two of which the mother must have known at the time were completely unexplained and un-witnessed.  The father had told her that he was reluctant to take C2 to Dr Papworth because they might be accused of assaulting C2.  That must have struck the mother at the time as being a very strange remark, coming as it was from C2&#8217;s principal carer.  Miss Henke and Miss Hayworth try in paragraph 44 of their written submissions to persuade me that if as far as the mother was concerned everything was as it should be, why would she then alert her parents about marks she thought to be innocent?  I am not so persuaded.  I do not believe the mother thought that &#8220;everything was as it should be&#8221;.</span></p>

Dr Davis had told them that trauma was one of the postulated causes for C1&#8217;s death, which was never excluded.  The possibility of C1&#8217;s death being as a result of an unnatural act was specifically referred to at the inquest, although Miss Henke and Miss Hayworth are absolutely right to point out at paragraph 15 that the Coroner said she did not see &#8220;any likelihood of unnatural causes&#8221;.  I accept Mr Furness&#8217;s submission that the mother appears to have readily accepted the father&#8217;s &#8220;explanation&#8221; for the bruising to the leg, but it was not until she was cross-examined did she accept there was no explanation for that bruise.  As to the eye and facial bruising, the mother seems to have accepted the father&#8217;s explanation.  She seems never to have questioned it, nor its changing detail.  </span></p>

In my judgment, she shut her eyes to what was happening to C2 out of misplaced loyalty to and love for the father, no doubt hoping that indeed there might be &#8220;innocent&#8221; explanations which would be accepted by the doctors.  Although in her statement she said that she accepted in the light of all the medical evidence that the father must have shaken C1, she has not and did not accept that he had caused the injuries to C2.  I regret to have to say that in my judgment the mother has failed to protect C2 in the ways I have described.</span></p>
