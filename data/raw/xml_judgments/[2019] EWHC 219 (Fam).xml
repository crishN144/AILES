The Father returned to his then employer, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, where he remained until 2012. The Mother commenced work with HSBC in April 2011. They lived in a two bedroom flat owned by the Father in Canary Wharf. In 2014 they purchased a second flat at Buckingham Gate, Belgravia, which is a one bedroom flat. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.36in">The parties both wished to have children, but discovered that they could not conceive naturally. The Mother therefore undertook IVF treatment in 2016. This took place in Wuxi, China. The Father says that the fact that the IVF was undertaken in China was at the Mother&#8217;s family&#8217;s insistence. This only matters because it is the Mother&#8217;s case that when the parties went to China in 2016 this was initially intended as a permanent move back to China. The Father says that the time spent in China that year was solely for the Mother&#8217;s IVF treatment and was only intended to be temporary. There is some evidence of the parties discussing buying property in Shanghai, where they were mainly living whilst in China. There is also an exchange of texts about kindergartens and preschools in Shanghai. In my view the evidence supports at least a finding that they were discussing the possibility of staying in China, but they never reached any firm view or agreement. </p>

It may well be that the Mother was hoping that they would settle in China, whereas the Father was intent on returning to the UK. The most that I can say with certainty is that there was no clear mutually concluded decision. </p>

The Mother says that the Father was very keen that the children be born in the UK, as that would entitle them to UK citizenship, and thus strengthen the parents&#8217; case for secure immigration status in the UK. The Mother&#8217;s evidence was that the Father&#8217;s employment was unstable and that there was always at least the possibility that they would go to live in China. </p>

They initially employed a nanny for 3 months and the Mother&#8217;s parents visited between July and September 2017 to help with the babies. From October to December part time nannies were employed and the paternal grandmother came to visit to help with the twins.  </p>

In terms of the relationship, it is clear on the evidence that as with many first-time parents, particularly of twins, there were considerable tensions and difficulties around the demands being placed on both parents. There is no doubt that the Mother was </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.36in">One of the central issues in the dispute over the children&#8217;s habitual residence is the nature of the parties&#8217; intentions at and around the time of their birth, as to where the children should be brought up. The factual evidence is that the children were registered at a number of London private primary schools, including Eaton House School, Belgravia which has a nursery section, where they were given a place. They were also placed on the interview list for schools that considered children from the age of 3. They were registered with a GP in Canary Wharf and had all the relevant immunisations there. They were involved in social activities in London to the degree possible given their very young age. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.36in">The Mother&#8217;s case is that she and the Father discussed going to China after the twins&#8217; first immunisations, and she says they agreed that she would stay for a period in Sanya, in Southern China, with the twins at a house belonging to her parents. She does not suggest that there was any agreement about how long this arrangement would last for.  There is an email dated 27 November in which there is discussion about where in China the Mother will go. The Father&#8217;s case is that they were only discussing a holiday in China over the New Year.  </p>

According to the Father both parents had decided to take a holiday in China around the Christmas period, in part to see the paternal grandfather who had not yet met the twins. The Father says that the intention was that they would all travel out to China together on 14 December 2017, and that he would return with Frederick on 2 January 2018, whilst the Mother and William would stay with his family until March 2018.  </p>

On the same day two helpers arrived from China, apparently sent by the Mother&#8217;s family, to help with packing and travelling with the twins. The Father says that at this point he asked the Mother why she was packing so much for the trip, and the Mother told him that she wanted a divorce and was going to leave England with the children. The Father says that he did not want to leave London but felt he had no alternative as he did not want the children to leave without him. </p>

She says that although there had not been detailed discussions about the future, it was agreed that she would go to China and spend some time there with the twins.   She said the fact that Frederick was booked on the Father&#8217;s ticket was only for convenience and there was no intention for him to return with the Father in January. There is an amicable text exchange dated 10 December where she refers to the paternal grandmother&#8217;s health position, and says she will delay the plan to go back to China and stay in the UK for longer if the Father needs her to, otherwise her parents&#8217; friends </p>

The Mother&#8217;s evidence is that the Father was violent to her, holding her down and pulling her hair. The Father strongly denies this, and his mother also said in evidence that the Father was not violent to the mother. It is however clear that there was a very serious argument and from that point onwards relations deteriorated badly. The Mother&#8217;s evidence was that at this point she had said she wanted a divorce, but she was not really sure what she was thinking. The main thrust of her evidence was that she just wanted to go home to China to be with her parents for a period. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.36in">I prefer the Mother&#8217;s evidence on what was intended in December 2017. If the plan had seriously been for the Father to return to London with Frederick I would have expected some contemporaneous evidence of this. The Father had not been the twin&#8217;s primary carer up to December, and indeed the Mother was still breast feeding until they went to China in December. The twins had never been separated from each other, or their Mother. The Father said that he had intended simply to find a nanny on a website when he returned. He said that he had spoken to his employers about working flexibly, and there had been a discussion with his boss about sharing childcare with his children, who apparently lived in Bromley. However, I have seen no contemporaneous evidence about discussions with his employers about childcare and flexible working for the period of return, or any evidence of planning for what would inevitably have been a very difficult return. I find it very difficult to believe that it would be that easy to arrange such flexible working, at very short notice, particularly in the financial investment sector. I also find the Father&#8217;s ideas about childcare and how he would have looked after Frederick alone, both inchoate and unrealistic. It seems to me to be far more likely that the Mother&#8217;s version of the plan was the true one, namely that she would stay in China for a certain period with both children.  </p>

The Mother&#8217;s evidence was that effectively she and her parents were using the requests for money as a way of testing the Father&#8217;s commitment to the marriage.

The Father had indirect contact with the children up to 25 March, but then had no further contact with them until November. He says this was because the Mother cut off electronic communication.  In April the paternal grandparents travelled to Sanya to meet the maternal family. The plan had been for the Father to join them on this trip. He did not do so. He says this was because he had been involved in a road traffic accident in London and was worried about leaving the country. I found this part of his evidence difficult to believe. The accident was apparently minor, and there were no injuries. Even though he says an off-duty police officer was involved, I have seen no evidence of a police investigation and nothing to support a concern that he should not leave England. </p>

However, I do accept the Mother&#8217;s evidence that she was highly confused and conflicted in terms of what she intended to do, the degree to which she wanted at various points to reconcile with the Father and her future plans. As I will return to below, this is one of the reasons why I do not think trying to decide the issue of habitual residence on the basis of the parties&#8217; intentions is very helpful in this case. Both parents&#8217; feelings and plans may very well have changed within very short periods, and indeed may not have been consistent at any particular time. Through 2018, and indeed perhaps up to the present day, the Father has been unwilling to accept the marriage was over and has, at least in his own mind, at various points sought reconciliation. </p>

She had previously worked for HSBC in London, and she said that since 2017 she had been considering the possibility of getting a job in Hong Kong. It was clear from her evidence that she was keen to get back to work, and saw her working as an important and positive step both for herself and the children.  In terms of what happened to the twins if she got the job, again I accept that she did not have clear and fixed plans in early 2018. She said that at one point she had thought that she would take the children with her to Hong Kong. Ultimately, she got the job in July 2018. At that point the Mother moved to Hong Kong and has been living there during the week since then. She described the job in Hong Kong as her &#8220;dream job&#8221;.  Initially the twins were in Dalian with the maternal grandparents and two nannies. In October the twins travelled from Dalian to Sanya with the maternal grandparents and nannies. They have been living in Sanya since then. I understand the Mother returns to Sanya approximately every second weekend, and during holidays. The rest of the time the twins are looked after by the grandparents and the nannies. Both grandparents are professors, and to the degree they still work this can be done flexibly and remotely, and therefore they do not need to be in Dalian but can reside in Sanya with the children.  </p>

Those rights of custody include the right to be party to any arrangement as to which country the child is to live in. It is not accurate to say that he gives up a right to veto the child's movements abroad; he exercises that right by permitting such movement on terms. He has agreed to the travel only on terms that the stay is to be temporary and the child will be returned as agreed. So long as the travelling parent honours the temporary nature of the stay abroad, he is not infringing the left-behind parent's rights of custody. But once he repudiates the agreement, and keeps the child without the intention to return, and denying the temporary nature of the stay, his retention is no longer on the terms agreed. It amounts to a claim to unilateral decision where the child shall live. It repudiates the rights of custody of the left-behind parent, and becomes wrongful.&#8221;</span></p>

Certainly in the present case no agreements as to what would happen once the children had gone to China were written down. Indeed there was no clear, or really articulated agreement at all between the parents as to where the children would live in the medium term. The situation was fluctuating, and both sides&#8217; wishes, intentions and emotions were changing. What I take principally from the passage above, is that the Judge should look for some objectively identifiable act of repudiation of the previously agreed position.

This will involve a real and detailed consideration of (inter alia): the child's day to day life and experiences; family environment; interests and hobbies; friends etc. and an appreciation of which adults are most important to the child.  The approach must always be child driven.  I emphasise this because all too frequently and this case is no exception, the statements filed focus predominantly on the adult parties.  It is all too common for the Court to have to drill deep for information about the child's life and routine.   This should have been mined to the surface in the preparation of the case and regarded as the primary objective of the statements.  I am bound to say that if the lawyers follow this approach more assiduously, I consider that the very discipline of the preparation is most likely to clarify where the child is habitually resident.  I must also say that this exercise, if properly engaged with, should lead to a reduction in these enquiries in the courtroom.  Habitual residence is essentially a factual issue, it ought therefore, in the overwhelming majority of cases, to be readily capable of identification by the parties.&#8221; </span></p>

I am grateful to both counsel for not seeking to present this dichotomy as raising any significant conundrum. Neither of them disputes that these applications stand or fall together. Unless Mr Scott persuades me that it is in the interests of the girls to be returned in the short term to South Africa so that their future can there be decided, the father will not secure an essential part of the relief which he seeks, namely the order for their return. I propose to look at the case first in terms of the girls&#8217; welfare and then, if I am satisfied that, judged by that paramount principle, it is indeed in their interests to return, I will, before directing a stay, cross-check that, in reaching that determination, I have in effect concluded, or alternatively that I should proceed to conclude, that the criteria requisite for a stay are satisfied. Of the authorities cited by counsel, the most helpful seems to me to be the decision of the Court of Appeal in Re K (Abduction: Consent: Forum Conveniens) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 2 FLR 211" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 2 FLR 211</ref>.

I will start by considering the question of what is the relevant date for the determination of habitual residence. There are three dates or periods that might be relevant: 14 December 2017 when the children left England; some date between JanuaryMarch 2018 when the Mother decided to retain them in China; or October 2018 when these proceedings commenced. As I have explained above, I consider that I am bound by <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re H</span>, and therefore article 10 of BIIR applies.  </p>

They had spent their entire, albeit short, lives here and both their parents were here. They were integrated in England, to the degree one would expect given their very young age, by reason of medical care and some socialisation. Mr Devereux accepts this was the case.  </p>

The Father had undoubtedly agreed that the children would spend some time in China. It is his case that the agreement was that Frederick would return with him on 2 January, but I do not accept his case on this point. As I have said above absolutely no arrangements were made for childcare in early January and it seems to me inconceivable that the Mother would have agreed to one child returning alone without her or the other twin. The common understanding, in my view, was that both children would remain in China with the Mother for a period, although the parameters of that period were not clear, and the parents probably had different expectations about when it would end. </p>

The Mother&#8217;s intentions on that day as she left England were unclear, probably including to herself. She and the Father had just had a very bad argument, she was upset and as she said she just wanted to go home to be with her parents. It would be wholly unreal to try to ascribe to her a fixed intention at that date to retain the children in China indefinitely. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.36in">The second possible date under article 10 is the point at which the Mother did decide not to return to England and that the twins would live for the foreseeable future in China.  It is not possible to pin this down to one precise date. However, by the end of March 2018 the Mother was unequivocally saying to the Father that she and the children were not coming back to England in accordance with any previous understanding that they would do so in March. How to define the date for a &#8220;repudiatory retention&#8221; was considered in detail by the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re C (Children)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2018] 2 WLR 683" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] 2 WLR 683</ref> as referred to above. At [51] Lord Hughes says that wrongful retention must be an objectively identifiable act and that purely internal unmanifested thoughts are best seen as at most a plan. Applying that approach here, in my view the objectively identifiable act comes at the end of March 2018 when the Mother writes to the Father formally indicating that she wants a divorce and that she has instructed lawyers. The instruction of lawyers seems to me to be the kind of objective act the Supreme Court was looking for. To the degree that there had been a mutual understanding that the Mother and children would return to London at some point,  I think the Mother was making clear at the end of March that this was no longer her intention, and she was keeping the children in China.  I will therefore take the end of March as the date at which I should determine the children&#8217;s habitual residence, and therefore for deciding whether this Court has jurisdiction.   </p>

In March 2018 the children were living in China with their Mother, who had been their primary carer throughout their lives, their maternal grandparents and nannies. The evidence suggests that they were well integrated in this environment. It is correct that they were not living with their Father, and they were not in England where they had spent their first six months. However, ethnically and culturally these are Chinese children, and as I understand the specific consideration around integration, it is to cover a situation where a child is physically in a country but not integrated within it. However, in this case these are very young children, so integration into a country or community is necessarily limited.  To the degree they could be, these children were integrated into their Chinese social and family environment by March 2018. I note that it is not necessary for the children to be &#8220;fully&#8221; integrated into the new country.  </p>

I do not think this is a fair reflection of the true situation. The Mother was by late March clear that the children were staying in China, or perhaps moving over the border to Hong Kong. She was also clear that they were going to reside with the extended maternal family rather than returning to England. There may have been some uncertainty as to whether they might move to Hong Kong at some point, but as at March 2018 their integration was in China. I view the whole issue of the job in Hong Kong as something of a red herring. Although Hong Kong is obviously a different jurisdiction to China, it is very much closer to China and Sanya in particular, than England, both geographically but also in terms of the environment the children were living in. </p>

The children&#8217;s &#8220;roots&#8221; in England were, particularly given their age, slight. Their family and cultural ties in China on the other hand were extensive. Therefore in my view this was a case where habitual residence could and was changed quite rapidly.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.36in">Fourthly, I need to consider in determining habitual residence their best interest in the context of proximity (<span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B</span> (iii) and <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Mercredi v Chaffe</span> 2012 Fam 22 at [46]. As I understand how this factor works at this stage of this analysis, it is whether a finding of habitual residence corresponds with the child&#8217;s best interests in terms of proximity. The children quite clearly here had a practical connection in China, but also and importantly they were being fully cared for in a loving environment. That is not to underestimate the importance of them being separated from the Father, but there is certainly no conflict here between their best interests and their being found to be habitually resident in China.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.36in">Fifthly it is now possible for one parent to change a child&#8217;s habitual residence without the consent of the other parent, <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B</span> (iv) and <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re R</span>.  In my view, the Mother&#8217;s unequivocal position by the end of March had led to the children&#8217;s habitual residence changing. The law is now clear that this is possible, and the facts of this case support that this is what had happened here. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.36in">The relevance of intention is potentially a complicated one. There may be cases where the parental intention is absolutely clear, and there is objective evidence, such as an application for a visa in the new country showing a clear intention. Here, the Mother&#8217;s intention may have been somewhat uncertain in early 2018, and may well have fluctuated. This is hardly surprising given that her marriage had broken down, and she was dealing with a new and emotionally very difficult situation. In my view by late March her evidence suggests that she was clear she was not returning to England, but this is not a case where I think intention alone is likely to be the critical factor. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.26in;margin-right:0.36in">Finally, I fully take into account the fact that the Father was living in England and that the children retained a home in England. Their room and possessions were still in the flat in Canary Wharf. They remained registered at the GP surgery, and as I have recorded above they had been given a pre-school place at Eaton Place School. However, taking the evidence in the round and focusing on the position of the children, as opposed to the position of the Father, I do not think that the remaining links to England outweigh the strong evidence in favour of the children being habitually resident in China. Their links to England were their nationality and the fact that their Father was living here. There may be cases where nationality is important, but given the young ages and the background of these children it seems to me to have little impact on their habitual residence. There is no suggestion that their immigration status in China was precarious. The fact that their </p>

However, for completeness I should record that I do not think it would have been in the best interests of the twins to bring them back to England, given that they appear to be well settled and well looked after in China. I appreciate that the Mother is away from them during the weeks, and some weekends. However, they are living in an extended family, and this form of childcare is not unusual in China. It plainly would be in their interests to re-establish a close relationship with their Father. I understand he is having some, albeit limited, indirect contact with them. The Mother was very clear that she thought it was in the twins&#8217; interests to see their Father, and that she hoped he would visit them regularly in China. It is to be hoped that such contact can take place as soon as possible.  </p>
