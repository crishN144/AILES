Contact time both here in the UK, where he lives with his mother MA, and more problematically, in his father&#8217;s home country the United Arab Emirates (UAE). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.03in">The principle of contact is not disputed. The differences between the parents as to the UK arrangements are small. The issue on which the parents disagree is whether at some point Z might have contact with his father and spend time with him in the UAE. Father wants this to happen late summer of 2025 when Z is about 4 &#189; years old and just before he starts school. If this is to happen I must review a prohibited steps order made early in the application. Mother is totally opposed, fearing father will keep Z in the UAE or take him from there to Pakistan. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.03in">Z was born in November 2020 in the UK. Mother with father&#8217;s full blessing had returned from the UAE to the UK in the latter stages of pregnancy wishing to have the support of her mother at the time of birth. Until then they had lived as husband and wife in UAE. Their marriage is valid and recognised in Sharia law. There was no civil ceremony in the UK. When Z was born father signed the birth certificate and therefore acquired parental responsibility.   In June 2021 seven months after the birth mother and Z returned to the UAE. They lived with father and his family until the relationship broke down and mother returned to the UK with Z  on the 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>November 2021.                      </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.03in">The relationship breakdown was a sad one.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.03in">It is important I record that in the statements made by mother and in her oral evidence she made allegations of domestic abuse against father. Father claimed controlling behaviour by mother. These have not been particularised. At the start of the application both were legally represented and made clear to the case management judges, more than once, that they did not consider the conduct and behaviour of either to be a barrier to contact between Z and his father. Whilst it is not specifically referred to in the orders, recordings made in them show that practice direction 12 J was engaged in their minds. Both accepted that the circumstances of their separation, and any behaviour during the marriage did not require any judicial finding of fact. It must be that all concerned including the court did not consider it necessary or proportionate to do so to resolve the welfare question which was the time father spent with Z.</p>

Both agreed in those early hearings to direct and indirect contact between Z and his father in the UK. Cafcass reported there were no safeguarding issues. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.03in">At the start of this final hearing, I asked for clarity from mother&#8217;s counsel as to whether domestic abuse was an issue. Practice direction 12 J is engaged at every stage of an application and my concern was the number of occasions that I had read references to domestic abuse. There seemed to be some lack of clarity as to mother&#8217;s position on this even though it was listed as the final hearing and the application had commenced 16 months earlier. The case was stood down on no less than three occasions for counsel to speak to mother and during one recess they had a conference with her solicitors.  At the conclusion of this process mother&#8217;s counsel made clear no findings of domestic abuse were being asked for.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.03in">Mother returned to the UK in November 2021 when Z was just a year old. A period of about 3 to 4 months passed before any contact arrangements were agreed with father. He visited the UK twice in February and April 2023, once with his father and supervised contact was allowed. There was little agreement however between the parents about how contact might progress. Most of the discussions and negotiations took place through the extended family.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.03in">The text messages between mother and father in the short period before separation show that mother made father aware of her plan to return to the UK and with Z.  The UAE has not signed and ratified the Hague Convention on Child Abduction. It does not recognize the legal concept of habitual residence. Its legal system derives from Sharia law.    </p>

Whilst mother is pressed for an answer on father&#8217;s contact proposals and legal proceedings are alluded to in the main this is a conciliatory routine letter that invites agreement outside of court proceedings. It records, presumably on instructions from their client, that Z was living with mother on a permanent basis in the UK and referred to him paying financial support. </p>

A without notice hearing was refused and the application was listed on notice on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> August 2022. At that hearing before a District Judge the order records first that mother did not view the allegations she made in her statement accompanying the application as a barrier to unsupervised contact long term. Second in recording 7 that contact in the short term should be supervised. This was argued on capability grounds: father had not cared for Z for any significant period.  Mother agreed for contact to take place supervised for up to 2 hours per day either in a contact centre or in the community. The judge made a prohibited steps order against each parent preventing the child from taking been taken from the jurisdiction. Father indicated to the court that he intended to make an application for a child arrangements order and this was issued on 27 September 2022.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.03in">For reasons that are just not clear the matter did not return to court until 17 February 2023. It was seen by a District Judge who noted that the safeguarding letter dated 12 September was incomplete. He ordered an updated letter by 19 May 2023 and listed a First Hearing Dispute Resolution Appointment (FHDRA)on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> May 2023.  The issues were identified: the court mother&#8217;s request for a live with child arrangements order within her application for a prohibited steps order; father&#8217;s application for a spend time with child arrangements order; mother&#8217;s request that the prohibited steps order made against her be discharged; lastly any interim spending time child arrangements order.  Once again it is recorded on behalf of mother that the unparticularized domestic abuse allegations were not a barrier to contact. Finally, it is recorded that if father was coming to the UK, he should contact her solicitors to arrange contact supervised either by the maternal grandmother or at a contact centre. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0in">Mother questioned father&#8217;s parenting skills and he agreed to go on a parenting course. Mother opposed unsupervised contact outside of the UK or within the UK if there was no prohibited steps order in place restraining father removing Z from the UK. Father made clear contact in the UAE was his longer-term ambition. Mother asked for a section 7 report, but Cafcass felt there was no welfare basis. The immediate challenge was to facilitate contact. An ISW was approached to assist with supervising 6-10 contacts and making notes. Both agreed to use Our Family Wizard App to facilitate communication. Mother agreed to provide monthly photos and 3 monthly written updates. Facetime was agreed once a week for 15 minutes.  The prohibited steps order against mother was discharged but continued for father. The case was timetabled to a final hearing on the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span>October 2023. The absence of a listed dispute resolution appointment suggests settlement prospects were considered as low.  </p>

The application with the approval of the DFJ was reallocated from the district bench to the circuit bench. Interim   arrangements for face to face-to-face contact whilst father was in the UK were decided by the judge on submissions and indirect contact as before continued.

There is uncertainty here although Dr Edge reported a detectable change in approach towards respecting the law of nationality of the person or child to be protected unless to do so would be contrary to Sharia, public policy, or morals. This follows a Federal Decree in 2020 amending the previous choice of law rules. In one case following the UAE courts applied Hindu law to 2 Indian Hindus even though the outcome was not consistent with UAE law. The situation however is uncertain and there is little authority on what might happen with non-nationals of Muslim faith. Because of the cost of proving the likely foreign outcome many in this situation just accept the application of local law in Dr Edge&#8217;s experience.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.03in">Family law in the UAE centre on Guardianship and custody which are the UAE equivalents of personal responsibility and residence. Father is the sole guardian. Both parents share custody. In practice a mother is expected to shoulder the main burden of childcare whilst a child is young. Father&#8217;s guardianship means that he has the sole right to determine how his child is raised, educated, and married. All major decisions on welfare. He is entitled to hold the child&#8217;s passport and the child cannot travel out of the UAE without his written consent. Mother has similar rights in terms of travel. This means that once a child has arrived in the UAE, relocation out of the Emirate requires the consent of both. Parents may by prior agreement give continuing approval to a child travelling without specific individual consent. Either may apply for a travel ban although this is not granted automatically. It is likely only to be made by a court if it is in the interests of the child as the child&#8217;s right to travel is guaranteed and generally takes priority over the rights of their parent. A mother&#8217;s custodial rights might be forfeit if she remarries or is not considered a fit and proper person to continue as custodian although again here the law is a in a state of flux with some courts adopting a much more flexible approach in line with decisions of the Federal Supreme Court particularly in respect of mothers who have remarried basing their decisions upon child welfare considerations. </p>

By this means it becomes a court judgement enforceable in the same way as any other local court judgement. The agreement will need to be translated into Arabic accurately.  If enforcement is required Dr Edge describes this as a simple swift process. Enforcement could be challenged by the other parent arguing duress, change of circumstance or inapplicability and if strenuously litigated could take some time to resolve.  He estimated enforcement costs would be in the region of &#163;5000 or if challenged a great deal more. </p>

Dr Edge reports that there have been very few cases in the UAE where breach of such agreements have been challenged or even considered by the court. His report does not report the outcome where they have. This may suggest several possibilities: it is a procedure only used by those honourable and intent on seeing it through; or used more widely and has been effective in the sense that and those who might be tempted to challenge its terms in the local court have been deterred by its existence from so doing.

She criticised father for lack of engagement as a parent both in the five months they were together in the UAE and since her return to this country. Worried about Z&#8217;s milk intolerance and whether father could manage this. She criticised his family particularly his grandmother describing her as illiterate and conservative and unable to properly meet Z&#8217;s needs.  She criticised father not being present Z&#8217;s birth even though they had agreed she give birth in the UK (apparently father was on the plane at the time). She considered father unable to properly manage Z&#8217;s eczema. Concerned about abduction she said both he and his family had strong links to Pakistan and were constructing a family home in Pakistan. Father had no right to remain in UAE independently of his work which she described as insecure. She was also critical of father&#8217;s contact in February and April, not bringing appropriate food, nappies and being distracted. She opposed any unsupervised contact until 8- 10 supervised contact sessions had taken place and Cafcass gave the green light. She wanted independent evidence from an independent Social Worker (ISW) that he can care for Z properly. She said that once Z is in school full time (in September 2025) she fully supported alternative weekends with his father in the UK. Quite how this could be achieved when father lives and works in the UAE is difficult to understand. Overnight contact she said might be possible when Z is older and in secondary school. </p>

This statement again asserts unparticularized domestic abuse despite those issues having been put on one side by both in the recordings to previous orders. Anticipating that the court may consider her overprotective and anxious she explains that the court has not seen father for who he truly is.

She simply said it was up to father to get this information not really understanding how odd it would be for him to ask the local police if he had asked them to implement a travel ban when on his case he knew that he hadn&#8217;t. And she had not asked him to. The comments about the deficiencies in father&#8217;s parenting and that of his family are repeated and she complains about the absence of child support. Her proposals for contact were that father should visit regularly which can begin to become unsupervised in the UK for 4-6 hours provided there is a prohibited steps order in place and provided father provides meals, nappies, details of his accommodation and travel including acquiring a toddler seat (she was not prepared to share).  Overnight contact was not possible or contact in the UAE.

That is a shared responsibility. In those first 4 months mother did not. There is no suggestion at this time that father was threatening abduction. Indirect contact would have been perfectly safe.   </p>

Father says they were not sent promptly, sometimes at all. At page 150 of the bundle mother&#8217;s solicitor wrote to father solicitors sending three months&#8217; worth of photographs demonstrating (aside from what either parent might say) that between March and May they had not been sent. When confronted with this mother once again apologised and promised to stay on top of it in the future.

That said she qualified the answer by saying that it must not intrude upon her time with Z and time with father must accommodate his continuing attendance at nursery and playgroup as she was paying for it. She was also wanting details of the accommodation that he was staying at, the transportation he would use, confirmation that he would personally prepare Z&#8217;s food from home and provide her with details of what he was eating. To some extent mother&#8217;s underlying concerns here have validity. Z has a serious dietary issue with milk intolerance and also a medical problem with eczema. These are however manageable challenges to any parent and ones father has said he will.   </p>

She opposed contact in the UAE as it was just not safe referring to the risk issues set out by the Dr Edge at paragraph 67 of his report: the required consent and cooperation of the parties  (which ironically she was unwilling to give), the time and cost of setting up a registrable agreement in the UAE courts,  the possibility one might use the local law for their own ends and lastly the lack of authority in the UAE where a breach of such an agreement or judgement has been challenged or considered by the local courts. As an aside this fourth point may be an indication of the success and durability of these agreements rather than their vulnerability. In short, they might just work. Alternatively, they may be entered into only by honourable parents who intent to stand by their agreements. Or perhaps both are at play here. They work for the honourable and trustworthy, and by deterrent the not so. </p>

She simply would not agree with it. If there was any risk at all, why should she agree to it? At the end of her evidence when I asked her whether she thought Z was more or less at risk without an agreement in having contact with father in the UAE she rowed back from this position and said that she would cooperate with an agreement if it was thought contact should take place there. </p>

He was now three years old, and the proposed arrangements would not start until next year when he was nearly 4. When it was put to him that leaving it until the child was older might have merit he agreed but felt that there was no real solution other than to try and see if it worked. He understood the bath time routine, accepted it might not be successful although neither would know until it was tried. If problems arose both could rethink and illustrated the point by referring to the last contact session which had been planned for 4 hours but cut down by him to 3 when Z said that he wanted to go back to his mum.  He was very happy to give mother advance notice of travel plans and hoped to avoid all conflict. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.03in">Mother&#8217;s rather mean-spirited approach to contact between November 2021 and the involvement of the ISW in August 2023 might ironically have been a vulnerability with some parents prone to act unwisely and recklessly, taking the law into their own hands. Father did not. Faced with a struggle he was patient and worked with the legal system.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.03in">The recommendation of Dr Edge for a Written Agreement formalised into a Consent Judgement supported by Oaths freely given and a Security Bond is a significant protective factor. Its terms can reduce further the small residual risks. This is a common solution with a track record of success. In this case there is more than sufficient time for it to be put in place. </p>

His important relationship with mother severely damaged. He would feel abandoned. He would lose for a time his primary attachment figure. The emotional harm would be akin to grieving with potentially long-term emotional consequences. The consequences are very serious. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.03in">The agreement would provide a litigation solution although it would take time. If he went to Pakistan the Protocol could come to mothers&#8217; assistance although again it would take time. There is a good prospect however in either scenario that mother would be successful eventually. Father would have blown it. At best infrequent heavily supervised contact. Perhaps none. Probably loss of his job and financial ruin. Would father take that risk? </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.03in">My assessment is that he would not. Z&#8217;s welfare is furthered by contact in the UAE. Father will not in my judgement retain him there unlawfully and the risk that he might, a risk which can never be eliminated, is so small that even having regard to the dire consequences to Z if he did, the balance of the assessment still falls in favour of permission being given for contact in the UAE subject to the protections advised by Dr Edge.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.03in">Dealing firstly with contact in the UK. I make a contact order that mother makes Z available for contact with his father for period of 1 week three times a year in the UK on dates to be agreed between them for the following year by the 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span>December of the year before. The 2024 dates to be agreed by 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span>December 2023 and so on. If they have not agreed the 3 dates by 31 December this year either may by application to ask for it to be determined.  Father&#8217;s suggestion that one take place in November around his birthday is one which I am sure he will enjoy. During each week there will be daily daytime visiting contact flexibly between 4-8 hours long. Flexible so that if he becomes tired or wishes to return to his mother, they know this can happen without either falling in breach of the order. On the second visiting contact in 2024 (likely July 2024) there will be one overnight contact with father midpoint during the week. He will return to his mother in the morning of the following day and stay with her in lieu of having contact with father that day&#8217;s (unless she is working). I expect both parents to reassure him about this so that he feels comfortable with it. It will be sensible for the parents to agree a later start time for contact on the day prior to the overnight sleep. Father should also facilitate a FaceTime call with mother just before bedtime so that she can be reassured all is well. In the weekly contacts following in the UK there will be two overnight stays with father following a similar pattern. The prohibited steps order will be discharged on 1 December 2024 after the second sequence of overnight contacts. By then both parents, mother in particular will have more confidence in the process. I have given careful thought to whether the prohibited steps order should be discharged now but feel it is a protective factor on the evolution of these arrangements.  I expect mother and father to cooperate and be sensitive to each other in these arrangements father finding accommodation close to mother in the UK and mother sharing the car seat and child buggy. This will be the pattern of the UK arrangements moving forward. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.03in">In terms of indirect contact, I order mother to make Z available for indirect contact through FaceTime twice a week between 5 and 6pm on a Wednesday and Sunday evening for a period of up to 15 minutes. I have directed it to take place twice a week as the arrangements are vulnerable and some may be cut short given children of this age are easily distracted. The parents will have to be considerate and tolerant over this, it will get better as he gets older. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.03in">In terms of contact in the UAE I direct that mother make Z available for contact in the UAE for a period of one week each year. Mother agreed to engage with Dr Edge&#8217;s recommended agreement, and I make it a condition of the order that this is in place prior to the first weekly visit which I order takes place in December 2025/January 2026. That is during the school Christmas holiday. I have decided December rather than August or September as the temperatures in the UAE will be lower and it will be easier with his eczema. He will by then have had his first term in school and be more used to spending time away from mother with his new teacher and classmates. He will adapt to this new arrangement easier then. I express the hope that mother will travel with him to the UAE although that is a matter for her. If she refuses father can take charge of the travelling arrangements. If she does travel time can be shared in the UAE. If she does not, I direct that there be FaceTime calls between Z and his mother not less than three times in the week. The terms of the agreement to be presented to the UAE court must be particularised in an agreed annex to this order. They must include that both parents agree for Z to live with his mother in the UK, that father has had independent legal advice and has not been coerced into this arrangement, that he will return Z to his mother at the end of contact and not take him out of the UAE during the time he is there, that he will not apply for travel bans either in respect of mother or Z. They will need careful legal advice on this, and the agreement must be in place no later than three months before the contact is due to start. It must be supported by the oaths offered by father and the security bond. </p>
