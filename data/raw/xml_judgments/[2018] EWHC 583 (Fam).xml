Mrs A claims that Mr A has either died or, alternatively, has not been known to be alive for a period of at least seven years.  The history given by Mrs A in sworn evidence before me today and supported by some documentary evidence is a very sad.</p>

Mrs A tells me and I accept that they lived together on and off over a period of years.  When not living with her in Boston, Lincolnshire, Mr A returned to live with his family in Nottingham where he worked illegally he not having leave to remain in this jurisdiction.</p>

She tells me, and I accept, that she went to considerable lengths to obtain leave for him to remain in this jurisdiction on the part of Mr A and he was subsequently able, with her assistance and her paying the costs, to obtain a British Passport.  He obtained that passport at the end of 2009.  Very sadly for Mrs A that marked him leaving her.  </p>

She was not given any details of how he died, where he died, or the date upon which he is said to have died.
