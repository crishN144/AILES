	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The petitioner Nasreen Akhter issued a petition for divorce from the respondent Mohammed Shabaz Khan on 4 November 2016. The husband defended the divorce on the basis that the parties had not entered a marriage valid according to English law. In her reply, the wife averred that the presumption of marriage arising out of cohabitation and reputation applied so as to validate the marriage. In the alternative, she averred that the marriage was a void marriage within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref>(a)(iii) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I shall refer to the petitioner in this judgment as the wife. I shall refer to the respondent as the husband. I do this because both the wife and the husband considered themselves to be married to each other and held themselves out to the world at large as husband and wife. That was because they had undertaken a religious marriage according to their faith which they themselves and the Islamic world considered made them husband and wife. The wife says (but it is denied by the husband) that they intended to undertake a civil ceremony. Whilst the parties lived in Dubai between 2005 and 2011 they were considered by the authorities there to be validly married. Although the husband now adopts the position that they were not married, and has apparently instructed his counsel to refer to the ceremony that the parties undertook in 1998 as a blessing, I consider that for the purposes of this judgment and notwithstanding that the issues that I have to determine go to their legal status in English law that I should refer to them as husband and wife.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Although the case before me is of most immediate concern to the applicant and the respondent and no doubt their children and extended families it does give rise to some questions which are of public interest also. The fact that some of the issues which are present in this case have been the subject of &#8216;The Independent Review into the application of Sharia Law in England and Wales&#8217; which was commissioned by Theresa May when she was the Home Secretary illustrates the potential wider public interests of itself.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">What this case is not about though is whether an Islamic marriage ceremony (a Nikah) should be treated as creating a valid marriage in English law. In fact, the main issue as it has emerged is almost diametrically the opposite of that question; namely whether a Nikah marriage ceremony creates an invalid or void marriage in English law. To the average non-lawyer in 2018, it may appear an easy question to answer. Surely a marriage which is not a valid marriage is a void marriage and thus can be annulled? Regrettably it is not that simple.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The complication arises in part from the fact that in a series of cases since about 2001, judges have interpreted the provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Marriage Act 1949</ref> and the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> such that as the law currently stands a marriage can not only be valid and void but also what has become termed a non-marriage.  </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">If the marriage is valid (either because it has been shown or is presumed to have been conducted in the UK and complied with the necessary laws here or it had been shown or is presumed to have been conducted abroad and complied with the necessary laws there) the husband and wife gain all the benefits that come with the legal status of husband and wife. These may range from tax benefits, entitlement to pensions, inheritance advantages, forensic advantages in evidential terms in court through to the more prosaic of family discounts on tickets. If contrary to the parties&#8217; hopes and, the marriage fails, they may separate and if necessary apply to court for judicial separation or divorce and for financial orders to deal with housing and maintenance and splitting of other assets.  In the alternative if the parties have failed to comply with the necessary laws, the marriage may be annulled as being void or voidable. Whilst the marriage subsists they may have the same benefits as a married couple and if the court annuls the marriage the parties will be able to divide their assets or deal with maintenance. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">However, in a &#8216;non-marriage&#8217; case there is no such remedy available. Whatever the circumstances of the non-marriage the consequences are the same. Of course, no one would suggest that actors acting out a marriage for a film should under any circumstances be considered married. Likewise two individuals making promises to each other in secret. Again a couple who have lived together and had children but who have never as between themselves or held themselves out as married would rightly be treated as cohabitees without any of the remedies available to those who have married.  But at the other end of the spectrum are cases where the application of the term &#8216;non-marriage&#8217; seems inapt and indeed pejorative. The parties may have undergone a public marriage ceremony conducted by an official, witnessed by others, in which they confirmed there was no impediment to them marrying, that they consented and that they committed themselves to each other which they, their family and communities accepted led to them being married. They may have lived a married life and been accepted as married by their communities and the state. They may have had children. To all intents and purposes, they have been married.  To characterise all of that as a non-marriage in law feels instinctively uncomfortable in 2018 and might rightly be regarded as insulting by many (although not all) of the participants. If it is a non-marriage which fails they may find they have no recourse to civil law and the remedies that provides. The parties cannot divorce because they do not have a marriage that is valid under English law but nor can they have the marriage annulled because they do not have a marriage that is void under English law. And so the parties &#8211; and usually of course the party who loses out is the wife &#8211; cannot ask a court to deal with issues of property, maintenance, pension sharing, variation of trusts.   </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">As I have said the application of the term non-marriage to cases such as that before me feels instinctively inappropriate. For most purposes the relationship will have been accepted as a marriage by the parties, the community, and very probably various emanations of the state (schools, hospitals, possibly benefits or tax authorities). That it has come to be called a non-marriage in a sense illustrates the conundrum in this case. The use of any other word to describe the marriage for instance invalid, unlawful, non-compliant, void tends to lead to the conclusion that it was not valid and so might be thought capable of annulment. </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">So the main issue in this case is whether this marriage &#8211; which lasted for 18 years (longer than the average &#8216;marriage&#8217;) and which produced 4 children and where all accepted them as husband and wife in fact is to be treated in English law as not a marriage at all?  Not even one which can be declared void for failing to comply with the formalities of marriage?  I am identifying this as the main issue because as will become clear in the course of this judgment the question of whether the situation of the parties over the course of the period 1998 -2016 was such that a valid marriage could be presumed occupied the court far less than the nullity issue.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Whilst the basic two questions which the court is required to answer can be simply stated, hidden within them are a multitude of legal issues. The case was initially listed for three days on the 5 February 2018.  For that hearing Mr Le Grice QC had filed a 13 page skeleton and Ms Rhone-Adrien a 7 page skeleton and they had compiled a bundle of 38 authorities running to some 615 pages. It became clear in the course of that hearing that the issues raised were of wider public interest, in particular whether the application of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref> required the court to adopt a different interpretation of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> or to apply it differently. As a result, I invited the Attorney General to intervene to make submissions on those issues. The Attorney General accepted the invitation to intervene and instructed Mr Nagpal whose written submissions ran to some 36 pages. Mr Le Grice QC&#8217;s further submissions ran only to a further three pages and Ms Paula Rhone-Adrien&#8217;s to 13 but these led to a further 17 page supplemental submission on behalf of the Attorney General. A further 33 authorities totalling some 956 pages were provided for the resumed hearing which was listed for two days on the 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of July 2018.  Having heard submissions from all the parties I adjourned my decision to consider my judgment.</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify">Parties undertake Islamic marriage ceremony at TKC Chowdhury&#8217;s in Southall.</p>
		    <p style="text-align:justify">The marriage certificate records that H was a car salesman resident at nine Elizabeth House, St Leonard Street, London, E3 it is signed by him. It records W as a trainee solicitor living at 10 Branca Road, Kent and is signed by her. It records the &#8216;Wali&#8217; as Rehmat Ali retired and is signed by him. The witnesses are Mohammed Ayaz Khan and Ramiz Ibrahim. W said the Certificate was not produced at the time but only in 2006. She said it wrongly records the dowry as &#163;500 when in fact it was books on Islamic jurisprudence that she had specifically asked for.</p>
		    <p style="text-align:justify">The Imam who conducted the ceremony Dr Khalid M Khan of the Lambeth Islamic centre has provided a letter dated 10 December 2016 in which he confirms that the ceremony was not registered but that he advised W&#8217;s father that the Nikah ceremony should be followed by a civil ceremony for legal recognition. </p>
		    <p style="text-align:justify">W says they met twice before the marriage that the ceremony was arranged fairly swiftly because Ramadan was approaching and they wished to get married prior to Ramadan and its fasting obligations.  </p>
		    <p style="text-align:justify">She described how although they had only met twice the discussed the wedding on the phone on several occasions including how it would be followed by a Walima and the civil ceremony. She said they had not discussed a detailed contract prior to the marriage and that she knew very few people who had.</p>
		    <p style="text-align:justify">She described what the Imam said about the obligations of marriage and the commitments of being a husband and wife and how the ceremony was amplified by a loud speaker so all could hear. She described how the Imam confirmed they were not already married and that her father was her guardian, what the mahr (dowry) was.</p>
		    <p style="text-align:justify"/>
		    <p style="text-align:justify">She said that following the Nikah ceremony which had been organised by and paid for by her family that she was expecting the husband to organise the Walima and the civil ceremony. She said that is traditionally how responsibility is divided. W says that as a lawyer in training she was concerned that her rights were not protected and that she told the husband that they would be treated as cohabitees. She says that the husband said English law was not important and that Sharia Law was more important to their lives. She says that on occasions when she raised the issue it led to arguments.  She says she changed her name by statutory declaration. W&#8217;s case is that her father also spoke to the husband to suggest a civil ceremony was undertaken but the husband dismissed his request. W says her sister Shameem Ibrahim had had a civil wedding service following her Nikah ceremony. Mrs Ibrahim said the family were concerned that the husband had refused to undertake a civil ceremony. Her father Rehmat Ali confirms that he acted as the Wali and that he had expected that there would be a civil ceremony after the Nikah.  He says that he spoke to the husband and said that when he was preparing for the Walima he should also arrange a civil ceremony and that the husband agreed to do this but never did.</p>
		    <p style="text-align:justify">After the ceremony she and the husband returned to her mother&#8217;s home with a small group of close family.  Following that they went to his mother&#8217;s home at Elizabeth house and spend their first night as a married couple there.</p>
		    <p style="text-align:justify">H says W was and still is extremely religious and felt it was unnecessary to register the marriage. He described the importance of the Nikah ceremony to him. It meant that he was married before God and under Islamic law. His position was that the question of a civil ceremony had never been raised by either of them or anybody else.  I find this hard to believe given how many members of their respective families, including his brother, have undergone civil ceremonies. Whilst I could understand them discussing the issue and deciding not to have a ceremony I cannot accept his evidence that neither he or the wife or anybody else ever raise the question of a civil ceremony. He said that had it been raised then that he would have agreed to it. He described how the vows that they gave were almost the same as a civil marriage. He says that she never at any time requested that a civil ceremony be conducted, that she well knew the Nikah ceremony had not resulted in a marriage valid in English law and that she has deliberately set out to deceive the court. (Self-evidently this is a serious allegation in respect of a qualified lawyer) H does say that they did not have a Walima because there is no requirement under Sharia Law for that to take place.  He says that the Wali (Guardian) was not the wife&#8217;s father but was her sister&#8217;s ex-husband although he accepts that the wife&#8217;s father was present. He has provided a statement from his former brother-in-law (although he did not give evidence) in which he says that the wife was adamant she did not want a civil ceremony despite the encouragement of her sister. H says that W could have made the holding of a civil ceremony a condition of the marriage but did not.</p>

In the letter he says, &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">whatever has happened I chose not to pursue this matter of second marriage at the moment&#8217;. </span>In the letter he makes various complaints about the wife&#8217;s behaviour and says, &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">you have always complained I have never been a good husband or a good father.&#8217;</span> He says that he will find her and the children a suitable home and provide her with a car and money whilst he carries on working to earn sufficient to buy her a house.</p>
		    <p style="text-align:justify"/>
		    <p style="text-align:justify">The husband&#8217;s case in his evidence was that it was completely untrue that he had ever expressed a wish to take a second wife (see paragraph 22 of his statement of 16 May 2017. He says that had he wanted to but he does not believe it would have been an issue for Nasreen. He links the ending of their relationship in Dubai to financial stresses rather than the second wife issue. His evidence on this was entirely unconvincing. At one point he seemed to be taking refuge in points about dates, at another he suggested that it was just a joke. The language used in the emails was far more consistent with him having made a serious reference to the possibility than to it being a joke. </p>
		    <p style="text-align:justify">The wife&#8217;s demeanour and account in relation to the question of a second marriage was clear and compelling. She was visibly distressed and spoke with real feeling about how she was British and was not interested in polygamy. She said that it was this issue which made the connection in her mind about the underlying reason for the husband&#8217;s reluctance to undertake a civil ceremony. Again the mother&#8217;s evidence had the quality of recalling a lived experience and I have no doubt that the husband had explored the possibility of taking a second wife and that this had created a huge amount of upset on top of the difficulties created by the financial crash. The wife&#8217;s evidence of how the husband put her under pressure saying that Islam permitted polygamy and that she was a bad Muslim and was rejecting the word of God shows a degree of emotional manipulation which is most unattractive. That the wife should end up effectively apologising for being a poor Muslim because she could not accept him taking a second wife shows how much she wanted to avoid confrontation and how she was prepared to allow the husband considerable liberty. It also confirms that his has the more traditional approach to Islam and the wife&#8217;s has a more modern and less fundamental approach.</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify">H says this was done without his knowledge or involvement. Again his evidence on this was that she had fabricated this based on documents she found when he left the home. That is therefore a suggestion that in 2016 the wife forged a document purporting to originate from 2014. The wife says that records at the firm she was working in would prove that it was done in 2014. I&#8217;m quite satisfied that the will arose in the context of a marriage still limping on and that it was drafted with the husband&#8217;s input.</p>
		    <p style="text-align:justify">Two thirds of his estate were left to W and the children.

The will identifies various debts including to his sister-in-law</p>
		    <p style="text-align:justify">H says it could not have been drafted then as he did not then own 216 Uxbridge Road. Given the completion date of that purchase it seems highly likely that 216 Uxbridge Road was his anticipated address and so it is probable it would have been included in the draft will.</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify">H says this was a gift and that they insisted he took the money. He asserts that this was part of a preconceived plan to make a claim over the property.</p>
		    <p style="text-align:justify">Although not central to the issues before me, his evidence on this was hard to follow. He was unable to give any explanation as to why his sister-in-law (particularly when he says the marriage had been over for three years) was gifting him such a very substantial sum of money. He also denied that the wife had been involved in the purchase at all. This was not consistent with the emails that the wife subsequently produced referred to above. His evidence that the wife and her sister were forcing him to do things does not seem consistent with his general nature which is a man of determination and force. I do not accept his account of the circumstances of the proposed purchase of 216 Uxbridge Road. In his evidence the husband essentially developed a conspiracy theory in which the wife and her sister plotted against the husband from 2014 all the way through to 2016 in order to take advantage of him. I do not accept that this was the case. I&#8217;m quite satisfied that this in the period from 2012 to 2016 the wife was still trying to make the marriage work as was he albeit it was on a steadily declining trajectory.</p>
		    <p style="text-align:justify">The provision of the money only makes sense in the context of the marriage being ongoing and the home being purchased for the family. The fact that it was purchased in H&#8217;s name alone rather than in joint names suggests that the husband adopted a more traditional approach than W. It also suggests that W did not either wish or feel able to press her case for joint ownership very hard.</p>

She is the sort who likes things to be by the book. Hence her detailed will drafting, her love of the law and her request for Islamic jurisprudence books as a dowry. The husband&#8217;s case that she has made up the discussions over the civil ceremony at the time of the wedding, and that she has made up every subsequent reference to it do not seem consistent with the general nature nor with her general demeanour in giving evidence. In general her evidence appeared more consistent with known fact and contemporary documents and appeared more connected to lived experiences than fabricated.</p>

Although a traditional Muslim and na&#239;ve in some respects she was not fundamentalist. I think she was quite meek. The husband in contrast would be dominant.

I doubt she would press her case particularly hard given her nature and his but I am satisfied it was discussed both shortly after the Nikah ceremony and for instance in 2001 when they changed their daughter&#8217;s name. Later it may have just been in passing. His evidence about the Walima being discussed several years after the marriage supports her account that these shortcomings were still live in her mind and as he brushed off the Walima with &#8216;it&#8217;s too late now; so I conclude he would have done with the civil registration. </p>

Bluff, genial, a bit of a charmer. Capable of being dishonest when sees it is adverse to his interests to tell the truth and is untroubled by this. He was obviously dishonest in relation to the second marriage issue. I need to give myself a Lucas direction in respect of his evidence. I accept that the fact that he lied about the second wife issue does not mean that he is lying about everything else or even anything else. However his general approach to matters of formalities, or the need for accuracy was far less evident than the wife&#8217;s. He was casual in relation to the accuracy of documents, in particular the Nikah certificate which he took responsibility for obtaining. It was submitted to the Dubai authorities even though he knew that it was inaccurate.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">He does not like to commit &#8211; preferring more general answers than specifics. I think he prefers to keep his options open, wanting freedom of action to do as he thinks fit at the time rather than tying himself down.  I thought his general personality suggested that he was motivated by looking for an edge or an advantage for him. What was in it for him? He is clearly a risk taker. Unless he sees a clear advantage to him he does not like to make commitments.  For instance, although I think he was more religious than the wife, he did not give his allegiance to the Sheikh whereas she did. I don&#8217;t think this illustrates she being more devout than he but rather she is more easily persuaded whereas he is reluctant to commit. Thus I can well understand that he may have not wanted a civil ceremony because there was nothing in it for him; he having secured his bride by the Nikah ceremony alone and having acquired all the advantages of a wife I conclude that seeing no advantage to him of going through with a civil ceremony that he fobbed the wife off taking advantage of her rather meek and undemanding nature and the disadvantage that she was at having moved to live with him become his wife spiritually and physically, I doubt that at that stage the husband had an eye to possible second marriage in future or even that he was specifically seeking to protect himself financially. Although he is highly money motivated (collected &#163;1.8m debts to get business back on feet) and I think quite self-centred I think it most probable that he simply could see no advantage for him in fulfilling the expectation that a civil ceremony would be undertaken. He is strong-willed and determined &#8211; I do not think things just slip with him &#8211; decisions are taken for a purpose and in this case it was ultimately his decision.</p>

I accept that it had been her genuine expectation that the Nikah ceremony would have been followed in a very short space of time by a Walima and by a civil ceremony arranged by the husband. I accept her evidence that she viewed the Nikah as only a part (albeit a significant part) of a broader process which she expected would include the civil ceremony as a less important but integral component of the whole. I accept her evidence that she and the husband had discussed the expectation that there would be a Walima and a civil ceremony in the weeks leading up to the wedding. I also accept that her father spoke to the husband about it as of course did the Imam. I cannot accept the husband&#8217;s evidence that the issue simply never arose between him and the wife. I therefore conclude that he either intended prior to the Nikah ceremony to organise the Walima and the civil ceremony but subsequently saw no advantage to him in seeing them through or that he led the wife to believe that he would undertake them but never truly intended to go through with it. </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Thus in every sense save for the issue of legal validity this was a marriage and a long one at that. It commenced with an agreement between the parties that they wished to marry each other and an understanding between them that they would undertake a Nikah, a civil ceremony and a Walima. Both parties were lawfully able to marry each other. Both gave their consent (I leave aside the question of whether the wife&#8217;s consent was obtained by misrepresentation of the husband&#8217;s intentions in relation to the Walima and civil ceremony). The ceremony was undertaken in front of the important members of their family and community. It was witnessed. It was conducted by an official in the religion which bound their consciences. Because of the husband&#8217;s actions the process which both had intended was not completed by the Walima and the civil ceremony. The wife committed herself emotionally religiously and physically to the marriage within a matter of days. This was followed by 18 years during which they considered themselves husband and wife. Every other person in their family and community considered them to be husband and wife. State authorities such as hospitals and schools (and I presume tax and benefits authorities), in England probably treated them as husband and wife. The state authorities of the United Arab Emirates treated them as husband-and-wife. The marriage produced four children. The trust was shattered by the husband&#8217;s proposal to take a second wife and thereafter the marriage limped to a conclusion in 2016.</p>

Prof Probert&#8217;s review makes clear the very different situations in which the presumption has been deployed over the 227 years it was born and the difficulty in defining a consistent approach.

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of the wife, Mr Le Grice QC did not advance a case for the application of the presumption in relation to the 1998 Nikah ceremony. What he principally focused on was the application of the presumption based rather on a presumed ceremony having taken place in the UAE. If such a ceremony took place it must have been by proxy on behalf of the wife because she had no knowledge of any such ceremony.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Al-Saedy v Muswai</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2010/3293" uk:canonical="[2010] EWHC 3293 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWHC 3293 (Fam)</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] 2 FLR 287" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] 2 FLR 287</ref> Bodey J reviewed the relevant principles and various authorities at paragraphs 60 to 71. The thrust of Bodey J&#8217;s reasoning was that if the parties&#8217; reputation as husband and wife derived from a particular ceremony and that ceremony were demonstrated not to be a valid marriage, then the presumption could not be relied on to establish that the parties were validly married. This is because the presumption cannot convert that which has shown to be invalid to be valid. He did, however, acknowledge that a petitioner might still exceptionally be able to rely on the presumption in support of some <span style="font-style:italic">other</span> marriage ceremony, of which she was unaware, <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">provided</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;that she is able to point to some evidential foundation for that possibility&#8221;</span>. As Bodey J explained, logically a petitioner must be unaware of such a ceremony, otherwise she would have given evidence of it. An example of such an evidential foundation would be where one party has signed a form of proxy. The underlying principled reason for the requirement of an evidential foundation was articulated by Bodey J in the final sentence of paragraph 71:</p>

In that case there was an evidential foundation arising out of the fact that the husband had been actively seeking to regularise the position as a matter of English law and to that end had been advised that the parties needed to divorce and re-marry abroad to create a marriage which would be recognised as valid in England. To that end the wife had signed a power of attorney which enabled her to be divorced and was accustomed to signing documents at the husband&#8217;s behest without appreciating what those documents were. The evidence established if the wife signed a power of attorney, the husband could marry her in an Islamic country without her knowledge and had been seeking to pursue a foreign marriage.   Mr Le Grice QC places particular emphasis on this decision (see paragraph 19 of his skeleton argument). It is submitted that it should be presumed that there was a valid marriage by proxy while they were living in the UAE or shortly before the wife joined Mr Khan. In support of this it is submitted that the fact that the husband was looking to prove marriage at that time by seeking evidence of the earlier Nikah brings the presumption into effect which itself supplies the evidence that there was a marriage unless contradicted by clear and weighty evidence that the presumption does not prove a marriage. Mr Le Grice QC&#8217;s reliance on this case though has to be viewed in the context of its facts which clearly provided an evidential basis where the presumption might operate.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The cases all establish that if the known ceremony is shown on the evidence not to create a valid English marriage that the presumption cannot apply.  The evidence of both the husband and the wife in this case establishes well beyond the balance of probabilities that the Nikah ceremony did not create a valid English marriage. It is clear, convincing and positive. For the &#8216;ceremony followed by cohabitation&#8217; presumption to apply on the basis of an assumed rather than actual ceremony I accept that there must be some evidential foundation of at least the possibility of a ceremony having been undertaken unknown to the wife. If there were to be no requirement for any evidential foundation it would in effect create a presumption indistinguishable from &#8216;cohabitation and reputation&#8217; presumption. I do not think the cohabitation and reputation presumption can be brought to bear where a known ceremony is demonstrated on the evidence not to have created a valid marriage. As Prof Probert makes clear in her article the presumption based on cohabitation and reputation arose from problems created by an evidential void or deficiency. It is difficult to see why as a matter of policy or justice it should be wheeled into action where the evidence is clear and complete.  The evidence in this case does not in my view provide any foundation for the possibility of a further ceremony in the UAE conducted without W&#8217;s knowledge. First of all the parties obtained a copy of their Nikah certificate in order to satisfy the UAE authorities that they were entitled to live together as husband and wife. Secondly there was no reason at all for the parties to need a further ceremony given that the UAE authorities had accepted the validity of their marriage for the purposes of residence in the UAE.  The wife does not suggest that the husband had expressed any desire to marry again in the UAE so as to create a valid marriage for English law purposes. Indeed her evidence is that he had declined to undertake a civil ceremony for just that purpose.  Nor does the wife suggest that she had at any stage signed a power of attorney or any other document which might have enabled the husband to arrange a ceremony by proxy. Nor is there any suggestion that the parties were Islamically divorced which might have been a necessary precondition for a further marriage ceremony in UAE. Thus the direct evidence of the parties discloses no evidential foundation for a presumed second ceremony on which the presumption can operate. There is therefore no burden on the husband to adduce clear, positive or convincing evidence to rebut it. </p>

Thus the event undertaken by actors in the wedding scenes of &#8216;four weddings and a funeral&#8217; can properly be described as a non-marriage; likewise children playing. Beyond that though the parties very much part company. The Attorney General, drawing on Bodey J&#8217;s judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Hudson v Leigh</span> (below), describes the phrase &#8216;non-marriage&#8217; as a convenient shorthand for describing something which is neither a valid or a void marriage.

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">On behalf of the wife Mr Le Grice QC argues that in interpreting <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> the court must proceed and act and give relief on principles and rules which are as nearly as may be conformable to the principles and rules on which the Ecclesiastical Courts acted prior to 1857.  It is on that basis that he argues that cases such as <span style="font-style:italic">Pertreis v Tondear</span> (1790) 1 Hagg Con 136 should be considered by this court (and should have been considered by the courts previously) in interpreting the true meaning and application of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref>. Mr Nagpal points out that section XXII of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Vict/20-21/85" uk:canonical="1857 (20 &amp; 21 Vict.) c. 85" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857</ref> expressly required the court to act in that way. He notes that its successor, the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/49" uk:canonical="1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5) c. 49" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Supreme Court of judicature (Consolidation) Act 1925</ref> also contained in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/49/section/32" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 32</ref> a requirement that the matrimonial jurisdiction be exercised as nearly as may be in the same manner as by the Ecclesiastical Court.  However he points out that there is no equivalent in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54" uk:canonical="1981 c. 54" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Senior Courts Act 1981</ref>.  Although I have not been taken to any Law commission, green or white paper or Hansard report on the circumstances in which the requirement came to be removed from the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54" uk:canonical="1981 c. 54" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Senior Courts Act 1981</ref> I think it reasonable to conclude that the omission of express reference was deliberate. That is hardly a surprise given the intervention of 134 years in which it might reasonably be thought that the principles and rules of the Ecclesiastical Courts had become embedded in the High Court family division in so far as they remained relevant.  I therefore do not consider that there is any statutory requirement to act in conformity with the approach of the Ecclesiastical Court prior to 1857.   In any event given the changes to the statutory framework in relation to nullity it would be difficult to directly transpose to the 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st </span>century the approach that the court took in 1790 in applying Lord Hardwicke&#8217;s 1753 Clandestine Marriages Act. The attorney general points out it seems clear that the Ecclesiastical Court regarded themselves as applying the universal law of Christian marriage; <span style="font-style:italic">Garthwaite v Garthwaite</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1964] P 356" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1964">[1964] P 356</ref>. Cases such as <span style="font-style:italic">Hyde v Hyde and Woodmansee </span>[1866] 1 LR P&amp;D 130 and <span style="font-style:italic">Risk v Risk (otherwise Yerburgh) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1951] P 51" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1951">[1951] P 51</ref> illustrate the court when it was under an express obligation to act in conformity with the practice of the Ecclesiastical Court refusing relief when the marriage was outside the Christian tradition.  It could be argued in the 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st </span>century it would be potentially discriminatory in the exercise of a general inherent jurisdiction to refuse relief simply because of the form of religion or because of a component feature of that religion. Mr Le Grice QC however accepted that there is no residual inherent power in the High Court to grant a decree of nullity save under statute. Thus it may not be open to the court to update the court&#8217;s approach using some sort of &#8216;filling in&#8217; aspect of the inherent jurisdiction; <span style="font-style:italic">A v Liverpool City Council</span><span/><span class="case" style="font-style:normal;color:initial"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1982] AC 363" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1982">[1982] AC 363</ref>;</span><span class="case" style="color:initial"/><span style="font-style:italic">Re X and Y</span><span/><span class="case" style="font-style:normal;color:initial"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2016/2271" uk:canonical="[2016] EWHC 2271 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWHC 2271 (Fam)</ref></span><span style="font-style:italic"/>at [31]&#8211;[50]. </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Ultimately, I agree with the position of the Attorney General although not without some reservation. The origins of the discrimination (if it exists) lies in the territory of status. This is dealt with in Article 12 of the ECHR which affords individuals a right to marry in accordance with national law. It is not asserted that there is discrimination in relation to the right to marry and it is accepted that the right to marry does not carry with it a right to divorce still less a right to nullity or a right not to be characterised as being in a non-marriage. The ability to mount a financial remedy claim ultimately derives from this categorisation. The substantive law of financial remedy is therefore accessible without discrimination but is dependent upon status. It seems to me therefore that Mr Le Grice QC&#8217;s argument is in reality an argument that Article 12 has a discriminatory effect but given that Article 12 does not confer a right to divorce or nullity if it is discriminatory it is not the content of a substantive right. Given there is no direct or indirect discrimination against a Muslim woman in bringing a financial remedy claim if she has obtained a decree of nullity, I conclude that there is no breach of the wife&#8217;s Article 6 and Article 14 rights in this regard.</p>

Furthermore, in the sphere of the state&#8217;s planned economic, fiscal or social policy, on which opinions within a democratic society may reasonably differ widely, that margin is necessarily wider.

For that reason the fact that the applicant does not have the status of heir, in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code governing inheritance and with the domestic social-security legislation, does not imply that there has been a breach of her rights under art.8.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Furthermore in terms of the obligation upon the court as a public authority it seems to me that it would be more appropriate to apply a term to the situation which is not as negative or potentially insulting as non-marriage is.  As the expression has originated from the courts that is an act of a public authority which it seems to me either does, or risks, infringing the Article 8 rights of couples to respect for their private and family life. Those who have religiously married and have lived for many years, raised families and been treated by the family community and state authorities as married should not have the term non-marriage applied to them. In the course of this hearing the expressions valid marriage, void marriage, voidable marriage have been used to describe the legal statuses provided for in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Marriage Act 1949</ref> and the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>. Whilst there may be a risk of confusion between void voidable and invalid it seems to me preferable to use the expression invalid marriage to describe a situation which is none of the other three. In my view the expression non-marriage should be reserved only to those situations such as acting or children playing where there has never been any intention to genuinely create a marriage.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Supreme Court has said that Article 8 ECHR should be viewed through the prism of Article 3 UNCRC. Thus the best interests of children as a primary consideration are a component of Article 8. The determination of whether this is a void or an invalid marriage is an action concerning the children. I therefore consider that in the interpretation of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref> or in its application the court should where it is appropriate be able to take into account the best interests of children. Whether this is seen as an aspect of the substantive right or an interpretive principle it seems to me does not matter as long as the court is able to take it into consideration. Given that it is a primary consideration their interests can of course be outweighed by other considerations including policy considerations. In a case where both parties had knowingly and voluntarily contracted a religious only marriage it might well be that respecting their autonomy and historic decision-making would outweigh the interests of the children.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Article 12 has not been expressly relied upon by Mr Le Grice QC as he accepts that the domestic law can properly impose formalities as to marriage. In this the attorney general agrees. Article 12 primarily addresses the rights of individuals to marry without appearance from the state. This however it seems to me there may be circumstances where Article 12 also has relevance in terms of its horizontal effect. In this case where the husband led the wife to believe that they would undertake a civil ceremony as part of the process of marrying and has thus left her in the situation where she does not have a marriage which is valid under English law the husband himself has infringed her right to marry. Once she had embarked on the process going through the Nikah ceremony and consummating the marriage, notwithstanding Ms Rhone-Adrien&#8217;s assertion that she could have left the marriage at any stage, the reality for this wife and I suppose many others in her situation is that this was not a realistic option for her. Thus if this marriage is not a valid marriage according to English law nor a void marriage she is left without the remedies which arise from divorce or nullity. It seems to me this must be a relevant consideration in the evaluation of whether on these facts this should be treated as a void marriage. Although usually deployed in the context of property rights, the equitable maxim that equity treats as done that which ought to be done and that equity focuses on intent not form (see Snell&#8217;s Equity 33<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> edition 5-015) seems to me capable of informing how the court might approach the interpretation of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref> or its application. Whilst the equitable maxim cannot it seems be used to create something which is only capable of legal creation by fulfilling statutory conditions (i.e. a legal interest in land cannot be created unless <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/34/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/34" uk:canonical="1989 c. 34" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989</ref> are met) it can create equitable rights. In this case it could not create a valid marriage but seems to me this approach supports the conclusion that in determining whether on the facts of this case whether what happened created a void marriage I can treat the joint intention of the parties to undertake a civil ceremony which was not then seen through by the husband&#8217;s as supporting the conclusion that this was a void marriage</p>

The same would apply if she obtained a decree of nullity. I assume for the purposes of this that that assertion is correct. From a point of logic it seems curious that a spouse can acquire a share in matrimonial property when in void marriage situations there has never been a valid marriage to generate rights arising out of marriage. That suggests that it is not the existence of a valid marriage that is the source of the rights but is based on the partnership of two individuals living together as husband-and-wife. </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I prefer the Attorney General&#8217;s arguments on this point. Cohabitees, however long they have lived together and however many children they have do not acquire any rights of property merely by cohabiting. They may do so independently on the principles applicable to implied, constructive or resulting trusts. Those would give true rights in property. The unascertained right to a share of the matrimonial property seems to me dependent upon establishing that there is either a valid or a void marriage and thus there is no potential property right infringed until that is established. I therefore do not consider that the A1 P1 argument assists either in respect of an assertion that a determination of non-marriage infringes rights or that the court should interpret <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref> so as to act compatibly with A1 P1 rights.</p>

Whilst I appreciate Mr Nagpal&#8217;s point on behalf of the Attorney General that a void marriage indicates it was void from its inception (i.e. was never a marriage at all) and thus is indistinguishable from a non-marriage in terms of legal status there is plainly a difference in ordinary perception but also in the remedies which flow from the different status.</p>
