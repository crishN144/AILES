	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This has been the concluding part of care proceedings for two children. It has been the sequel to a lengthy fact finding hearing affecting this and two other inter-related families on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March this year. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The process this week has been more than usually distressing for the parents and maternal grandmother because they have had to contend with an unexpected change of position on the part of the Children&#8217;s Guardian, Karen Gorbutt. Whereas it had been her position until just last week that she appeared to be supporting a placement for both children within a long term foster home, since the second day of the hearing, Wednesday, Ms Gorbutt has instead aligned herself entirely with the local authority which seeks care and placement orders as the first step towards adoption.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_3">
	  <num>3.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Gorbutt is, I know, regretful that the parents in particular have had to confront what they have undoubtedly seen as very bad news when they had  been expecting support from her. It has been and remains their hope that they would be able, long term and throughout the children&#8217;s minorities, to maintain contact with them whilst they made their home with foster parents.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_4">
	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It should be acknowledged in her favour that Ms Gorbutt spent an appreciable part of Wednesday morning explaining to both parents &#8211; and later on the grandmother as well &#8211; the reasons which lay behind her changed position. The mother should be given credit, as Ms Gorbutt has commented, for responding with dignity to what she was being told. The father was extremely courageous when on Wednesday afternoon he agreed with my suggestion that he might explain his position in his own words from the witness box. Through his very understandable and utterly genuine tears, he told me he understands his children need permanency. His only concern is that they should not lose the sense of who their parents are. He knows that what is required by the children is stability. He did not need to say that the situation is nothing short of heart breaking for him. That much was clear for everyone to see, as it is I&#8217;m quite sure, for the mother as well.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father has remained in court throughout. The mother was too distressed to come in at all on Wednesday. No one could blame her. The grandmother, who could not be at court on Wednesday morning because she had to attend an important appointment, chose not to come in to listen to the guardian&#8217;s evidence that afternoon given her grief at the change in Ms Gorbutt&#8217;s position. Again, her choice was altogether understandable.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The children for whom a decision is both urgent and overdue are Ct who is just 7 years old, born in May 2006, and Cm who was born in June 2009 so he is only 4. The background to these proceedings requires no repetition here. It was dealt with extensively during the March 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> judgment. Nor is it necessary to repeat what I said about the parents and the maternal grandmother. All of that is a matter of record. This judgment has to be seen for what it is &#8211; the sequel to that which came before.</p>

	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Since the hearing in February, there have been a few developments of significance. First, a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist, Dr Mike Blows, was instructed to advise to assist the local authority and the court in relation to care planning for the children; and in particular as to whether long term fostering or adoption would better meet their welfare needs. He was requested to assess attachments between the adults and children as well as between the siblings and also to make recommendation about contact. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Blows carried out his inquiries and interviews in late April and produced his report on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> June, well after the due date of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May. Somewhat mysteriously, the report bears the date 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May which Dr Blows accepts is an error. Be that as it may.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_10">
	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The other development of some significance is that the mother who had been living in the Birmingham area at the time of the February hearing has moved to live with her father and his partner in Cornwall. She has continued to come to London for contact with the children and continues to show great commitment to them as indeed does their father.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties&#8217; positions on the key issue are simply stated. In her heart, I&#8217;m quite sure the mother would wish above all else that she were able to make a case for the children to come back to live with her. The statement she made a week ago makes that abundantly clear and notwithstanding the welfare decisions made at the February hearing. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_12">
	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the end of the February hearing, I ruled out any prospect of the children being placed back with their mother or indeed their father. Last week, in the light of AP&#8217;s recent lengthy statement in which she made clear she wished nonetheless to be reunited with the children at her father&#8217;s home in Cornwall, it was necessary for me to set out the stark realities, which I did. </p>

	  <num>13.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">AP&#8217;s secondary position, advanced on her behalf by Ms Troy, is to seek to achieve a result which would enable her to continue to have face to face contact with the children. She wishes, relying on Dr Blows&#8217; advice, that Ct and Cm should be placed with long term foster parents (she would consent to a care order formulated on that basis), and she would wish to see them as much as possible; no doubt, in surroundings which are as natural as can be arranged. AP would be quite content to share contact visits with the children&#8217;s father, GL.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_14">
	  <num>14.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father, GL, is to be admired as I&#8217;ve said already for his insight and ability to look at the issue of what should happen to the children with their interests rather than his own at the forefront. GL does not oppose but neither can he bring himself to consent to the making of placement orders. He is able to understand what the children need in a way that very few parents caught up in care proceedings can because, for the most part, their own wishes take priority. I found his altruism both commendable and humbling.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_15">
	  <num>15.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The children&#8217;s maternal grandmother, RC, invites me to accept Dr Blows&#8217; written evidence in which he said, contrary to the opinion he expressed orally, that RC is an attachment figure for the children. Miss Magee suggests the search for adoptive parents should be brought to an end at the six month point, as had been suggested by evidence given at the February hearing by another member of the family finding team, Sammy Forbes. However, RC does not suggest the search for an adoptive family should be made more complicated by imposing a pre-condition of ongoing face to face contact.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Blows&#8217; contribution has had a very considerable impact upon this process, as would be expected given his expertise and the extent to which it had been thought he would have been able to assist in decision making. Judges and practitioners from whichever discipline, legal or social work, repose trust in experts, be they psychiatrists or psychologists, to provide helpful analysis in relation to the key questions asked and make recommendations upon welfare issues in line with mainstream thinking. Indeed many experts nowadays will include a few short sentences within the body or at the end of their reports indicating, one way or the other, whether their opinions and advice would be viewed by others within their specialty as conventional. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Blows was instructed on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2013.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The report, when it came, extended to 75 pages. It contained inordinately detailed, almost minute by minute, accounts of Dr Blows&#8217; observations made at contact visits as between the children, their mother, their father and then their mother and grandmother together, three in all. There were also recitals of the extensive and minutely detailed discussions Dr Blows had with the mother, the father and the children&#8217;s short term foster parents. He saw and interviewed the children. He carried out a School Age Assessment of Attachment in relation to Ct.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is only on page 55 of his report that Dr Blows begins to confront the questions asked of him. He referred to what had been described by Miss Gillard as &#8220;insecure and ambivalent attachment patterns&#8221; as between the children, their mother and grandmother, less evident with the father. Nine pages of Dr Blows&#8217; conclusions are devoted to what he prefers to refer to as &#8220;Type C attachment strategies.&#8221; He provides a great deal of detail as to what that means for the children&#8217;s behaviour, their patterns of interacting with their parents, grandmother and also their foster parents. </p>

	  <num>20.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In just three pages, Dr Blows deals with what might have been thought to be the questions of overriding importance at this hearing, namely those directed at the children&#8217;s future placement needs. He begins with this &#8211; that &#8220;there is a potential risk for adoption, by dint of their age; in particular Ct, and long term fostering because of the high rates of placement breakdown.&#8221; He then deals with the sibling relationship and concludes that the children should be placed together. No one at this hearing, I should make clear, has suggested any other course should be followed.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_21">
	  <num>21.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Blows comments extensively in this section of his report with Ct&#8217;s coercive behaviour and that, at her age, establishing new more adaptive attachment relationships will be more difficult.  He opines that a complete cessation of Ct&#8217;s relationship with her mother will be felt as a loss (which her strategy is set up to avoid) and that it will be difficult for her future carers to remove that sense of potential or impending loss. He thinks it likely, even with a less maladaptive strategy Ct will continue to be anxious and coercive in her future relationships. She will be particularly at risk of presenting with somatic symptoms such as getting attention or showing protest through aches and pains or struggles over normal functions (currently her eating).</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_22">
	  <num>22.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his next paragraph, Dr Blows says this &#8211; &#8220;Ideally then, given the risk of the next new carers, the children should stay with their current foster carers long term. I don&#8217;t know, but assuming that this isn&#8217;t possible, then on balance I would recommend long term fostering.&#8221; I pause to mention that throughout the time the children have lived in foster care, it has been clear that there is no possibility of them being able to stay where they are. The foster parents are short term foster parents and do not wish to be considered for a long term role of any kind.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_23">
	  <num>23.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Blows provides two reasons to support his long term fostering recommendation, as follows &#8211; &#8220;&#8230;. by dint of their age; I think there is less likely to be an advantage in reduced placement breakdown rates of adoption, compared to long term fostering. If both children were pre-school, I think this balance of risk would be less, with adoption. The second strand of his argument is that, &#8220;There is also the added risk that it is harder to find adoptive parents of two children of this age, and that family finding can take a long time, adding to the risk of moving from an established foster placement to another new carer.&#8221; He then added that the &#8220;risk of placement breakdown in long term foster placements is around 40-50%&#8221;.</p>

It is, he said, the opposite of what you would expect. Dr Blows believes there &#8220;is a lot of risk to come in the next 12 &#8211; 15 month period which will make it more difficult for Ct to make &#8220;an adaptive relationship with a new carer.&#8221; But he added, &#8220;we have got a window of 3 to 4 years. If she is moved now, we will have some chance of reparation.&#8221; In answer to questions posed by Ms Troy, Dr Blows said that &#8220;within 6 months from now, Ct&#8217;s behaviour will start to get worse.&#8221; He is not saying her behaviour may get worse or that in all probability it will deteriorate, Dr Blows says, categorically, it will get worse and in 6 months time.</p>

Nor was there a need to deal, as Dr Blows did in his discussion with the mother (2 hours over the telephone) with the physical circumstances surrounding the birth of the two children or what her own mother did when she was naughty as a child.

He ought to have considered and discussed the relative advantages of adoption. There is not one word, anywhere in his report, about the children&#8217;s need for stability, security and for the assurance that those who will be looking after them for the remainder of their minority are fully committed to them. Nor is there any elaboration of the various obvious disadvantages for the children of continuing to be &#8220;looked after children&#8221; for the next 11 and 14 years respectively, as would be the case if they were to live with foster parents. Nor does Dr Blows confront the obvious and very disadvantageous emotional consequences for the children of the potential for further disrupted placements. </p>

Either I should have suggested to the local authority that the evidence required could have come from a combination of the allocated social worker and a manager within the family finding team; or Amanda Gillard, the independent social worker who has already provided truly excellent assessment reports in these proceedings should have been approached again.

As she said, losses of that kind are what professionals in the field &#8220;deal with all the time in cases of this kind.&#8221; Contact, which may be face to face or indirect is &#8220;always about promoting identity and mitigating against unresolved loss.&#8221; Ms Gorbutt could not agree with Dr Blows as to the preference he accorded to long term fostering because, as she said, there are &#8220;too many variables&#8221; and permanency by adoption offers a better chance for children with &#8220;less of the risk factors.&#8221;</p>
