The SSHD invites the court to consider the application to revoke the adoption order with anxious scrutiny and has confirmed that if T&#8217;s adoption is revoked that will not affect her British citizenship, which she would retain. ZH has applied for asylum, this was refused on 7 January 2019 and that decision and has been appealed. ZH has been granted a renewable term of 30 months leave to remain as T&#8217;s parent. </p>

This obligation is more onerous in non-agency adoption applications and should, in my judgment, always involve some legal advice. Any report directed must cover the matters specified in PD14C, which sets out a comprehensive list of what the report is required to address. Such a report needs to be prepared within a robust framework in the local authority that will provide effective scrutiny of that report (both legal and social work) so as to consider whether it contains the relevant information as required by the FPR 2010 and PD14C. Such a framework should provide, at the very least, for the report to be signed off by the team manager, as well as active supervision during the preparation of the report and consideration whether any further directions need to be sought from the court. The local authority in this case accept the wholesale failure by them to undertake the necessary enquiries as were required of them by PD14C. They were, in my judgment, right to do so. It was an institutional failure where no framework was in place to ensure these important reports, that affect the legal status of children, are prepared in accordance with the FPR 2010 and PD14C. TS, the team manager, has confirmed in her most recent statement the changes in practice at the local authority. I will direct that the Head of Service at the local authority shall write to the court setting out the revised procedures that have been put in place relating to the preparation of Annex A reports.    </p>

Moreover, it must always be remembered that, in the context of such factors, the checklist demands consideration of the likely effect on the child throughout her life of having ceased to be a member of her original family. Mere lip service to such matters is not enough. The approach, both of the witnesses and of the judge, must be rigorous, analytical and properly reasoned, never forgetting that adoption is permissible only as a "last resort" and only if a comprehensive analysis of the child's circumstances in every aspect &#8211; including the child's national, cultural, linguistic, ethnic and religious background &#8211; leads the court to the conclusion that the overriding requirements of the child's welfare justify adoption.&#8221; </span>([105])  </p>

The first of these are the natural parents of the adopted person, who by adoption divest themselves of all rights and responsibilities in relation to that person. The second party is the adoptive parents, who assume the rights and responsibilities of parents in relation to the adopted person.

The social worker author records at the start of her report that she started working for the adoption and fostering team on 1 August 2016. This may well have been her first report. What was so concerning about the report was the apparent failure to deal with the issue of parental consent. It equated the father&#8217;s agreement 9 months previously to his sister caring for T to consent to adoption, without any caveats or any indication in the report that she had not spoken directly to the father. In relation to the mother she simply failed to consider what was required in terms of any steps that could be taken to locate her.  The report failed to provide any assessment of the relative merits of adoption and other orders either in her report or in her discussions with HS and MO. No consideration is given to the distortion in family relationships that would be brought about if an adoption order was made, or the availability of other orders that would give HS and MO parental responsibility without the need to change to change T&#8217;s status with her birth parents. As I have set out this was, in my judgment, an institutional failure by this local authority. The author of the Annex A report was very recently appointed to the adoption team, was not supervised or, as far as this court is aware, given any guidance or training relating to writing these reports. </p>

Whilst this can in part be explained by reliance on the flawed Annex A report there was a failure to join the child and appoint a Children&#8217;s Guardian, engage with the issue of the mother&#8217;s consent and despite the Annex A report recording that the medical assessments of HS and MO were outstanding, as well as the DBS checks, the court proceeded to make a final order.

Judge&#8217;s frequently request social workers to undertake such a task in Non-Agency adoptions and to provide evidence to the Court to confirm that this has been done or that all reasonable efforts to do so have been made.  This has particular importance in cases where the parent is overseas. Where the applicant(s) have applied for a serial number to preserve anonymity, the information that can be shared with relevant birth parent may be very limited or subject to the court&#8217;s directions.
