Plans to carry out a pre-birth assessment of the Mother were overtaken by the Mother&#8217;s ill-health during the pregnancy. A safety plan was put in place which saw R remaining with the Mother after she was born, however in July 2021 the Mother&#8217;s car was the subject of an arson attack and R was removed from her care. The Father pleaded guilty to the arson attack as a result of which he was imprisoned. In the aftermath of the attack the Father indicated that he was likely to be R&#8217;s father. This was confirmed by DNA testing and the Father subsequently said that he wished to be assessed to care for her.</span></p>

Instead of realising the value of the opportunity that she had been given, she failed to work openly with them, and in doing so she exposed both herself and R to significant risks. Even two years into these proceedings her lack of openness in the parenting assessment demonstrates that she has still not learnt that safeguarding children requires professionals to be made aware of all potential risks that they may be exposed to.</span></p>

It appears to the Court that it would not be appropriate to infer that they were committed to the process. They have their own children and Mr F is busy with work. The Father is a dangerous individual, and the documents suggest that they were informed as to the risks that the Father or his associates may present to them and their family. There could be a number of reasons why they would not be committed to the process. I accept the evidence from CW that she made substantial efforts to complete the assessment process and I accept her opinion that the carers did not demonstrate the level of commitment expected to care for R by ensuring that the sessions were attended or appropriately rescheduled. There are no other positively assessed alternative carers.</span></p>

There is a dearth of available foster places at present. Foster placements regularly end and can end at short notice. There are real concerns that foster care can result in a lack of permanence and can be significantly damaging to a child&#8217;s identity and their ability to form attachments. The stigma of being a looked after child can weigh heavily on children and repeated exposure to parents who are dangerous or inconsistent, as I have found is the case here, could severely harm a child&#8217;s development and sense of identity. </span></p>

It cannot be understated how harmful this extended period of foster care will have likely been for her. The period between birth and two years old is the time when the majority of attachments are made by a child. She has been denied the opportunity to make attachments and form bonds with her permanent carers for an extraordinary period of time. Having considered all of the options in the round I am of the view that only adoption will do. R remains a young child and there will be optimism that she can be matched in fairly short order.</span></p>

Each parent may argue that they have not been given the chance to prove that they can care for the child, but the main potential stressor has been absent whilst they look to make changes and yet positive change cannot be demonstrated. Even without R&#8217;s presence the Mother has not managed to reach a position where a return to her is a viable prospect notwithstanding the length of proceedings and I find that she is unlikely to be able to maintain changes within R&#8217;s timescales, having regard to the test in </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Re S (A Child)</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> [2014] EWCC B44 in respect of which I made findings earlier when I considered her evidence.</span></p>

If placed for adoption R will grow up in the knowledge that her adoptive family are only a part of her history and that her understanding of the remainder of her history is limited, although she will have life story work to help bridge the gaps. That work can help bridge any cultural absences that may result from the separation with her mixed heritage parents, She is still young, and she remains at an age where she will have an opportunity to form settled and secure emotional attachments to her adoptive family. The clear harm caused by the likely loss of her sibling relationships is likely to be outweighed by the permanence to be provided to her by an adoption order and there is some, albeit limited, hope that the relationship could be maintained. I accept the professional evidence from NM and the Guardian in that respect.</span></p>
