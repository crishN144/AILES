The parties who have been represented at this hearing are the wife, represented by Mr. Turner, QC, Mr. Harrison, QC and Mr. Hagen; the husband, represented by Mr. Howard, QC, Mr. Oliver and Mr. Hilliard; and the adult beneficiaries represented by Mr. Pocock, QC and Miss Moys.</span></p>

The scope of the conflict in those proceedings can be seen from the fact that in his open offer the husband proposes that the wife should receive &#163;2 million, while in her open offer the wife proposes that she should receive &#163;120 million.  When the parties are as far apart as that, the litigation risk which they both appear to be embracing is clearly very significant.  </span></p>

They are the adult beneficiaries who are applying to be joined to these proceedings.  </span></p>

In addition, he is the principal beneficiary of five trusts, all of which are agreed or accepted to be nuptial settlements and which hold assets valued at approximately &#163;20 million.  The husband accepts that the assets held within these trusts are resources available to him and, as I understand it, can effectively be treated as his assets.   </span></p>

The wife is also a beneficiary of various family trusts, including a sub-fund established in 2007 called the Lizella Trust of which the wife and her children, and remoter issue, are the only beneficiaries.  The husband is specifically excluded from being a beneficiary.  The Lizella Trust received assets worth, it would seem, somewhere in the region of &#163;15 million.  The wife is also a potential beneficiary of other family trusts.  It is not clear to me at the moment what resources are held within those trusts.  Certain of the documents which I have seen suggest that they are substantially in debt. </span></p>

During the course of his submissions Mr. Turner expressly said that the wife is not advancing any case in reliance on the needs principle.  Put very simply the wife's claim is to a share of the assets generated during the course of the marriage, the most significant of which is the sum of approximately &#163;250 million which was made from the acquisition, and then later sale, of a company called Whyte &amp; Mackay.  The acquisition took place in or about 2001; the sale took place in 2007.   All the profit was - and insofar as it remains, is - held within a trust structure because the husband conducted, and conducts, his business affairs through the vehicle of companies held within a trust structure.   </span></p>

The structure which holds this wealth consists of approximately ten trusts, of which neither the husband nor the wife are named beneficiaries.   If the husband were added as a beneficiary, the wife, as I understand it, could not under the terms of all but one of the trusts be made a beneficiary; and vice versa.  The only named beneficiaries, save for a charity, are the husband's parents, the husband's adult children by his first marriage, the child of this marriage, and a grandchild of the husband's (being the daughter of Bianca).  They are all discretionary trusts and hold assets, as I have said, believed to be worth in the region of &#163;130 million. </span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">These trusts were settled by the husband's father in 2008.  Essentially, again as I understand it, the assets of earlier trusts, which (or some of which) had been settled by the husband, were appointed out to the husband's father, clearly with the intention that he would re-settle them as he did.  There is a dispute as to the motivation for the assets being re-settled in this way.   In part, it appears to have been motivated by anticipated or proposed tax changes and, in part, it is alleged by the wife, it was to seek to shelter the assets from any claim she might have, or make, on a divorce.  </span></p>

In other words, both the trustees and the children clearly took the view that it was not in the interests of the various trusts for them - the trustees - to participate as parties in these proceedings.  At present I have not been told why they took this view, but it is not difficult to come to the tentative conclusion that it is to enable them in due course more easily to submit to the courts of the trusts' home jurisdictions that any order which this court might make should not be enforced.   I say this because in a decision of the Royal Court of Jersey, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">In The Matter of the H Trust</span><span style="font-size:14pt">, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">X Trust Company Limited v RW and Six Others</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> [2006] JLR 280, Birt DB (as he then was), said at para. 15, </span></p>

All three of us either work professionally for a business owned by the settlements, or intend to do so in the future.  I am the Executive Director of Earlcrown, the property development and project management arm of the family activities.  I have worked full-time in this role for five years now, and I am fully committed to this work notwithstanding having a young daughter.  I work on particular property-related projects which are then developed - with funding from the settlements - and usually sold on.  Megan is the lead interior designer, currently part-time, but her role is increasing. We are building up a major business.   Jess is training at Bain &amp; Co., the global management consultants, in order to give him a broad grounding in business: he is being groomed to join, and ultimately to take a lead role in, the family enterprises.</span></p>

The Family Division is concerned to do justice between the two spouses before it.   It is sitting in a matrimonial context and its objective is to achieve a fair allocation of assets between those spouses.  It has no mandate to consider the interests of the other beneficiaries of any trust involved.  Conversely, this court is sitting in its supervisory role in respect of trusts, as is regularly done in the Chancery Division of the English High Court. This court's primary consideration is to make or approve decisions in the interests of the beneficiaries.  It has, therefore, a very different focus from the Family Division.</span></p>

To do so would be to confer an enforceable power upon the overseas court to act to the detriment of the beneficiaries of a trust when the primary focus of that court is the interests of the two spouses before it.  It is more likely to be in the interests of a Jersey trust and the beneficiaries thereunder to preserve the freedom of action of both the trustee and this court to act as appropriate following and taking full account of the decision of the overseas court.  We have said this is likely to be the case in most circumstances.  In some cases, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">e.g.</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> where all the trust assets are in England, it may well be in the interests of a trustee to appear before the English court in order to put forward its point of view because, by reason of the location of the assets, that court would be able to enforce its order without regard to the trustee or this court.</span></p>

Far from it.   That court will have investigated the matter very fully and will have made a decision intended to achieve a fair allocation as between the spouses.  In such cases, the interests of comity, as well as the interests of the beneficiaries will often point strongly in favour of this court making an order which achieves the result contemplated by the order of the Family Division.  Indeed, this court has made such orders in the past and will no doubt do so again in the future.  But, the significant factor from the point of view of whether the trustees should submit to the jurisdiction of the overseas court is that it will remain a matter of discretion for this court as to the course it should take in the light of the overseas order if the trustee has not submitted, whereas if the trustee has submitted, the overseas order is likely to be enforced without reconsideration of the merits.  For these reasons we approve the trustees' decision not to submit to the jurisdiction of the Family Division in this case.</span></p>

It seems to us important in this case that the husband and the wife should have the fullest information concerning the financial affairs of the trust so that any compromise which they reach, failing which any decision of the Family Division, is based upon the true financial position.  It is our understanding that the wife has received the necessary information, but if this understanding is incorrect and further information is requested, the trustees should make the fullest information available to both parties and through them to the Family Division should this become necessary".</span></p>

If I have understood these comments correctly they do not, with respect, reflect the approach taken by the English court.  Indeed, at an earlier hearing in these proceedings Baron J said, "The court is going to be concerned to protect their interests --", 'their interests' being the interests of the beneficiaries of the trusts.   She then added, "-- to protect Mr. Imerman's interests and to be fair to Mrs. Tchenguiz".</span></p>

The proposed variation is, as I understand it, for the payment of a substantial lump sum from the trusts' assets, out of the trusts, for the benefit of the wife.  In my view the only correct conclusion for me to draw is that the proposed variation does potentially adversely affect the rights or interests of the child of the family because it would result in a very substantial diminution of the resources held within the trust of which this child is one of the potential beneficiaries.   It would potentially have a very real effect on her rights or interests. </span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I am concerned as to who should be speaking on behalf of the child and who should be putting forward arguments as to how the child should be separately represented.   Both the minor children were separately represented during the course of the proceedings in Jersey and in the British Virgin Islands by a Jersey advocate who acted on behalf of them both.  In my view the trustees should be deciding - or at least putting forward their views - as to who should separately represent the child of the family for the purposes of this application (in other words the wife's financial remedy application, and specifically her application for a variation of settlement).   I do not consider it disproportionate or likely to result in any substantial delay if I put over the resolution of how the minor children should be represented to give the trustees an opportunity to express their views of the manner in which the child should be separately represented in accordance with Rule 9.11.</span></p>

In my judgment the stance they have now taken has been inconsistent with the position they took before the courts in Jersey and the BVI.  Even though it was limited to supporting the trustees, it did consist of supporting the trustees in not participating in these proceedings as parties. That is inconsistent with their application to be joined as parties to these proceedings on the basis that their interests are being fundamentally attacked.  Their interests are, in my judgment, broadly coincidental with the interests of the trusts more generally.   So, the trusts&#8217; interests are directly being attacked.   It might, therefore, have been considered appropriate for the trustees to participate as parties in these proceedings save for the approach outlined in the judgment of Birt DB in the decision of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">In Re H Trust</span><span style="font-size:14pt">. </span></p>

I do not, therefore, consider it just that they should have an order for their costs to be paid by the wife.  In my judgment the merits are best met by my making no order as to costs in respect of their application.  </span></p>
