In 2016  he was detained under section 3 Mental Health Act and placed at a hospital unit. In 2017 he was determined to lack capacity to consent to his detention and treatment under the Mental Capacity Act.  He was moved to a different placement which specialised in working with young people with sexually problematic behaviours. In 2017 DY pleaded guilty to two offences of sexual assault of a girl aged under 13, and received a 26 month Youth Rehabilitation Order. He was placed on the sex offender&#8217;s Register for 5 years with a concurrent Sexual Harm Prevention Order (which expires in March 2023) with a residence requirement and curfew. He is prohibited from having contact with children under 16 save as is inadvertent and not reasonably avoidable in the course of daily life.  He was referred to MAPPA and has been assessed as a category 1 offender requiring level 2 management. As of June 2021 he was still considered a high risk to children and known adults. To his mother he poses a risk of violence and sexual assault. To children he poses a risk of sexual assault.  </span></p>

There is no doubt that he poses a risk to the public, but it is also clear that it would be very harmful to DY himself were he to commit further offences.  DY is a young person who is vulnerable and has engaged in self harming behaviour (albeit not recently). The social worker stated in her evidence that when DY becomes stressed and anxious that this leads to him ruminating and in turn puts him at risk of self harm.  If he were to reoffend he would be very distressed, and engage in self loathing.  There would also be the risk of retribution from the public. I agree with Lieven J in </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt">Birmingham City Council v SR; Lancashire County Council v JTA </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2019/28" uk:canonical="[2019] EWCOP 28" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] EWCOP 28</ref></span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt"> that it is a false dichotomy to conclude that the protection of P cannot also include protecting him from harming members of the public. As in that case, it is strongly in DY&#8217;s best interests not to commit further offences, or place himself at risk of further criminal sanctions.  In my judgment this falls squarely within the meaning of the qualifying requirement in paragraph 16 schedule A1, &#8216;to prevent harm to the relevant person&#8217;. That this harm would come about by his harming others does not detract from this. </span></p>

One minute he would say he wanted to live his life without restrictions and another he would then say he had to have support.  Then he would say he has learned ways to cope over the years, and follow this by saying that it was staff who kept him safe. These contradictions in his answers was a factor in her conclusions that whilst understanding and retaining relevant information he could not use or weigh it.

As an example she said that when discussing how he might control his urges to sexually assault a child if he was out in the community alone he suggested using distraction techniques of drinking a hot drink or eating chilli or spicy food without considering how realistic or practical this was.  When challenged about this he acknowledged that that it was not.  When DY went out into the community with the social worker he did not take a hot drink with him, nor did he appear to think about this at all.  In further discussions he was unable to say how things would be if he was in the community without staff to support him.

He was also aware of the consequences of refusal or withdrawal of care and that care can currently be enforced as a component of the Standard Authorisation and DOL. Perhaps most importantly, he was able to set out a level of care that he believed would be both sufficient, beneficial and would balance his own wishes for a greater degree of autonomy and independence with an umbrella of oversight and protection.  Dr. Ince acknowledged that there is a relevant issue as to the degree to which DY&#8217;s decisions as to his care needs and supervision are impaired at times of sexual pre-occupation and whether this would constitute a fluctuating picture of capacity and lack of it, but by reference to Finklehor&#8217;s model he concluded that the fact that DY can make impulsive decisions regarding further offending does not lead him to make what he describes as an intuitive leap that these are due to an absence of capacity. </span></p>

He emphasized that DY has an understanding of his offending, his victim profile and consequences of offending and that there is no suggestion he would be unable to plead in a criminal trial.  He concluded that DY&#8217;s understanding was relatively sophisticated, that it was consistent with his cognitive functioning, and that it was not mere repetition. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt">Having considered all the evidence and submissions, I have come to the conclusion on the balance of probability that DY has capacity to make decisions as to his care and support. I accept Dr. Ince&#8217;s evidence.  In arguing otherwise, it seems to me that the respondents are setting the bar of capacity at too high a level. In the final analysis, their arguments relied heavily on the fact that DY makes contradictory statements about his need for care and supervision, that he was inclined not to think things through and that fact that he can overestimate his abilities.  In doing these things, DY is no different from many people who do have capacity. People with capacity can make unwise decisions and act on impulse. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt">When interviewed by Dr. Ince DY was honest about the risks he posed, and was able to express his fear of what would happen to him if he committed another offence. I agree with his conclusions that DY was not merely repeating what he had been told or saying what the interviewer wished to hear.  I do not accept the respondents&#8217; submissions that Dr. Ince asked himself the wrong questions or relied too heavily on DY being able to describe the risk factors rather than being able to show what benefit his care and support offers him. It is very difficult for DY to demonstrate the benefit to him in circumstances where he has not experienced being without it (a situation he himself recognises).   I reject the submission that Dr. Ince did not appear to consider the impact of the interplay between  DY&#8217;s paedophilic or paraphilic disorder, his anxiety and his autism, for he discussed and explained this at length in his evidence.  DY has an impairment/disturbance of the mind or brain by reason of his ASD and accompanying anxiety, but Dr Ince does not accept the additional diagnosis of paraphilia is relevant in this context or that the fact that DY can make impulsive decisions regarding further offending is due to lack of capacity. </span></p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt">I entirely appreciate why the respondents in this case are so concerned, because there is a high risk that DY will reoffend if he is given the opportunity to do so.  If he is allowed to make decisions for himself he could go out alone, and in doing so he could  put others and himself at risk by acting impulsively and committing a sexual assault.  Those responsible for his care are undoubtedly very worried about the effect upon him (and of course others too) were he to do this.  Anyone responsible would be concerned about this, as I am myself. But Dr. Ince is right that any further offending is a matter for the Criminal Justice System. The current SHPO is an example of such risk management.  The truth is that most sexual offenders and risky adults have capacity, and, like DY are not to be managed by a Deprivation of Liberty within the provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>. </span></p>

This means that DY will no longer be subject to a Deprivation of Liberty Authorisation.  He will, however, continue to be offered the same care package he now has (including help with his daily living and medication), and he will be strongly encouraged to continue to be accompanied by at least one care worker whenever he goes out.  What this decision changes is that DY will no longer be compelled to accept what is on offer, but I sincerely hope that he does. </span></p>
