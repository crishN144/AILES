Although the father has family there, he was brought up here and is a British citizen.  During the course of their marriage the parents lived separately. The mother, H and then C lived in Y Country and the father here although he visited Y Country (which is in South Asia) from time to time.  In 2012 the father married a second wife, AA.   He brought her to live with him in England, and they have two children.</p>

She said that the father had told her that she could follow the children to the UK within three months but that this had not happened.  In her application the mother said that she was concerned about the welfare of the children because the father had previously been violent to her in front of them. Locations orders were made by Francis J on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September and the matter was first heard on notice by Microsoft Teams on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October. At that stage the father was unrepresented.  In the recitals to the order the father was said to have made submissions that he was not in a position to sponsor the mother to come to this country and that she was involved with another male.  He also said that the mother was fully aware of the whereabouts of the children.   The children were joined as parties and a guardian appointed.</p>

In March 2023 there was an incident in the father&#8217;s home whereby there was (putting it neutrally) an altercation between the father and his second wife which led to her fleeing the home and making a complaint to the police.

The parties have filed statements which deal with the circumstances of the children&#8217;s arrival in the UK, and also as to the incidents in March 2023. Social services and police records have been disclosed but no schedule of findings sought was ordered or prepared until Ms Wiseman submitted one at the beginning of this hearing. None of the counsel before me at this hearing had been instructed in any of the hearings this year. Nonetheless as these are wardship rather than pure Children Act proceedings the parties have had representation pretty much throughout.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst I appreciate why Ms Wiseman produced a schedule of findings as she did I consider it came too late and it would be better to deal with the issues in accordance with the order of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January.  It was plainly envisaged that the court would consider the question as to whether the father stranded the mother in Y Country without the children.  As part of the welfare assessment that must be carried out to decide where the children should live and what contact they should have with the non-resident parent it has been clear from the beginning that it would be necessary for the court to consider matters such as any harm that the children have suffered or might be at risk of suffering, and the capabilities of each of the parents.  The incident of alleged domestic abuse witnessed by the children on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2023 is obviously relevant to this, as is the behaviour and attitudes of the parents to each other and the children.  The documents in the bundle reflect the expectation that the court would be considering all these matters.</p>

She thought that he had applied for a visa for her as well. When it became apparent that she was not going to be able to accompany them she was led to believe she would be able to follow shortly afterwards.   She said she had no idea the father had taken another wife, nor that this wife was living with him in England with two more children. It was only when the children were here that she became aware of the situation and that he had no intention of sponsoring her to come here.  The mother said that the father had been physically and verbally abusive to her during the course of their marriage and she was concerned about the welfare of the children.  She asks the court to make orders that the children live with her and have contact with their father in accordance with the recommendations of the Guardian.</p>

He said that she was well aware that he had another wife and that in those circumstances it would not be possible for him to sponsor her to come to this country.  He said that he had intended to take the children to Y Country from time to time, for example during the summer holidays.  He denied all violence to the mother and said that she was dishonest and had affairs.  Her care of the children was inadequate and she and her family had encouraged the children to make false allegations against him and AA.  He said that the children would have a better life with him and that the children&#8217;s views as expressed to the Guardian were a product of the mother&#8217;s influence.</p>

I heard oral evidence from the social worker from the area where the mother is living and the social worker from the area where the father is living, the mother, father, and Guardian.  After a discussion about special measures at the start of the case it was agreed that each party would be able to give evidence without being observed by the other party.  During the mother&#8217;s evidence the father sat behind a screen, and the converse applied when he gave his evidence.  Fortunately the parties were all represented so that the mother was cross examined by counsel, Ms McIntosh. I wish to commend her for the way in which she presented the father&#8217;s case, asking searching and probing questions in a courteous manner and making well-presented submissions. I am also very grateful to Ms Wiseman and Ms Savage for their skill and assistance to the court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The law in this areas is not controversial and can be briefly summarised.  The burden of proof is on the person or party making the allegation. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. Findings of fact must be based on evidence and not speculation or suspicion.  The court must take into account all of the evidence in a case, and furthermore consider each piece of evidence in the context of all the other evidence.  It must not be assessed in separate compartments.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The evidence of the parties is of vital importance, and will weigh heavily in the balance. I bear in mind that people do not always tell the truth about things in court, especially in cases where they are frightened or distressed, or ashamed of conduct which is not relevant to the allegations.  Sometimes people lie out of misplaced loyalty, to bolster a true case or for no reason that anyone can discern.  The fact that someone has lied about some matters does not mean that they have lied about others.  A lie should never be considered as direct proof of guilt. Additionally, individuals may have faulty recollections or confusion at times of stress. The effects of delay and giving repeated accounts is something to be considered.</p>

Once the mother settled into things she appeared to find things a little easier but there can be no doubt she found the process of giving evidence very difficult.  The courtroom is large and unfamiliar.  She has not been in this country for long.  She was giving evidence contradicting the father in a number of respects.</p>

Her evidence about the time at which she became aware of the existence of the father&#8217;s second wife was also somewhat inconsistent, at one point suggesting it was the day after they arrived and at another point later.

He said that the mother had lied to him about the children&#8217;s education, that she did not understand how important it was, that her family was dishonest, that she was dishonest and had affairs, and that she had health issues which severely impacted her ability to look after the children.  He said in one statement that &#8216;I wish to make it clear that it was I, their father, who made visa applications for them to come here after seeing their neglect from their mother.

Also, a close look at the father&#8217;s written evidence shows that he repeatedly asserts that the decision was taken for the children to come here because the mother&#8217;s care of them was inadequate.

It is conceivable that the mother might have been prepared to sacrifice her own relationship with the children if she had thought they would have a better life in England but I do not accept she would have waved away the emotional effect on the children so readily.  Finally, the notion that she agreed to the children coming to live here without her does not sit easily with the application that she has made to this court.  The father&#8217;s case that she has only made this application in order to obtain residence here is unsupported by the evidence.</p>

His claim was that he could not afford to pay for the airfare.  He went as far as to contest the application for him to provide financial support and then to apply to set aside the order that was made. This was at a time when H was expressing her distress at being separated from her mother to professionals.  In February of this year the Guardian observed video contact and saw H sobbing at the end of the call.  If the father could not afford the mother&#8217;s air fare to come to England it calls into question his evidence that he intended to take the children to Y Country for their summer holidays and some half terms.</p>

She expected to travel with them and when it became apparent that she could not, she was led to believe that she would be able to join them within a few weeks or months.  These events were plainly very distressing to her as she tried to recount what had happened in the witness box. She had no experience of international travel and so things that might appear obvious to those who are used to airports and flying are not those who do not. She does not read or understand English and this would have hampered her in her understanding of what visas had been applied for and received. The visas were granted not long before the children left and she must have found everything going on around her at the time utterly confusing. In my judgment this is the reason that some of her evidence was inconsistent and not because she was not telling the truth overall.</p>

There is no doubt in my mind that this is so. The father&#8217;s conduct was cruel and abusive to the mother, and it was also emotionally abusive to the children. He deprived them of the parent who had looked after them since they were born. It is of great concern that the father seems to have so little understanding of the effect of his behaviour on others. I acknowledge that at first the children appeared to settle well in this country and at school, but it was not long before H was displaying significant problems. Whether or not all her allegations against her stepmother were true and accurate, as opposed to an expression of how difficult she was finding things, is difficult to know, but her state of mind and genuine distress at being separated from her mother was absolutely clear from the Guardian&#8217;s observations.  That C did not display such obvious emotion is not a sign that he was not affected; indeed the Guardian noted how detached he seemed to be.  He is very different now.</p>

She said that this included when he was giving her driving lessons and she made a mistake.  She said that on another occasion he had put his hands around her neck, and once had cut her head when he threw a mobile phone at her.  On 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March she said that the father had become angry because she had been away at a birthday party with her children and she had not been at home to feed H and C.  She said she did not like to argue with him because she feared being hit.  She said that the father hit her from behind and called her a prostitute.  She said that he followed her into the hall and punched and hit her all over her arms. At this point the children were on the stairs and could see.  The father followed her again into the sitting room and grabbed the back of her head and starting hitting her with something that she assumed was the remote control.  She screamed and then realised that she was bleeding from the back of her head.  There are photographs of this injury. She then went to seek the help of a neighbour and the police were called.  She said at the end of her statement that she could not take being hit any more. She kept thinking the father would change but he never apologised and she was frightened of him and was worried about the children seeing his violence.   In her second statement dated 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March she confirmed that her original statement was true but that she wished to retract it on the basis that the father had said he would not behave in that way again and she wished to save the marriage.</p>

The father did not deny that the injury existed and must have happened when he was present in the house with her but had no explanation to give as to how she could have suffered it.

I note the very strong and persuasive evidence from the Guardian that the children wish to remain living with their mother whether this is in England or Y country.  When H was living with her father and AA she repeatedly spoke to professionals about how much she was missing her mother and the Guardian&#8217;s account of her sobbing at the end of video contact with her mother in February was very striking.  C, who did not display much emotion when he was living with his father is now expressing clear views.  The wishes and feelings of these children deserve to be given respect and weight in the light of their respective ages and the level of understanding that goes with it.  I do not accept the father&#8217;s case that they are the product of influence from the family, even if he is right about what he says the mother and others have said in their telephone conversations and may repeat at home. The point is that the children&#8217;s views are genuine and entirely understandable in the light of their experiences.   If they were to be returned to their father it would cause them great distress, and would not meet their emotional needs.  The father says that the area he lives in is a more prosperous area than where the mother and children are, but this means little in the context of the children&#8217;s overall welfare. They have suffered a great deal of disruption in the last 16 months and require a period of stability.</p>

The incident of 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March shows that he is capable of violence which appeared to erupt from an argument over something relatively trivial.  I also note that the children were taken into police protection in March when they were the sole care of the father because he apparently left them unattended in a supermarket.

This is especially so when he is unlikely to have the funds to pay for supervised contact once the first four visits have taken place, meaning that it is possible may cease altogether unless an alternative can be found.  Added to this, the children are living in an environment where there is some hostility to the father even if it is understandable why that is so.  I am, however, fully persuaded that the children&#8217;s best interests require them to be safeguarded from the harm that their father poses to them at the moment and that the order is necessary and proportionate. I am conscious that the children are different and that C is much younger than his sister but their needs are the same in this regard and the harm to them of not seeing their father face to face for the time being is outweighed by risk of harm if they do. The lack of empathy seen here combined with a propensity to be emotionally and physically abusive is a worrying combination which should be taken seriously (as I know it is) by all those who work with the family, especially if the other parent is vulnerable and can be put under pressure.  Work undoubtedly needs to be done with the whole family to reduce risk but this work has hardly started. I hope that the father&#8217;s social worker will be able to work with him to enable him to move forwards to attend a suitable domestic abuse programme but am not able to say whether or not that will be possible.  It will be a matter for the professionals working with the family and the parents themselves to manage the situation going forward, but my suggestion would be that before any unsupervised  contact takes place there should be a further risk assessment carried out by someone who is not actively working with the father, whether that is a social worker or a psychologist.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am conscious that this judgment will not make easy reading for the father for I have been highly critical of him.  It is important that I make clear that I know he loves his children and wants the best for them as he sees things. I know from statements he has provided and other professional observations that he can interact very well with them.  If he is able to engage with the work and to develop a better understanding of his children&#8217;s needs and to reflect and change his past behaviour it will not only be to the advantage of his children but it will bring him great satisfaction too.  I urge him to do this not only for the mother and children in this case, but AA and the children they have together.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As a postscript I think it is worth observing that the international dimension to this case meant that the proceedings were commenced under the inherent jurisdiction and the children made wards of court. One of the consequences of this was that both parties have been represented from an early stage. Also, the children were joined as parties. This might have happened in ordinary private law proceedings but not so quickly. The work of the Guardian in this case has been of the highest quality, and the focus in her investigation and reports as to the impact and welfare of the children, along with the assessments from the two local authorities has been extremely helpful in dealing with all the issues together rather than by having fact finding hearing followed by assessments and welfare later. In my judgment the work outside the case and the resources devoted to it has led to the court process itself being shorter.  Whilst with the benefit of hindsight the developments in the case should have led to an earlier focus on the provisions of PD12J, PD3AA and the drafting of a proposed schedule of findings, this did not undermine the overall advantage of the case being managed and conducted in this way.</p>
