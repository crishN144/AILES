Their only child, a daughter (who I shall call U) was born in 2015. By this time their relationship had already become strained and finally broke down when U was 8 months old. She remained with her mother.  Over the course of the next few years the mother alleged that the father had been domestically abusive to her, and she also claimed that U was exhibiting disturbing behaviours after returning from contact.  Proceedings were issued for the first time in about 2016 which led to an agreement whereby U&#8217;s time was shared equally between the parents.  In 2018 further proceedings were launched. There was a fact finding hearing in which none of the mother&#8217;s allegations of abuse were found, neither were allegations of alienation made by the father found.  At a welfare hearing (in which three experts were instructed) an order was made transferring U&#8217;s main residence from the father to the mother, with alternate weekend and holiday contact to be spent with the mother.</span></p>

At that point U was reported to be a smiley and content child at school. They had not noted any welfare concerns although did query whether U had appeared as less happy than she had been previously.  The mother told the Cafcass officer that U needed to live with her to enable her to have the access to the emotional support that she needs. The father expressed concern that U&#8217;s behaviour was driven by the mother.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In July 2023 the Guardian filed a report in which she expressed concerns (expressed to her by the school) about U&#8217;s wellbeing before and after time spent with her mother. This was said to be something which had happened relatively recently. The Guardian said that the mother was trying to relitigate old matters which had already been decided and to frame the father as being an abusive and unsafe carer.  The mother was relying heavily on U&#8217;s therapist who appeared to have (according to the Guardian) very much taken on the mother&#8217;s version of events. The guardian recommended that the mother&#8217;s time with U should move to being totally supervised, and at a hearing before Her Honour Judge Davies she made an order for supervised contact to take place every two weeks until the final hearing.</span></p>

In this she reported that U was &#8216;unhappy, confused and disheartened by the decision for her to only spend time with her mother in a supervised setting. [U] has struggled and continued to struggle to understand this decision and feels that the Court and myself are making decisions on her behalf which she not only does not agree with, but does not understand.

Ms. RF had been having regular sessions with U since she had moved from her father&#8217;s care in 2020.

Unsurprisingly she struggled to formulate questions properly, and took up quite a lot of the limited time allotted to her by making reference to what Ms. RF had said.  The questions she asked about the proposal for unsupervised contact were very limited indeed, and came at the end.</span></p>

Given the costs of supervision the amount of time for contact realistically could not be more than two hours a session. The Guardian proposed, and the father supported, an order preventing any further applications for child arrangements orders pursuant to s91(14) for a period of 3 years.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The judge gave an extempore judgment the following day. It is apparent from the transcript that he had four cases in his list the following morning, so he had a very busy list indeed.  He noted the extensive litigation history in this case, including several appeals by the mother with respect to decisions adverse to her.  He set out the parties&#8217; respective cases and made it clear that he had read all the documents before him, including the expert reports that had been prepared for the original proceedings in 2018/19.  H referred to the opinion of Dr. Willemsen in 2019 in which he had remarked upon the mother&#8217;s negative attitude towards the father, and the lack of insight that she had as to the importance of U&#8217;s relationship with him.  Dr. Willemsen had opined that there was &#8216;evidence of parental alienation&#8217;, and a possibility that, in time, U could unknowingly identify with her mother&#8217;s feelings and opt not to see her father.  The judge also referred to the evidence of the other experts in those proceedings, namely Dr. Van Velsen, and Sarah Brookes, an independent social worker, which also advised that the mother&#8217;s attitude towards the father was hostile and that there was a risk of this being transmitted to U. It was the views of these experts which underlay the decision that U should move to live with her father.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The judge then set out the Guardian&#8217;s evidence which he accepted in every respect. He said that the Guardian took the view that U aligned herself with her mother, that she had far too much knowledge of the proceedings, that the mother over-emphasized some of U&#8217;s behaviour (which she described as self-harming when it was not), and that the mother was simply not able to give U permission to live with her father.  The judge records that the Guardian said that U was suffering from being engaged in the conflict by her mother, who was sharing inappropriate information with her.</span></p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In his decision the judge undoubtedly gave weight to the expert opinions in 2018/19. He rejected the mother&#8217;s case and in particular rejected her reliance on U&#8217;s therapist, Ms RF and accepted the Guardian&#8217;s view that she (the therapist) was too close to the mother. He particularly rejected the mother&#8217;s case that the Guardian was not giving sufficient weight to U&#8217;s views, saying that &#8216;on the contrary she has spent an inordinate amount of time with the child, far more than is usually spent in similar cases, I find&#8217;.   He rejected the mother&#8217;s case for a change in residence. He concluded that contact should continue to be supervised on the basis that this was in U&#8217;s best interests. He made a section 91(14) order noting that it was a serious order to make but that it did not ban further applications altogether, just created a filter.  U had been the subject of proceedings for too long, and she had been too involved. He therefore made an order for a period of 3 years in relation to all applications for child arrangement orders. He refused the mother&#8217;s application for enforcement (by which she was seeking payment from the father for fees for the therapy which he had not paid), and ordered that a copy of his judgment be provided to the contact supervisors.</span></p>

Nonetheless, the order that there should only be supervised contact between the child and her mother, coupled with a s91(14) order for three years is a draconian one.  Whilst the judge&#8217;s approach to the wishes and feelings of an emotionally vulnerable child was quite properly based upon the views of the Guardian, there is a question mark as to the weight he gave at this final hearing to the emotional harm to [U] of having such a restricted regime of contact with her mother which had to be balanced against the harm of being exposed to her views if contact was unsupervised.   The strength of the child&#8217;s views and the distress that she exhibited when she was spoken to by the Guardian are striking, especially with respect to a child who has not had her main home with the mother for a number of years.

At the time of the November 2023 report she was still only eight years old, but her views were expressed in very heartfelt terms to the Guardian, and also, via a letter, to the judge.  In that letter she says &#8216;I am disappointed in the other judge&#8217;s decision because I want to see my Mum and I want to see my Dad as well. &#8230;..

But is hard to see how U could have been  subject to significant influence by her mother in the months leading up to the final report and hearing.  She had had no unsupervised contact with her for several months.

Strong feelings on the part of a child do have to be taken into account and managed even if they cannot be acted upon. This is especially true when the issue at the heart of the case is the risk of emotional harm. The fact that there is recent evidence that U appears happy and calm is good, and may suggest that she will cope well with the loss of the unrestricted contact with her mother, but it is not sufficient of itself to bridge the gap in the reasoning of the judgment and the decision that was made at the time.</span></p>

But he did not say anything about the harm that was likely to be caused by the effect of such a restricted regime upon the mother/daughter relationship.  The parties were not in a position to pay for contact for more than two hours a fortnight and there were no family members who could supervise to make the regime more natural.

There was good reason to restrict the mother from making further applications for a change of residence for three years as the judge did.  It does not follow that this was the right decision for the contact arrangements.  Indeed one possibility is that the finality of the living with arrangements and the restriction of a s91(14) order might have created more stability for U and opened the way for a less restrictive contact regime.
