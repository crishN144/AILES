	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an application by a local authority for permission to withdraw care proceedings pursuant to FPR 1991 4.5; it is supported by the parents and by W (a party in his own right). The guardian advocates that no order should be made in this case but is less confident in (but does not seek to oppose) withdrawal as the proper route to that end. The alternative approach is the conduct of the listed fact finding hearing leading to no order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 1(5)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>). It is accepted by all that the giving of such permission involves a discretionary exercise by the Court.</p>

It is the fact that the giving of permission would involve the discharge of an interim care order; any application for a discharge would unarguably engage <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 1(1)</ref>.</p>

The court makes it clear that the consequences of giving permission (i.e. discharging interim care orders) do not determine of themselves the nature of the application. In other words the focus is on permission not on discharge.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although new Rules are still under consideration, it seems to me that in considering such applications as this the court should take into account the principles set out in CPR 1 as to the &#8216;Overriding Objective&#8217; which is to be included in new FPR and which is implicitly recognised now in family proceedings. A refusal of permission would commit the parties and the court to the listed 15 day hearing which would be substantially taken up with the hearing of expert medical evidence. Whilst proportionality could not be allowed to trump welfare, it nevertheless remains a factor to which the court should give proper consideration.</p>

The parties submitted that, although the actual permission hearing was brief (though the required reading was not), a full judgment would be necessary not least because the local authority acknowledged that the evidence could indeed satisfy the requirements of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 31(2)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.</p>

It will, however, be necessary to mention two other children in this judgment: U aged 18 and who has long since been adopted elsewhere and V aged 16 who is in long term foster care. There are three adult parties in this case: F who is the father of Y and Z but has also acted in that role for W and X; M who is the mother of U, V, W, X and Z; and SM who is the mother of Y. F and M had been in a relationship for some time but married on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June2009. There are three other adults (all former partners of M) who will be mentioned: P (now deceased) was the father of U, Q who is the father of V, W and X, and R; neither R nor Q have taken any part in these proceedings. It will be convenient in this judgment, however, to refer to M as &#8216;the mother&#8217; and F as &#8216;the father&#8217;.</p>

It was a stormy relationship characterised by domestic violence which resulted in U being removed (in the event permanently) and made the subject of a care order on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> June 1992. The mother then had a relationship with Q which was also characterised by domestic violence; indeed in 1997 Q served a short prison sentence for making threats to kill the mother. V was not an easy child and there was frequent involvement from a London local authority. Between 2001 and 2003 the mother was in a relationship with R which ended because R&#8217;s violence extended to W and X. The mother was involved in further care proceedings which culminated on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2004 with a care order in respect of V and supervision orders in respect of W and X. thereafter the mother moved, began a relationship with the father and they now reside in the area of the applicant local authority.</p>

SM, who currently lives in France, is content that that should continue and she looks to make contact arrangement directly with the father - as, of course, should be the case. It is, however, to be noted that, unlike the mother, the father had had no significant dealings with social services before this case.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;In February 2003, Dr. Churcher-Brown, psychiatrist, found that M came from an emotionally deprived and disturbed family background and that her low opinion of herself was typical of people with such a childhood history. She was the victim of childhood physical and sexual abuse and in adult life became involved with violent men.

Sadly these consequences of early life abuse are all too well known to the court.</p>

I say this on the basis that this is a complex case of factitious illness involving a large number of hospital departments and feel that it is a particularly difficult case owing to the fact that not only are the three children who are currently resident with Mother subject to factitious illness allegations, but the mother is also fabricating illness in herself. It is well recorded that, in such complex cases of factitious illness, challenge of the perpetrator can result in verbal fabrications rapidly being converted into induced illnesses in the children.

In the event the mother did return home but not until April 2010. By then most of the medical expert evidence had been filed. In broad terms that evidence demonstrated that both in respect of the mother and the children there were genuine medical conditions that underlaid the history. This never was (nor was ever suggested to be) a case of imposed or imputed illness. It was a case, so it was said, of grossly exaggerated or fictitious symptoms. The tenor of the medical evidence was broadly against fictitious symptoms but did admit of over-anxious reporting or dramatic exaggeration. At the time, however, that the mother arrived home, there was still awaited the paediatric overview from Dr. Ward and the response of Dr. Atkinson.

The effect of the plan is the withdrawal of social services and the devolving of safeguarding responsibilities on to the health and/or school authorities.

The social work team have an independent duty to satisfy themselves as to the route that best promotes the welfare of the relevant child. It is a matter for speculation, of course, what would have happened had the local authority given notice to the parents or what stance they (or indeed Judge Norrie) may have taken had the mother made there and then an offer to leave. The local authority would have been aware that where possible alleged perpetrators rather than children should be removed from the home just as they could and should have foreseen the trauma surrounding the actual removal.

It is merely to re-emphasise that in cases like this both the local authority and the court owe separate and distinct duties to safeguard the welfare of children by applying their own distinctive expertise. It may be that the trauma suffered by these children was simply an unfortunate part of the price that society pays for a system of child protection but the very fact of that trauma emphasises the need for everyone - expert, social worker and court - to tread as gently in this area as the safety and welfare of the relevant child permit.</p>

My reasons can be shortly stated. First, all the present signs are that this family can function alone. Secondly, given the ages of W, X, and Y, intervention in the teeth of their wishes is unlikely to be fruitful. Thirdly the father has demonstrated an impressive capacity to work with professionals to whose views he is profoundly opposed. Fourthly, I think the family&#8217;s present resistance to therapy or CAMHS is wholly understandable but I think the parents can be trusted to seek help if it is needed. Fifthly, I think the experiences of the last nearly 12 months have been effective to engender caution in the manner of reporting illnesses and in making the father realise that he must play a central role in the healthcare of these children. Lastly, I think it would not be healthy for the development of these children to be members of a family dependent on professional support or supervision.</p>

There is a risk of medical dramatisation although I think the fact that Dr. Ward&#8217;s report and review, attached to each child&#8217;s medical records as it will be, is sufficient to alert professionals to caution if dealing with the mother alone.

I believe it is right that a public account should be given of why proceedings are to be withdrawn notwithstanding the existence of evidence potentially capable of satisfying the requirements of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 31(2)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. I hope that this judgment may provide further food for thought for experts, local authorities and judges concerned with taking emergency action, along with those matters adverted to by the Court of appeal in <span style="font-variant:small-caps">A -v- ESCC &amp; Another </span>(above). I hope too that in due course it may be of assistance to W, X, Y and Z in making some sense of the unhappy events that have befallen them over the last year. This judgment must not be read as deciding any contested issue of fact. It is intended to be uncontroversial as to fact and merely descriptive of what has brought all these events about.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties have agreed the ambit of disclosure in this case. I agree with it. This judgment being public requires no permission for its disclosure save that it must not be used to identify the children in any circumstances where there would otherwise be no right to do so. Finally I wish to express my appreciation to counsel for all parties for the considerable assistance they have given me in this case.</p>
