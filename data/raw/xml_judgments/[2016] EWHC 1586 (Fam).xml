		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;One can see from the authorities and indeed from this case that the courts are much preoccupied in relocations, whether internal or external, with the practicalities of the child spending time with the other parent or, putting it another way, with seeing if there is a way in which the move can be made to work thus looking after the interests not only of the child but also of both of his or her parents.  Only where it cannot and the child&#8217;s welfare requires that move is prevented does that happen.  Once welfare has been identified as the governing principle in internal relocation cases there is no reason to differentiate between those cases and external relocation cases. In my view the approach set out in <span style="font-style:italic">K v K</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re F (Relocation)</span> [2012] and <span style="font-style:italic">Re F</span> [2015] should apply equally to internal relocation cases.  Clearly, however, the outcome of that approach will depend entirely on the facts of the individual case.  At one end of the spectrum it is not to be expected, for instance, that the court will be likely to impose restrictions on a parent who wishes to move to the next village or even the next town or some distance across the county and a parent seeking such a restriction may well get short shrift.  At the other end of the spectrum, cases in which a parent wishes to relocate across the world, for example returning to their original home and to their family in Australia or New Zealand, are some of the hardest cases which the courts have to try and require great sensitivity and the utmost care.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The present appeal has caused me to consider how a proportionality evaluation would actually work in the context of a relocation case.  We are now entirely familiar with the role of proportionality in relation to public law children proceedings, its impact upon whether the court sanctions an interference in family life by the state in the guise of the local authority.  Interference would not be permitted if it would violate the rights of the child or parents to respect for their family life under Article 8 of the ECHR.  </p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Proportionality also has a well-established role in contact disputes where, as can be seen notably in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A</span>, the court can have an obligation to ensure that appropriate steps are taken to enable the family tie between parent and child to be maintained.  It is not difficult to see how Article 8 influences the outcome in that situation.  The court has to strive harder.</p>

		</level>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">However, the situation in a relocation case is more problematic.  Often, whichever way the decision goes, there will be an interference with the Article 8 rights of a parent.  If the father is allowed to take the child to live at the other end of the country there may be an interference with the mother&#8217;s Article 8 right.  If, on the contrary, he is refused permission to move, there may be interference with his Article 8 right.</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Both parents may be disinclined to back off and middle courses are not often easy to find in these problematic cases.  As Lord Justice Ryder implies, the problem may be worse in the international context.  Australia is more difficult than another town in the United Kingdom, but even moves within the United Kingdom can be seriously disruptive of established arrangements.  Left with a significant interference with Article 8 rights, whichever way one turns, what can the court do and what should it do?</p>

		    <content>
		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.58in">&#8220;Article 8 requires that the domestic authority should strike a fair balance between the interests of the child and those of the parent and that, in the balancing process, primary importance should be attached to the best interests of the child which, depending on their nature and seriousness, may override those of the parents&#8221;.</p>

The interests of the parents are not ignored but, if it is not possible to accommodate everyone&#8217;s wishes, the best interests of the child dictate the outcome.&#8221;</p>

The separation of the parties occurred on a family holiday to Israel in July 2013.  There have been court proceedings firstly in Israel and then here ever since.  The proceedings in Israel were begun by the father who issued divorce and custody proceedings alleging that the mother&#8217;s state of mental health posed a significant risk both to him and to A.

Both appeared all too eager for the fight.  I would question whether it is a proportionate use of the court&#8217;s finite resources for a case to occupy so much judicial time when the sole issue now for the court is to determine how A&#8217;s care should be divided between his parents and where the level of care that the parents are able to provide has been described in the Section 7 assessments as well beyond the standard of good enough parenting.</p>

At the time of writing her first Section 7 report filed on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February, 2014 A was living with his mother with contact to his father.  There was considerable acrimony between the parents, resulting in the handovers taking place at a central police station in Nottingham under the gaze of CCTV cameras.  A&#8217;s then nanny was to be present.  The parents had to communicate in writing regarding any matters affecting A&#8217;s welfare.  </p>

Father reluctantly agreed to consider some form of mediation in order to reach agreement about contact but this was at prejudice to his clear assertion that the mother could not adequately care for A as he asserted she was mentally ill and he therefore asked that A should accordingly be living with him.  I note that Miss Whittle recorded her concern that if the father believed the mother was mentally ill he did not manage his own behaviour in a way which would support her and reduce the stress placed on A.</p>

He receives an excellent level of stimulation and both parents demonstrate a warm and loving relationship with A.  A is a child who is developing well and meeting appropriate developmental milestones.  These points are extremely important to recognise as they not only provide evidence to draw conclusions regarding other aspects of his parent&#8217;s care, they also need to be counterweighted against any more negative aspects of his care.  </p>

I can only conclude that the parents do not accept that each is able to provide good care to A despite the evidence before them that A is, at least for the present time, thriving in all respects.

Miss Whittle stated this had also been her view but that independent evidence from child professionals had shed more light on the behaviour of the parents.  By this Miss Whittle was referring to the evidence of G at the University Nursery that A had been attending since mid-October.

Children should never hear one parent talking negatively about the absent parent.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have given the competing applications very careful consideration.  On reflection, my suggested middle course of adjourning the mother&#8217;s application to relocate for a period of twelve months is not in A&#8217;s welfare best interests.  To adjourn that application to ensure that there is a stable and consistent pattern of contact with the father before further considering the relocation application would, in my judgment, run the very real risk of the father causing further difficulties in respect of contact in an attempt to undermine and/or thwart the mother&#8217;s application to relocate.  I fear the father would, albeit contrary to his own and A&#8217;s interests, seek to portray the mother as exceedingly obstructive in allowing him contact with A and thus to assert that such difficulties would continue or be the greater if the mother were permitted to live with A in Israel.  In my view, I have to grapple now with whether I should grant or refuse the mother&#8217;s relocation application.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have to balance the advantages to A of his mother being permitted to relocate with him to Israel against the adverse impact on the frequency and regularity of the father&#8217;s contact.  I have also to balance those factors with the advantages of refusing the mother&#8217;s application against the disadvantages.  The father would have the opportunity to maintain regular contact but that would come at a cost to the mother&#8217;s new family life and her emotional and psychological well-being.  I am satisfied that the mother will promote contact between A and his father because she acknowledges the importance to A of having a close relationship with his father.</p>

I will give the parties time to reflect on this judgment to see if they are able to agree issues of contact.  If not, I will resolve the issues either on paper or at a short directions hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Both of the parties are familiar with making applications in the Israeli courts.  I trust the father will take some reassurance that he will continue to spend time with A if I require the mother to obtain mirror orders in Israel.  The father will then, if the need should arise, be able to enforce the provision for him to spend time with A in the Israeli courts.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For those reasons I propose to grant the mother permission to make an application to relocate.  Pending a finalised order, I grant permission to the mother to take A to Israel so that she may assist her mother caring for and nursing her father.  Once the issue of contact has been agreed or ordered and a final order drawn, I will grant permission to the mother to relocate permanently to Israel with A. </p>
