	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The local authority have applied for these orders due to the father&#8217;s refusal to acknowledge the conclusions reached by HHJ Hammerton in care proceedings on 7 October 2015 (after a 3 day hearing), regarding his responsibility in causing his son J to be at risk of physical and emotional harm whilst J was in his father&#8217;s care. Through his relentless campaign (mainly against the local authority) I am satisfied that, very sadly, the father has lost sight of his son&#8217;s needs. As a result of the father&#8217;s failure to recognise that his continued behaviour risks further harm to his son, it is necessary for the court to intervene in order to protect his son from further risk of harm. In March 2015 HHJ Hammerton stated as follows &#8216;..</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">unless the father takes steps to exclude J from involvement and protect him from the ill effects of his campaigning, there is a risk of further emotional harm to J. That risk is additional to the risks that arise from the deficiencies in the father&#8217;s parenting as identified in the care proceedings.&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">  The impact on J of the father&#8217;s failure to change his behaviour is readily illustrated by what HHJ Hammerton said in the most recent judgment in October about the circumstances of J&#8217;s removal from his father&#8217;s care in April (only a few weeks after the March judgment) when the police attended the father&#8217;s home, she said </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;Father&#8217;s behaviour on 9 April as shown displayed a lack of empathy or understanding in respect of J&#8217;s feelings, in the early part of the film the father focuses entirely on phoning contacts with a view to publicising what was occurring with no concern for J, and when he does engage it is to shout at J in Russian to blame J for the arrival of the police and social services&#8217;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> The father&#8217;s behaviour has been and remains deeply damaging to his son&#8217;s welfare.</span></p>

I also consider the application for a RRO is justified to protect J as any public debate about the issues raised by this case are not advanced by J or his carers being identified. On the contrary, J&#8217;s welfare demands that neither he, nor his carers should be identified. The balance needs to be struck in such a way to facilitate public debate and enable the father, as he seems intent on doing, to continue his campaign, whilst at the same time protecting J&#8217;s anonymity. J&#8217;s welfare needs now are for security and stability in his placement and school, which being identified in the media or otherwise is likely to undermine.</span></p>

		<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The third care application was made a few weeks later in April 2015, after J was taken into police protection from his father&#8217;s care in April 2015. J has been with foster carers since then under an interim care order, with initially weekly and then from July fortnightly contact to his father. The care application was heard by HHJ Hammerton over three days in September, she gave judgment on 7 October 2015 (soon to be published on the BAILII website) where she found the threshold criteria had been established and having undertaken the welfare analysis concluded J should remain placed long term with foster carers, with contact to his father on six occasions a year. At that hearing she made an interim care order to enable the applications to be made to me for a RRO and injunctive orders against the father. Following this judgment the matter will be listed back before HHJ Hammerton to consider final orders in the care proceedings. To complete the procedural context a further hearing will be listed (on a date to be fixed) to consider the application issued by the LA for orders under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1997/40" uk:canonical="1997 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Protection from Harrassment Act 1997</ref>.

In relation to foreign media the English court must proceed with very great caution. As a general principle, any attempt by the English court to control foreign media, whether directly or indirectly, is simply impermissible. In the first place, what justification can there be for the courts in one country seeking to control the media in another? If the media in a particular State are to be controlled that must be a matter for the relevant authorities in that State. For the courts of another State to assume such a role involves an exercise of jurisdiction which is plainly exorbitant, not least as involving interference in the internal affairs of the other State. What would we think, what would the English media think, if a family judge in Ruritania were to order the Daily Beast to desist from complaining about the way in which the judicial and other State authorities in Ruritania were handling a case involving an English mother? Secondly, the exercise of such a jurisdiction would be inconsistent with the principles I explained in </span><span class="Emphasis" style="font-style:normal;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Re J</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">, paras 44-65.

So, in principle, attempts by a court to control the internet are not subject to the complaint that they are thereby interfering with the purely internal affairs of a foreign State.&#8217;</span></p>

Copies of the email were sent to various people including an MEP. The father informed the court neither he nor J were prepared to meet with the Children&#8217;s Guardian as he was making a complaint against her. A position statement was filed on behalf of the Guardian which expressed her concern about J being returned to the father&#8217;s care without the therapy recommended by Dr Van Rooyen having been undertaken. Further information was sought from the LA.</span></p>

In its later position statement the LA stated that at the time this discharge application had been issued it had been hoped that the father would continue to work positively with the LA and engage with the support provided by the LA. It was said the opposite had happened, and the father had become convinced that the role of the LA in J&#8217;s life had been negative.  The analysis provided on behalf of the Guardian in September concluded that the father had not made the necessary changes and as a result, in her view, the risks of physical and emotional harm to J identified in the previous proceedings remained.</span></p>

The Guardian was clear the matter could not proceed without further investigation. She was increasingly concerned she was not able to meet with J, she sought the father&#8217;s co-operation to enable her to do so. Notwithstanding her inability to meet with J she was clear that the circumstances did not justify a peremptory removal of J to foster care. HHJ Hammerton agreed further investigation was required and that immediate removal of J to foster carers was not justified. The matter was adjourned for a three day hearing in January. It was hoped the father would be able to secure legal representation. The injunctions were continued.</span></p>

Her view was that was likely to cause more harm to J than him remaining in his father&#8217;s care. She was clear the involvement of J in the legal proceedings and in the father&#8217;s campaign against the LA had been emotionally harmful to J. She believed it was essential the proceedings were brought to a swift end. In a statement filed on the eve of the hearing the LA had reached the same view. They concluded that J&#8217;s needs could be met by a referral to CAF (Common Assessment Framework) which would require the father&#8217;s agreement. The support under this framework would involve professionals from health and education, which would ensure some support being available ensuring removal from any interaction with the LA, which had caused such division and distress.</span></p>

It may well be that notwithstanding the conclusion of the proceedings, the father will continue with his campaigns against the local authority. In that case unless the father takes steps to exclude J from involvement and protect him from the ill effects of his campaigning, there is a risk of further emotional harm to J. That risk is additional to the risks that arise from the deficiencies in the father&#8217;s parenting as identified in the care proceedings. Given the premature return of J to his father&#8217;s care it is not possible for the local authority to ameliorate these risks. J has now been in his father&#8217;s care for 15 months, he has always expressed a wish to remain in his father&#8217;s care and as a result of recent experiences has adopted an increasingly negative attitude towards social workers. A change in residence would have a profound effect on him and on close analysis is not viable. Neither is it workable for a care order to remain as a framework for additional support and protection. It is clear there is no benefit in retaining the care order indeed the opposite is the case. Hence the agreement of all parties that the care order should be discharged.&#8217;</span></p>

Whilst he did not name J it is submitted there was sufficient information on the boards carried by the father to make him readily identifiable. The LA was alerted to this from two sources. First an email from one of its employees, who has a child at the same school. The second was an email from J&#8217;s foster carer who describes J&#8217;s reaction to what his father was doing. Although J had not been aware of it on the day, the foster carers considered he should be informed before the next day at school. At that time J didn&#8217;t make any comments. On his return from school the next day J reported to the foster carer that he had not had a good day at school because lots of students had asked him about his father. When asked what J had said to them, he had told them he didn&#8217;t know who this man was. J said he was embarrassed by this, and that his father had asked students if they knew J. He said his father had asked a boy in his class whether he knew J, when he said he did the boy reported the father asked him to give J his regards. The foster carers reported J appeared embarrassed and annoyed by his dad&#8217;s actions and he did not like the other students knowing he was in care. There is an email from one of the other parents to the school following the father&#8217;s protest. This parent reported being sympathetic to the father&#8217;s plight and emailed the address on the board, he was surprised that the father responded and asked this man to ask his son to contact J, when the father didn&#8217;t know this man or his son. The parent reported this to the school, as he was concerned about security in the school.</span></p>

He is unable to recognise that J may be caused distress by any action he takes, on the contrary he takes the view J is likely to enjoy any publicity. There is no recognition or acknowledgement by him of any of the evidence available of the distress his actions have caused J to date and that the continuance of them risks doing so in the future.</span></p>

The need to prevent interference with J&#8217;s Art 8 rights by restraining the publication of information that identifies J outweighs the need to prevent interference in Art 10 rights by not restraining such publication. Equally, I am satisfied that the need for personal injunctions restricting the father&#8217;s dissemination of information is also required as is the order sought restricting his ability to attend at J&#8217;s school. I have reached these conclusions for the following reasons:</span></p>
