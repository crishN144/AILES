	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in">This is an application by a professional journalist who seeks a disclosure order which, if granted, will enable her to see the court file and other materials relating to public law care proceedings which concluded in October 2018.  The child at the centre of those proceedings is M who was born in November 2012.  M is now 7&#189; years old.  On the application of the local authority she was removed from her mother&#8217;s care in June 2015 when she was 2 years old.  With the mother&#8217;s consent, a care order was made and M was placed in the care of her father.  That placement subsequently broke down and M&#8217;s mother made an application to discharge the care order on the basis that M would return to live with her rather than remain with foster carers.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in">In June 2016, after a hearing which lasted four days, His Honour Judge Hess sitting in the Family Court at Portsmouth rejected the mother&#8217;s application to discharge the care order.  Instead, he authorised the local authority to place the child for adoption. Had that order survived its subsequent journey to the Court of Appeal, the outcome for M and her mother would have resulted in the severing of all ongoing family ties between them. </p>

The mother was not eligible for legal aid and, for the purposes of bringing that appeal, she was obliged to fund the proceedings to the tune of about &#163;20,000. It was money she could ill afford.  The Court on that occasion declined to make an award of costs against the local authority because <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;it is not possible to say that the local authority has been unreasonable in defending the judge&#8217;s decision, it being a decision that was in line with all professional advice and was supported by the children&#8217;s guardian&#8221;</span> (paragraph 75). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in">Following the decision of the Court of Appeal in February 2018, the matter was relisted before the Designated Family Judge in Portsmouth, His Honour Judge Levey. By that stage the case had attracted wider media interest and there had been several reports about the case both locally and nationally.  At the hearing on 19 October 2018 three respected and experienced journalists appeared at court to observe the hearing as they were entitled to do under the Family Procedure Rules.  They had accorded the judge the courtesy of letting him know in advance that they would attend in order to make an application to vary the usual reporting restrictions.  One of those journalists was Ms Newman.  She was accompanied by fellow journalists, Ms Sanchia Berg and Ms Louise Tickle, who has been present in court, with my permission, throughout this hearing. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in">In terms of the development of the care proceedings at that point in time, the local authority had commissioned two expert assessments following the decision of the Court of Appeal.  Those assessments were positive from the mother&#8217;s perspective.  She was by then working constructively with both the local authority and the experts. The plan for M changed to one based on rehabilitation within the family.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in">In the summer of 2018, M was returned to the full-time care of her mother where she has remained ever since.  She was then nearly 6 years old and had spent over three years of her life in foster care.  Those were three very important years in this child&#8217;s life.  Notwithstanding the conclusion of the proceedings and the absence of any further state intervention in M&#8217;s family life, Ms Newman seeks access to the information and material which informed the earlier decision-making of the local authority and the court.  She became interested in the case in 2018 following the decision in the Court of Appeal.  She had by then begun a wider investigation into what she perceived to be an unusually high percentage of cases in this particular local authority&#8217;s area which resulted in adoption orders and was keen to understand what might be driving that trend (if indeed such a trend existed).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in">Thus, by the time the matter was relisted before His Honour Judge Levey on 19 October 2018 after its first journey to the Court of Appeal, there was a clear consensus as to the way forward.  The court was invited to discharge the care proceedings and substitute a six-month supervision order.  All that remained for the judge to decide was the issue of the extent to which there should be a relaxation of the existing restrictions on reporting.  Counsel who appeared for the mother on that occasion told the court that, whilst there was no criticism of the local authority&#8217;s approach in terms of its willingness to change the plan for M, there was &#8220;a flaw in the system&#8221;.  Nevertheless, through her counsel, she was urging on the court a cautious approach to the issue of reporting which she said must be &#8220;very sensitive to her request that matters are kept as private as possible in terms of identification&#8221; which should include the potential for jigsaw identification. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in">His Honour Judge Levey permitted the reporting of the original judgment delivered by His Honour Judge Hess on an anonymised basis.  He went on to approve a reporting restriction order which not only prevented further reporting: it also had the effect of restricting the reporting of information about the family which was already in the public domain as a result of the publication of the Court of Appeal judgment delivered in February 2018.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in">Ms Louise Tickle, one of Ms Newman&#8217;s fellow journalists, lodged an appeal against that order.  The BBC applied to be joined as a party to their appeal.  By the time the case reached the Court of Appeal, there was a consensus amongst all parties, including the representatives of the media, in relation to the terms of a replacement reporting restriction order.  In advance of the listed appeal hearing, a short hearing was convened on 15 February 2019 in order to take stock.  The media representatives were anxious to preserve the full listing in order that they might canvass wider issues of principle and practice generated by the facts of this particular case.  The President, Lord Justice McFarlane, sitting with Lady Justice King, declined on that occasion to take the opportunity to use the hearing date as an opportunity to issue wider guidance on &#8220;this somewhat complicated but very important area relating to transparency in the family courts&#8221;.  His Lordship acknowledged the absence of any detailed guidance or road map to assist journalists on how such applications were to be determined and expressed his resolve as President to issue such guidance at the earliest opportunity after full consultation with all relevant stakeholders. </p>

She accepts that she would need to come back to the court and seek that permission on a separate occasion were her journalistic endeavours to lead to a story or an article which she wished to put before the public at large.  Should she succeed in her present application, she accepts that she would continue to be bound by whatever restrictions the court considered appropriate and she has made it clear through her counsel from the outset that she would observe those restrictions to the letter.  It is acknowledged by all parties to this application that Ms Newman is an experienced and responsible journalist who has a particular interest in this case.   </p>

The original judgment delivered by His Honour Judge Hess in June 2017 has also been made available to Ms Newman and her legal team.

M was born in 2012 but her parents had by then separated.  M had a number of developmental issues which were reflected in a delay in her functioning in speech and language.  In addition she had a number of allergies which were characterised as &#8216;severe&#8217;.  Notwithstanding the challenges which M&#8217;s early life presented to this mother as a single carer, there was nothing to suggest that the care she was providing was inadequate or concerning in any way until she presented at a local hospital with M on two occasions in October 2014 and May 2015.  M was admitted as an emergency with respiratory problems on both occasions, the mother having administered medication to her daughter via the use of an EpiPen.  Those admissions, together with a perception that she had been overprotective in her inappropriate use of the EpiPen, appear to have informed the local authority&#8217;s concerns that M might be at risk of physical harm were she to remain in her mother&#8217;s care. The mother was subsequently arrested by the police on suspicion of fraud and neglect.  With no other family members available to care for M, she was taken into police protection and placed in local authority foster care.  This started the local authority&#8217;s formal involvement with this family.  An interim care order was made on 19 June 2015 confirming M&#8217;s placement with foster carers.   </p>

No doubt fearful that the alternative might be a placement of M outside her family, the mother agreed to that plan and, having received legal advice, a final care order was made by a circuit judge in March 2016 reflecting that plan.  All parties, including the mother, signed what is known as a threshold document confirming that the risk of significant harm to M in her mother&#8217;s care in June 2015 was such that she </p>

That document recorded the agreed factual basis for the care order: it included that she was an overprotective parent who was not fully informed about the potential dangers of using an EpiPen in the context of M&#8217;s several ongoing health concerns.  Whilst the mother had always maintained that she did this in the honest but mistaken belief that her child was suffering a severe allergic reaction, she was prepared to accept that her own medical training as a nurse should have led to a more appropriate response. </p>

As is clear from the judgment delivered by Lady Justice King in February 2018, the Court of Appeal had identified a number of concerns about the reasoning and analysis which informed the judge&#8217;s decision to place this child for adoption.  First, there was no up to date picture of M or the extent of her developmental delay and speech difficulties both then and as anticipated in the future.  Identifying what she regarded as &#8220;a significant gap in the judge&#8217;s judgment&#8221;, her Ladyship said this: </p>

In recent years there has been a welcome and progressive move towards open justice and transparency initiatives in the Family courts.  In April 2009 the (then) President of the Family Division, Sir Mark Potter, issued guidance following the Government&#8217;s announcement that members of the media could attend hearings in family proceedings: <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2009] 2 FLR 167" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] 2 FLR 167</ref>.  That guidance established the important base line principle that, henceforth, &#8220;duly accredited representatives of news gathering and reporting organisations&#8221; would be permitted to be present at hearings of family proceedings save for those designed to achieve &#8220;judicially assisted conciliation or negotiation&#8221;&#8217;.

It is clear from the grounds specified in rule 27.11(3)(a) and (b) that the media could properly be excluded by a judge if that course was necessary in the interests of any child concerned in, or connected with, the proceedings or for the protection of a party or witness in the proceedings or a party connected with such party or witness.  Thus, the issue of confidentiality and the effects on a child and third parties of a breach of confidence was specifically preserved as a reason to exclude the media or to place restrictions on what could and could not be published about the proceedings.  However, the default position regarding the attendance at family hearings of the media was preserved: a person wishing to exclude the media must satisfy the court of the necessity for exclusion. </p>

The case concerned care proceedings initiated by a local authority during the course of which three children were removed from the care of their parents.  When the mother became pregnant again, the local authority issued fresh proceedings with a view to removing the unborn child at birth.  The basis of the earlier proceedings was an allegation that the parents had physically abused their children.  The parents denied these allegations and claimed they had been the victim of a miscarriage of justice based on flawed and incomplete evidence.  </p>

In 2016, and prior to his appointment as President in July 2018, McFarlane LJ sitting in the Court of Appeal with Macur and King LJJ, considered the issue of transparency and media reporting in the context of the high profile case of Poppi Worthington over which Peter Jackson J (as he then was) had presided: see <span style="font-style:italic">In re W (Children) (Care Proceedings: Publicity) </span></p>

Those proceedings involved a rehearing of an earlier fact-finding enquiry.  They had been held in private pursuant to FPR r 27.10 and, since no part of the judgment had been released by the judge, the publication of any information relating to the hearing would have amounted to a contempt of court pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 12</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65" uk:canonical="1960 (8 &amp; 9 Eliz. 2) c. 65" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">AJA 1960</ref>.  Shortly before the rehearing was due to take place, the judge released an edited version of his judgment from the first hearing and allowed media representatives to attend the second hearing and to report on a daily basis what happened in court.  The children who were the subject of the proceedings appealed through their Guardian arguing that the judge&#8217;s order had placed too much emphasis on publication and openness to the detriment of their own interests. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;[36] Throughout her submissions, Ms Gallagher [counsel for the media organisations] repeatedly referred to the existence of a &#8220;presumption of open justice&#8221; which, it was submitted, should govern the court&#8217;s decision in the present case.  With respect to Ms Gallagher, whose submissions were otherwise argued from a cogent legal basis, any presumption or principle in favour of open justice which applies generally to court proceedings does not apply to proceedings that are held in private and which relate to children.  The default position in such cases is to the contrary and is, as I have described, as a matter of statute and the rules, one which prohibits the publication of any information relating to the proceedings.  That default position, which is designed to protect children, can, where appropriate, be modified by a judge upon the application of a party or the media.  It has in any event been tempered by the President&#8217;s transparency initiative, the purpose of which is to allow greater public access to, and understanding of, the work of the family courts. </p>

That was a matter for the judge&#8217;s discretion.  It was common ground before this court that the discretion must be exercised by conducting a balancing exercise between the rights to privacy and a private life which are encompassed within article 8 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, on the one hand, and the right to freedom of expression reflected in article 10.  The parties in this appeal each accepted that the exercise of judicial discretion whether to relax, or increase, the default restrictions upon publication of information from <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> proceedings is not one in which paramount consideration must be afforded to the welfare of the child who is the subject of the proceedings&#8230;.&#8221;. </p>

That decision was based upon the child&#8217;s welfare not being the paramount consideration.  His Lordship then referred to key authorities which tended to point in a different direct: <span style="font-style:italic">In Re S (A Child) (Identification: Restrictions on Publication)</span> [2004] UKHL; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 AC 593" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 AC 593</ref> (cited above), <span style="font-style:italic">Clayton v Clayton</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] Fam 83" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] Fam 83</ref>, and <span style="font-style:italic">In re Webster</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 1 FLR 1146" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 1 FLR 1146</ref>.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in">As to outcome, McFarlane LJ concluded that, despite &#8220;a feeling of substantial unease at this degree of openness at the start of an unpredictable fact-finding exercise&#8221;, it was not possible to hold that Peter Jackson J had been wrong in his analysis and conclusions. It was a compelling case of significant public and media interest.  A very young child had died and the future of her five siblings was being considered.  There had already been a substantial amount of press and media coverage of the case.  The essential balance which the judge had struck involved looking at &#8220;the public interest in there being the greatest achievable openness in such a serious and worrying case&#8221; (the article 10 perspective) and &#8220;the public interest in the protection of vulnerable children who are innocent victims of the circumstances outside their control, and the legitimate interests of the adults concerned&#8221; (the article 8 side).  The Court of Appeal decided that there was to be some protection for the children in terms of the confidentiality of the proceedings.  That protection would be achieved by delaying the permitted reporting until after the court proceedings had concluded on any given day, thereby ensuring that the court had a proper  opportunity to consider whether any additional directions were required.  Stock could thereby be taken so as to identify any aspects of the evidence which should properly be subject to embargo in order to protect the children&#8217;s confidentiality in the proceedings. </p>

The case concerned a very young child who had presented at hospital with various fractures.  Although there was no other evidence of poor parenting, the local authority commenced care proceedings.  Evidence was given by the treating clinicians, social workers and expert witnesses.  The trial judge found in favour of the parents and dismissed the case against them.  Those parents wished to tell their story through a television documentary.  The issue was whether the professional witnesses were entitled to injunctive relief in order to preserve their anonymity.  The parents sought to name them and applied for the disapplication of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65" uk:canonical="1960 (8 &amp; 9 Eliz. 2) c. 65" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">AJA 1960</ref> in order that they could speak publicly about their experience of the care system and various individuals within it.  </p>

In terms of whether or not the parents should be allowed to publish information about their experience and that of their child, his Lordship held that, since they were the only persons holding parental responsibility for the child and there was no further State intervention or involvement with the family, any decision as to whether or not it was in their child&#8217;s interest for any of this material to be put in the public domain was one for the parents.  However, he explained that the balance in this particular case was not, as is so often the case, a balance between differing and conflicting <span style="font-style:italic">private</span> interests; it was essentially a balance between the private interests of the Ward family and the various public interests they could pray in aid  and, on the other side, the public interests in favour of preserving confidentiality for children who found themselves at the centre of proceedings.

These are not easy applications.  They require time, effort, research and expense on what is essentially a satellite issue.  For these reasons it is important that if and when Local Authorities and the media (and/or the other parties) do come to realise there is an issue between them about how much should be reportable and on what terms, there should be sensible and responsible dialogue as soon as possible, with a view to finding an early <span style="font-style:italic">modus vivendi</span>.

Ms Proops QC maintains that the fact that M was subsequently returned to her mother after further judicial intervention, including that of the Court of Appeal, does not dilute the importance of informed public debate into the basis on which this particular local authority makes decisions. As a well-respected journalist with a longstanding interest in these proceedings, Ms Newman points to the fact that she has abided by the terms of the existing reporting restriction order and the court can have confidence in her ongoing compliance in terms of maintaining confidentiality in respect of the material she wishes to see.  By gaining access to the court files she will have an opportunity to undertake an independent journalistic assessment as to whether or not they contain information which should be made available to the public at large.  In that event, she accepts she will need to return to court to seek permission to publish at which stage the court will have an opportunity to conduct a further balancing exercise to test the extent to which the article 10 rights of the media should prevail over the article 8 rights of M and anyone else who may be affected by the resulting publicity if permission to publish is given. </p>

In these circumstances, it is not enough for the local authority to rely on confidentiality per se.   Whilst there is no guidance as yet in relation to the extent to which the court should exercise its disclosure jurisdiction since the introduction of r. 27.11, it is clear from the President&#8217;s Guidance (Sir Mark Potter, 2009) that the media would be able to make applications to see the underlying court documents.

However, she reminds me that the breadth of the request for access is unprecedented and goes beyond any request for disclosure which has been made either in the Family jurisdiction or beyond.  She points to the fact that what is sought represents a significant intrusion into matters which, by their nature, concern private rights.  The law is such that, merely having access to a private document for the purposes of reading it, can represent an intrusion of that privacy:  see<span style="font-style:italic"> Imerman v Tchenguiz and Others </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2010/908" uk:canonical="[2010] EWCA Civ 908" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWCA Civ 908</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] Fam 116" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] Fam 116</ref>.

Ms Newman has failed to point to a feature which takes it out of the run of many similar cases dealt with daily in courts up and down the land.  It did not develop into a case about fabricated or induced illness and it was never the subject of a forensic investigation on that basis.  She points to the fact that all parties (including the mother) consented to the initial care order on the basis that threshold was crossed.  Whilst the mother may have had regrets about her decision to agree that position, it was nevertheless a voluntary agreement between M&#8217;s parents, approved by the court, which led to this child&#8217;s original placement with her biological father.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in">In terms of the information which is already available to Ms Newman, Ms Rogers QC points to the fact that His Honour Judge Levey permitted the publication of the judgment delivered by His Honour Judge Hess in June 2017.  Ms Newman has a copy of that judgment.  As is clear from that judgment, His Honour Judge Hess acknowledged that, at face value, this was not a family in which the local authority&#8217;s children&#8217;s services department was likely to have been involved (para 49).  Whilst the mother and her husband had made allegations against the local authority that there was an element of institutional racism driving its approach to the case, that had been specifically rejected by the judge and did not resurface as an allegation when the case went up to the Court of Appeal.  The fact that Ms Newman, or any other journalist, <span style="font-style:italic">could</span> have attended that hearing and listened to the evidence (including the oral evidence from all the local authority&#8217;s witnesses) does not mean she, or anyone else, would have been granted access to all the documents.  On the contrary, Ms Rogers QC submits she would not have been granted that access although she might have made an application for permission to report some of what she had heard as the case progressed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in">Ms Rogers QC further submits that King LJ gave a full judgment in the Court of Appeal and explained precisely why the trial judge was reversed and his placement order set aside.  Thus, to the extent that there had been flaws in the judicial process in terms of the inadequacy of reasoning or analysis underpinning the original placement order, that potential injustice to M and her family had been exposed and made right by the higher court&#8217;s reversal of the placement order.  The Court of Appeal had thereby fulfilled its proper function as a check and balance on a potential miscarriage of justice.  Furthermore, Ms Rogers QC argues that the mother&#8217;s failure to qualify for legal aid to pursue her appeal was not reflected in a costs order on the basis that the Court of Appeal held that the local authority had not been acting unreasonably in supporting the judge&#8217;s decision in the context of the appeal. </p>

She makes a fundamental but compelling point that family proceedings involving children are held in private for a good reason.  Apart from the privacy rights of the child, or children, and their family, others who provide documents or disclosure for such proceedings often do so in the legitimate expectation that the information will remain private. </p>

The media sought to argue that they should be entitled to see and take copies of witness statements, written arguments and correspondence which were supplied to the judge for the purpose of the extradition hearings.  At first instance the district judge determined that she had no power to grant the media&#8217;s request.  Having conducted a wide-ranging survey of both domestic and European jurisprudence, Toulson LJ explained the development of the court&#8217;s power to determine what open justice requires.  At paragraph 85, his Lordship said this: </p>

However, there may be countervailing reasons. &#8230;.. I do not think that it is sensible or practical to look for a standard formula for determining how strong the grounds of opposition need to be in order to outweigh the merits of the application.  The court has to carry out a proportionality exercise which will be factspecific.  Central to the court&#8217;s evaluation will be the purpose of the open justice principle, the potential value of the material in advancing that purpose and, conversely, any risk of harm which access to the documents may cause to the legitimate interests of others.&#8221; </p>

Administrators, judges, arbitrators, and persons conducting inquiries and investigations depend on it; likewise the press, NGOs and individuals concerned to report on issues of public interest.  Unwillingness to disclose information may arise through habits of secrecy or reasons of self-protection.  But information can be genuinely private, confidential or sensitive, and these interests merit respect in their own right and, in the case of those who depend on information to fulfil their functions, because this may not otherwise be forthcoming.

Even in respect of these categories of documents, consent, anonymity and restrictions upon onward disclosure were to be important considerations in the exercise of judicial discretion and case management.

Rule 12.73 covers what information may be communicated in relation to proceedings held in private without exposing such communications to becoming the subject of contempt proceedings.  R. 12.73(2) is clear:  nothing in this chapter permits communication to the public at large, or any section of the public, of any information relating to the proceedings save where permission is granted by the court or in the limited circumstances set out in r.12.73(1). That contemplates communications between parties and their legal advisers, welfare officers, experts involved in the case and the like.  Practice Direction 12G puts the flesh on the bones of what is and is not permitted in terms of disclosure, subject always to the overall discretion vested in the trial judge to enlarge the scope of any disclosure which may be necessary in any particular case.   </p>

She has given significant weight in reaching her recommendation to M&#8217;s valuable and important rights under article 8(1):  disclosure of the full court file to a journalist, albeit a respected professional, would not coincide with the child&#8217;s best interests.

To look at the balancing act which is required on the basis that she will see the documents and there the matter will end does not reflect the reality of the situation.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in">Ms Fottrell QC reminds me that there is a very strong public interest in maintaining the privacy afforded to proceedings which concern children.  She points to published research<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="7">

	      </authorialNote> which demonstrates the extent to which children who are the subject of such proceedings invariably resist wider publication about their private family circumstances.  They worry about general publicity and being the subject of speculation amongst their peers, friends, neighbours and classmates.  The preservation of confidentiality (or privacy) in relation to the intimate details of their family lives is there to protect them as individual children as well as for purposes of protecting the public interest and nothing in the transparency initiative dilutes that principle. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in">The private rights of children are, she submits, no less important than those of an adult and the court should look for solid justification before invading the privacy of information contained in documents such as psychological reports and medical records.  This principle achieves greater momentum in circumstances where the disclosure sought involves the release of these documents not to another family member or associated party but to a journalist who is a complete stranger to the child concerned.  Ms Fottrell QC submits that children such as M are entitled to have their private information under the careful control of the court.  She submits that whilst disclosure is often necessary when it is made to third parties involved in litigation which is designed to achieve an outcome based upon that child&#8217;s best interests, we should only step over that line so far as is necessary.  The mere fact that M&#8217;s mother is prepared to consent to disclosure on behalf of her child is not a good reason to avoid the careful balancing exercise which has to be undertaken by the court which ultimately controls the process of disclosure. </p>

Here, she submits that the best interests of a child will always be the court&#8217;s primary concern; the paramountcy principle goes merely to weight in any case where that principle is properly applied. </p>

The decision in that case concerned the weight which should be given to the best interests of children who are affected by the decision to remove or deport one or more of their parents from the country.  From paragraphs 21 to 28 of her judgment, Baroness Hale traced the development of the broad consensus which had emerged in both domestic and international jurisprudence that, in all decisions concerning children, Convention rights had to be interpreted on the basis that their best interests must be paramount.  Her Ladyship pointed to article 3.1 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of the Child 1989 (&#8220;UNCRC&#8221;) which provides as follows: </p>

This is not, it is agreed, a factor of limitless importance in the sense that it will prevail over all other considerations.  It is a factor, however, that must rank higher than any other.  It is not merely one consideration that weighs in the balance alongside other competing factors.  Where the best interests of the child clearly favour a certain course, that course should be followed unless countervailing reasons of considerable force displace them.  It is not necessary to express this in terms of a presumption but the primacy of this consideration needs to be made clear in emphatic terms.  What is determined to be in the child&#8217;s best interests should customarily dictate the outcome of cases such as the present, therefore, and it will require considerations of substantial moment to permit a different result.&#8221; </p>

The merits of her application have been argued from the foot of existing law as it has developed through cases and statutory guidance.  My core bundle was restricted in the main to the application and the statement in support, previous judgments and orders and such third party responses as had been received from the professionals to whom notice of this application had been given.

In this way, quite properly, M&#8217;s parents (and her mother and M&#8217;s Guardian in particular) were provided with full and transparent details of the unredacted information which had informed the approach of both the local authority and the social workers and other professionals involved in the case.

She has given her full consent to the release of the information sought and has given that consent both on her own behalf and that of her child.   Thus, the fact that the disclosure application is made in this instance by a journalist rather than a member of the family affected by any order may be of less weight in the exercise I have to conduct. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in">It seems to me that the answer to this particular question is one that can only be determined by the court in accordance with established legal principles.  At the end of the day, it is not for journalists to determine the <span style="font-style:italic">lawfulness</span> of any particular decisions taken by judges or public bodies.  That is the function of a judicial system which operates within State-mandated boundaries and judicial precedent.  It is entirely appropriate and an important part of the media&#8217;s function to hold up to public scrutiny and debate the reasons for the rules which bind us together as a democratic society.  Equally, they must ensure that unintended consequences of legislation and miscarriages of justice in any individual case are subjected to the spotlight of intense public scrutiny and debate.  In similar terms, any exercise of judicial discretion has to be undertaken (i) from the basis of established facts, and (ii) with a fully reasoned exposition or judgment which sets out a comprehensive and transparent basis for a particular decision.  In this case, the important check and balance which exists as a function of the appellate process intervened to put right the potential injustice for this child which it agreed had occurred.  The thorough and careful judgment which King LJ gave at the conclusion of the appeal explains precisely what mistakes had occurred, what questions had not been answered by the trial judge, and the defects in the process of his decisionmaking which had exposed M to the risk of being permanently separated from her birth family.  There was no criticism of the local authority in <span style="font-style:italic">launching</span> the care proceedings as part of its statutory obligations to protect vulnerable children living within its area of responsibility.  Indeed, there was no criticism of that authority for defending the mother&#8217;s appeal.  In finding that its actions had not been unreasonable so as to attract a costs sanction, the presumption has to be that the Court of Appeal found it to have been acting reasonably. </p>

Transparency of process requires a full understanding of not only how decisions are made but the basis of the facts and evidence-gathering which supports those decisions.  The opportunity which journalists now have to sit in and observe the Family Courts in action gives them the opportunity, on behalf of the wider public, to see that process unfolding in real time and to observe the procedures which are put in place to ensure a fair and Article 6-compliant hearing for all the families involved.  When such litigation concerns State intervention in family life, it is imperative that decision-making is subjected to particular scrutiny.   </p>

She seeks to understand how social workers and others make their decisions and the parameters within which issues and concerns for children are addressed.  She wishes to explore, by reference to this particular case study, whether wider policy considerations influenced or determined decisions taken by the local authority at crucial points in that process.  That in itself raises the issue of how far her Article 10 rights are engaged in the balancing exercise.  I have determined that they plainly are engaged.  Her request to <span style="font-style:italic">access</span> this information, if not to publish it without first securing the court&#8217;s later permission, raises many if not all of the considerations which would fall to be examined at the next stage, i.e. the permission to publish. </p>

In regards, to maintaining the privacy of my daughter, [M], and her family, this is now unachievable.

That trauma has been such that the child requires ongoing therapeutic intervention to mitigate its continuing effects.  She is still only 7 years old.

In terms she says to me, &#8220;It is already out there so what is the harm in releasing further detail to Ms Newman ?&#8221;.  In this context, I find myself unable to agree with the conclusions which this mother has reached in relation to the ongoing engagement of M&#8217;s Article 8 rights.  I do not accept that her child&#8217;s anonymity is, as her mother expresses it, &#8220;beyond repair&#8221;.  The information contained in the various judgments which are now published and available for public consumption is indeed significant in terms of background detail and content.

In circumstances where accredited members of the media are permitted to sit in on family cases, why, she asks, should they not have access to whatever material they wish to see subject to specific reporting restrictions imposed by a judge ?

At that point in time, and after much careful thought and debate surrounding the change to the Family Procedure Rules, it was decided that the press should be entitled to see whatever was reasonably necessary for a broad understanding of the case.  The interests of a child or third party in the confidentiality of their personal information extended beyond the mere provision of limited information to journalists:  it was a specific reason for excluding them from all or part of the proceedings.   </p>

The mother wishes to open the way to an open debate in the media about whether or not there has been a miscarriage of justice in this case.  She supports the release of information to Ms Newman for these purposes even where that information touches and concerns the most personal and private details of her own medical history.  It seems to me that she is entitled to make that waiver on her own behalf if and insofar as it is not contrary to the best interests of her child.  In this context it is important to bear well in mind that M is now reunited with her mother and living in a household where she will continue to live probably for the next decade and more.  These will be challenging years for a child who has evidently been severely traumatised by the litigation in which she has already been involved and the publicity which has surrounded the appeal in that litigation.  I accept that the original proceedings have now concluded but Ms Newman&#8217;s application has already provoked a further round of litigation and anticipates yet more litigation should her current application succeed.  There is thus the potential that this child will be drawn back into the forensic spotlight of further court scrutiny.  </p>

Not having seen the medical records, and knowing only what I read in the published information which is available from the published judgments, I cannot imagine what that information might be.

Such a step would represent a clear court-directed intrusion of this child&#8217;s most basic and fundamental rights to a private family life.  If those rights are to be the subject of court-sanctioned interference, there has to be a proper justification.  I appreciate that Ms Newman cannot justify that interference on any specific basis because she has not yet seen the medical and other records.  She wants to read them in order to see what they contain.  Having reflected carefully, and because of the intimately personal and sensitive nature of this material, I do not consider the mother&#8217;s consent to its release on her own or M&#8217;s behalf to be sufficient to displace the overwhelming need to ensure that such information remains confidential from public scrutiny and I would include Ms Newman within this embargo. In the context of this application, I am satisfied that she has sufficient material about the medical history of both M and her mother.  It is either already in the public domain and recorded in the judgments to which I have referred or it is likely on the balance of probabilities to be irrelevant to any decisions which were made in those proceedings.  To the extent that those judgments have not recorded the full detail of the medical evidence available in the bundles, I am satisfied that such confidence will have been preserved for a very good reason.   </p>

If they are typical of the contact records which are regularly produced in care proceedings, they will no doubt contain details about the dates and frequency / duration of such periods of contact.  They are more often than not a useful source of reference for observations about interactions between a child and his or her family members.  They can demonstrate the extent to which a parent has insight into a child&#8217;s needs, how he or she is able to hold a child&#8217;s attention with appropriate activities and child-centred play.  Whilst I have not seen the contact records in this case, I know that they have been referred to and, to some extent, relied on in the social work undertaken and the Guardian&#8217;s analysis of the relationship between M and her family members.  The judgment produced by His Honour Judge Hess sets out an overview of contact for a period of nearly a year between 2016 and 2017.  There is reference in his judgment to certain aspects of concern which arose from those contact records.  We know that ultimately, following the reversal of the placement order by the Court of Appeal, the contact records were sufficiently positive for both the local authority and the Guardian to recommend the return of M into the care of her family. </p>

However, it appears from the schedule with which I have been provided that objection is taken because of the multiple references in these notes to private information relating to M and her family.  Given this factor, I accept that a release of these records to Ms Newman could be seen as a significant interference with the child&#8217;s Article 8 rights to a private family life. It appears from the indices in Section F of the core bundle that there are hundreds of pages of contact notes and I cannot see how it would be proportionate or necessary to require the local authority to conduct an extensive redaction exercise in circumstances where there is within the published judgments a summary of the progress of contact.  M is now back with her family and that fact alone speaks to the success of those contact arrangements and their development in the context of the family&#8217;s rehabilitation. </p>

In response to the consultation process, the police have confirmed that they are not in a position to consent to disclosure.  This remains a matter for the court as part of its balancing exercise.  I accept that the mother is entitled to share details of her criminal record with Ms Newman if that is what she chooses to do.  What she cannot do is waive the rights of any other individuals who are referred to in, or are the subject of, the police disclosure.  This constitutes private information and, whilst perhaps not always on a par with the sensitivities of medical evidence, the police records may nevertheless reveal intensely personal and sensitive information which has the potential to influence matters such as reputation, employment prospects and the formation of future social and personal relationships.  In this case, the judgment of His Honour Judge Hess makes clear reference to the mother&#8217;s involvement with the police.  That information is already in the public domain.  In these circumstances I cannot, for example, protect M from the consequences of it being public knowledge that her mother was arrested.  This mother will no doubt be able to provide Ms Newman with a full narrative account of the circumstances of her own arrest and criminal record.  I cannot see what a formal disclosure of the underlying police records will add to her forthcoming journalistic enquiries over and above what she already knows about the case both from the public judgments and from her discussions about the case with M&#8217;s mother.   </p>

It is clear from the observations of Sir James Munby P in <span style="font-style:italic">Re G </span>that the court will not permit an &#8216;archaeological excavation&#8217; through material in the trial bundles so as to be enable a family member to come to independent conclusions about the quality of the evidence or the reliability of the trial judge&#8217;s reasoning and conclusions.  Adopting his Lordship&#8217;s analogy, it seems to me that much of the material which Ms Newman seeks to &#8216;mine&#8217; relates to the very personal and private aspects of the lives and histories not only of M and her mother but of other family members.  If that did not weigh sufficiently in the balance of a family member&#8217;s Article 10 rights in <span style="font-style:italic">Webster</span>, it is difficult to see what change she can point to in terms of public policy in relation to child protection issues which might warrant wholesale disclosure to a journalist who has no direct family connection. </p>

Their entire focus is on steps and actions being taken or considered in order to safeguard vulnerable children who are potentially at risk of harm.  They come into existence at various stages during the risk assessment process both before and after the commencement of formal court proceedings.  They are conducted at a time when perceived risks may not be substantiated by a solid body of reliable evidence such as would be required by a court charged with reaching what are often exquisitely difficult decisions about whether to separate children from their birth families.  Because the overriding objective of such meetings is the immediate safety of children, they are of necessity a forum for free discussion of views and opinions expressed by professionals coming together from a number of different backgrounds.  These meetings are conducted on a confidential basis and the expectations of all those who attend is that they are free to express views and concerns in confidence with that objective.  The written reports or minutes of such meetings attract a high level of confidence for obvious reasons. Save in cases of exceptional risk or emergency, parents are invariably permitted to attend these meetings (including the regular reviews which are held) and will thus be privy to the views which are expressed. </p>

In this context it is important to remember that confidentiality in this context should not be equated with secrecy.  A local authority which evaluates the risk to a child as being substantial and crossing threshold in any given case will always be required to subject those concerns to the scrutiny of the court.  Ms Newman would no doubt argue that judicial scrutiny and challenge through the forensic court process is not always sufficient protection against potential miscarriages of justice.  She is right to make that point.  But child protection case conferences are deliberations which evolve as investigations and enquiries proceed.  They involve professional assessments of risk and for good reasons of public policy the courts have afforded a high level of confidentiality to records informing these ongoing risk assessments.  I can see nothing in this particular case which would justify any departure from that established principle.  The local authority recognises that the mother is entitled to share with Ms Newman those expert assessments which relate to her.  It supports the objections raised by the Guardian on behalf of M in relation to expert reports relating to the child. </p>

The indices refer to psychiatric and other reports in respect of both the mother and M&#8217;s father which were prepared in October 2015.  These reports were before His Honour Judge Hess for the purpose of the hearing in June 2017.  There were further assessments and psychological reports carried out in 2018 in respect of the mother and her new husband when the local authority&#8217;s plans for M changed to rehabilitation within the family.  An independent social worker carried out an assessment of both M&#8217;s mother and stepfather in May 2018 in the context of the proposed reunification of the family. </p>

Whilst he heard from a number of witnesses, it does not appear from the summary in paragraph 7 of his judgment that the authors of these reports were required to give oral evidence.  It is nevertheless true that, subject to any reporting restrictions put in place by the judge, those experts would have expected that they might be required to attend for cross-examination on the content and conclusions of their reports in the presence of any press members attending.  That by itself would not have given such journalists access to copies of the full reports.   </p>

The basis of such disclosure, he suggested, was that journalists should be able to comment upon the reports and the use to which they were put in the proceedings so long as this did not undermine the child&#8217;s anonymity.   </p>

The rationale for such communication, in whatever form it takes, is designed to encourage experts to agree or at least to narrow issues.  If experts believed that their deliberations were to be opened to the scrutiny of parties and their legal advisers, they would doubtless be reluctant to make concessions and accept the validity of different opinions.  They can, of course, be challenged in crossexamination about the reasons underlying their conclusions and opinions but this is different from requiring them to publish or open to scrutiny the professional discussions which informed those conclusions.   </p>

Reports such as these are an important aspect of the forensic evaluation process which a court must undertake because they are often an expert distillation of a significant quantity of underlying material.   I start from the proposition that Ms Newman has every right to pursue her journalistic enquiries in circumstances where she believes that something may have gone wrong in this case, whether or not there has been a miscarriage of justice.  I have already expressed my view that any potential miscarriage of justice for this family was averted by the decision of the Court of Appeal to set aside the original placement order.  The judgment of King LJ is the clearest evidence of the judicial process at an appellate level working as a proper check and balance in respect of a flawed decision made by a lower court.  As she has explained to me, Ms Newman&#8217;s investigations extend beyond the court process itself.  As I understand it, she wishes to understand the process and evolution of the local authority&#8217;s decision-making in terms of the original institution of care proceedings and its subsequent decision to rehabilitate M with her family. </p>

There is no detailed analysis of these reports in any of the published judgments.  The mother has expressly waived her Article 8 rights in respects of these documents and has consented to their release to Ms Newman.  As I have said, she cannot waive the Article 8 rights of other parties to the litigation such as M&#8217;s biological father.  I have not read this material and no one has suggested that I should do.  I was told by Ms Rogers QC that the author of the clinical psychology report prepared in relation to the mother and the independent social worker who assessed the mother and her husband have no objections to Ms Newman being shown copies of their reports. </p>

We are not at that stage.  Ms Newman, for present purposes, seeks only to understand from information which was put before the court by the local authority why decisions were taken both by its officers and social workers and ultimately by the court.  For these purposes she wants access to everything in the court files.  I have explained why that request is far too wide and, in certain respects, inimical to M&#8217;s interests.  </p>

Taking into account the important role which journalists have as a result of the engagement of their Article 10 rights, I have reached the conclusion that, in relation to the reports which relate to the mother herself, the balance falls in favour of allowing Ms Newman to see these.  I appreciate that there may be reference in those expert reports to her underlying medical records in respect of which, as a category of documents, I have not authorised release.  To the extent that there is specific reference to the child&#8217;s medical history which is not already in the public domain through the judgments, the reports in relation to the mother will need to be redacted to preserve M&#8217;s confidentiality in respect of her own medical history.  The same principle applies to any reference in the reports on the mother to M&#8217;s biological father and his medical history.

I have already explained why I do not consider the wholesale waiver of those rights which M&#8217;s mother is prepared to give is conclusive and/or in the best interests of this 7 year old child.  These assessments will cover a very broad range of sensitive and private information relating to the backgrounds and early lives of each of M&#8217;s parents, as well as M&#8217;s own early circumstances.  To redact large sections of these assessments would inevitably lead to an unintelligible document.  This runs the very risk of uninformed reporting which Ms Newman wishes to avoid. </p>

Insofar as these details were relevant to decision-making, they have been referred to in the published judgments.  Weighing these matters carefully in the balance, I cannot see any justification for prioritising Ms Newman&#8217;s wish to conduct a trawl through this material over and above this child&#8217;s expectation of privacy for the intimate details of her family life.  In circumstances where I would be unlikely to permit the publication of this information in any media article which Ms Newman might wish to write for consumption by the general public, I can see no principled reason to elevate her wish to read the material over the importance I attach to M&#8217;s Article 8 right to confidentiality in respect of that information.  Unlike the specific reports and assessments which relate to the mother, who has given her consent to their release, these statements have been provided by third parties.

I do not agree that her consent on behalf of M is determinative in this case.  As the President made clear in paragraph 74 of his &#8216;Publication&#8217; judgment reported at <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2020/122" uk:canonical="[2020] EWHC 122 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] EWHC 122 (Fam)</ref>, the <span style="font-style:italic">Maktoum</span> case was wholly unusual on its facts.
