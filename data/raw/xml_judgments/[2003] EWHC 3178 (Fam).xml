Virad&#8217;s mother is 40 year old Mrs Manisha K, a former social worker now qualifying as a solicitor.  She lives alone in Cardiff.  I shall refer to them as the mother and the father.</p>

In my judgment of 1 March 2002 I accepted his report and the evidence he had given before me on the previous day.  He supported Virad remaining with his father.  This was because he saw no relief from the emotional pressure which Virad&#8217;s mother placed upon him and no recognition by her of the actual as well as the potential harm  that it could cause.</p>

She has not intended to harm her son, but the unbridled intensity of her hostile emotions against Mr K swamp Virad&#8217;s thinking mechanism, so that he suffers emotionally and is abusive in his subsequent emotions and behaviour.</p>

Telephone contact had been emotionally upsetting on Virad and he did not recommend it.  He recommended a supervised day contact visit by Virad with Mrs K in each of the school holidays.  He appreciated it was little but it was better for Virad than not seeing his mother; there was an encouragement for Virad and his mother to plan for a resumption of holiday staying contact in the future.</p>

Having looked at the arrangements but regretting having received no comments from the mother, he considered the father&#8217;s application was well-grounded.  A three year stay was more likely to broaden Virad&#8217;s horizons than impair them.  He concluded that there seemed no good reason from Virad&#8217;s point of view to refuse the father&#8217;s application.</p>

They were also spending significant periods of time with them.  I am satisfied that it would require exceptional circumstances before a parent only seeing a child in terms of supervised contact 2 or 3 times a year would be a party to a shared residence order.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Shared residence orders are not necessarily exceptional; they were to be made if in the best interests of the children.  However, it was important to realise that a residence order was an order which settled the arrangements to be made as to the person with whom a child was to live.  In the instant case, the Recorder had made a shared residence order to recognise the equal status of each parent in relation to all 3 children.  However, it was difficult to make such an order about a child who was not only living with one of the parents but was, for the foreseeable future, unlikely ever to visit that parent.  The court&#8217;s order had to be designed to reflect the real position on the ground.  Accordingly the shared residence order in relation to M was inappropriate and an order that M was to live with his father and have contact with his mother would be substituted.&#8221;</p>

I grant the father&#8217;s application for a sole residence order.  I dismiss the mother&#8217;s application of 28 August 2003 for enforcement of an order for telephone contact.  I grant the father&#8217;s application of 17 October 2003 for leave to remove Virad to Shanghai for a period of 3 years from the summer of 2004.  I give the mother leave to apply.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, bearing in mind that I consider that at this stage telephone contact between the mother and Virad is too upsetting for him to be to his advantage, I urge the mother to write to him on a regular basis.  I have not discovered why she will not do this given the ready manner in which she has been able to write to me.</p>

If the mother finds it too upsetting to write she might well receive assistance from friends or counsellors to give assistance.  I also hope that her start with counselling will be shown to be real and beneficial and that mediation can include the father in due course.</p>
