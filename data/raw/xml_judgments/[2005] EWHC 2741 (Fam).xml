	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">Last Tuesday (22 November 2005), whilst I was sitting as the urgent applications judge in the Family Division, counsel instructed by well-known matrimonial solicitors of unimpeachable integrity applied to me ex parte for a worldwide freezing injunction. The application was made by a wife in a pending divorce suit. She claimed that the husband was about to make a disposition, in circumstances caught by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>, of a valuable residential property in London. The wife understood that the husband was on the point of completing a sale in relation to which contracts had already been exchanged. The registered proprietor of the property was a Lichtenstein anstalt which, according to the wife, was merely the husband's alter ego. In these circumstances the wife's advisers took the view that there was no need to join the anstalt as a party: see the discussion in <span style="font-style:italic">Re W (Ex Parte Orders)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] 2 FLR 927" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] 2 FLR 927</ref> at page 938 of, in particular, <span style="font-style:italic">Purba v Purba</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] 1 FLR 444" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] 1 FLR 444</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Khreino v Khreino (No 2) (court's power to grant injunctions)</span> [2000] 1 FCR 80. They took the view that it would be sufficient if the injunction, although directed only against the husband, was served on the anstalt and on the purchasers. </p>

Accordingly, the freezing injunction I granted contained a provision giving the wife "permission to notify the following persons of the terms of this Order by serving a copy of this Order upon them."

I declined to deal with that application in the absence of the wife's representatives and the matter came back in front of me later in the day inter partes. The wife's solicitors indicated through counsel that they had no objection whatever to providing the information but felt constrained in the absence of a court order. I made the appropriate order but reserved for further consideration the question of whether any such order was necessary or whether, as I was inclined to think, it had in fact been the obligation of the wife's solicitors to comply with the request from Citibank without waiting for an application to the court. </p>

The principle set out in the passage in <span style="font-style:italic">Re W (Ex Parte Orders)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] 2 FLR 927" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] 2 FLR 927</ref> to which I have just referred applies whether the request comes from the party who is injuncted or from someone, whether or not a party to the proceedings, and whether or not he has himself been injuncted, who has been served with or given notice of the injunction.</p>

The confidentiality of the proceedings (even if they were confidential) was not of itself any answer to Citibank's request. The wife's solicitors could, and should, have supplied copies of the documents requested, and without requiring Citibank first to obtain an order of the court.</p>

And, as I have already made clear, I accept without reservation that the wife's solicitors reasonably believed themselves to be precluded from giving Citibank the information requested. Accordingly, no criticism of the wife's solicitors is to be read into anything I have said. But the position is now, I hope, clear. For the future, the wife's solicitors and others who may hereafter find themselves in a similar predicament will know how they ought to proceed.</p>

	    <intro>
	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">The first arises out of my observation in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S (Ex Parte Orders)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 1 FLR 308" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 1 FLR 308</ref> at page 317 that:</p>

	  <heading class="NormalWeb">In other words, information should be volunteered without waiting to be asked. That principle no doubt applies in the case of those parties against whom the injunction has been obtained. But I see no reason why it should be extended to those, not parties and not themselves injuncted, who are merely served with or given notice of an injunction. In their case the obligation, it seems to me, is confined to supplying information when asked. After all, banks served with freezing orders might not welcome becoming the automatic recipients of all the often voluminous evidence put before the court.</heading>

	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">The second point relates to certain limited exceptions to the principle that the court cannot receive communications from one party which are to be kept secret from the other. As I said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S (Ex Parte Orders)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 1 FLR 308" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 1 FLR 308</ref> at page 317:</p>

	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">The third point relates to the potential embarrassment to the parties &#8211; the husband and wife &#8211; which can arise in a case such as this if evidence in the divorce proceedings has to be disclosed to third parties. I had to consider a similar issue in <span style="font-style:italic">Kelly v BBC</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 1 FLR 197" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 1 FLR 197</ref> at page 239, when pressed with the problems which might arise if the evidence in a wardship case had to be shown to the media. I said there was no "justification for not making full disclosure to the media of the material on the basis of which an injunction contra mundum has been granted." I continued: </p>

		<p class="ind" style="margin-left:1in">"This may give rise to a practical problem, for very often the material relied on in support of the application for such an injunction will be contained in affidavits or witness statements filed in the substantive children proceedings which contain a mass of other information which is of no relevance to the application for the injunction, which there is no need for the media or any other third party to see and which it is highly undesirable that they should be allowed to see. </p>

		<p class="ind" style="margin-left:1in">That is, however, no reason for denying the media their right &#8211; and in my judgment it is their unqualified right &#8211; to see the material which has been relied upon against them. If, as will typically be the case, it is not appropriate for the media to see the material in the form in which it was originally filed with the court, the solution is not to deny them what they are plainly entitled to as a matter of natural justice &#8211; and what, I might add, they will plainly be entitled to in accordance with Art 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 1950 once the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref> comes into force &#8211; but rather to set out the relevant material in a separate affidavit or affidavits which can be shown to the media."</p>
