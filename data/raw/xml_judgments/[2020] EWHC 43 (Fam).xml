As part of a lengthy court order, the judge determined that two particular plots of land in Cyprus should be transferred to the applicant.  The issue for determination is whether or not, prior to the completion of that transfer, the respondent was responsible (personally or through instructions given to others) for the removal of a number of olive and other trees which were formerly planted on that land.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:0.04in">The issue which lies at the heart of this satellite litigation (&#8220;the tree issue&#8221;) can be simply stated.  At the conclusion of long-running and highly acrimonious financial litigation flowing from divorce proceedings, Moylan J (as he then was) ordered the respondent husband to transfer to the applicant wife a small estate of land in Cyprus on which stood many mature olive trees.  That transfer of property was but one small part of a wholesale reorganisation of their matrimonial property situate in this jurisdiction and elsewhere.  The value of the matrimonial property was substantial (in excess of &#163;60 million) and, as a result of the trial judge&#8217;s order, the applicant wife received shares in a number of valuable commercial property companies.  The extraction and implementation process has been long and complex.  Moylan J made his order on 15 May 2017.  We are now almost two years further on in this process but many of the issues surrounding implementation of the mainframe order continue to separate these parties and take up valuable court time. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.29in;margin-right:0.04in">In relation to the discrete issue of the olive trees and the transfer of the Cyprus property to the applicant, the respondent has felt particularly aggrieved.  He sought to appeal that decision but lost in the Court of Appeal.  Moylan J was highly disparaging about certain aspects of the respondent&#8217;s litigation conduct in the financial remedy proceedings.  Notwithstanding that these were essentially private proceedings which were subject to the implied duty of confidentiality, his Lordship reflected his disapproval and censure of that litigation conduct in a public open judgment. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.29in;margin-right:0.04in">The order made by Moylan J on 15 May 2017 is long and complex.  It runs to 63 separate paragraphs over 27 pages.  By paragraph 57, he specifically released the parties from their implied duty of confidentiality in relation to six identified issues.  Four of those issues concerned ongoing or potential litigation in relation to matters arising from, or in connection with, the operation of various companies in which the parties had an interest during their marriage.  Two of the issues related to the tax affairs of the parties and/or the companies which each was to retain and the ordinary course of their business dealings in relation to those companies.  In other words, in the context of advancing or defending positions in any litigation which was, or might be, ongoing in relation to these corporate entities, each of the applicant and respondent was no longer to be bound by any confidentiality owed to the other or the court in the context of that litigation. </p>

Given the size of the trees, this would not have been an insignificant operation.  She discovered that the trees appeared to have been re-planted on another property in Cyprus (Plot B).  The applicant commenced enforcement proceedings in which she sought reinstatement of those trees on her land and/or damages in respect of any trees which had died or otherwise not survived the transplantation process. </p>

He later accepted that his employees had removed certain plants from the land but maintained that they were not olive trees but &#8220;windbreakers&#8221;.  He was adamant that he had played no part in removing any olive trees from his former wife&#8217;s land.  She was subsequently able to produce drone footage showing exactly what trees had been growing on the area where the trees originally stood delineated on a map and in still photographs (Plot A).  The drone footage had been taken before there was any issue of removal.  As long ago as March 2018 when the issue of the trees was before me for case management, I had viewed this drone footage and expressed a provisional and preliminary view that it was tolerably clear that what I was observing on that video footage was a collection of mature and well-established olive trees. </p>

The respondent&#8217;s case at that stage, in summary, was that, whilst he accepted he had removed eight palm trees from the applicant&#8217;s land, he was not responsible for removing and replanting the olive trees which were not, in any event, the same trees.  Mr Cocking concluded that, in his expert opinion, the newly-planted olive trees which he inspected on Plot B (all about 50 years old) were the same trees as those which had been removed from Plot A.  His report is dated 23 November 2018. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.29in;margin-right:0.04in">On 19 December 2018, there was a further hearing following the publication of Mr Cocking&#8217;s report.  The respondent instructed a different counsel on that occasion (not Mr Troman); Mr Southgate QC was unable to appear and negotiations took place outside court between different counsel with a view to resolving all outstanding matters in relation to the tree issue.   Whilst the parties appeared to be making progress, it was plain from the correspondence which was exchanged after the conclusion of the hearing that the parties had been unsuccessful in settling this aspect of the litigation although the respondent was by now offering to reinstate the trees and pay the applicant&#8217;s costs of the exercise. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:1.29in;margin-right:0.04in">The matter comes back before me today (i.e. 6 March 2019).  The respondent continues to make no admissions in relation to liability notwithstanding that these matters have absorbed several days of court time and an enormous amount of the lawyers&#8217; time with the inevitable expense which that has entailed.  The applicant&#8217;s costs alone are now approaching c. &#163;500,000 on this one issue alone. </p>

In circumstances where Mr Troman now accepts that his client will be responsible for her indemnity costs and for the costs of the transplantation exercise which will hopefully result in the reinstatement of the olive trees on her land, he asks why his client should be fixed with formal liability in respect of the wrongful removal of those trees.  He maintains that to permit Mr Southgate QC to cross-examine his client with a view to establishing liability on the evidence is an abuse of the process in circumstances where there is no further relief which the applicant could obtain from her original application. </p>

The respondent renewed his application for permission to appeal that decision (which I had refused) to the Court of Appeal.  On 11 July 2019, Lady Justice King refused permission to appeal on the basis that there was no prospect of success in any substantive appeal were permission to have been granted.

I remind myself that, since it is the applicant who makes these allegations against the respondent, it is she who bears the burden of proof.  In other words, the burden of proving a fact rests on the person who asserts it.  Since these are essentially civil proceedings, she must satisfy me that, on the balance of probabilities, it is more likely than not that the event occurred.  Here, the applicant must establish that it was more likely than not that it was the respondent who removed, or caused the removal, of the olive and other trees from her land.  In this context neither the seriousness of the allegation, nor the seriousness of the consequences, nor the inherent probability of the allegations alter the standard of proof.  Each piece of evidence has to be considered in the context of the whole. </p>

He provided a lengthy explanation as to how a number of different trees (some 178 in total, including 48 olive trees) had been planted on various plots on his land.  In support of this explanation he provided various photographs and a report which had been prepared by a local garden nursery supplier following a site visit to Plot 19/172 in December 2017.  That report states that there were 61 olive trees on the plot together with various other fruit trees.  He accepts that the report has overstated the number of olive trees by one because of a &#8216;miscalculation&#8217;.  He has produced a further report from a local horticulturalist dated 30 March 2018 following a site visit by that individual to Plot 19/172 in mid-March 2018.  She records 49 healthy olive trees and seven dead trees present on site as at the date of her inspection. </p>

I was told that it would not be possible as their roots would be cut in the process and would wither and die.  I therefore said in my solicitors&#8217; letter of 10 November 2017 &#8230; that it would not be possible.  I have since spoken with other nurseries who have told me that, whilst it is possible to transplant mature trees, there is only around a 60% success rate in replanting mature trees of 25 years age or more.  I have nurtured the trees on Plot 1339 for many years and I would not take the risk of uprooting and transplanting them if doing so was likely to kill or harm them.  I continued to nurture and maintain the farm at great expense even after my application for permission to appeal was refused to ensure that it was transferred in a healthy condition.  The Agriplanat valuation which I have obtained in respect of the trees located on Plot 19/172 confirms that the possibility of loss in the case of uprooting and replanting the trees would be around 40%.  Ms Theophilou places the chances of loss of trees in transplanting at around 20 &#8211; 30% in her report.  As I have said above, none of the seven trees which my workmen initially transported from Plot 713 survived.  The trees I purchased for Plot 19/172 from third party suppliers were in pots and could therefore be easily transported and planted without causing damage to the trees. </p>

In relation to each of the issues he was asked to address, he has provided a comprehensive and reasoned response.  There is a detailed breakdown on each and every compartment and zone he inspected and a precise identification of the number of trees planted in each. He concludes that there were, in all, 57 olive trees removed from Plots 1232/1255 and 1339.  He has explained in detail the methodology he used to establish the ages of the trees and the manner in which the core samples he took were treated and tested.  He has concluded that the trees were old and established olive trees which were likely to have been planted when they were between 5 and 10 years old.  Their average ages were now c. 49.5 years with a possibility of having been planted between 39 and 44 years ago.  Mr Cocking concludes that, at the time of his inspection, there were a total of 56 olive trees on Plot 19/172 (the respondent&#8217;s retained land), all of which were newly planted in the soil in which they stood.  These consisted of 52 semi-mature trees, 2 large dead or dying specimens and 2 medium aged specimens.  The newly planted trees at Plot 19/172 had been &#8216;hard pruned&#8217; and were showing regrowth that was about a year old suggesting that the trees had been prepared for transport and planting about 1 year previously.   </p>

A further olive tree was considered to be dying with little chance of recovery and Mr Cocking considered this to be due to &#8216;transplant shock&#8217;, a common phenomenon when planting older trees that are less resilient to the procedure of transplant.  As he records in his report, this provided him with further evidence that these trees did not exist on the site prior to November 2017. </p>

To an extent it did.  The issue of liability for the removal of the trees had been listed for a hearing before me on 19 December 2018.  By that stage, whilst not prepared to hold his hands up and admit formally that he bore responsibility for removing and replanting the olive and palm trees on his own land, the respondent had, through his legal representatives, agreed to transfer the trees back to the applicant and to cover all her legal costs on an indemnity basis.  As a result, the hearing on 19 December was vacated.  However, they were unable to agree the terms of an order and/or the precise mechanics of the re-transplantation process.  The latter issue was resolved when it was agreed that the single joint expert, Mr Cocking, would appoint and supervise an independent contractor to move the trees back onto the applicant&#8217;s land. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">As I began to hear submissions from Mr Southgate QC at the commencement of this hearing on 12 November 2019, there was still no formal admission from the respondent that he had played any part in relation to the removal of the trees prior to the transfer of the land to the applicant in accordance with the orders made by Moylan J.   Perhaps of greater significance, there was no attempt on his part to retract any part of his substantive case as set out in some considerable detail in his written statement of 10 April 2018.  The only material he put before the court was his (renewed) application to vacate the hearing and thereby avoid any findings on the tree issue.  The justification for that application was primarily his inability to &#8216;countenance placing [him]self under yet further strain by attending court on 12 November to give evidence&#8217;.  At no stage in his statement dated 9 October 2019 did he suggest that he had misled the applicant or the court.  He prayed in aid only his voluntary repatriation of the trees and the sum of just under &#163;330,000 which he had paid to the applicant in respect of her indemnity costs relating to this discrete issue.  Once again he expressed an anxiety about the use which the applicant and/or either of his two sons might make of a formal judgment in respect of his liability for any involvement in the removal of the trees.  I shall return to this shortly in the context of why this judgment has been released as an open judgment. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Having carefully reviewed all the evidence which is before the court, I am entirely satisfied that, on the balance of probabilities, the respondent was responsible for the removal of the applicant&#8217;s trees prior to the formal transfer to her of the plots of land on which they previously stood.  If he did not physically assist in the removal of the trees, I am satisfied that he gave instructions to a team of contractors to carry out the removal.  It is abundantly clear from the terms of Mr Cocking&#8217;s report that this operation would have involved a substantial number of man hours and, most probably, a significant amount of heavy lifting equipment to remove and transport the trees.  It was, in my judgment, a substantial operation which was motivated by a desire not only to preserve what he could from land which he had fought tooth and nail to preserve in the context of the ongoing matrimonial proceedings:  it was also, as I find, an act of pure spite against the applicant. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Whilst the respondent admitted removing eight &#8220;potted&#8221; palm trees, he has maintained throughout that he did not remove any of the missing olive trees as the applicant was alleging.  In support of that &#8216;defence&#8217; he has sought to construct an elaborate narrative into which he has woven various &#8216;explanations&#8217; as to why her allegations are unlikely to be true.  He has declined to submit himself for cross-examination in relation to his narrative, aspects of which are patently untrue in the light of the unchallenged expert evidence.  I do not accept that the CAPO documents assist me at all in relation to the </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">tree issue.  These were provided to the SJE and found no traction whatsoever in Mr Cocking&#8217;s report.  Further the statement from Mr Theodoridis dated 21 November 2018 confirming his conversation with Mr Cocking confirms specifically that the (transplanted) trees shown in situ on the respondent&#8217;s retained land identified in various photographs were not sold by his nursery business to the respondent.  The statement confirms precisely what was sold to him (i.e. 48 small ornamental olive trees which were not trees designed for the commercial production of olives and none more than 6 years old at the most).  The statement from Mr Theodoridis contains a statement of truth and has never been the subject of formal challenge by the respondent.  I can only conclude therefore that this aspect of the respondent&#8217;s narrative account is a pure fabrication. I know not whether he has at any stage planted anywhere on his retained land elsewhere in Cyprus the trees which he describes in paragraph 18 of his April 2018 statement but I am confident on the basis of the undisputed expert evidence that these were not the trees observed by Mr Cocking during his site visit.  Thus, I reject in its entirety the detailed description he gave at paragraphs 18 to 20 of how his workmen planted the trees supplied by the nursery over the course of five days and his account of having spoken to those workmen when some of the trees died.  I reject entirely his denial of having removed, or caused to be removed, olive trees from the farm and I find his challenge to the authenticity of the drone footage to be part and parcel of the narrative he was constructing in defence of his former wife&#8217;s allegations.   He appears to accept in paragraph 29 of his statement that whatever was removed from the land was removed by his work force on his instruction but he then attempts to pass this off as the &#8216;cutting back of some wind breakers&#8217;.  In this context, I remind myself about what I saw and observed when I watched the drone footage prior to the instruction of either of the joint experts in this case.  There is no doubt in my mind that what I was observing in the earlier footage, taken prior to the removal of the trees in question, was an established row of mature olive trees.  It was only the indignation expressed by the respondent through his counsel on that occasion and the strength of his denial of involvement which persuaded me to allow him to proceed with the instruction of a single joint expert in relation to the authenticity of the drone footage and the instruction of Mr Cocking.  It follows that I reject the respondent&#8217;s account at paragraph 65 of his statement in relation to why the drone footage is unlikely to be genuine just as I reject his attempt to pass off what was removed as a &#8216;row of wind breakers&#8217; if that was indeed the thrust of his case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Further, I reject the respondent&#8217;s account in paragraph 70 of his statement that, on receiving the initial allegation in November 2017 that he had removed the trees, he had a conversation with a local nursery about the impossibility of such an exercise.  If I am wrong and any such conversation took place, it was likely to have been part and parcel of the false narrative which he was seeking to construct for the purposes of his defence to this court.  I reject the evidence of Ms Theophilou as assisting one way or the other on the principal issue of the respondent&#8217;s liability for the removal of the trees.  She had been asked to express a view about the likelihood of mature trees surviving the transplantation process and, as is now apparent, some of the retransplanted trees have not survived the restitution exercise which the respondent agreed to put in place following receipt of both experts&#8217; reports. </p>

Further, I find that at the time he made those representations, he knew them to be untrue.  In this context, I agree with the earlier findings made by Moylan J (now Lord Justice Moylan) that the respondent cannot be considered a reliable witness in terms of the truth of several aspects of his evidence as presented to the English court in the context of this long-running matrimonial litigation and its implementation.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">He was offered the opportunity by the applicant to admit his role in relation of the removal of the trees.  On the basis of such an admission, she was content to rely upon that admission within the restricted terms of paragraph 57 of Moylan J&#8217;s mainframe order (the confidentiality waiver clause).  In other words, the admission would be covered by the implied undertaking and subject to the exceptions set out in paragraph 57.  He did not avail himself of that opportunity and she now seeks a public judgment recording his liability including my findings in relation to the untrue evidence which he has put before this court. </p>

That does not in my judgment amount to a collateral purpose or an abuse of process.  If established, it may constitute litigation conduct which demonstrates the lengths to which the respondent is prepared to go in order to put undue pressure on the applicant in a litigation context and/or his indifference to his obligation to present his evidence to the court on the basis of facts which he knows or believes to be true.  Just as Moylan J sought to ensure the existence of a level playing field as between these parties for the purposes of the prescribed parallel litigation which continued (and continues) between them, I am equally determined to ensure that neither has an unfair advantage.  I would take exactly the same view if the allegations in relation to the responsibility for damage to property owned by the party seeking a remedy were to be levelled against the applicant wife in this case.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">On behalf of the applicant, Mr Southgate QC seeks an open judgment on the issue of liability.  On balance, I am prepared to accept that the respondent&#8217;s wholesale rejection of liability both in correspondence and in his written evidence to this court, which case I have found to be a manufactured and untrue defence, is ongoing litigation conduct which must find reflection in an open judgment.  His presentation is not the result of a lapse of memory or a misconstruction of actions on his part.  It was a deliberate and contumelious attempt to mislead this court and the applicant in what I suspect was a misplaced hope that she would abandon her application in respect of any formal findings of liability when faced with the prospect of an expensive trial of the issue.  In a <span style="font-style:italic">Lucas </span>context, I reject any suggestion that he has misled the court out of a sense of shame, panic or a desire to protect others.  In my judgment, the stance he has taken in this litigation is part and parcel of the ongoing war of attrition which continues to be waged against the applicant and those family members whom he </p>

It is true that she has to date been given a complete indemnity in relation to her legal costs.  However, in my judgment, this litigant has breached his obligations to this court.  He has been neither frank nor honest in the account he has given and, as such, he has forfeited any entitlement he might have had to confidentiality.  This case has, at the instigation of the respondent, travelled to the Court of Appeal on more than one occasion.  As the Court of Appeal confirmed in <span style="font-style:italic">Lykiardopulo v Lykiardopulo </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2010/1315" uk:canonical="[2010] EWCA Civ 1315" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWCA Civ 1315</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] 1 FLR 1427" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] 1 FLR 1427</ref>, the court is entitled to publish an un-anonymised judgment in circumstances where there has been what amounts in its essence to a fraud on the court.  This is not primarily about assisting a party to secure enforcement of orders which the court has made.  In relation to the Cyprus land and the restoration to that land of all that stood upon it prior to the transfer of the legal title to the applicant, that has now been achieved.  It is about recognising the consequences to a party who is prepared to deliberately obfuscate and mislead in the context of sworn written evidence put before the English court seised of these matters.   </p>

I doubt whether the husband&#8217;s role in the removal of the trees from the applicant&#8217;s land as I have found it to be remains private or confidential information for these purposes in any event.  It seems to me that by his conduct in misrepresenting the position to the court he has sacrificed any confidentiality which arose in the context of these being private financial proceedings between the parties.   </p>

Mr Southgate QC has submitted costs schedules showing a sum of just under &#163;40,000 remaining outstanding given the substantial contribution which has already been made by the respondent to date on an indemnity basis.  I agree that these costs should be assessed on the indemnity basis.  At a late stage, and after the conclusion of the hearing, I received written representations from the respondent which suggested that there are aspects of these costs which he would wish to challenge.  I am minded to assess costs summarily as I have done on previous occasions in this litigation.  It seems to me that there is a tension in the position which the respondent has adopted in relation to his lack of participation in this hearing and his wish to secure the court&#8217;s indulgence in assessing his liability for costs.  Having considered carefully the statement of costs submitted by the applicant&#8217;s solicitors and the points made in the respondent&#8217;s email dated 27 November 2019 (sent at 10:38), I propose to order the respondent to pay the applicant&#8217;s costs in the sum of &#163;39,617.  That sum will be paid within 14 days of the drawing of the order which flows from this judgment. </p>
