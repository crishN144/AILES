	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On other occasions and with reason, the intricacies inherent in seeking to place a child in the USA have been described as &#8220;an undoubted legal minefield.&#8221; In this instance, I am indebted to Miss Cabeza and Mr Hames, both specialists in the field, who have provided invaluable assistance in familiarising me with the statutory framework as well as the case law on the subject of ordinary and habitual residence where the &#8216;looked after&#8217; child is placed overseas.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority&#8217;s application is for permission to remove a child, IA, born in June 2008, so four years and nine months old, from the United Kingdom so that she might go to live in the USA with Mr and Mrs X. They are British Citizens who adopted IA&#8217;s elder half sister, A, in 2003. Their son, O, is 15. A is now 10. Mr and Mrs X are living in the USA largely as the result of Mr X&#8217;s employment. They remain domiciled in England and Wales.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are powerful welfare arguments for acceding to the application, extraordinarily well described within Mr Bob McGavin&#8217;s excellent report, summarised by Mr Hames in this way &#8211; IA will be able to live with and grow up alongside her half sister A whom she already refers to as &#8220;my sister.&#8221; Mr and Mrs X are very impressive individuals who will be able to offer IA a safe, secure and nurturing home where all of her physical and emotional needs can be met. IA is ready and able to move now. She has met and begun to engage very favourably with Mr and Mrs X. Any delay could frustrate her development. IA&#8217;s mother by reason of her very sad history and mental health difficulties was excluded as a potential carer; and it is difficult, says Mr Hames, to conceive of any reasonable objection she might have.</p>

She did attend in person on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> November 2012 when I gave directions which included a requirement she should file evidence if she wished to oppose the application. The indications were that she intended to instruct solicitors. Miss Cabeza provided her with the bundle of papers. Mrs A-K was polite and friendly. </p>

Mr McGavin&#8217;s letter of 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2013 asking the mother to get in touch did not elicit a response. When the allocated social worker and her manager called at the mother&#8217;s home last Thursday, the mother&#8217;s reaction was both aggressive and bizarre. It was necessary to summon police assistance. Mrs A-K&#8217;s non appearance at the hearing on Monday was not surprising against the background of her diagnosis. In 2009, she was said to be suffering from a paranoid psychotic illness. She was described as extremely anxious, volatile and unpredictable.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The interplay between the laws of the UK and the USA in relation to adoption and also the USA&#8217;s immigration requirements have guided the local authority towards the route it now pursues. Because Mr and Mrs X retain English domicile, in theory they could apply to adopt IA utilising the English domestic framework. In November 2011, at a time when it was believed a domestic adoption would most efficaciously solve the legal complexities, I made a declaration as to the X&#8217;s domicile and therefore pronounced them eligible to apply to adopt pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/49" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.49</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref>.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, from a US perspective, neither route is viable. If IA were to be adopted under English domestic provisions, her adoptive parents would have had to live with her for two years in the UK before they would be eligible for a visa permitting her to enter and remain with them in the USA. There are practical reasons why they cannot pursue that option.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The alternative of a Convention Adoption order would not be available to the Xs if they were to apply in the USA because, as a matter of US policy, only US citizens are eligible to apply when America is the receiving State. Mr and Mrs X are not citizens though they do enjoy permanent leave to reside in the USA. They will not be eligible to apply for citizenship until about the middle of next year, 2014. The Hague adoption process could take between 6 and 9 months to complete.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_12">
	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The original plan, put forward as I understand it by the American authorities, was for IA to be placed in the USA and then adopted under American domestic law. However, a placement of that kind would have been in contravention of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/85" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.85</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref> (&#8220;Restriction on taking children out of the UK for adoption&#8221;) unless she had been removed under the auspices of s.84 (&#8220;Giving parental responsibility prior to adoption abroad&#8221;) which in the case of the USA would have to have been authorised under the Convention. In any event, because Mr and Mrs X retain their UK domicile, under s.84(2), they would not be eligible under UK law to apply for such an order</p>
	  </content>

	<paragraph eId="para_13">
	  <num>13.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Accordingly, the view was taken that the only way for the Xs to secure an adoption order would be under the Hague Convention. Any such application could not be made until such time as they become US citizens. Since they will not be eligible to apply for US citizenship until the middle of 2014, it is unlikely they will be in a position to apply to the US Central Authority for an assessment of their suitability to adopt IA under the Convention until early in 2015; and therefore the likelihood is that any Convention adoption proceedings would not be concluded before the end of that year.</p>

Regulation 11 deals with the &#8220;Placement decision&#8221; and the requirements of the responsible authority&#8217;s nominated officer. Regulation 12 is concerned with &#8220;Placements outside England and Wales&#8221;; and refers explicitly to arrangements to place children outside the jurisdiction in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 19 of Schedule 2 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>.
