	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">An application was made to me on the 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2003 by Mr Mostyn QC, on behalf of the wife to seek the ruling of the court as to the effect of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/29" uk:canonical="2002 c. 29" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Proceeds of Crime Act 2002</ref> (&#8220;POCA&#8221;) on his client&#8217;s application for ancillary relief in divorce proceedings. Counsel and solicitors acting for the wife sought urgent directions from the court in respect of their obligations under the POCA.  Exceptionally they did so without giving notice to the respondent (the husband), his solicitors or counsel.    The genesis of these extraordinary events is apparent from the history of the wife&#8217;s correspondence with the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) to which I shall refer later.   </p>

In January 2002, the wife filed her divorce petition.  This court has not been asked to make any findings as to the parties&#8217; assets, but it is suggested by the wife that they are substantial and may exceed &#163;19 million.  The wife made her application for financial relief, and a Financial Dispute Resolution appointment was listed for July 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> 2003 before a High Court judge.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The accountants&#8217; forensic reports were first made available in October 2002.  The husband&#8217;s accountant&#8217;s reply to the wife&#8217;s additional questions was supplied on the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd </span>May 2003. It was not until a conference was held with leading and junior counsel for the wife on the 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span>June that the wife&#8217;s legal advisers became sufficiently concerned about the husband&#8217;s financial position to consider that issues under Part 7 of the POCA might arise. In particular, her legal team was concerned about the possibility of committing an offence under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/29/section/328" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 328</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/29" uk:canonical="2002 c. 29" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. Based on the financial information they had seen and the advice of their forensic accountant, the wife and her legal team became suspicious that part of the matrimonial assets might be &#8220;criminal property&#8221; within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/29" uk:canonical="2002 c. 29" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.  The wife&#8217;s solicitors and counsel were worried that, in acting for the wife in the litigation and/or settlement of a financial dispute, <span class="hidden"/>they might fall foul of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/29/section/328" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 328</ref> prohibition and might become concerned in an arrangement which might facilitate &#8216;the acquisition, retention, use or control of criminal property&#8217; by the wife.  Accordingly, they sought to protect themselves and their client by invoking the protection offered by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/29/section/328/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 328(2)</ref>(a) and on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span>June 2003 the wife&#8217;s solicitors wrote to the NCIS making disclosure of the following information:</p>

Further, the letter sought advice as to whether in light of the &#8220;tipping off&#8221; rules, the letter could be disclosed to the husband&#8217;s solicitors. The NCIS did not respond in writing to that letter. A number of telephone calls were made by the wife&#8217;s solicitors to the duty officer at NCIS, whose advice (which NCIS now accepts was misleading) was that the decision to continue to act was purely a &#8220;business decision&#8221; for the solicitors.  The officer advised that a report was only required if money were actually about to change hands. He also thought, however, that if the money were not to pass through the solicitors&#8217; hands that a report might not be necessary at all. This advice was wrong.  Crucially, the NCIS officer also advised that the wife&#8217;s solicitors were not permitted to tell either the other side, or their own client, that the disclosure report had been made, as it would contravene the tipping off provisions and/or the prohibition against prejudicing an investigation.</p>

Further attempts to seek clarification from the NCIS proved unsuccessful.  Letters were sent on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June and 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July, but by 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July a response had not been received.  </p>

Mr Mostyn, on behalf of himself and the wife&#8217;s solicitors, submitted that they had been placed in an untenable position. It was impossible, he said, to reconcile the NCIS&#8217; instructions to them not to disclose the fact of the report, with their professional obligations to the court, his client, and the respondent.  He could not see how they could proceed with the Financial Dispute Resolution on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July whilst prevented from disclosing the full facts to either of the parties, the opposing solicitors or the court.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As it happened, on receipt of the order to vacate the FDR, the husband&#8217;s representatives obtained from the Mechanical Recording Department, as they were quite entitled to do in the absence of any specific order of the Court, a copy of the transcript of the 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July hearing and immediately made an urgent application before me on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July to attend the 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July hearing. I gave them permission to do so, on the condition that they were not to tell their client.  That order was of a type rarely made in this court, and whilst clearly necessary at the time in the extremely unusual circumstances of this case, I hope that it will seldom be necessary in the future.  In the result, the order endured for not more than 24 hours and I am satisfied that the temporary interference with the husband&#8217;s Article 6 rights of the ECHR was necessary and proportionate in all the circumstances.</p>

This arose from a misunderstanding of the questions asked. The solicitors were correct to bring the matter to the attention of the NCIS when they did. At that stage the NCIS should have advised the solicitor whether consent was appropriate and was wrong to have advised the solicitor that it was not an appropriate case to seek consent. The NCIS did later give advice as to consent by a letter of the 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July and consent was given so that the legal adviser would be able to conclude a financial settlement with disclosure made. It was not necessary, in order for there to be a disclosure, that funds actually passed through solicitors&#8217; client&#8217;s account. The test for the legal adviser would be whether s/he had become concerned in an arrangement.</p>

There is plainly room for an exception to this where the lawyer seeks the permission of the NCIS or makes application to the Court in the absence of agreement. No obligation to be full and frank about the affairs and circumstances of a person in private law proceedings can override the statutory waiting period which permits for inquiries and then investigation. There can be no matrimonial exception to this position.&#8221;</p>

But he questioned whether there would ever be any legitimate purpose for a solicitor to make such a disclosure.  To inform the client or the other side of the actual intention to disclose his suspicions would have the effect of warning the client and would be tantamount to becoming concerned in an arrangement, since if such a suspicion was well founded the client was bound to try and avoid detection.

In particular there was now, in general, no distinction between drug trafficking offences and other offences.  There were two significant changes made by the POCA which affected the role and duties of professionals. Firstly the definition of &#8216;criminal conduct&#8217; was far wider than before and secondly there was now a positive duty to report criminal conduct in cases involving no attempt to conceal or launder the proceeds of crime. </p>

The application of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/29/section/328" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 328</ref> to disclosures made before the &#8216;prohibited act&#8217; was causing practical difficulties but <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/29/section/328" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 328</ref> did apply to less specific activity and, in the view of the Law Society, it was necessary to make a request for consent in such cases to &#8216;becoming concerned in an arrangement&#8217;. </p>

The proposals put forward by NCIS in its position statement represented a sensible and practical way forward in cases similar to the present application. In other more complicated cases, particularly those in which the solicitor may have to make an authorised disclosure to NCIS about his own client, the position of the solicitor was more uncertain and placed solicitors in the impossible position of withholding material matters from their clients. There was urgent need for guidance about circumstances where a solicitor could tell a client or third party about an authorised disclosure of which the client&#8217;s activities were the subject.</span></p>

The Bar Council had issued guidance to barristers in respect of money laundering. In a written submission it pointed out that the inclusion of suspicion in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/29/section/342/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 342(1)</ref> broadened the scope of the offence and might include those representing clients.  The suggestion in the NCIS written submission that &#8216;the solicitor should not tell the other side that a report has been made unless not to do so would breach an obligation to make disclosure in the context of the particular financial settlement proceedings&#8217; was not realistic in the context of family law. All ancillary relief cases required full and frank disclosure. If there was anything relevant in the report to the NCIS it might well affect the value of the assets. It followed therefore that, when a report was made, the other side and the clients on both sides would have to be informed.  One particular problem might arise on disclosures made at the door of the court. </p>

There is nothing in that section to prevent a solicitor or barrister from taking instructions from a client.

In accordance with this duty of full and frank disclosure in financial disputes between spouses, details of the size and description of family assets and actual or potential debts are crucial to the attempts of the legal advisers to settle these cases and to the FDR process, see <span style="font-style:italic">Family Proceedings Rules 1991 </span>(as amended) rule 2.61A-E. If financial irregularities are discovered and investigated, it may diminish the value of the assets, the subject of the ancillary relief proceedings.  The purpose of the FDR would be frustrated if the judge or district judge did not have the true facts and the parties were unable to negotiate a genuine settlement in the absence of the requisite knowledge as to the true value of the assets. In general terms the professional duties in family proceedings do, in my view, appear to attract the protection of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/29/section/333/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 333(3)</ref> and 342(4) in order to permit a legal adviser to inform, for instance, the other side that a disclosure either will be, or has been, made to the NCIS.</p>

In  <span style="font-style:italic">Francis</span> the court was concerned with the attachment, and loss, of legal professional privilege to items held on a client&#8217;s behalf.

However, the present case does not appear to me to be analogous.  This case raises the issue of the right of a solicitor to make a disclosure to a client, or another, such as an opponent.

A central element of advising and representing a client must be, in my view, the duty to keep one&#8217;s client informed and not to withhold information from him/her.

If, as the NCIS suggests, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/29/section/333/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 333(4)</ref> and 342(5) bite every time a party who is suspected of holding a criminal purpose is given notice that a disclosure has been or will be made to the NCIS (ie, is &#8216;tipped off&#8217;), then the legal professional exemptions in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/29/section/333/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 333(3)</ref> and 342(4) would be rendered meaningless.  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/29/section/333/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Sections 333(4)</ref> and 342(5) must have some purpose and the interpretation suggested by the NCIS cannot in my view be correct.  The exemption is lost if a disclosure to a client is made &#8220;with the intention of furthering a criminal purpose&#8221;.  The natural meaning of those words would seem to be clear.  The approach which the House of Lords took to the construction of the word &#8220;held&#8221; in <span style="font-style:italic">Francis</span> should not be transposed into this context in relation to the word &#8220;made&#8221;, nor would it be necessary or proper to attempt to do so.  Whereas the purpose of holding documents can be tainted by the intention of any number of people (including client and third parties), the intention of a legal adviser in choosing to make a disclosure  would seem to belong to the adviser alone.  The context and purpose of this particular section of the POCA is distinguishable from that in <span style="font-style:italic">Francis</span>, not least because the POCA has specifically underlined the duty of disclosure by legal advisers.</p>

In dealing with a submission that the solicitors could not consult their client about the appeal for fear of breaching the equivalent tipping off provisions, Lord Griffiths said (at 386):</p>

In such a case the legal professional exemption would, of course, be lost.  I cannot, as I understood Mr Mostyn to suggest, give a blanket guarantee to all family practitioners that they will never lose the protection of the exemption.  But unless the requisite improper intention is there, the solicitor should be free to communicate such information to his/her client or opponent as is necessary and appropriate in connection with the giving of legal advice or acting in connection with actual or contemplated legal proceedings.</p>

In most cases I cannot see why a delay of, at most, seven working days before informing a client would generally cause particular difficulty to the solicitor&#8217;s obligations to his client or his opponent.  Where appropriate consent is refused and a 31 day moratorium is imposed, best practice would suggest that the legal adviser and the NCIS (or other relevant investigating body) try to agree on the degree of information which can be disclosed during the moratorium period without harming the investigation.  In the absence of agreement, or in other urgent circumstances where even a short delay in disclosure would be unacceptable (such as where a hearing or FDR is imminent, or orders for discovery require immediate compliance) the guidance of the court may be sought. </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">The Bank of Scotland v A Ltd </span>the Court of Appeal suggested a similar procedure whereby the bank in that case could have made an application to the court naming the Serious Fraud Office as respondent. The application could be held in private and there would be no question of serving the customer since he would not be a party.  The procedures suggested by the Court of Appeal in those two cases might usefully be adapted to the family financial proceedings where a disclosure has been made.  Since the purpose of such an application is to protect the legal advisers and, in some cases, the client, I cannot see how one can impose an obligation on the NCIS to be the applicant (although the NCIS would however also be entitled to approach the court if it wished to do so). In my view, it would be appropriate for the legal advisers to make the application without notice to the other side, making the NCIS the respondent to the application. It would be an application however within the ambit of the existing court proceedings and I do not see any difficulty at the moment in the court making any appropriate order, including, if in the High Court, declarations. In the present case I granted declarations since the situation was entirely new and I did so to clarify the situation. It would not seem to me to be necessary for the court generally to grant declarations, but rather to deal with the practical consequences of the authorised disclosure to the NCIS.  The application would of course be heard in private and the court should direct that any mechanical recording of the proceedings should not be disclosed or transcribed without the leave of the judge.   </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the circumstances of this case, the wife&#8217;s legal advisers were clearly right to make an authorised disclosure to NCIS. It was also entirely proper for the wife&#8217;s legal team to approach the court for guidance.  The coming into force of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1988/33" uk:canonical="1988 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">this Act</ref> in February has caused immense confusion and disruption in family proceedings, and no criticism should be made of the wife&#8217;s representatives for seeking clarification of their statutory obligations, particularly in the light of the approach of the NCIS to the disclosure made by them. In fact, since there was no reply by the end of the 7 day period, the wife&#8217;s legal advisers were free to continue to deal freely with the other side and to inform the other side that a disclosure had been made to NCIS. They would not have been exposed to the risk of prosecution for tipping off or prejudicing an investigation, as I have found, contrary to the submissions on behalf of the NCIS.  But they could not have reasonably known this at the time.  This position was reinforced by the consent given in the NCIS letter of the 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July. The wife&#8217;s solicitors were not however certain from the NCIS letter that they had that right. Mr Mitchell and Mr Tidbury told me that neither the NCIS nor the Inland Revenue had any objection to the husband being informed of the fact that the disclosure report had been made.  Accordingly, I ordered that my previous order of 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July preventing the husband&#8217;s legal team from making the disclosure to their client should be set aside. I also granted the declarations sought by the wife&#8217;s representatives, that:</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The NCIS would wish the legal profession to note that subject to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/29/section/333/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.333(4)</ref>, under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/29/section/333/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.333(3)</ref> POCA there is no restriction on the legal advisor informing any person of the fact that they have made a report to the NCIS if such a disclosure is to a client or his representative in connection with the giving of legal advice to the client or the disclosure is made in connection with legal proceedings or contemplated legal proceedings. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Where the legal advisor has made a disclosure to the NCIS, the NCIS would prefer as a matter of practise the legal advisor not to make any reference to that fact during the seven days following the disclosure or during the period of 31 days following a refusal to consent to an arrangement, unless not to do so would be in breach of a disclosure obligation imposed by the particular proceedings.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In the event that the legal advisor considers that a requirement of the legal proceedings is to require disclosure of the fact of the disclosure to the NCIS, but there has been no consent from NCIS within seven days or the period is still running then the legal advisor should firstly inform the NCIS and try to seek agreement on the way ahead. In the absence of such agreement the legal advisor should consider making a without notice application to the Court for directions giving the NCIS an opportunity to make representations. (See <span style="font-style:italic">C v S and others (Money Laundering: Discovery of Documents)</span> [1999] 1 WLR 1551 and <span style="font-style:italic">Bank of Scotland v. A Limited</span> [2001] 1 WLR 752).</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Where the client of the legal advisor has joined in the disclosure that has been made the client would, from the point in time when a disclosure is made to the NCIS, not be regarded as having committed an offence under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/29/section/327" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.327</ref>-329. Where a legal advisor makes a disclosure without the knowledge of their client then plainly and necessarily such protection for the client would not apply.</p>
