On that occasion HHJ Jacklin KC heard a part 25 application made on behalf of the Respondent. The application was to instruct Dr Hessel Willemsen to undertake a global psychological assessment of A and his parents. HHJ Jacklin KC granted the father&#8217;s application and directed that Dr Willemsen&#8217;s report should be filed by 3 November 2023. The Appellant, who was a litigant in person at that time, did not appeal that direction. However, by a C2 application dated 27 September 2023 the Appellant applied for an &#8220;urgent hearing, this week&#8221; to discharge or vary the direction made on 9 August 2023 permitting the instruction of a psychologist and seeking a finding of fact hearing. She did not raise any objection to the psychologist based on his sex. The Appellant&#8217;s application were listed to be heard on 4 December 2023, after the date by which Dr Willemsen was to report. Accordingly, by C100 application issued on 12 October 2023 the Appellant applied for an &#8220;urgent same day hearing or without notice order&#8221; to prohibit the child being taken to see the psychologist, Dr Willemsen, pending determination of her C2 application above. On 16 October 2023, she filed a second C1A containing allegations dating from 2019 to October 2023.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Respondent says that there has been protracted litigation between the parties about A over many years. In summary, it is said on his behalf that the Appellant has taken unilateral action on occasion which has disrupted contact. The current arrangements which have been in place since August 2023 were agreed between the parties but only after the father had commenced proceedings because the mother had yet again stopped contact. On behalf of the Respondent, it is said before me that within the current proceedings the Appellant&#8217;s case at first instance has been &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">evolutionary</span>&#8221;<span style="font-style:italic"/>and that the same can be said of the Appellant&#8217;s argument on appeal.  It is common ground between the parties that the Appellant first raised objection to being assessed by Dr Willemsen on the basis that she is a victim of male violence and the psychologist instructed was a man whilst making oral submissions before Recorder Searle.  After the learned Recorder had given judgment, I am told that the Appellant then told the court of significant further male sexual, physical, and emotional abuse that she had sustained at the hands of a third-party males (not the Respondent) during her lifetime. Those abusive experiences include, the Appellant tells the court, sexual abuse by a consultant paediatrician when she was a teenager. The Appellant&#8217;s case is that the level of detail she felt compelled to give to justify not wishing to be seen by a male psychologist caused her such distress that she was not able to put her case forward as she wished. This was, it is said, compounded by the failure of the Recorder to implement any participation directions in accordance with the rules. </p>

The Appellant has no objection to undergoing the assessment as ordered by HHJ Jacklin KC but argues that given this is to be a single joint instruction then the assessor appointed by the court should be female. Otherwise given her history, she is unlikely to be able to participate fully and give her best evidence when being assessed.</p>

Accordingly, it is substantially out of time, and it is argued on behalf of the Respondent that I should not extend the time for bringing any appeal. It is said that I should read the facility to extend the time for appealing in the context of the overall need to avoid delay. Allowing the Appellant to appeal the order of Recorder Searle which upholds the directions of HHJ Jacklin KC allows the Appellant to circumvent the rules applying to appeals and render the provision for time limits nugatory.

The relevant context in this case is that Recorder Searle ought to have known that the Appellant was raising allegations of domestic abuse against the Respondent because they were the evidential foundation of the application for a non-molestation order before the court.

The Appellant&#8217;s reason for objecting to an assessment by a male psychologist was her experience of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse by third party males. She says that on the remote link she was inhibited from revealing that abuse by the lack of protective measures in place; in particular by being able to see the Respondent.

Further, I take into account the reality of dealing with case management issues at first instance and that it is &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">vital for the Court of Appeal to uphold robust, fair case management decisions made by first instance judges</span>&#8221;<span style="font-style:italic">. </span>However, having studied the transcript of Recorder Searle&#8217;s extempore judgment and the recitals on the order he approved, I consider that his engagement with the Appellant&#8217;s argument based on the sex of the psychologist was, at best, superficial. In particular, it failed to weigh in the balance that the Appellant would not be able to participate in an assessment by a man by reason of the past trauma she had suffered which included past abuse by a male medical professional. Consequently, I consider that his decision-making on the issue was wrong.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">However, I do not consider that the modified Ground 3 of appeal is made out. Recorder Searle dealt with the issue of a fact-finding hearing at paragraphs 9- 11 of his judgment. Therein he identified the correct legal test and applied it to the facts as they were presented to him. He did not mention PD 12J specifically but the manner in which he reached his decision and the fact that he recorded it on the face of his order in accordance with paragraph 18 of PD 12J indicates to me that he had it well in mind when he made his decision. Thus, having read his judgment and reasons carefully and taking into account the exigencies of daily court life - that this was a case management decision and that the judgment was truly ex tempore - I consider that Recorder Searle cannot be said to have been wrong when he refused to direct a fact-finding hearing. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Having decided that the appeal should be allowed on Grounds 1 and 2 alone, I now consider what should follow. I am conscious that this appeal process has been protracted and that any delay is contrary to the welfare of the child. I am aware that the case at first instance is now listed on first available date after 8 July 2024 with a time estimate of 3 days. The parties have permission to apply for directions on receipt of this judgment. That court is likely to have up to date evidence in relation to the welfare of A and what has happened in his life since October 2023. That court will be better placed to determine the timescale of the assessment and its interaction with the timescales for the child and that of the court.  Indeed, it may well be that the psychological assessment which was considered to be necessary and proportionate in August 2023, is no longer needed at all. Accordingly, I remit the issue of whether or not the assessment direction should be varied or discharged to the court at first instance to be considered afresh. It will be for the judge hearing that issue to exercise their discretion which I do not fetter. That said, I conclude this judgment by reminding myself and the reader of what Lady Justice King stated in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re N (A Child)</span> above<span style="font-weight:bold"/>at paragraph 63, namely:</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On the facts of this case, I consider that the Appellant has put forward good reason why a female psychologist should be used. Again, on the facts of this case, I consider that the best possible assessment evidence will be obtained by appointing a female psychologist to undertake the assessment.  Thus, the Article 6 rights of both parties will be observed. In particular, the Appellant, who is a victim of third-party male violence, will have the best opportunity to participate in the assessment process and give of her best during the assessment. The appointment of a female psychologist is most likely to engage this Appellant in the assessment process. It would also limit the opportunity for any further objection to the assessment and thus any further delay.</p>
