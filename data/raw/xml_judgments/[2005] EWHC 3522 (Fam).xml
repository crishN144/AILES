Some are shown defiantly using their mobile telephones either to talk or to send text messages while the teacher is trying to teach, others are shown fighting each other, others are shown running around the classroom jumping from desk to desk, and some are shown adopting not merely an utterly defiant but also a grossly insubordinate and offensive attitude towards their teacher. One scene shows a boy who would appear to be something of the age of 14 or 15 telling the teacher who is trying to control the class to "Fuck off." Other scenes show pupils simply leaving the classroom when they choose or arriving late for classes. </span></p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.32in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">That is one of the major themes which runs throughout the film. A second significant theme which applies to the first of the four schools which is featured, one of the schools in Leeds, shows what on the face of it appears to be the deliberate misrepresentation of the school, with the complicity of the senior staff, on the occasion of an OFSTED inspection; the picture of the school deliberately being presented on that occasion by the staff intentionally creating, so it is said, an entirely false impression of the reality of life in the school. For example, it is said that the kind of teaching materials which ought to be available and otherwise never were, had been made available for the teachers on the occasion of the inspection. For example, it is said that the worst offenders in the school were deliberately removed from the school and sent on extracurricular activities while the inspection was going forward, again so as to create a reassuring but, so the thesis of the film would have it, utterly misleading picture of the school.</span></p>

Nonetheless, I have to say that I was surprised when I viewed the film, having, albeit fairly briefly, previously been told what the film was about and what it showed. I have to say that nothing prepared me for what I actually saw on the screen. Using the word in its proper sense, there are many things which appeared that were, on the face of it, shocking. The overall impression I had was that in the three schools which were particularly the focus of critical filming a very significant proportion of the pupils, through their own misbehaviour, are not being properly educated, with the consequence, and this was another of the themes which emerged from the film, that those pupils who want to learn and want to be educated are being denied a proper education because of the uncontrolled misbehaviour of those who do not want to learn.</span></p>

That said, I can only express the view, having watched the film, and at the same time read the script setting out the commentary which has not yet been attached as a soundtrack to the film, that it seemed to me to be a serious piece of documentary film-making, intending to serve, and as it seemed to me in fact serving, important public interests. If conditions in those schools, never mind other schools, really are as bad as they seem to be, then it might be thought that the picture displayed is one which should be of the very greatest concern, not merely to the local education authorities who are responsible for the schools, not merely to the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, not merely to OFSTED, who it appears are being bamboozled by at least some schools, but also to parents. Not just the parents of those children who, by reason of their disruptive behaviour, are not being educated, but also those parents whose children because of the disruptive behaviour of other children are not receiving the education they want and which they are entitled to.</span></p>

In the event Leeds City Council has not pursued any application before me for relief, being content to accept and to rely upon certain undertakings given by Channel 4 (given, I emphasise, in correspondence, not formally given to the Court) which means that its concerns are, in significant part, allayed. In particular, all the children shown in the film, not just those for whom Leeds has responsibility but also those for whom Islington has responsibility, are shown with their faces obscured. As I understand it, the proposal is that the degree of obscuration should be somewhat extended from what appeared on the version of the film I saw, so that not only the face but also the hair and the neck of each of the children are obscured. The purpose of that, obviously, is to reduce the risk that children shown in the film may be identified.</span></p>

When the matter was first put before me this morning two different classes of children were identified as possibly requiring protection. The first were children in relation to whom there were particular concerns as to the risk they might be exposed to if their identities were to be disclosed, even to those &#8216;in the know&#8217;. For example, there was concern that some children whose present whereabouts are not known by disaffected members of their families might be identified and might, therefore, be exposed to risk of attack or other harm in a direct and worrying fashion. The second group of children were those in respect of whom there were no specific identified concerns of that sort, but who took their stance essentially on the proposition that they had been filmed surreptitiously, in breach of obligations of confidence enforceable at common-law or in equity, in breach of rights of privacy protected by Article 8 of the Convention, and moreover in circumstances where it was said that, notwithstanding the recent decision of the House of Lords in </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman'">In re S (A Child) (Identification: Restrictions on Publication)</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2004/47" uk:canonical="[2004] UKHL 47" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] UKHL 47</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 AC 593" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 AC 593</ref>, there was a cause of action under the inherent jurisdiction of the Family Division.</span></p>

They are both boys, they are both in the same year at the school and they were born within days of each other in September 1989. They are therefore between 15 and 16 years old. Mr. Hudson expressly disavowed any claim on behalf of either A or B which might bring them into the first of the two classes of children I have mentioned. The claim, therefore, has proceeded on the basis of the more general complaint, based upon breach of confidence, breach of privacy and, if need be, the inherent jurisdiction.</span></p>

No doubt in its more recent extension into what for shorthand I will call the commercial context, the law of confidence focuses upon the confidential nature of the particular information in question, but there are many relationships or settings which have traditionally been accepted as giving rise to a duty of confidence irrespective of the particular nature of the information in issue; such obvious examples as the doctor/patient, the lawyer/client and the banker/customer relationship come readily to mind. The class of cases in which a claim in confidence can arise on that jurisprudential basis is not, I believe, closed. It seems to me highly arguable that the relationship of parent or pupil and school is such as in principle not merely engages Article 8 (as it undoubtedly does), but also in principle gives rise to enforceable duties of confidentiality. Of course, if a schoolchild goes to a school sports day or takes part in the Christmas nativity play or some other similar production it is probably the anticipation of both the pupil and the parent that the event may be filmed. It is not, however, I should have thought the normal expectation or assumption of either a pupil or a parent that the ordinary school day will be surreptitiously filmed by an organ of the media.

There are, of course, in the present case a number of rights which are engaged. Mr. Hudson, understandably, focus upon the Article 8 rights of his two client children, Mr. Nicklin, understandably, focuses primarily upon the Article 10 rights of Channel 4, both its right to receive information and its right to impart information to others. But equally, as Mr. Nicklin correctly points out, there have to be taken into account the Article 8 rights of the other children, for example those who wish to be educated but whose education is being frustrated. And one also has to have regard to the Article 10 rights, in particular the Article 10 right to receive information, not merely of the public generally but also of parents of children in these schools who, as Mr. Nicklin says, have a right to know what is going on in the schools, and no doubt also, by parity of reasoning, the right of rightly concerned citizens, council tax payers and members of local authorities, councils and committees, to be informed of what is going on in the schools for which, in one sense, they have responsibility.</span></p>

It seems to me, as I have said, that children when they go to school have a reasonable expectation that they will not be filmed surreptitiously. And if they are shown in an embarrassing, humiliating way, or in a way which will call down opprobrium on their heads if they are shown misbehaving themselves, then those are important rights and interests protected by Article 8. And this is so, I emphasise, even if, because of the obscuring of their identities, the children in question are going to be identified only by those who are close to them, either within their families or amongst their immediate friends and neighbours, and therefore will not be exposed to public opprobrium or humiliation.</span></p>

When I say &#8220;the facts&#8221; I am referring in particular to the very clear impression I was left with having watched the film, that in relation to a number of matters (the most important but not all of which I identified at the beginning of this judgment) the film raises issues not merely of very considerable public interest but which ought to be of great concern to the public, represented for this purpose by the Secretary of State for Education and Skills and OFSTED, great concern to that more narrow section of the public being the public authorities who are responsible for the particular schools, and legitimate, and it might be thought considerable, concern to that section of the public represented by parents of children in what are often referred to as sink comprehensives and in particular, of course, the parents of the children in these particular schools.

My attention has been directed in particular to rules 8.1, 8.13, 8.20 and 8.21 of the Code. Summarising the matter shortly, these indicate that surreptitious filming is acceptable only where it is "warranted", and moreover that it will only be &#8220;warranted&#8221; in that sense if a number of conditions set out in rule 8.13 are met, including a requirement that there are reasonable grounds to suspect further material can be obtained by surreptitious filming, and most important of all that "It is necessary to the credibility and authenticity of the program" that there be surreptitious filming. In other words, surreptitious filming is permissible in principle if, but only if, a legitimate story which is in the public interest &#8211; a requirement also spelled out in rule 8.13 &#8211; can be achieved only by means of surreptitious rather than open filming. Rule 8.20 directs broadcasters &#8220;To pay particular attention to the privacy of people under 16.&#8221; Rule 8.2 specifically directs that where a program features an individual under the age of 16 in a way that infringes privacy, consent "must" be obtained from a parent, guardian or other person in loco parentis, and if possible the individual concerned, and this is the important qualification, "Unless the subject matter... is warranted to proceed without consent."</span></p>

This is an important factor which has to be fed into the Article 8 scale, because in so far as Article 8 protects privacy, the privacy is not merely privacy as against the world at large it is also privacy as against particular sections of the world. </span></p>

That, as it seems to me, is to adopt an unduly optimistic view of the consequences which would be achieved if, without general publicity, there is a merely private disclosure to those directly concerned with what the film shows. Also, and perhaps more fundamentally, it seems to me to attach wholly insignificant weight to the importance in a democracy, as has been repeatedly pointed out both by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and by the highest tribunal in our Country, of an investigative press which in the public interest exposes wrongdoing or incompetence by those public agencies who serve the citizen.</span></p>

That seems to me to be the label which appropriately describes what is sought to be achieved in the present case by Channel 4. To repeat, the film is about what are alleged to be very serious shortcomings in the state school sector. Whether those failings are properly to be attributed to central government, to OFSTED, to the local authorities or to the teachers is a matter no doubt of debate, and it may be controversy, but it does not particularly matter for present purposes. What is the dismal comfort to a parent of knowing that the responsibility for the fact that her child has not been properly taught lies with inadequate teachers, rather than inadequate councillors, or perhaps lies with an inadequate inspectorate, rather than any failings on the part of the local authority? The fact is that this is a film about the public sector, about the state school system. Incompetence is a word which can only be said to be inapt insofar as it might be thought to be a word which is hardly adequate to describe what is actually shown in the film.</span></p>

The reality, I suspect, is that if the consent of either the children or their parents or the local authority had been sought consent would have been refused and the project would have been strangled at birth. Be that as it may, it seems to me that what has been done in the present case by Channel 4 falls within what is legitimate and permitted by the OFCOM Broadcasting Code. More precisely and more relevantly, insofar as this is part of his case, Mr. Hudson has wholly failed to persuade me that anything which has been done by Channel 4 falls foul of the Code.

	    <p class="Level1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.32in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">There is one more matter I should mention. Mr. Hudson submitted as an important factor in the application of the balancing exercise that I should have regard to what as he would have it would be the minimal impact on the film if all that I did was to injunct the showing of images of his two clients. His primary submission was that for all the reasons he gave and which I have tried to deal with the film should be injuncted in so far as it shows any children, whether his clients or other children. He submitted that a film which involved, as it were, an interview with the undercover reporter describing what she had witnessed, and including, as the film I have seen does include, interviews with other people, would meet the public interest and that for the film to go beyond that and to show the children was disproportionate, and therefore unwarranted.</span></p>

That, of course, as will be appreciated, would probably affect only one part of the film, since both his clients are at one of the schools and the film, as I have said, deals extensively with a total of four schools.</span></p>

Mr. Hudson says of course that he is concerned only with his two children, that there is no application on behalf of any other child, and that it would therefore be perfectly appropriate for me to limit the injunction in that way, and in circumstances where, so he says, that would not significantly, if at all, affect the overall integrity of the film.</span></p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.32in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Amongst the difficulties with that submission is this: in truth, since Mr. Hudson explicitly disavowed any claim based upon particular damage to a child because of that child's particular circumstances, his arguments if good in relation to A and B must equally be good in relation to all the children who are the subject of the film. His case was not based upon specific problems in relation to either A or B. It was based upon the Convention rights of all the children, of whom A and B are merely examples. It seems to me wrong in principle, if that is the reality, to restrain the broadcasting of a film showing A and B but not the others, not X, Y and Z as it were, merely because A and B have commenced proceedings and X, Y and Z have not, in circumstances where had X, Y and Z also commenced proceedings they would, on Mr. Hudson's argument, have been entitled to the same relief. Moreover, there is a further practical point. If the principle once be established, as Mr. Hudson would have me accept, that any child can obtain an injunction preventing the broadcasting of that child, what will there be to prevent X, Y, Z, D, E, F and G from making application tomorrow morning saying, in effect, well if the court has accepted that A and B are entitled to prevent their images being broadcast, then the same must go for any other claimant who - I do not put this pejoratively &#8211; seeks to climb on the bandwagon.</span></p>

I, accordingly, refuse to grant injunctive relief in any of the forms sought by Mr. Hudson.</span></p>

As I have already said I was invited by Mr. Nicklin, without objection from Mr. Hudson, to view the film myself. Mr. Hudson has not, in fact, seen the film, partly because until the film was brought to court today Channel 4 was not willing for him or his clients to see the film, and partly because once it had been accepted that I should myself see the film (in circumstances where normally that very fact would entitle Mr. Hudson as of right to see the film) the limited time available was such as to make it difficult to accommodate any wish Mr. Hudson might have had to view a film which in all lasts about 50 minutes. Had Mr. Hudson wished to see the film then I would unhesitatingly have either refused to watch the film myself without him having an opportunity of doing so, or if he had wished to do so I would of course have allowed him and his solicitor time to view the film. I only place these events on record, as also the fact that Mr. Hudson was content to proceed without himself watching the film notwithstanding that in the course of his submissions I described to him some of what I had seen on the film and gave a fairly clear indication of the impact the film had had upon me, in particular an indication of the provisional view I had formed about its potential public interest. </span></p>
