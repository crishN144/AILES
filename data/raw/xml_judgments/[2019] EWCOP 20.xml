However, the parties identified a dispute in respect of the costs of the January hearing. The parties submitted draft directions to resolve the dispute on costs in respect of the January hearing which proposed a mechanism for the dispute to be decided on the basis of written submissions. The order I made on of 24 April 2019 adopted that mechanism, but also listed the matter for hearing on 14 June in the event that oral submissions were necessary. Oral submission are not necessary and the hearing of 14 June 2019 is retained for the formal handing down of this judgment.  The parties may be excused from attendance at that hearing if an order is agreed and they notify the court in writing that they both request to be excused by 4pm 10 June 2019. </p>

Various reports explored the impact of alcohol intake and challenging behaviour, including verbal and physical aggression to carers and family, BP&#8217;s family including his wife.  BP had received care at home up until October 2016. He was placed in the Care Home on 3 May 2017. S21A proceedings were issued on 8 November 2017.

The Applicant&#8217;s submissions referred to documents in the hearing bundle by page number, further copies of which were supplied following the court&#8217;s request. The Respondent says these should be disregarded. They have not been. I find it wholly artificial to consider submissions based on documents which the court has already had before it and then to disregard the copies of those document supplied on request. It is not clear whether the court disposed of bundles which should have been retained. It is in furtherance of the overriding objective at Rule 1.2 (3) (a) and (d) to consider the documents provided.  </p>

Parties should be free to bring personal welfare issues to the Court of Protection without fear of a costs sanction. Local authorities and others who carry out their work professionally have no reason to fear that a costs order will be made. The submission that local authorities will be discouraged from making applications to the Court of Protection if a costs order is made in this case is a thoroughly bad argument. The opposite is, in fact, the truth. It is only local authorities who break the law, or who are guilty of misconduct that falls within the meaning of [Rule 19.5], that have reason to fear a costs order. Local authorities who do their job properly and abide by the law have nothing to fear. In particular, the Court of Protection recognises that professional work in this very difficult field often involves very difficult judgments and decisions. The Court is not going to impose a costs burden on a local authority simply because hindsight demonstrates that it got those judgments wrong. </p>

The Respondent&#8217;s offer of a trial at home at the January hearing meant that the January hearing was not effective as a final hearing. The Respondent cannot rely on this to submit, as it may appear to at paragraphs 14 and 15 of its submissions that this is a factor to consider under Rule 19.5 (1) (b). To do so would be contrary to the Respondent&#8217;s submission that it &#8216;proposed a short trial to further its understanding of what was in BP&#8217;s best interests&#8217;. It would also be contrary to the Official Solicitor&#8217;s submission, which I accept, that the trial home enabled the parties to propose an order in respect of the substantive S21A challenge. There is also an element of the Respondent wanting it both ways, that it always supported a trial at home and that the failure of the trial at home supported its position that a move back home was never a viable option. Finally, the conduct of the parties should only be considered prospectively and cannot be considered retrospectively with the benefit of hindsight. </p>
