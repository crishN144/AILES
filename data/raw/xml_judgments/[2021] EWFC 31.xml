The mother was received into care and after one failed attempt at rehabilitation, she (together with her brother) was made the subject of a placement order and adopted by Mr M and Ms N when she was six years old (in 2008).  Mr M and Ms N are, and have been since that time, her parents &#8211; legally, psychologically, and emotionally.  </p>

The difficulties in the placement intensified when the mother reached out to her birth mother on social media, and they exchanged messages; Mr M and Ms N indicated that they &#8220;did not know how to deal with this&#8221;.  In or about November 2017, the adoptive placement finally broke down, and the mother was accommodated in foster care under <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 20</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> </span>(&#8216;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>&#8217;).  The mother unsurprisingly experienced strong feelings of isolation, and depression at that point, and she made further and renewed efforts to contact birth family.  In 2019, the mother visited her birth family, over several weekends, and on one occasion it is said that she stayed for approximately one month.  She met members of her birth family of whom she had had no prior connection or knowledge.  It was during one of these visits that the mother discovered that she was pregnant (she herself was 17 at the time; this was an unplanned pregnancy), and reports that &#8220;the response to me discovering I was pregnant &#8230; was extremely negative.  I was not supported at all&#8221;.   </p>

During this visit, F fell out of her pram and sustained a fractured skull, which resulted in her being admitted to hospital. Neither the mother nor members of her birth family sought immediate medical attention; indeed, it was only through the actions of a nearby shopkeeper who had observed the incident on CCTV that the emergency services were notified. A <span style="font-style:italic">section 47</span> investigation was initiated, and a Child Protection Case Conference held in respect of F, where it was agreed she would be made subject to a Child Protection Plan under the category of neglect.   Significantly, the professionals involved in the mother&#8217;s life at that time advised the mother not to visit her birth family again; the mother commented on this: </p>

She further contends that no obligation falls on the Local Authority to assess the birth family in this case, and indeed that given the mother&#8217;s opposition to this course, it would be counter-productive for it to do so.  In this, she aligns herself with the position taken, and the arguments advanced, by Ms Anning on behalf of the mother.  She makes the additional point that one of the key philosophies which underpins a family placement for a child who cannot be cared by his/her parents is to ensure the continuity for the child of blood ties within established networks, where a parent may be able to continue to play a normal/natural role; this, she submits, would not truly be available here for although blood ties would be restored/preserved, the current difficult and tenuous emotional ties between the mother and her birth family, and the absence of legal relationship which was of course dissolved by the adoption many years ago, would make any placement very problematic indeed. </p>

In that respect, their status (if any) in relation to F is materially different from the status of the extended or wider family as discussed in the caselaw referred to above, namely <span style="font-style:italic">Re A, B, C</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re H</span>.   Furthermore, the birth family&#8217;s limited experience of F during a short visit in March 2020 (which culminated in a <span style="font-style:italic">section 47</span> investigation as a result of the serious injury to F) falls a long way short of supporting any finding that they had acquired <span style="font-style:italic">Article 8</span> rights to a family life with F.

In that regard, I have assessed what the mother says about her birth family and have done so objectively and critically.  In this context, I have been able to undertake the necessary &#8216;analysis&#8217; of their potential as &#8216;realistic options&#8217; as long-term carers of F at this stage, without undertaking or commissioning a fully-fledged &#8216;assessment&#8217; (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re JL &amp; AO</span> at &#167;92(2)).   On the evidence presented, there are at least four clear pointers steering away from the birth family as a <span style="font-style:italic">realistic</span> option to care for F: (a) the fact of the mother&#8217;s adoption 14 years ago following her upbringing characterised by turbulence and significant neglect (see [6] above); (b) the events surrounding the injury to F in March 2020, and their failure to report the same (see [9] above); (c) the accepted fact that the mother and her birth mother have a difficult relationship (see [12] above), and (d) the current view of the professionals that the mother should avoid contact with her family (see [9] above). </p>

In this case, I am further satisfied that involving the birth family in assessment would be likely to have a deleterious effect on the mother&#8217;s fragile mental health, at a critical time when she herself is being assessed in the community as a long-term carer for her daughter.  It would also, I am satisfied, cause unwelcome and avoidable division in the relationship between the mother and her parents (Mr M and Ms N). </p>
