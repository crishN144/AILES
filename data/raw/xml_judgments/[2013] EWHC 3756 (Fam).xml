Both parties originate from Saudi Arabia.  There is a dispute as to whether they were primarily based in England or Saudi Arabia thereafter.  In the summer of 2001 W commenced nullity proceedings in London, where she and the parties&#8217; three sons were staying or living at the family&#8217;s London base (owned by a company).  Within the nullity proceedings she applied for financial provision.  In the nullity proceedings H challenged jurisdiction on the basis that W was not habitually resident here.  He also applied for orders for the return of the children to Saudi Arabia pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Without hearing evidence, but on the basis of submissions and the documentary evidence, the Deputy Judge recorded in his judgment and in paragraph 3 of the consequent order three instances of breach: failure to index link, failure to pay for the requisite number of W&#8217;s staff, and failure to maintain and keep the Jeddah property in good repair.  He found that these breaches were substantial and not illusory.  Although he recorded that there had been a dispute and much conflicting evidence between the parties about the extent of the maintenance and rebuilding works required to the Jeddah property, he did not deal with the totality of W&#8217;s assertions as to the alleged multifarious breaches over a lengthy period of time, nor with  H&#8217;s case as to frustration of his proposals to carry out repair works due to a dispute as to whether what W wanted was in fact a substantial extension, improvement and upgrade of the property. Nor did he deal with H&#8217;s case that the order provided that he pay for W&#8217;s existing staff as at 2012 and not the number employed by W as at the date of Kirkwood J&#8217;s order.  He said that H&#8217;s case as to set&#8211;off did not affect the question of whether there had been breach.  The Deputy Judge ruled against H&#8217;s case set out in the papers that W was in breach of contact orders and other children orders which formed part of the overall bargain.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">H appealed, raising five points.  The Court of Appeal found that it was only necessary to rule on the fundamental point of jurisdiction.  This is clear from both the judgment and also an exchange between Mr Turner and Thorpe LJ.  The remaining grounds of appeal were that (i) W had not been habitually resident in England on the relevant date, contrary to the Deputy Judge&#8217;s finding (ii) the marriage had not been terminated by 13 February 2002, the date when leave had purportedly been given to apply under Part III (iii) the Deputy Judge had not been entitled to find that H had had an interest in a dwelling-house in England and Wales within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/15/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 15 (1)</ref> (c) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref>; (iv) he should not have found that H was in substantial breach and W was not.

Mr Turner filed a skeleton argument setting out his case.  Mr Cusworth filed a skeleton argument in reply.  He argued that although W had failed on the appeal she had been successful in obtaining the findings, and that the findings survived the hearing. </p>

W listed the enforcement application in that surviving slot.  H did not consent, but neither did he make an application to vacate the hearing.  There was no pre-trial review.  No party applied for one.  I agree that it would have been helpful if there had been a PTR.  The ambit of the hearing was assumed to be the resolution of the enforcement claim.  Both parties came to London for the hearing.</p>

Mr Cusworth  again submitted that they survived the appeal, and were based on undertakings given in the children and nullity proceedings and not the Part III claim.  </p>

During periodic reviews of the progress of the negotiations, counsel agreed that if the case proceeded the court was required to rule on the issue estoppel point as a preliminary issue.  When, negotiations having failed, I started hearing the application, it was common ground that I could not conclude the enforcement proceedings within the time available.  The trial needed a longer slot than 5 days, and refinement and updating of the evidence. </p>

The issue in that case was the extent to which new material might allow the decision to be revisited: not the case here. Lord Keith of Kinkel advanced a general underlying proposition [at 109 G] that the underlying principles upon which issue estoppel is based are public policy and justice, although he stated that these principles have greater force in cause of action estoppel than issue estoppel.  But he also said at [109 B] that &#8220;one of the purposes of estoppel being to work justice between parties, it is open to courts to recognise that in special circumstances inflexible application of it may have the opposite result&#8230;&#8221;.
