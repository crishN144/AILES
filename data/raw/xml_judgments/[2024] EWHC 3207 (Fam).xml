Powys County Council (&#8216;the Local Authority&#8217;) on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2023 made an application for public law orders in respect of three children pursuant to section 31 of the Children Act 1989.  The children in respect of whom that application was made are EB who is now five years three months old; DB who is 12 and a half and CB who is 13 and a half.  The allegations on which the Local Authority founds its application for orders, arise out of events and behaviours concerning EB and it is those allegations which have been the focus of this fact-finding hearing.</p>

It is her behaviour towards, and treatment of, EB on which the Local Authority relies for the allegations it seeks to prove. CB and DB are the children of BB, EB is the child of AC. As far as the threshold criteria is concerned, the Local Authority seeks to prove no allegation in respect of either father. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Local Authority has been represented at this hearing by Ms King KC leading Mr Evans.  The mother has been represented by Mr Tillyard KC leading Ms Leader. EB's father has been represented by Ms Wood. Ms Wood and her client have taken an entirely proper approach to attendance at this hearing attending on days when evidence of key importance was to be called but not otherwise. CB and DB&#8217;s father has been represented during the lifetime of these proceedings and will have the opportunity to participate in any subsequent welfare hearing as may be appropriate but in view of his role in the forensic process and the fact that there was no participation intended by way of either evidence to be given by him or challenge on his behalf to evidence to be given by others at this fact-finding hearing it was neither necessary nor proportionate for him to be represented. It had already been acknowledged that his personal attendance was not required and the responsible approach taken by his counsel to her own attendance is to be commended. The children have been represented by Ms Jenkins, taking her instruction from the Children&#8217;s guardian. The Guardian and her counsel have participated appropriately in the forensic process and have not sought to sit silently behind a stance of &#8216;neutrality&#8217;. I have been very greatly assisted by the very considerable skill and diligence with which all Counsel have approached their respective cases. Each team has presented me with documents of very high quality in advance of the evidence and at the conclusion of the hearing. Each team has approached the task of challenging and testing the evidence with appropriate forensic rigour without straying into the territory of what is sometimes described as exploration. To the extent that there has been exploration, it has been with appropriately charted navigation. </p>

That threshold document will appear as an appendix to this judgment. For brevity that which is alleged may conveniently be summarised as follows. EB is a child with a diagnosed condition of epilepsy and associated with it, medical issues. Within that context of a diagnosed and genuine condition, the Local Authority asserts and seeks to prove that the mother i) has presented her, to medical professionals and others as a child with problems more significant problems than she has in reality ii) has medicalised EB and has actively promoted for  and ascribed to her what the Local Authority terms the &#8220;sick role&#8221;  by exaggeration, non-treatment of real problems, fabrication or illness induction iii) has reported additional/different symptoms to encourage further medical attention for EB iv) has shown disappointment at negative findings including by request for further tests or opinions v) has avoided assessment in an effort to avoid negative findings by treating doctors vi) has challenged clinicians and made complaints about how she has been treated to create a defensive medical approach and elicit sympathy.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is an enormous amount of written evidence. The trial bundle exceeds 6000 pages. There are additionally 3 bundles of extracts of relevant e mail correspondence which the mother has had with medical professionals and others which runs to more than 350 pages.  I have read a good deal of the written evidence within that material.  I have not found it necessary for the purposes of the decisions I have to make at this hearing read in detail the contact recordings though I have dipped into them and note the affectionate tone of the interaction between the mother and children discussion of family pet rabbit and the like. It chimes largely with the evidence I have from other sources that there are plentiful observations of the mother being a warm and loving parent to her children. I have also read many of the recordings made within the clinical and nursing notes at the time of the events under consideration. Counsel have taken me to those parts to which my attention is especially invited. I have heard oral evidence from the following: </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr ZA was the lead treating clinician for EB. He has been a consultant in paediatric neurology since 2007. Within the trial bundle there were entries reflecting his ward rounds and consultation with EB and her mother. He had provided a detailed statement setting out the history of his involvement with EB and her mother. I have read it carefully. He did not depart from the contents of it in any meaningful way. It is neither practicable nor necessary to set out the contents in this judgment but in it he charts the progress of treating EB and the difficulty he and his team had in making sense of the reports being made to him of seizures at a time when the epilepsy they thought they had managed to balance the medication so as to control. He was also the author of a number of letters of referral to fellow clinicians; had provided a letter of open access to PAU; had contributed to a multiagency referral form. He had taken part in a professionals meeting in relation to perplexing presentations and suspected FII on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December. In evidence he told me that he had not had minutes of the meeting but when asked for any record of meeting he found he had a cached teams meeting transcript &#8211; produced I understand automatically rather than by request-  on his computer and so exhibited that to his statement. From some of his answers in evidence, I infer that he had not checked or been asked to check the accuracy of that transcript. </p>

She had been referred to him after she had been admitted to hospital the previous November after episodes of unsteadiness and an admission to hospital when she had been seen to be limping or dragging her leg in December 2020. It was thought there was a neurological component to her presentation, but she was not diagnosed formally with epilepsy until October 2021. By that time two EEGs performed in August and September had been normal - which Dr ZA explained is not unusual since often they fail to capture seizure activity. In October a sleep deprived EEG showed results consistent with the episodes she had been experiencing and of which her mother had provided video recordings. The diagnosis was one of Left Temporal Lobe Focal Onset Epilepsy with Secondary Generalisation and following Todds Paresis. At the March appointment, Dr ZA had been accompanied by ZB specialist epilepsy nurse. </p>

By about March of 2022 he regarded EB's epilepsy as being controlled. On 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2022, in an e-mailed response to a query from the GP practice he described the epilepsy as &#8216;fully controlled&#8217;. In oral evidence he said that this was on the basis of EEG, of review of EB and her clinical state. Controlled in his experience might mean no seizures at all or it might mean a small but acceptable level of seizures and there are always things that increase risk of a seizure in children such as infection raised temperature or sleep deprivation. </p>

This was on the basis of the information he was receiving (from the mother) about the number and type of seizures occurring. Since the mother lived in a relatively remote place and ambulance response times were poor, he also prescribed rescue medication to be used if a seizure lasted more than 5 mins. He had detailed discussion with the mother about the different types of seizure. I accept his evidence that both he and the epilepsy nurses explained multiple times to the mother the different types of seizures. </p>

There were a number of reasons for so doing. The mother&#8217;s behaviour he and the team were finding harder to manage in terms of contacts and she had been keen to have another opinion; he had begun to doubt what he was seeing in his patient and wanted to have the views of a colleague as to whether this really was drug resistant epilepsy; he also wondered if not possible to control by medication whether the ketogenic diet or even surgery should be considered. </p>

I do however regard examples of the mother&#8217;s correspondence as expressed in terms that those who are caring for her child &#8211; and making themselves available to the mother far beyond that which other parents have access to - would indeed find unacceptable.

There was disagreement about the care plan which had been provided for the school &#8211; only when it had been provided could EB return. Dr ZA seemed reluctant to agree that it had been a school plan. He said that the template was the same one used for various different things. I think that he was wrong when he suggested that it was not, in this case, a plan for the school. The second epilepsy plan to which he was taken in the bundle was one which he ended up drafting himself on December 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> 2022. This plan was intended not for the school but to signpost and direct those who might care for or be called on to treat  EB though unfamiliar with her. The document was constructed in in terms of continuity of care all in one document. Dr ZA had to accept when pressed that the plan had been late in coming and had been produced only when the mother and ZL on his behalf pressed for it and indeed by the time it was forthcoming the mother had already made a complaint about him. </p>

First what if any effect it had on the working relationship with the mother which I will consider later in the judgment. Second as part of my consideration of whether this witness&#8217;s evidence or actions were affected by animus to the mother and in particular whether his referral for consideration of FII in respect of the mother was a retaliatory response to her complaint. That latter I will consider later but I was satisfied listening to him that he was not someone who had done anything other than try to find a way to do his best for his patient. </p>

Examples of this were &#8211; a negative PCR test in circumstances where she had been obliged to self-isolate for prolonged period in the public health conditions of the pandemic. I do not regard either the detail of the test or the circumstances of her isolation as &#8216;personal&#8217; information at a time when that sort of information was exchanged very commonly. In like form I do not regard either the empathetic recounting of the experience of a mother of a sick child herself or the explanation for absence of the death of her father as being properly characterised as the offering of personal information.

I will consider elsewhere the issue of the mother&#8217;s communication with professionals. The extent to which ZB worried about EB's situation and about the mother&#8217;s isolation as a single parent was for me encapsulated in that part of her evidence where she explained that even though home visits were not part of her role and even at a time when Wales was subject to stringent pandemic lockdown regulations, she sought and obtained permission from her manager to carry out a home visit. </p>

Mr Tillyard KC with some delicacy explored this aspect with her and the position which emerged was that she had found working this case and the proceedings flowing from it stressful. She said frankly that she was at the stage in her career where the NHS sent out communications to employees nudging them to think about when they might retire, and this had made her do so.  She did not think she had it in her to take on another similar case should one come along, and she thought someone younger and with a resilience she felt she lacked would be needed. She does intend now to retire but has not yet done so. At other points in this hearing, I was asked to remember the effect on the mother of living within the requirements of lockdown.

Though I do not agree with him that there was the need for an appropriate adult given the fact that this was a conversation in a s 47 context.  I bear those criticisms in mind, to the limited extent that which emerges from the conversations with the older 2 children has relevance.  They confirmed it seems what the mother and the maternal grandmother have also said &#8211; that EB did not wear a helmet at home. Neither described seeing her choking on food. CB reportedly said that EB had small fits at night and other sorts of seizures but had never seen EB have a seizure, though had seen her in what appeared to be a post ictal state. DB is recorded as having said that the mother had told DB that EB had epilepsy but DB had not seen a seizure. Both knew their sister wore a helmet at school. </p>

I have been cautious, because of the failures in relation to ABE compliance and the absence of verbatim question and answer, in taking very much account of what the CB and DB are reported to have said. I do not however wholly disregard it and there are two aspects of it to which I attach some weight when I place it in the context of the overall picture. First the fact that the children were spoken to without their mother being alerted (or permission asked) in advance means that there is no suggestion that she can have influenced them as to what they might be asked about or say. Second, given what is recorded elsewhere as to the mother reporting of seizures, it is noteworthy that the 2 childrenliving in the same house did not report having seen seizures.</p>

She spoke warmly of EB and was clearly concerned for her. She had been the person who sat in when EB had spoken to the police officer and the social worker who attended the school. ZJ was aware of EB's diagnosis with Epilepsy. She agreed that the nursery had declined to have EB back until there was an epilepsy care plan and the staff had the training to deal with any seizures EB might have at school.  In due course, in March there was such a care plan but there was a time lag until June when the training was given to administer Buccal, the recovery medication. In the interim it was agreed at the mother&#8217;s suggestion that she would remain close by during nursery hours so that should EB need the recovery medication it could be given.  The mother had described to the sort of different things to look for in relation to EB's epilepsy: absences, tonic clonic, focal seizures and drop seizures.</p>

This was not something instigated or required by the nursery. ZJ also explained that the Seizure Incident record which formed part of the evidence was a document she had devised following the phased return and was a document completed at the mother&#8217;s request so that she could use it to show at her appointments with Doctors. ZJ explained that it was to be used to make a note of any seizures or anything that might be a seizure. Those episodes which I have seen in the log within the court bundle and to which Ms ZJ was taken in the course of her evidence have entries which are consistent with the diagnosis EB has. That is to say there are entries of twitching and jerking from time to time. ZJ also spoke of an occasion when she had seen EB take herself off and lie down for what she described (and the mother told her sometimes happened) as a lying down seizure. What was striking in its absence from ZJ&#8217;s evidence at a similar time the mother was telling Dr ZF that EB was having tonic clonic seizures every couple of days along with drop seizures 5 -6 times a day, was that she had not ever seen such in the Nursery. That might have been surprising in and of itself given her involvement in and around the setting when EB was day to day. It is the more so taken together with her evidence which I also accept that she never had reported to her by anyone else  - and nor do I see in the records &#8211; drop seizures or generalised tonic clonic seizures.</p>

It was therefore, I find, all the more impressive that running through her evidence was a clear thread of concern for the welfare of her grandchildren, a desire to do her best for them and an effort not to mislead or jump to conclusions, still less to step outside what she knew or remembered herself and so felt able confidently to say. She and her husband had taken the children in without hesitation when they were removed from the mother&#8217;s care. They had no notice of the intended removal.  I found her account of managing the distress of the older two &#8211; which showed itself in different ways in each child and of looking after EB striking and affecting. She described how she took EB into her bed because, knowing her to be a child with the diagnosis of epilepsy, and having herself no experience of looking after such a child she was worried that after such an upsetting day, EB might have a seizure, so she held her close. As it happens, she did not have one. She described her being very jerky at night &#8211; now of course she knows much more about myoclonic jerks and seizures.

The e mail which the mother was asked about which contains the allegation of an ultimatum was sent from the CPN to a third party. I heard no challenge to the fact that what had been intended to be a stay of a fortnight or so with the maternal grandmother in an emergency had dragged on when the Council did not sort out the alternative housing. I am satisfied having asked the mother about her recollection and heard the maternal grandmother&#8217;s evidence that it is more likely than not that the e mail in which reference is made to the maternal grandmother giving the mother an ultimatum to leave her home by a given date was sent at a time when unless the council understood her to be becoming homeless, it would not as a priority take the steps to rehouse her. I make it clear that to the extent that I have reached conclusions about the way in which the mother described the shortcomings in her relationship with the maternal grandmother and why she gave such descriptions I have disregarded the suggestion that the grandmother would have seen her daughter and grandchildren on the streets or that the mother suggested that she would do so. </p>

He also gave a clear picture of how terrifying it can be for parents especially in the early days of diagnosis to see their children having seizures. There is much that is unpredictable about the condition and the medication used to treat it. Although as a child came off Lacosamide it would be expected to show in diminishing effects such as sleepiness, it could not be predicted how long that might take and it could vary yet again from one child to another. Given that it was Dr Curran who had thought it possible EB might have grown out of her epilepsy I was surprised slightly to hear him say in the course of his evidence &#8211; volunteering it rather than directly asked &#8211; that he entirely agreed with an observation made by Dr Robinson the paediatric expert in his report i.e. </p>

Although he was cross examined with great skill for the mother, he had not at the conclusion of his evidence moved from his view that there were elements of exaggeration and fabrication in this case. He reiterated his view that the mother was, as he saw it, an extremely anxious sort of person and sometimes an anxious parent behaves in ways that fit within FII. That does not of course excuse the behaviour or alter the effect for the child, but he regarded it as relevant. He was asked to consider a paper authored by Luke Clements. The subject matter was the effect on parents of being suspected or facing allegations of PII. Reading it and the questions he was then asked about it did not cause him to amend his view.

She was frank and open about her past struggles in relation to her mental health and she did not say as I know she has suggested to others that it is something which is being in a sense used unfairly against her in these proceedings.</p>

In doing so I have had regard to the relevant and applicable legal framework which is uncontroversial and will appear as an appendix to this document.  As is often the case there remains at the end of the evidence much that is in dispute between the parties. It is neither proportionate nor purposive to determine every last disputed point in exhaustive detail even were it possible to do so.  It is also the case that for reasons I perfectly well understand and about which I make no complaint the document setting out the allegations made, and findings sought by the Local Authority (and therefore also the response) is more narrative and discursive than in a case which more readily lends itself to a Scott schedule. It is likely therefore that there will be conclusions I reach which are relevant to more than one aspect of that which is alleged. </p>

The mother time and again in her oral evidence and in her responses has relied on the fact that it was a requirement of the plan and indeed the only way in which the school would allow EB back into nursery and that it was not something she had wanted. To a superficial extent that provides an explanation, but I find that the fact that it came to be in the plan at all is as a result of the mother&#8217;s reporting of drop seizures and so the reliability of that reporting falls to be considered. </p>

A drop seizure is not a subtle manifestation of epilepsy which is hard to spot or requires expertise to interpret. Dr Robinson in both his written and oral evidence made the point that the wearing of a helmet, is something which would be reliant on drop seizure reporting. He had noted in his report that the helmet was not needed at home and that EB's siblings when spoken to did not say she fell at home.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As with so many aspects of this case, it is important not to lose sight of the fact that EB does have a properly founded diagnosis of epilepsy.  It is not the case that she had <span style="font-style:italic">never</span> had drop seizures. They had been observed by people other than her mother. Her grandmother had seen three. Most recently whilst EB was on holiday and in her care. Before formal diagnosis the mother says that there had been a drop seizure at nursery in September 2021. There are no recordings of drop falls at nursery. Mr Tillyard KC submits that although ZJ from the school could not remember it, and there were no notes of any, she accepted it was possible there were other drop seizures. I do not regard that passage of cross examination as one on which I can rely to find that it was more likely than not that there were drop seizures at nursery and I reject the submission that there were drop seizures there, but they went unrecorded. In about September of 2022, when the seizure record began to be kept at the school, no drop seizures were included amongst the recordings of observations that were or might be seizures.   I hold in mind the evidence I heard from ZC when asked the level at which she would expect a child to be experiencing drop seizures  before prescribing helmet &#8211; that it would be very often, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;daily&#8217;</span>. I am satisfied on balance of probability that it was nowhere near this level.   I do not accept that, were it happening as frequently as the mother says, it would be the case that her siblings did not see it at home or that the nursery did not see falls there (as I accept on the evidence and consider elsewhere). Nor do I think it more likely than not that the maternal grandmother would have seen only 3 occasions as she told me had been the case. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Similarly I find that the frequency of the GTCS she reported to Dr ZF was exaggerated. At about the time the mother was reporting to Dr ZF a very worrying level of seizure activity which would place EB on the spectrum of concern at the more worrying end - 5 &#8211;6 drop seizures a day; every second day GTCS - the log at her school was reporting nothing of the sort. It is noteworthy, against the backdrop of ZJ&#8217;s evidence which I accept, that the seizure incident log was something the mother asked the school to keep so she could produce it to the treating doctors, she did not in fact do so. Had she produced the seizure incident log to the doctors what that would have demonstrated was a child with controlled epilepsy and not a child with the seizure activity the mother reported.  The mother had been asked to provide video footage. Some she did provide, and Dr Curran notably regarded the 3 or so recordings she did as being quite a high level of recordings in comparison with many parents. What was captured however was the not GTCS which the mother reported happening so frequently. I do regard that as surprising. At this hearing I heard that although in the early days when parents are frightened and as both Dr Curran and Dr Robinson acknowledged it looks like their child is dying, as they get used to the fact that the GTCS are something the child comes out of, parents are able to record them as they last long enough to capture them. The more so now almost everyone has a smartphone to hand.   Although I find the dissonance with that which was not seen at school more helpful evidence as I assess this aspect, I do also regard it as telling also, when added to that, that the mother did not record the GTCS she was reporting.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I find that on the balance of probabilities EB was not experiencing seizures at the level the mother was reporting. Had she been, it defies reason they would not have been seen at least some of the time at school. I have examined carefully the recordings in the log kept by the school.  It follows and I so find that the mother was over reporting the seizures. The over reporting represents at least exaggeration. The contrast between what was reported to Dr ZF and what was seen and recorded at school at the same time raises my suspicion that, as with the drop seizures, it may be likely that it contains elements of fabrication. I am however less certain of this than I am in relation to the drop seizures reported at the time and so whilst I find she exaggerated the GTCS I do not make a positive finding that it was more likely than not that the mother fabricated in this respect. Nor do I think it is necessary to strain to reach a firm conclusion as between exaggeration and fabrication. For those in the field of the paediatric diagnosis of   the child and or the psychiatric diagnosis of the adult, where one blends into the other is likely meaningful. For the purposes of this Court, whether the mother exaggerates or fabricates, the real significance lies in what that means for EB's welfare. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The prescription of medication to control the epilepsy is in very large part dependent on an honest account from a parent or carer. Put simply doctors rely on parents to be truthful in the accounts they give. The medication as I heard from Dr Curran, Dr Robinson and Dr ZA is not without risk or side effects. I was very struck by Dr Curran&#8217;s observation that from his own perspective he would always medicate if there were seizures and wouldn't conduct a cost benefit exercise but some paediatricians would. He thought it such a difficult area that it was hard to say what would be the view of a reasonable body of paediatric neurologists on whether there should or should not be a cost benefit analysis. EB, who did have a proper diagnosis of epilepsy, was on 2, at times as many as 3, anti-epilepsy medications. It was the exaggeration and or fabrication by her mother that led to this. The doctors relied on her to give a true account. She did not. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have had to think about the way in which what is said is recorded in the records. In a number of respects submissions are made on the mother&#8217;s behalf that if something is not recorded in a note, or a note is not available, then I should not accept a witness's recollection or statement. One such instance comes in relation to the statement of ZC for this hearing. In it she says that the mother reported a previous 24-hour period where EB had a cluster of seizures including 30 drops the previous day. She relates a conversation about asking whether there were injuries since 30 is a lot, and reports an explanation from the mother as to why there were no injuries as mostly the drops were from sitting. The submission is made that it is inconsistent with an e mail to ZB of the same day which reports a cluster of drops, a huge amount of myoclonics and does not include reference to 30 drops. It is said also on behalf of the mother that there is no mention there of a clonic tonic at all. It is notable to me that it refers to the child having had a tonic clonic at 11. I have thought long and hard about whether I should reject Ms ZC's statement about the 30 drops on the basis of there being no record to support the conversation and the fact that, as it is put for the mother, it &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">flies in the face of this contemporaneous record from that we do have from [mother]&#8217; </span>I am wary of regarding the mother as a reliable historian such that I may take an e mail from her as a contemporaneous record. This instance is not one where there is a small difference in the account of something: for example ZC recalling the mother saying something happened 6 times and the mother saying she only said 4 and relying on an e mail sent as supportive. There is a reason why cases such as this are not tried by simple reference to the very large number of papers filed. The advantage I have as the trial judge is to see, hear and assess the witnesses as they give oral evidence and are cross-examined. It was my assessment that ZC was an honest witness doing her best to assist the court in her evidence. I have not formed the same view of the mother. It would be quite wrong, because I have disbelieved her and found her to have been unreliable in other respects, including giving an account to Dr ZF that I find to be false about the number of daily drop seizures, to work on the basis that she is therefore unreliable or untruthful wherever her account conflicts with that of another witness. I do not take that blanket approach, but in relation to this aspect of the evidence I do believe, accept and prefer Ms ZC's evidence that she was told there had been 30 drops. I do not think she added the detail of asking about injuries as it seemed like a lot for any reason other than because that is what she was told and that it was indeed a large number and so that is what she asked. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The significance of the mother&#8217;s misreporting to Dr ZF is underscored by the fact that it was as a second opinion clinician that she was being seen. Part of the reason Dr ZF had been selected (by Dr ZA, not the mother) was her expertise in ketogenic diets. It is recognised that a ketogenic diet is a step to be taken only if it is warranted because the epilepsy is serious and unresponsive to medication. It is a reasonable inference to draw that someone as well informed as the mother would be aware of this this. She had already assiduously sought out information from the Matthew&#8217;s Friends website and the Daisy Garland website to which Dr ZF had intended to refer her. It was from one of those websites that she obtained Dr ZF's direct (professional) e mail address so as to contact her to remonstrate about the cancellation of an intended consultation.  The fact that Dr ZF put EB on the list for ketogenic diet treatment is not as the mother seemed to suggest the same as saying that it was her idea. It was a direct consequence of what the mother reported to her and of what she understood from Dr ZA, EB's consultant. Interestingly, when asked on behalf of the mother about the fact that she had been asked to consider whether EB should be referred for a ketogenic diet Dr ZF responded <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;Dr ZA asked me if it was appropriate as the mother has been asking for it&#8217;. </span>Elsewhere I have considered the extent to which Dr ZA explained the reliance that he and EB's epilepsy team had on accurate reporting.  Mr Tillyard KC and Ms. Leader were right to remind me in their submissions by reference to <span style="font-style:italic">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">underland CC v AB (Re-hearing: Factfinding : Expert or Professional evidence) </span><span style="font-style:italic">219 EWHC 3887</span> that the evidence of those involved as instructed experts and those who come to the case as treating clinicians bring somewhat different qualities and one potential &#8216;drawback&#8217; of treating clinician is that they may have formed a relationship with and view of the patient and parent. I held that caution in my mind when re-reading the evidence I had from Dr ZF. In a sense she occupies the ground between the instructed expert and the treating clinician contemplated by Williams J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Sunderland</span>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">One consequence of what I find was the mother&#8217;s over reporting and exaggeration of seizure activity was that Dr ZF thought it right to place EB on the list for ketogenic diet. Another was that it meant that Dr ZF, taking the mother&#8217;s account to her as accurate, formed the understanding that the situation on which she was advising was one of uncontrolled epilepsy (making EB a candidate for the Ketogenic diet) since she was simultaneously hearing that EB was on Lacosamide and sodium valproate but nonetheless experiencing 5-6 drops a day and GTCS every couple of days. Within that context it is unsurprising that Dr ZF was alarmed when the mother expressed concern about the sleepiness which she thought the Lacosamide brought about, and wanted a reduction. Dr ZF was clear that she could not step into prescribing or withdrawing of medication in any event as that was not her role. She also fairly accepted that the impression she had at the time, that the mother might have been thinking to reduce the Lacosamide levels without reference to Dr ZA was misplaced.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">From other medical professionals I have heard of the way in which medicating - and reducing medication for the management of seizure activity requires most careful consideration. I did not detect any disagreement between Dr Curran and Dr Robinson or for that matter from Dr ZA, that it would be desirable if safe and indicated clinically to reduced dosage or remove a medication. From Dr ZA I heard that it would be preferable to manage epilepsy with as few medications as possible &#8211; so to be on 3 was not ideal. I did not regard the evidence I heard from Dr Curran as contrary to that.  All doctors from whom I heard recognised the association between viral illness, temperature spikes and breakthrough seizures even on medication. It is not well understood scientifically why that is so. Reduction in particular is something about which as appears earlier Dr Curran said it would be hard to get a consensus paediatric neurologist view. Elsewhere I have indicated my clear impression that his own position is that he would almost always medicate if there were a risk of seizures. Dr ZA on the other hand spoke of the balance between side effect and seizure control. This he had apparently expressed to the mother as  <span style="font-style:italic">better sleepy than seizure</span> something for which he appeared to be criticised somewhat in cross examination. It was not my impression that he had intended it flippantly in expressing it in that way. There was a seeming consensus that the most important sign that reducing/withdrawing anti-epilepsy medication was clinically indicated was that a child had become seizure-free or seizure-controlled. By way of illustration Dr Curran spoke of it being appropriate to seek to reduce or withdraw where no seizures had been seen for 12 perhaps 18 months. What emerged from all those medical professionals qualified to express a view, was that it would be against a backdrop of controlled or diminished seizures that reducing medication would be contemplated. So it is that when the mother has said several times at this hearing that she was repeatedly asking for the Lacosamide to be reduced, that must be seen in the context of her exaggeration of the seizures which it is being prescribed to address and which on her reports are not well controlled. This part of the evidence has echoes of the way in which the mother characterised the helmet as not being at her request but because it was a requirement of the safety plan, without acknowledging that others relied on her reporting.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is a good deal of evidence about the mother&#8217;s unboundaried approach to contacting professionals. Mr Tillyard KC has most effectively cross-examined ZB to the effect that (though he did not put it as crudely as this) she in a way brought it on herself by not rebuffing the mother when she overstepped the mark.  There is some force in that. It was suggested that she had never for example told the mother not to contact her so frequently or to make use of the helpline and that although she had said this in her statement, one could see this did not feature in the run of e mails. She was clear that she had on occasion spoken to the mother over the telephone. Inevitably (and properly) she was challenged on this and asked if there were any notes of such conversations. Inevitably (and properly) a complaint was made that none had been produced. ZB did produce her own notes which included such a conversation on 28 July 2022. It is submitted on behalf of the mother that it is an important omission that in the note (as distinct from the statement) there is no mention of the advice line being the &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">appropriate</span>&#8217; way for the mother to contact ZB rather than to e mail. I agree that for this mother, the fact that ZB suggesting (as the note records) that she ring the advice line rather than e mailing is unlikely to have had the same impact as being told that to do otherwise was not &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">appropriate</span>&#8217;. It is likely, I think, that ZB was doing her best to deal kindly with the mother when she reasoned with her that were she for example on leave then e mailing her would not work. Reading this note, I do not think a reasonably insightful person could have failed to see what ZB was saying was that she did not want the mother to keep e mailing her. I have not formed the impression that the mother was such a person and it is also my impression (shared I note by Dr Robinson when he gave evidence but not by the mother in hers) that she is someone with high levels of anxiety. I therefore agree with Mr Tillyard KC that the note does not say quite what ZB's statement does and also that for this mother, that made a difference to what she took from the conversation. Whilst elsewhere in this judgment, I have not found the approach taken on behalf of the mother that if something is not in a record or a note I should not accept the evidence of a witness in this instance the submission is well pitched.</p>

To me, the mother said that no such thing had ever been suggested and that had it been she would have welcomed it. I reject her evidence on both those points. The note also records the mother responding to the suggestion that she should ring the advice line, that she had deleted the advice line number - I regard that, if true, as an extraordinary thing for a mother in her position to have done. It records also that she deleted it as she does not feel able to leave a message. It is hard to see why that was so, but it inclines me to the view that at this time, for this mother, the focus was on her own preference and convenience. In her oral evidence, as part of explaining why she had not taken a firmer line, ZB had said that she had a memory of the mother in this conversation saying something to the effect that she had her own ways. That too I see reflected in this note. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> ZB was an empathetic and concerned professional. She almost certainly should have been firmer with the mother at an earlier stage. Hindsight is however quite different. ZB believed the mother on her own account to be isolated and alone (she was not).  Without family support (she was not). It is also the case that ZB's role involved her building a relationship with the parents of her patients. I bear in mind also that since much of the mother&#8217;s dealings with her were during the pandemic that was something that skewed boundaries on both sides as work and home distinctions were less keenly apparent. Nevertheless and allowing for all that I regard the mother as having taken advantage of ZB's openness to her. She certainly I find was resistant to taking the route of ringing the helpline and waiting for a call back. I accept that Mr Tillyard KC is probably right when, as he put to more than one witness, the mother regarded the relationship as having developed into a friendship. Having heard ZB's evidence I am satisfied that that was not her perception of it.  I accept Dr Robinson's evidence that the volume of the communication and the reporting of the symptoms was excessive. I have thought carefully about  Mr Tillyard KC&#8217;s well pitched point put fairly to more than one witness that the e mail traffic with ZB was not all one way. ZB would respond &#8211; which given her role is not perhaps surprising but she would also as Mr Tillyard  KC points out sometimes initiate contact with mother asking how EB was. She did so within the context of understanding from the mother&#8217;s reporting to her EB's epilepsy to be unresponsive to medication and high level of seizures to be continuing notwithstanding that. </p>

I also hold in my mind Dr ZA's oral evidence that in the early time following EB's presentation and then diagnosis it was not unreasonable for the mother to be in contact frequently with the specialist epilepsy nurse. The order of magnitude between the level at which this parent e-mailed and made contact as compared with the next most frequently corresponding parent is however telling.  I am satisfied also that ZB came to find it oppressive and overwhelming. I do not find that the mother intended the effect it had on ZB, nor do I think it is even likely that she was aware of it. She appears to me to lack the insight into how the way she behaves affects others. I have in reflecting on this aspect wondered if it is fair to draw firm conclusions from the different approach the maternal grandmother took to communications with the epilepsy services when she assumed care of EB. Her communication was far more limited even although she was very nervous taking charge of a child who she understood to have a serious health condition which she was not used to managing. I have stepped back from relying on that contrast, essentially for two reasons. The first is that the grandmother was entirely candid that the fact that she was as she put it &#8216;petrified&#8217; that the children might be removed from her and placed with strangers meant that she did was afraid to make frequent contact with medical professionals for help when she was worried about whether something might be wrong with EB. There is evidence that she needed and was given reassurance by the social worker about this. The second reason is that the maternal grandmother is somewhat different in character and personality. Even when given reassurance by the social worker she instinctively &#8216;saved up&#8217; observations to ask about in one session rather than calling daily because she said she didn't want to be &#8216;a nuisance&#8217;   and she was, she explained, also someone who felt that you had to trust what the doctors said. For those reasons whilst I have found the comparison with the level at which other parents whose children were part of the caseload of the professional concerned helpful and illustrative, I have not found the comparison with the maternal grandmother to be so. </p>

There was similarly an initially high level of e mail traffic sent to ZI who described the constant &#8216;pinging&#8217; of her laptop as unexpected e mails came in in large numbers from the mother over and over again as she was in a meeting. Her evidence was that it started the day before she was allocated formally once the mother had been told. She told the mother to stop and it seems that largely thereafter she did.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The e mails to which Dr Robinson was referred in evidence which came at a time when the relationship between the mother and the treating clinicians was breaking down were in character hostile and destructive. When the FII meeting was convened on 14 December, Dr ZA complained about the language the mother used. He was challenged in cross-examination about this aspect of his contribution to that meeting and much of the challenge was rooted in the assertion that the mother had not used profanity or bad language at any point. I had not read Dr ZA's remark, recorded on the Teams transcript about the language as meaning that. I do regard the language of &#8216;gaslighting&#8217; likening situation to domestically abusive relationships, saying to ZB that she was &#8216;done with&#8217; her as unacceptable. I observed the effect that it had had on ZB. I note elsewhere that the mother is recorded in hospital notes of an attendance at PAU saying to those medical and nursing professionals dealing with EB, that she would rather work as a prostitute than work in the NHS, that animals are treated better than children , that they can all sleep at night whilst she is left to pick up the pieces, that EB lost her skills and she is left to pick up the shit. As it happens I agree with Mr Tillyard KC&#8217;s overarching point on this, that what language the mother may have used does not really bear on the decisions I have to make at this hearing but since it was put so strongly to Dr ZA that he was wrong to comment on it, I make it clear that I disagree.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">What then to make of this aspect of the case? Part of the reason why the communications matter is their content. The symptoms she was reporting and the picture of EB she was presenting knowing the reliance to be placed on them. She was reporting multiple symptoms over multiple e mails. Some repeats of the same, some new. Whether they were happening or not is, as Dr Robinson observed, another thing. I have elsewhere made findings as to exaggeration of seizures. The excessive and unboundaried quality of them is something other and even the mother acknowledges that aspect is striking looking at them as she does now from the end point of the witness box. I have not found it helpful to take a mathematical approach to adding up the number of e mails and symptoms in the way that the Local Authority does, or to add up the number of responses as Mr Tillyard KC in the course of the hearing invited various witnesses to. To the extent that it is necessary to determine for the decisions I must make in this case, why it was that the mother communicated in this excessive and unboundaried way with professionals, I think it is likely that the roots lie in anxiety. Whilst the mother told me that she did not think her anxiety had been affected by the pandemic and living under lockdown conditions, it may be that it was. I acknowledge that I am in danger of straying too far into speculation and go no further than to observe that the period of the pandemic was one which is widely regarded as re-igniting difficulties for many whose past mental health profiles included elements of anxiety. It may be that the behaviour is a manifestation of anxiety. I am wary of coming to a firm view on that when, first of all the expertise to do so almost certainly lies in another field and second, it is does not much matter in terms of the effect on EB and her treating clinicians. The effect I find it had was to jeopardise EB's stable continuity of care by e.g. having to have the specialist epilepsy nurse changed. I do not find that it was the mother&#8217;s intention to bring that about by the correspondence. There is in fact clear indication in the e mails that she was displeased and vexed by the change of specialist epilepsy nurse. She did, however later request a change from Dr ZA and his team.</p>

Coughing and spluttering is a common observation in small children, and it is very often not a symptom of a medical condition but a symptom of being a small child. I was impressed by ZD the speech and language therapist who by way of update told me that she has closed her file to EB, since April 2023 so far as eating issues are concerned and to the extent that colleagues in SALT are to see EB it is for slightly delayed speech.

Having heard and reviewed the available evidence of this admission I find that the Local Authority has not established that the mother was exaggerating or fabricating the account of a choke at home. To be clear, whilst I have already made findings that the mother was exaggerating the seizure activities at this time, it does not follow that everything else she was reporting in all domains of health  therefore was or must be exaggeration or fabrication. </p>

More troubling however is the misreporting and exaggerating of what ZD said. I reject the mother&#8217;s explanation from the witness box that ZD used interchangeably the terms nasogastric tube and PEG.

The extent to which the mother struggled with the question was very striking. She was not dissembling when she said that she was confused and could not think straight; she was completely flummoxed.

Epilepsy her treating clinicians regarded as controlled. The Grandmother was explicit that her only source of information about EB and her epilepsy (before she assumed care) was the mother.

The prospect of a child coming to believe something that is not true of herself carries with it serious emotional and psychological risk.  To illustrate by way of an example at the far end of the spectrum of harm and removed from the factual circumstances here: a child repeatedly characterised as one who cannot walk or eat may needlessly find themselves PEG fed and wheelchair reliant because they too come to believe it to be so. I accept Dr Robinson&#8217;s evidence that medicalising &#8211; that is bringing children for medical attention to professionals is harmful. Doctors will try, he said to say to a child who comes to a hospital for diagnosis something like <span style="font-style:italic">well yes you have epilepsy but its well-controlled and everything from here on will be ok .</span>If there are repeatedly presentations, reassessments investigations, parents constantly on the phone about it then the child becomes medicalised. An older child may worry about losing a medical support system. A younger child who is medicalised can be highly anxious and believe they are unwell when they are nor, or more unwell than they are. That is why this is not a makeweight finding sought by the Local Authority but a serious aspect of the case brought. I find it established.</p>

To the extent that even now there is not, as I understand it, full agreement to date. For this reason I have been disinclined to read anything adverse into any question or challenge she has raised in relation to the MRI.

I anticipate that, in the context of having been told the scan showed atrophy, most parents would find that difficult. For similar reasons although in contemplating matters about which the mother has given catastrophising or exaggerated accounts, I have seen it has relevance it has seemed to me that evidence about for example reference to shrinking of EB's brain is not sufficiently safe foundation for such findings.

In my judgment that delay heightened the mother&#8217;s anxiety, contributed to (though does not excuse or fully explain) some of the excessive communications to which I have made reference elsewhere and damaged the working relationship. From ZL, whose evidence I did not otherwise find helpful, I heard how she had become involved to assist with the plan and with CPR training. As to CPR training there was also delay in providing the mother with what might be characterised as &#8216;hands on&#8217; training rather than providing her with information via literature. Dr ZA in evidence was cross examined at very great length and to good effect about these deficits. I conclude that the delays in provision contributed to the breakdown of the relationship and formed part of what Mr Tillyard KC called in his submissions &#8216;Health not communicating with mother&#8217;. I reach that conclusion notwithstanding the fact that the mother in her approach to communication and EB's presentation which for the medics working on the mother&#8217;s report was complex and demanding, placed a burden on an already stretched epilepsy service in meeting the needs of all of the families on its caseload. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The criticism made of Dr ZA in relation to his decision not to take forward the Ketogenic diet for which Dr ZF had placed her on the waiting list is not well founded. For the mother it is submitted that it is <span style="font-style:italic">understandable </span>that the mother was frustrated and disappointed that he had cancelled this (and the genetic testing) without telling her or discussing it with her first. In the light of the serious findings I have made about the account the mother gave to Dr ZF on the basis of which she made the referral it is not understandable &#8211; at least not in the sense of being justified. It was notable that Dr ZF when she gave evidence did not appear to be troubled by the fact that the ketogenic diet had at Dr ZA's instigation not been proceeded with. I find that but for Dr ZA's decision EB would have been exposed to unnecessary course of treatment. I am not certain he was wise to take the course he did but his response as to the ethical conviction with which he did so in evidence was striking. I agree with Ms King&#8217;s characterisation in her submissions of him &#8216;putting his career on the line&#8217; in so doing. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst I accept some of the submissions made on behalf of the mother, about the way in which evolving concerns about perplexing medical presentations and suspected FII were managed, I do not in the circumstances of this case make any further observations still less any finding on the fact the lead clinician for EB took the view that the concerns should not be discussed with the mother who was at the centre of the evolving concerns or that on this occasion there was not a collaborative meeting with her. It was a fact, as is submitted on her behalf that the mother was unaware she was under suspicion and the subject of discussion by medical professionals. Often those whose behaviour towards their children is troubling to professionals in medical settings are unaware.  The meetings of colleagues from different disciplines to discuss emerging concerns is an appropriate step to take. To the extent that the Teams transcript shows a free and frank discussion between medical colleagues I do not regard it as improper. It has as I see it the character of a discussion to try to understand what is going on and that encompasses speculation about worst case scenarios of behaviours that I fully accept have not formed part of the allegations before me. I reject the submission for the mother that comments made by Dr ZA were intended to or had the effect of unfairly influencing other professionals at the meeting to a view that this was a case of FII. I am satisfied that the concerns about perplexing medical presentations were discussed both at this meeting and on referral at the multi-agency strategy meeting on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January as a result of evolving worries amongst those treating of possible FII. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not regard it as improper that the referral was made when it was. Nor having clarified with Mr Tillyard KC during submissions is it submitted that it was. During the lifetime of this hearing the mother has from time to time asserted that the question of FII and the referral was made by Dr ZA in response or retaliation to the complaint she had made against him. I do not read the detailed closing submissions as maintaining such an assertion on her behalf and nor did it feature prominently in her oral evidence. It is right also that there has never been a time when the mother as part of this hearing or the structuring of it contented for a finding to that effect. Lest there be scope for any doubt however, I explicitly reject the suggestion that the FII referral was so caused or motivated and I accept that it emerged from the clinicians concerns as to the evolving picture.</p>

Although I make that finding, I hold in my mind the grandmother&#8217;s evidence of her anxiety that living in a small community everyone would know and it would be difficult for the older children who were of an age to be affected by gossip and were already distressed by the removal. There was some component of this in the mother&#8217;s thinking as well when she was asked about it. In her case however it was not just about the children but about her. She was accused of child abuse and did not want that to get out. I have read in the papers of her distress at being labelled a child abuser.  It was her belief that the proceedings would come to nothing and it would all be over in 12 weeks. I think it is more likely than not that she hoped in that case that the fathers would not have to know.</p>

I have in the course of this judgment and indeed in other similar cases expressed reservations as to whether the appropriate expertise to define and identify the mother&#8217;s motivations for her behaviour lies within the court room. It most likely does not. I have some similar reservations about attaching to the findings I have made the label of FII which it seems to me is more properly a diagnosis than a legal finding even and although the components of such a diagnosis might be reflected in the findings. </p>

Perhaps the more so in this case because of the findings I have made as to medicalisation and the sick role, the seriousness of which may be too easily overlooked. Whether the findings carry the label of FII or not what matters for the purposes of any welfare decisions for EB and her siblings is that they establish the threshold and that the mother poses a risk of significant harm. </p>
