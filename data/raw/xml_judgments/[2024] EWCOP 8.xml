The summons included the required notices to Ms MacPherson including her right to non-means tested funding for representation. She chose not to attend in person but I was aware from her correspondence to the Court and to others that she was in fact in France, and that she was ready to join the hearing remotely. After hearing submissions from counsel for the Local Authority and the litigation friend for FP, I allowed Ms MacPherson to join the hearing remotely.  She was not represented but wanted to make submissions to the court. She indicated on that occasion very clearly that she would not attend a further hearing of the committal application.  </span></p>

That could only have been executed in the event of her return to this jurisdiction, or at least that was my expectation.  On reflection, after the hearing I decided that a further hearing ought in any event to be listed, otherwise the application to commit Ms MacPherson for contempt of court might stand in abeyance for a very long time.  Accordingly, I listed the application for a further hearing with personal attendance by the defendant directed again, the listing being for today, 22 January 2024 at 2.45pm.  Again, Ms MacPherson has not attended in person.  She remains in France.  However, she was able to attend remotely, and again I have allowed her to do so after giving an opportunity to counsel to make submissions.  Ms MacPherson again attended remotely and unrepresented. She was prepared to argue her case and did not ask for an adjournment to seek representation or otherwise. Ms MacPherson was keen to make her arguments and I gave her ample opportunity to do so. I have a long experience of Ms MacPherson appearing before me remotely and she can become angry and unfocused. I repeat that she has been notified of her rights in the notice and summons served upon her in accordance with the requirements of COP Rules 2017 r21.4. Given the defendant&#8217;s departure to France, and her address in France being unknown and not revealed to the court or the claimant, I have previously allowed service to be by way of email as well as post at her last address in England, where her husband still lives. She has been effectively served. I was satisfied that it was appropriate to proceed.</span></p>

Those proceedings have recently concluded.  FP was diagnosed and is treated for paranoid, treatment-resistant schizophrenia, which causes her, amongst other problems, to have delusions about being persecuted by others.  </span></p>

She believes that her daughter is being poisoned with medication that she does not need.  She is convinced that a wrong turn was taken with her daughter&#8217;s treatment some time ago.  These beliefs are, as I have found at many previous hearings, deeply entrenched.  Indeed, today once more she has demonstrated that.  </span></p>

She has tried to do so throughout the Court of Protection proceedings, including when seeking to appeal decisions of the Court.  She has made multiple complaints to regulators, professional bodies who govern medical and legal professionals, the Court of Protection, and the police.  She has brought, as I say, multiple appeals against decisions of the Court of Protection, all of which have been dismissed with permission to appeal refused, most certified as totally without merit.  </span></p>

She has not been ignored; rather no one has agreed with her analysis and her description of her daughter&#8217;s position and treatment.  As it happens, her daughter, having previously been detained as an inpatient under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>, has avoided that form of detention and is being cared for at a specialist placement by experienced and caring professionals, I am sure to her benefit as the Court has previously found.  </span></p>

Those changes would be contrary to professional medical opinion, and contrary to her daughter&#8217;s best interests.  These are matters that the Court of Protection has previously considered and concluded.  </span></p>

There are no grounds on which I could proceed on the basis that the Court of Protection, in making the injunctions in June 2023, acted in contravention of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>, or acted in an illegal or corrupt manner.

It is important to be clear as to why the injunction orders were made: they were to protect her daughter, not to persecute her daughter or to persecute Ms MacPherson. FP has rights of her own.  She is an extremely vulnerable individual.  She suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. She does not have capacity to make decisions for herself in relation to a number of decision-making areas. Posting material as the defendant has done, contributes to the difficulties of staff caring for PF &#8211; they are accused of torturing her.

There are benefits in adjourning after a finding of committal before sentencing, not least for a party to take legal advice, and to take steps to mitigate the sentence that the Court might otherwise pass, including, in a case like this, to take down offending material.  However, I am sure, having heard from Ms MacPherson, firstly that she has no intention of removing the posts from the Internet.  What she has said is she is willing to compromise by taking down names for now, but not to remove the offending posts.

She says no-one will take her case. It seems to me that there is very little prospect, particularly as she is in France and intends to remain there, of her trying to obtain legal representation in time for an adjourned sentence hearing, or perhaps at all.  Also, there appears to me to be no medical or other evidence that would assist the Court in relation to sentence that could be made available to the Court prior to sentencing.

She was advised that to do so would be regarded as a contempt of court, and she chose nevertheless to do just that.  She only took those steps after she had moved from England to live in France.  I am satisfied that she thought that by doing so, she would be beyond the reach of the law.  It has been reported to me in evidence today that the defendant has posted further material identifying her daughter on the eve of this hearing.  She continues to show no intention of removing posts which I have found were posted in breach of the injunctive order and in contempt of court.  </span></p>

She did not dispute the fact that the injunction had been made.  Her grounds of dispute were those previously referred to, namely that she considered the injunction itself was illegal or invalid.  I cannot give her full credit for admitting the breaches, but I do take into account the more limited admissions that she has made.  </span></p>

However, it is possible, if it any warrant for committal were executed, that a period of imprisonment would at last cause the defendant to see the error of her ways in breaching clear court orders to the detriment of her daughter.  Nothing else has yet had that effect.</span></p>

The possibility that FP is aware arises from the fact that she does have access to the Internet.  </span></p>

I have to take into account that, realistically, she would have to return to England for any warrant of committal to be executed.  I note that I issued a warrant for her arrest on 7 December 2023, and she has not returned to this country in the meantime, and clearly has no present intention of doing so.  Therefore, for her to commence any sentence of imprisonment would require her to return to this country, in effect. </span></p>

She wants to highlight her complaints about the treatment of her daughter.  She has, for example, I understand, tweeted about the hearing today, no doubt to try and draw attention to herself and her allegations of conspiracy, corruption, and the torture of her daughter.  In many ways, by bringing this committal application, the Local Authority has helped the defendant draw attention to her own position and campaign.  On the other hand, the Local Authority is seeking as best as it can to protect FP, the protected party in the Court of Protection proceedings.  </span></p>

The law applies equally to all, even to those who believe, contrary to all the evidence, that they are conducting a justified campaign.  The defendant has openly and intentionally defied the court in a brazen manner. I cannot allow the defendant to treat herself as beyond the law.  </span></p>

Nothing else would meet the seriousness of the defendant&#8217;s contempt of court.  In this case, given the previous suspended sentence and that the current contempt of court is of an identical kind to the previous contempt, it would not be appropriate to suspend the sentence of imprisonment.  </span></p>
