Taken with the terms of the order of 3 November 2020 the father, and those advising him, cannot have doubted that the local authority would be applying for a summary dismissal of his application for contact at the next hearing before me. Unfortunately, it took some time to translate the social worker&#8217;s statement into Czech, and it was only seen on 24 February 2021 - the day before the hearing - by the father. Further, on Tuesday, 23 February 2021 at the advocates&#8217; meeting counsel for the local authority explicitly stated that at the hearing before me in two days&#8217; time a summary dismissal of the father&#8217;s contact application would be sought. </p>

		      <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;It is important to recognise the nature of the proceedings before Judge Cliffe. These were family proceedings, not ordinary civil proceedings where the function of the judge is in large part to act as the umpire determining the competing cases put before him by the litigants. In ordinary civil litigation the circumstances in which a judge can prematurely stop a case are limited, albeit less limited now in accordance with the Civil Procedure Rules than was once upon a time the case. But these are not ordinary civil proceedings, they are family proceedings, where it is fundamental that the judge has an essentially inquisitorial role, his duty being to further the welfare of the children which is, by statute, his paramount consideration. It has long been recognised &#8211; and authority need not be quoted for this proposition&#8211;that for this reason a judge exercising the family jurisdiction has a much broader discretion than he would in the civil jurisdiction to determine the way in which an application of the kind being made by the father should be pursued. In an appropriate case he can summarily dismiss the application as being, if not groundless, lacking enough merit to justify pursuing the matter. He may determine that the matter is one to be dealt with on the basis of written evidence and oral submissions without the need for oral evidence. He may, as Judge Cliffe did in the present case, decide to hear the evidence of the Applicant and then take stock of where the matter stands at the end of the evidence.&#8221;  </p>

She pointed out that the risk assessment from the local authority sought in the proposed directions has already happened through the medium of the social work statement. The exercise would be entirely repetitious. Further, there is nothing in law which prevents the father from sending to the local authority a letter for the children. It would then be for the local authority to consider, rationally and reasonably, whether to pass that letter on to the children. The father has already filed a statement in accordance with case management directions setting out his case about contact. His proposal now is no more than a second bite of the cherry.  </p>

On balance Mr Singh appeared to favour allowing the case to proceed. This was because he regarded the period of notice that was given at the advocates&#8217; meeting of the intention to seek at this hearing a summary disposal  as not sufficiently long to satisfy the requirement of procedural fairness. However, this view overlooked the fact that summary disposal was clearly prefigured in para 9(b)(ii) of the case management order of 3 November 2020. </p>

It could only refuse to do so if it were objectively and reasonably satisfied that promotion of contact was either not reasonably practicable or was not consistent with the children&#8217;s welfare. Thus, I agree with Ms Cameron-Douglas&#8217;s argument that the relief that is being sought by the father adds nothing to the reasonable expectations which accrue to him from the local authority&#8217;s duty as set out above. </p>

What he needs to do is to write the letter that he says will get the ball rolling. The local authority is then under a public law duty to consider that letter conscientiously and to decide whether to pass it on the children. A really carefully drafted letter written in sensitive and emollient terms, which expresses regret and contrition for the nine-year silence as well as for past misdeeds, might well be difficult to justify rejecting. I would expect that the local authority would wish to take on board the advice of the Guardian before reaching a decision. It could be argued that it would not be reasonable for it to fail to take such advice . </p>
