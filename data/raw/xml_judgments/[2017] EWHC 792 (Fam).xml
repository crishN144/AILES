	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This titanic litigation at last comes on for final hearing: Pauline Chai&#8217;s application for financial remedies against her former husband Dr. Khoo Kay Peng.  For convenience, I will refer to them in this judgment as &#8220;the wife&#8221; and &#8220;the husband&#8221;.  At hearings in March and May of 2014, Holman J &#8216;implored&#8217; the parties to negotiate, saying &#8220;&#8230; it should be so easy to settle this case&#8221;.  Six months later at the end of judgments on estoppel by foreign judgment, jurisdiction and <span style="font-style:italic">forum conveniens</span>, I said: &#8220;&#8230; The combined costs [in this jurisdiction] alone are already about &#163;2.7 million and I urge the parties with all the strength I can muster &#8230;.. to redouble their efforts to reach a financial accommodation.  Whatever the precise extent of the husband&#8217;s wealth, there is enough in the kitty for it to be said with confidence that they would be hard pushed to spend it all in their lifetimes, even if they wanted to.&#8221;   I repeated the same sentiment at the end of one of several maintenance pending suit (&#8220;MPS&#8221;) and legal services provision order (&#8220;LSPO&#8221;) hearings in November 2016, when I said: &#8220;&#8230; There should be a settlement figure now which both parties could live with&#8221; and I urged them again to find a compromise solution.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Those words have fallen on stony ground.  The husband&#8217;s formal open offer dated 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2016 was of &#163;15,000,000 as being a fair settlement on a &#8216;needs&#8217; basis.  The wife&#8217;s counter-offer by letter of 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2016 was that she would accept &#163;520,000,000 as being 50% of an estimated kitty of &#163;1,040,000,000.  It is fair to say that that aspirational estimation of the kitty by the wife was based on allegations by her in respect of the many and complex ways in which she believes the husband has &#8216;warehoused&#8217; assets and failed to disclose the bulk of his wealth.  However, in the interests of retaining this hearing and achieving a decision, she has accepted that she will not pursue the bulk of those allegations.  Be that as it may, the chasm between the open offers of November 2016 reflects the polarised positions which the parties have taken up throughout these proceedings, not only in terms of their respective offers but also in respect of virtually every issue which has arisen: as to estoppel by foreign judgment; jurisdiction; <span style="font-style:italic">forum conveniens</span>; MPS; LSPO for the wife; the choice and instruction of experts; &#8216;freezing&#8217; arrangements; enforcement; whether the husband should be debarred on the &#8216;Hadkinson&#8217; basis, and so on.  So this wasteful and extravagant litigation has continued over the last four years.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A quick run-down the agreed chronology, which itself runs to 45 pages, shows about 35 orders in this jurisdiction, in addition to which there have been numerous orders in Malaysia, where parallel proceedings have been taking place with similar energy and determination.  Each party accuses the other of bad faith, dishonesty and tactical manoeuvring.  The husband says that the wife has been over-zealous and greedy in her litigation approach, making wild assertions.  The wife says that the husband has been obstructive and has failed to give full discovery, thus justifying her wide-angled and combative approach.  Both sides have failed to comply with court orders when it has suited them, whilst expressing righteous indignation when the other party has done likewise.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">With such a mutually combative and litigious approach costs have accrued accordingly.  Although I have capped costs where possible, the court is not able to control how much parties choose to pay their lawyers.  The wife&#8217;s costs of the financial remedy proceedings are &#163;3.78m including VAT and the husband&#8217;s nearly &#163;2.4m excluding VAT (which, not being resident here, he does not have to pay): total &#163;6.18m.  Adding to that the parties&#8217; combined costs of the jurisdiction and forum proceedings (below) of &#163;2.72m, the total costs bill is &#163;8.9m, excluding the costs incurred in Malaysia.  It is as well for both parties that, save for any problems of enforcement, finality can at last be achieved at this hearing.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties have been represented before me as follows: the wife by Mr. Todd QC and Mr. Yates; the husband by Mr. Wagstaffe QC and Miss Sheridan. Three companies which are parties (being companies indirectly owned by the husband) have been represented by Mr. Bheeroo.  They have all put in helpful skeleton arguments and schedules, which they have supplemented in oral submissions.  They have done their best to keep the temperature down in a case of great underlying acrimony and conflict.  Both cross-examinations by leading counsel were skilfully performed and neither of them could have been more persuasive in advancing their respective clients&#8217; wholly polarised cases. I have read a vast amount of information contained in four core bundles and now four Lever Arch files of &#8216;LiveNote&#8217; transcripts.  In addition, there are, I think, six Lever Arch files of appendices to the reports of Andrew Caldwell, the single joint expert (&#8220;SJE&#8221;) instructed to value the husband&#8217;s commercial and business &#8216;empire&#8217;.  There are about 64 &#8216;library bundles&#8217; from which documents have been elevated into &#8216;elevation bundles&#8217; as the case has proceeded.  I have been blessed with three Lever Arch files of authorities.  I have taken oral evidence from the wife; from the parties&#8217; adult daughter D (called by the wife); from the husband and from Mr. Caldwell.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have already mentioned one respect in which the case had outgrown its time allocation for this hearing, namely, as regards the wife&#8217;s wish to pursue multiple complex and interwoven allegations over many years about the husband&#8217;s business affairs.  But there are other respects too in which the hearing has had to be truncated, in the interests of being able to achieve the finality which both parties strongly want.  It was therefore agreed between counsel that their estimated times for cross-examination, submissions and so on would be strictly adhered to and enforced and that many points would therefore have to be left unpursued.  I warned at the beginning of the case (Transcript pages 35 to the top of page 38 and again at pages 347 and 348) that there would be an inevitable downside, in that the outcome might have to be rougher and readier and, in some respects, rather more summary than if enough time had been set up for the case, which I said was measurable in my view in many weeks.  Both sides accepted that situation, which has indeed pertained.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A further consequence of the tsunami of information before me, coupled with the highly adversarial positions which the parties have adopted, is that it has become difficult to see the wood for the trees.  I am conscious of having been drawn into disputes and areas where, if the parties&#8217; approaches had been less tendentious, I would not have needed nor wanted to go.  To try to keep reasonably focused, I need to be selective about the points which I deal with.  I have, however, read and re-read everything (sometimes several times), including the extensive skeleton arguments. I have all the contentious points well in mind and, even if I do not mention them, they have helped me form my thinking.</p>

They are both by origin Malaysian and the husband remains of Malaysian domicile and citizenship.  The wife now has Australian and Canadian citizenship.  They were married in 1970 in Malaysia.  At that time the wife moved into the husband&#8217;s property at 10 Ukay Heights, Ampang, Selangor, Malaysia, which he had bought before the marriage.  They lived there together for the next 10 years, during which time their elder two sons, A and B, were born.  They are now in their mid-40s.</p>

She lived there with the children in a large family home, which is still in the husband&#8217;s name to date, at 1063, Gardenwood Court, Victoria, BC, Canada.  The wife continued to bring the children up there, whilst the husband continued working out of Kuala Lumpur as his business interests expanded.  The family continued to come together one way or the other for visits from time to time.</p>

There is a paucity of evidence about this property, its ownership and how it was used.  But from that time onwards the parties have always had the use of a property in this jurisdiction.  In 1999, the husband became a director of Laura Ashley Holdings PLC.  Three years later he became, in his words, the non-Executive Chairman of it, which he remains (although company documents refer to him simply as the Chairman: Laura Ashley interim report for 2017).</p>

The entire estate comprises a main house with a curtilage of some eight acres (&#8220;the main house&#8221;) surrounded by about 800 acres of land, which is farmed, and some 200 acres of woodland, which is managed.  The precise number of acres is stated differently in different places, but this is unimportant.  The parts of the estate other than the main house are run commercially by Central Point.  It contains a secondary residence, Old Rossway, a large number of rented cottages and tenanted land and it makes a pre-tax net profit of around &#163;180,000 per annum according to the latest accounts before me, being to 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2013.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2001, according to Land Registry form TR1, Central Point transferred the main house at Rossway to another company, Dunross Properties Limited, thereby separating the main house from the commercial part of the estate.  Those two companies between them remain today the legal owners of the Rossway Estate.  A major issue is as to whether or not the beneficial interest in it is held by the husband.  Both companies, Central Point and Dunross, are incorporated in the BVI and are owned 100% by a Hong Kong company, Norcross Limited (&#8220;Norcross&#8221;), which is itself owned 50% by KKP Holdings Sdn Bhd and 50% by Soo Lay Holdings Sdn Bhd (both Malaysian companies).  Those two companies (&#8220;KKP&#8221; and &#8220;Soo Lay&#8221;) are owned 99.98% and 99.99% respectively by the husband.  The wife owns the balance of 0.02% and 0.01% respectively.  Effectively, therefore, the husband owns the companies which own the Rossway Estate.  It is those three companies in the chain of ownership of Rossway (namely, Norcross, Central Point and Dunross) which are the respondents in these proceedings.</p>

As his condition improved and he was able to attend to his business affairs again, she accompanied him on his various travels to different countries.  Both parties agree that the marriage had been under tension for years, but it seems that the stroke brought them together to some extent.  It was not until October 2012 when they were staying at Rossway that the separation occurred.  They were due to return to Malaysia when the wife told the husband that she was feeling unwell and was going to stay on at Rossway.  That is what happened.  The husband returned to Malaysia and the parties did not live together again.</p>

The asserted jurisdictional ground was the wife&#8217;s habitual residence for a period of one year, i.e. from May 2013 to May 2014.  It was common ground that she had lived here from October 2012, so the issue was as to her state of mind and intentions.  By this time, the Malaysian court had ruled (in December 2013) that it was the <span style="font-style:italic">forum conveniens</span> for dealing with the husband&#8217;s divorce proceedings and with the parties&#8217; financial disputes.  So the husband applied to this court for orders dismissing or staying the wife&#8217;s English petition.  After a heavily contested hearing in October 2014, at which I heard eight witnesses, I made findings as follows: (a) that there was no <span style="font-style:italic">res judicata</span> or issue estoppel arising from the Malaysian court&#8217;s decision that it was the <span style="font-style:italic">forum conveniens</span>; (b) that the wife had established her case that she had been habitually resident in this jurisdiction for a year prior to the issue of her May 2014 petition; and (c) that the husband had not succeeded in his application for a stay of the English proceedings on the basis that Malaysia was the <span style="font-style:italic">forum conveniens</span>.  </p>

She and her legal team make no secret of the fact (indeed it is obvious) that this is because Rossway is the only asset within this jurisdiction.  There are Laura Ashley shares here, but they are owned by companies which although ultimately owned by KKP and Soo Lay (and therefore by the husband) are incorporated in respectively Malaysia and the BVI.  The wife&#8217;s Particulars of Claim goes on to assert further civil claims against the husband and his business empire based on contractual agreement, constructive trust, resulting trust and estoppel.  These claims are based on representations allegedly made by the husband before and during the marriage that &#8216;everything I have or earn is ours&#8217;.  Those civil proceedings are heavily defended by the husband and, through solicitors and Counsel, Mr Bheeroo, by the three company defendants, Central Point, Dunross, and their holding company, Norcross Limited (which, as I have said, is itself owned by KKP and Soo Lay and so ultimately by the husband).</p>

These are held within a spider&#8217;s web of inter-related companies.  They are set out in an Organogram attached to the husband&#8217;s Form E in December 2014 (the &#8220;Organogram&#8221;) although he went some way to disavowing this document in his evidence.  The Organogram defies verbal description and only makes sense when considered diagrammatically.  In summary, it contains 26 companies incorporated in respectively Malaysia, Hong Kong, BVI, and Great Britain.  I do not understand it to be disputed that there are other companies which extend below the companies on the Organogram, for example, Banyan Tree Limited and Regent Corporation: but these other entities have not been explored during this hearing much or at all.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The values contended for in respect of the husband&#8217;s business &#8216;empire&#8217; are as follows.  The husband says that the appropriate figure to take is &#163;66.4 million.  This is obtained by taking Mr. Caldwell&#8217;s valuation of the &#8216;empire&#8217; (i) on the basis of the net asset value in the accounts at historical cost and (ii) on the basis that the husband <span style="font-style:italic">does not</span> own Fresh Approach.  On those assumptions, Mr. Caldwell&#8217;s valuation is &#163;86.5 million for the husband&#8217;s business interests.  Extracting from that the value of the Rossway Estate at &#163;18.2 million gross and the value of 10 Ukay Heights at &#163;1.8 million gross, one gets the figure of &#163;66.4 million for the business interests as put forward by the husband.  Adding that to the overall sum for property (&#163;26.8 million) the sum for &#8216;funds&#8217; (&#163;24.7 million) and the sum for pensions (&#163;970,000), one reaches a total of &#163;119 million, which is the total amount at which the husband says I should value the overall kitty. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The wife&#8217;s figure for the value of the husband&#8217;s business empire is &#163;153.3 million.  This is achieved by taking Mr. Caldwell&#8217;s valuation of it on two bases which are different from those taken by the husband: (i) that the valuations of the underlying assets within the Group (or at least a large number of its hotels and other real property in England and Malaysia) should be updated from their historical cost value in the company accounts to an estimate of their 2017 value; and (ii) that the husband <span style="font-style:italic">does</span> own Fresh Approach.  On those two assumptions, Mr. Caldwell&#8217;s valuation of the business empire is &#163;173.5 million.  Extracting the Rossway Estate and Ukay Heights (as before) one is left with &#163;153.3 million for the husband&#8217;s business interests.  Adding to that the same figures as just mentioned for property, &#8216;funds&#8217; and pensions, one reaches a total for the kitty of &#163;205.8 million.  That is the overall figure contended for by the wife.  Thus, the difference between the parties in terms of the value of the kitty (&#163;205.8 million as compared with &#163;119 million) is &#163;86.8 million.  These figures, I should add, may be subject to some latent tax, which is still being ascertained.  I shall revert to and determine this valuation issue below.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The wife, as I say, is aged 70, although, if I may say so, she does not look it.  She left school after A-Levels and lived with her parents before getting married to the husband.  I am not aware that she has ever worked in the sense of &#8216;doing a job&#8217;, although she was to take on the important role of home-making and bringing up the children.  She is a very articulate lady and would, I think, have been quite feisty on occasions in her dealings with the husband.  However, there do seem to be some circumstances in which the husband exercised a more than usual measure of control over her and when she paid him considerable deference.  In this respect, I refer to my jurisdiction and <span style="font-style:italic">forum conveniens</span> Judgment dated 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2014 at paragraph 39.  I there record her e-mailing the housekeeper at Rossway to ask how much food she (the wife) was &#8220;&#8230; allowed to get&#8221; for herself and E.  She enquired, &#8220;What can I eat and what am I not allowed to get?&#8221;  The housekeeper&#8217;s reply set out a limit of &#163;100 a week and identified certain foodstuffs, &#8220;&#8230; like chicken, salmon, broccoli &#8230;&#8221; , which were to be purchased &#8220;&#8230; in moderate quantity&#8221;.    Even bearing this in mind though, I am of the view that the wife&#8217;s case is likely to have become exaggerated with the passage of time when she says (433) that the husband very tightly controlled every aspect of her life.  That case does not sit easily with her case that he consulted her and asked her opinion about various matters, like home and business decisions. </p>

He comes over, if I may say so, as more like his chronological age than she does and there were some occasions during his evidence when I wondered whether he was losing the thread of the question, or of his answer.  I have borne that possibility in mind when evaluating his evidence.  English is, I suppose, not his first language, although from his commercial career and business and other achievements, including his university positions, he must have had to deal routinely in English with a complex range of topics throughout his working life.  When questions were more benign and less probing, he came over as able to cope without apparent confusion, or asking for what were already quite simple questions to be simplified.  He appears a fragile gentleman, physically, and was obviously finding the process very tiring.  I note from his Form E dated December 2014 that: &#8220;&#8230; In 2014, my health has taken a turn for the worse.  I become easily exhausted with work and travel &#8230;&#8221;.  Although much more animated in his answers and demeanour than the wife, the husband was still what I would call inscrutable, in that none of the adversarial questioning appeared outwardly to faze him.  He metaphorically &#8216;came out fighting&#8217; and gave robust and spirited responses to all the questions which Mr. Todd asked of him.  On many occasions, he was very obviously evasive, as a perusal of the Transcript of his evidence shows.  I shall have to come back to that.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The essential plank of Mr. Wagstaffe&#8217;s case is an assertion that the wife is and was a blatant and dishonest &#8216;forum-shopper&#8217; who rigged her living arrangements prior to May 2014 (the date of the relevant petition) so as to be able falsely to achieve jurisdiction in this jurisdiction.  By so doing, it is said that she has created the ability to obtain a much greater award than she would have achieved in Malaysia.  Accordingly, relying on the maxim <span style="font-style:italic">ex turpi causa non oritur actio</span>, or by analogy with it, Mr. Wagstaffe submits that I should award the wife no more than that which she would have received in Malaysia.  Otherwise, he says she would be benefitting from her own dishonesty; and &#8216;forum-shoppers&#8217; in general would be encouraged.   He is expressly not seeking to set aside my conclusions in October 2014 about jurisdiction; nor could he, since the husband&#8217;s appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed, as above.  But he submits that this court&#8217;s role is now inquisitorial and that the wife&#8217;s &#8216;forum-shopping&#8217; can and should be seen as part of &#8220;all the circumstances of the case&#8221; which have to be considered under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">S. 25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>.</p>

What Mr. Wagstaffe cannot do, says Mr. Todd, is to mount a collateral attack on my October 2014 decision, because that decision is either <span style="font-style:italic">res judicata</span> or else the subject of an issue estoppel.  Initially, I have to say I was wholly with Mr Todd on this; but when I reflected on the apparent strength of some of the points which the husband wished to run, I decided, on balance, that to be sure of achieving a just result as between the parties, I should not stop him doing so, even though it would mean the wife being &#8220;vexed&#8221; twice regarding the same point.</p>

On Mr. Wagstaffe&#8217;s case, this report shows that the Malaysian Court would treat this either as a &#8216;one-third&#8217; case, or else as a &#8216;needs&#8217; case.  Hence his point that the wife would have received much less in Malaysia.  Mr. Todd referred to this in opening (73 to 77) when he took me to and we looked at Mr Singh&#8217;s report.  He made the point that the husband&#8217;s interpretation of the report is not accepted on behalf of the wife, since there seemed, according to Mr Todd, no reason why there could not be an asset split in Malaysia of say 51% to 49%.  He said that Mr. Singh would need to say whether such a division would or would not be feasible (76, line 18).</p>

The first report of Mr. Singh was a little surprising, since he appeared to be answering only in the terms of maintenance, saying that a maximum of a one-third apportionment would most likely be awarded to meet the wife&#8217;s reasonable needs.

The fact that the parties fought tooth and nail about this in October 2014 is not to the point.  It may just have been an example of their wishing to disagree about everything possible.  Or they may, like the wife&#8217;s solicitor in a newspaper interview in August 2013, have been of the belief that the Malaysian Courts would be less generous.  But at that stage there was no expert evidence on the point; and now that there is, it seems to support the idea of a &#8216;rough justice&#8217; finding as to fairness, in respect of which the contributions by the non-asset-producing spouse are given due recognition.  At its highest, the evidence of Malaysian law is ambiguous.  Accordingly, on the evidence before me, I do not conclude that a judicial decision in Malaysia would necessarily have been to award the wife any or any significantly less than that which she stands to secure in this jurisdiction.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I address this purely for completeness, in case I am wrong in my conclusion about Malaysian law; but not because I am in any doubt about that conclusion.  Mr. Wagstaffe has put great store on the wife&#8217;s credibility.  He brands her as dishonest and a liar.  He relies on what I accept are the many inconsistencies in her evidence.  Some of those inconsistencies are glaring and come exclusively from her own evidence, such that one would expect a manipulative and dishonest forum-shopper to have made sure they did not arise.  A detailed 29-page Schedule in tabular form was put forward in on the husband&#8217;s behalf during Mr Wagstaffe&#8217;s final speech headed &#8216;Chronology of Inconsistencies&#8217;.  It contains 111 unnumbered boxes.  I have numbered each box.  This produces, for example, box 35 at page 10 beside the date 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2014 and box 72 on page 20 beside the date 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2015.   </p>

As I said having skim-read it during Mr. Wagstaffe&#8217;s submissions, it contains &#8220;&#8230; some good points and some less good points&#8221;.  On further and better perusal, I confirm that point of view.  There is much repetition; some points of pure comment, for example box 66; and some items which do not show any significant inconsistency, for example box 65.  As I read p169 of the Transcript, Box 67 (1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2014) is plain wrong.  Many of the items are trivial: for example, box 68,  about moneys borrowed by the wife from B&#8217;s friend; or, box 69, about whether it was &#163;2,700 that the wife borrowed from D, or only &#163;1,000.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are also in the Schedule several &#8216;jury points&#8217; regarding inconsistencies between the wife&#8217;s case in these proceedings and what she was telling a Canadian tax investigation in 2013.  In that respect I have already held in terms in October 2014 that she was going along with the husband&#8217;s wishes.  Having seen and heard both parties, I confirm that view today and that the husband was also himself at risk of being implicated within the Canadian tax investigation.  That is because it was he who had transferred two tranches of 500,000 Canadian dollars to the wife&#8217;s bank account (for some reason best known to himself) when he wanted to buy a property or properties in Canada.  I find it to be likely that they were complicit in trying to distance the wife from Canada, so as to eliminate or reduce any taxation risk, and that in the process she was essentially taking the lead from him, via the Canadian and Singapore lawyers instructed by him.  I accept that she herself came up with, for example, the golf club in Malaysia as falsely connecting her to Malaysia (when she had not been there for 30 years).  I do not, however, in the circumstances see her inconsistencies in this respect as a strong credibility point against her; certainly no more than the whole episode is a credibility point against the husband.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A further alleged example of the wife&#8217;s asserted dishonesty relates to her immigration status in this country.  The husband says that, if her case on habitual residence in 2014 were right, then she is here illegally, because she has only a tourist visa.  It is said that on coming and going she must have lied to the UKBA.  She has not been able to get a Tier 1 Visa, because the husband has not been willing to advance her the necessary funds.  There has now during this hearing been production of documents by the UKBA following a contested application.  Such documents have, however, turned out not to assist on the question of whether the wife has ever actually misled the UKBA in any way when she has been coming and going.  The matter rests there, with the wife&#8217;s assertion that she has never misled them and has always been allowed into the country.  So there is no credibility point in it for the husband.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That said, the husband&#8217;s &#8216;Schedule of Inconsistencies&#8217; does, as I say, make some very valid points.  I accept, as asserted in boxes 1, 33 and 75, that the wife failed to mention in 35 statements or thereabouts in these and the Malaysian proceedings (those statements being made either by her or on her behalf by her solicitors) that the husband had promised, as she now says, that everything they owned would be held for their joint benefit.  In many places, this is not surprising; but in some cases it might have been expected to have been mentioned.  At box 13 of the husband&#8217;s Schedule it is correctly pointed out that in her Points of Claim, the wife pleads that she became aware of the involvement of Central Point and Dunross in the acquisition of Rossway about six to 12 months after the purchase was completed (i.e. in about 2001); whereas, in her statements of 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2013 and 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2014, she says that until her solicitors recently did searches she understood the property to have been solely owned by the husband.  It is difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile these statements as to her state of knowledge about how Rossway was purchased.  However, it is equally difficult to see what she would have been hoping to gain by being untruthful in the use of either version.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to the wife saying (as she did in October 2014 and has repeated at this hearing) that her motivation for trying to establish jurisdiction in England was &#8216;not financial&#8217;, Mr. Wagstaffe submits that this is simply not credible.  He is now able to rely on a statement of D, to the effect that in or about September 2012 she told the wife, her mother, that she thought it would be a 50/50 split.  However, I do not find this to be probative of dishonesty on the wife&#8217;s behalf.  The conversation with D happened at a time of high emotion for the wife, as I find, and whilst she accepts that she may have had such a discussion with D, she tells me apparently credibly that she does not recall it.  There may have been many motivations coming together to cause her to want to divorce here, not least her belief (which I accept she holds) that the husband is a very powerful figure in Malaysia and her subjective fear (I do not suggest objectively justified) that she would not obtain a fair hearing or just outcome there.  It would not be at all surprising if the hope of a larger award was playing a part in her motivation, contrary to what has said; but I am not persuaded, having seen and heard her, that it was the only motivation; and I do not consider that D&#8217;s evidence impacts significantly on this.  In box 111 of the Schedule reference is made to the wife saying (378) &#8220;&#8230;I happened to be here in England and it was decided we would stay here and this was the place to file for divorce&#8221;.  However, the context relates back to the row which the parties had in December 2012 and this evidence does not suffice alone or in combination to persuade me that the wife&#8217;s case about her habitual residence here from May 2103 onwards was a dishonest construct, as alleged.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The next point relied on for impugning the wife&#8217;s credibility is her channelling of MPS payments to the children.  I accept that in her January 2014 statement, she said that she had spent &#163;1 million of the moneys given her by the husband in May 2013 (above) on &#8220;living expenses for me and E&#8221;.  That was inaccurate, as it was not all spent in that way.  She failed to explain that she had also funded generous treats for various adult members of the family to Dubai, Hong Kong, Florida, Venice, Innsbruck, St. Vincent and Paris, on most of which she did not go herself.  So I accept that her statement was misleading.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At paragraphs 8 to 12 of my Judgment on MPS and LSPO dated 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2016, I set out the sums of money paid across from the wife&#8217;s MPS to the children of the family.  I will not repeat the details here.  Basically, analysis of her bank statements from 2013 by the husband&#8217;s team showed &#163;1.2m going to the children out of MPS paid by the husband of &#163;2.4 million: so, on the face of it, about 50%.  Exhaustive schedules have now been produced by both sides.  It was originally suggested that the wife had covertly and dishonestly &#8220;stockpiled&#8221; these moneys with D, who was shown to have received some &#163;830,000 and who was alleged on behalf of the husband to have been in cahoots with the wife, her mother.  However, on full investigation, that case is now effectively unsustainable.  D produced a witness statement explaining how most of the money was accounted for, along with three lever arch files of her relevant bank statements and those of her husband.  True she did not produce the statements on her business bank account, which she should have done; but she told me she had received advice that this was not necessary.  She did produce those business statements overnight so that the hearing could continue.  I accept what D told me in evidence.  In spite of the fact that she has shown strongly negative views towards her father and has been very supportive of her mother, she was clearly a witness of truth.  It was evident that she was and is not holding money for the wife, and Mr. Wagstaffe rightly did not pursue the previous allegations that she is or was.  The moneys which led to the &#8220;hoarding&#8221; argument have either been spent by way of payments by D on behalf of the wife and for her, the wife&#8217;s, benefit (a good deal of it on security), or else have been otherwise explained, save only as to about &#163;60,000 (according to the husband) or about &#163;18,000 (according to the wife).  I made it clear &#8211; and it is accepted &#8211; that it is not proportionate to continue battling over this very time-consuming issue.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On this point about channelling MPS to the children, therefore, one is left only with a credibility point against the wife and I have already accepted that her answer about spending &#163;1 million in 2013 on expenses for herself and E was a misrepresentation because it was incomplete.  Similarly, her representation of relative poverty to Roberts J in November 2011 was not credible in the light of the income arrangements made for her and of the sums gifted to the children.  It should be noted, though, that the wife did say in her Form E in December 2014: &#8220;&#8230; I have previously contributed to C&#8217;s training as a veterinary nurse as well as supporting her financially during her studies.  I hope to be able to resume this support shortly.  I also provide financial support to E and A on a regular basis and I pay our daughter, D&#8217;s rent on her London apartment in order to provide a safe and welcoming place for E &#8230;&#8221;.  So she was flagging up her wish to support and expectation of supporting the children.  She was corroborated in this by D, who described the wife as a generous mother, always willing to support the children financially whenever they needed it, right from their school days.  Hence, in the last 18 months or so, D has received a benefit of about &#163;100,000 to &#163;150,000 from the wife as &#8216;start-up&#8217; capital for her business (whether by gift or by &#8216;soft&#8217; loan is not greatly relevant) and is having the rent for herself and her husband paid by the wife, their flat being a useful pied-a-terre for the wife and E when in London.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On one view, it is entirely up to the payee to decide how to spend her maintenance.  The court does not &#8216;police&#8217; a payee&#8217;s preference to give an adult child a holiday, rather than buy costly shoes or an expensive handbag.  On the other hand, I am of the view that the duty of full and frank disclosure did require the wife to say how she was spending the money, at least when applying for increases of MPS, as she was certainly doing on occasions.  It would certainly have been sensible to do so, even though it might not have had much influence on quantum, because it would have avoided the expensive investigation which has had to take place to establish that a substantial amount of the moneys diverted to D were spent on her (the wife&#8217;s) behalf.  It is certainly the case that, by August 2014, the husband was being provided with bank statements by the wife and that these, as she said in evidence, showed to a large extent what she was doing with the money.  Moreover, the wife&#8217;s failure to mention that she was spending quite a bit of her MPS on the children is mitigated by her concession from the outset that all MPS and LSPO payments were to be set against her final award.  It seems very likely that, in her mind, she was merely spending her own money as she wished to spend it.</p>

The point is made in the Schedule that it is not included in her statement supporting her application for an injunction in February 2013.  I accept that it is a surprising omission.  However, contrary to the manner in which the wife was cross-examined by Mr. Wagstaffe on instructions, the husband did accept that there had been an incident on Boxing Day 2012, when he was trying to get the wife&#8217;s iPad off her, physically, so as to be able to access it.  I am confident that he (the husband) minimised the incident and that the wife maximised it.  I do not accept that he was holding her and struggling with her for 15 minutes.  But on the other hand, it is clear that the incident was not an invention of the wife&#8217;s, as was first suggested her.</p>

It is right to say that there was a period, between 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September 2012 and 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> August 2014 (the run-up to the jurisdiction hearing), during which the wife spent almost all her time in this country.

These statistics are taken from a graph in Mr. Wagstaffe and Miss Sheridan&#8217;s Skeleton Argument.  The wife explains this decrease in time here by reference to her having been largely in Canada when not here, although there has not been a precise investigation into her movements and other countries may well have been involved.  She expresses great concern for A, who has Tourette&#8217;s syndrome, and who still lives at the former family home in Canada.  She says he has suffered from deep depression after a disagreement with the husband.  She maintains that she has for ages felt intimidated at Rossway in various ways which she, for her part, would trace back to the husband, although this was rightly not investigated.  Hence, she says she has spent less time here.  Be that as it may, Mr. Wagstaffe submits that the graph to which I have referred is the &#8216;graph of a blatant forum-shopper&#8217;.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Pulling the threads together, there is clearly force in the points about the wife&#8217;s credibility and reliability which I have singled out above.  I do not consider that she has been 100% frank throughout in everything she has said and, in my view, she has a tendency to exaggerate.  On the other hand, I have had many days now to observe her in the witness box.  As on the last occasion (paragraphs 7 and 16 of my &#8216;Forum&#8217; Judgment of October 2014, regarding her claim to jurisdiction in her February 2013 petition and her assertion of a joint agreement to move to Rossway in 2009), I am reasonably sure that she has some facility to come to believe, or imagine, that what actually happened is what she has now come to think happened; or, to put it another way, that the truth is that which she would like it to be.  I remain satisfied on the balance of probabilities, as I was in October 2014, that she had been habitually resident here for a period in excess of one year by May 2014, the date of issue of her second petition.  Her independent supporting evidence to that effect (albeit based largely on impressions formed of her and on things said by her) was credible and strong.  Those several witnesses whom I heard and saw were decent church-going people, who did not, in my judgement, come to court to lie in order to give the wife a false case.  The many inconsistencies, which I accept there are, in her evidence do not, individually, nor cumulatively, persuade me that it would be right to re-open that which was judicially determined in October 2014 (and, again, by the Court of Appeal in December 2015) whether (a) by the exercise of a discretion to revisit the subject-matter of an issue estoppel (<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">R Mandic Bozic v.

Mr. Wagstaffe argues attractively, at paragraphs 32 to 41 of his Skeleton Argument, dated 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> March 2017, by analogy with <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Agbaje v.

In support of that argument, he refers to paragraph 77 of my October 2014 judgment (where I said that the connecting factors panned out fairly equally, with a small bias in the wife&#8217;s favour) and he sets out, at paragraph 37 of his Skeleton Argument, why he says the connections with Malaysia are strong.  I do not, however, accept that <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Agbaje</span> adds anything significant to this point.  It turned on Part 3 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984</ref>, whereas this is not a Part 3 case.  I can see that the word &#8220;normally&#8221; in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Radmacher</span> may admit of the possibility of some very exceptional case, where the connections with this jurisdiction (although sufficient to found jurisdiction) are otherwise very much weaker than both parties&#8217; connections with another jurisdiction.  There I can see that a &#8220;sideways look&#8221; might be appropriate, as part of &#8220;all the circumstances&#8221;, when the court is trying to produce fairness in this jurisdiction. Even then, though, the correlation of two perhaps very differing and inconsistent regimes could prove highly problematic.  Here, however, the point does not arise, in my judgement, because whilst the husband&#8217;s connections are all with Malaysia, the wife&#8217;s are not meaningfully with Malaysia at all.  She cut away from that country in 1980 and has not lived there since, except when tending to the husband after his stroke in 2008.  Her home country became Australia, in 1980, and then Canada from 1989 onwards until she came here. From her point of view, there is no justification to take a sideways look at Malaysian law.  It is, therefore, my conclusion that I should not do so. </p>

However, both parties have asked me not to delay this judgment waiting for it to be handed down.  It is clear from reading the husband&#8217;s statements that he had the foresight to see how to make the most of the fact that Malaysia was moving forward from being an economy based, essentially, on the country&#8217;s natural resources, to being the modern, thrusting business economy which it has become and is now.  He was in the right place at the right time and he astutely made the most of it through his business acumen and hard work.  In cross-examination by Mr. Todd (859) however, he accepted that he has never described himself as a &#8216;genius&#8217;.  He agreed that he had not come up with any particular invention, nor done anything particularly innovative in the commercial sphere; but that he had expanded the markets within which, for example, Laura Ashley trades.  He accepted that this would have happened &#8220;&#8230; as a normal development of a multi-national company&#8221;.  It must, I think, usually follow that the harder the entrepreneur breadwinner had to work at his business, the more the responsibility of childcare and domestic infrastructure would have fallen to the home-making wife.  That is particularly so here, where one of the children has Tourette&#8217;s syndrome and the other is on the autistic spectrum.  In the past, the husband has minimised these conditions of the two children concerned, accusing the wife of exploiting E to bolster her case to be in England.  But, as I recorded in my October 2014 Judgment, the seriousness of E&#8217;s condition was established by his consultant psychiatrist, Dr. McPhillips.  His report, dated 9</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:#000000">th</span><span style="color:#000000"> June 2014, describes E&#8217;s syndrome as &#8216;moderately severe&#8217; and as having existed since E was 15.  Dr. McPhillips did not think that E would ever be able to obtain non-sheltered employment in the outside world, nor live independently.</span></p>

He owned 10 Ukay Heights before the marriage, which the wife has said she thinks was worth about &#163;120,000. He also had some land in Malaysia and some shares in MUI.  So far as 10 Ukay Heights is concerned, it became the matrimonial home, after the marriage, for the next nine years.  It is generally accepted that the matrimonial home usually becomes so much a part of the shared family economy as to be swallowed up in the concept of &#8216;matrimonial property&#8217;.  There is no reason to depart from that approach here.  As to the remainder of the husband&#8217;s pre-marriage wealth, it is unquantified and there is no evidence as to what happened to it.  It can only sensibly be assumed that it became mingled with the general family finances.  It is 42 years ago, and a drop in the ocean when compared with the assets now available, on whichever party&#8217;s view of the value of the husband&#8217;s business empire is right.  I am not persuaded that it should be taken into account as reducing what would otherwise be the wife&#8217;s share.</p>

The wife says that it belongs to the husband, or at least that he indirectly controls it through nominee shareholders.  The husband strongly denies this.  It matters, because Fresh Approach owns xx% of the main company, MUI.  The other companies which have shares in MUI all relate back to KKP and Soo Lay and, thus, to the husband.  They are Cherubim Investment (HK) Limited, which owns 10.16% of MUI; Norcross Limited (Hong Kong SAR), which owns 10.24% of MUI; Bonham Industries Limited (BVI), which owns 14.04% of MUI; KKP Enterprises (as distinct from Holdings), which owns 10.38% of MUI; and Pan Malaysia Industries Bhd (Malaysia), which, after a controversial transaction last year, now owns 2.85% of MUI.

However, Fresh Approach would add xx%, such that if it belongs to the husband directly or indirectly, then he would (indirectly, through companies) own yy% of MUI, being a sizable majority of the company, although less than 75%.  MUI, in turn, has a 33.64% indirect share in Laura Ashley Holdings PLC and it also owns Corus Hotels Limited (Great Britain) through two subsidiaries which it wholly owns.  The remaining shares in MUI are owned by multiple investors, small and large, since it is quoted on the Malaysian Bursa.  The percentages of ownership by the companies indirectly owned by the husband is also such that, if he can ensure that Fresh Approach abstains from voting at any meeting, then his other companies (47.67%) would be bound to succeed on any motion, being greater than all the other shareholdings combined.

Unfortunately, it transpires that his solicitors filed and served only an unsigned copy of it and, seemingly, it was never signed by the him.  This led to a whole series of questions and answers, commencing at 677 of the transcript, whereby Mr. Todd was trying to get the husband to confirm that the Form E actually filed (unsigned) was an accurate representation of his, the husband&#8217;s, finances.  The gist of the husband&#8217;s answers was that, if he had not signed it, he could not confirm its truth.  He said he would have to read it all through, which would have taken up a great deal of time allocated to Mr. Todd for his cross-examination.  The skirmishing ran on until page 686, when Mr. Todd drew the husband&#8217;s attention to a letter from the partner of the husband&#8217;s solicitors, Mr. Breakwell, dated 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2014, to the wife&#8217;s solicitors, which reads: </p>

He denied Mr. Todd&#8217;s suggestion that it is he, himself, who exercises that control.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Reverting to the Organogram, it is evident that Fresh Approach is distinguished in three ways from all the other companies there set out: by the fact that it is typed in red, not black; by the fact that it is joined to MUI by a dotted line, not an unbroken line; and by the fact that there is no entity above it.  Why has whoever drafted this Organogram made these distinctions?  Mr. Caldwell said (915 and 916) that quite often, and especially where there is an &#8216;opaque entity&#8217; involved, it may demonstrate that there may be some interest being less than outright ownership.  He was not asked to give an opinion about the other two differences of presentation of Fresh Approach on the Organogram.  It is difficult, without hearing from the draftsman, to interpret exactly why he or she included Fresh Approach in the Organogram in precisely the way it appears; but there it is on the face of a document purporting to set out the husband&#8217;s &#8220;private companies&#8217; shareholding structure&#8221;.  The husband told me at one point in his cross examination (711) that the Organogram was prepared by a &#8216;junior officer&#8217;; but this does not sit easily with his later evidence in re-examination (875), nor with the wording of his draft Form E (B:42), where he says: &#8220;In completing this Form E I have taken advice and have relied on Dr. Damien Lim, my lawyers and I have asked Crowe Harwath, accountants, to verify the document.&#8221;  He described the Organogram in the same paragraph as giving a bird&#8217;s eye view of his private companies&#8217; shareholding structure.</p>

He said this twice at this point, although querying it later.  Subsequently, asked in re-examination to explain what he had meant by Fresh Approach being &#8216;part of the whole [MUI] group&#8217;, he said (879): &#8220;It means they are connected.  Either they sit on the Board of standard [?] companies, or what, but they are known&#8221;.  [sic] [Question mark added].  He repeated: &#8220;&#8230; I know them&#8221;, and that: &#8220;&#8230;they are people of reputation in the town&#8221; (which does not sit easily with his earlier expressed ignorance of any details about Fresh Approach in his answers to Mr Todd at 677).  Quite what the husband meant by these exchanges is not completely obvious.  However, it is difficult, if not impossible, to see what he could have meant if the only role played by Fresh Approach in MUI is that whoever owns the shares (being wholly disconnected from the husband and from the other companies on the Organogram) merely has an independent free-standing interest of xx% in M.U.I., with no other connection or link with MUI.</p>

I look, for example, to page 761 of the transcripts, where Mr. Todd was asking about Cherubim Investments (HK) Limited, which on the Organogram is clearly stated as being 50% owned by KKP and 50% by Soo Lay (both owned by the husband).  The husband was unwilling to accept that he is the ultimate owner of Cherubim, and said that it could be a mistake on the Organogram and that it would be necessary to ask whoever prepared it.</p>

Schedules from his accountants, however, clearly show income coming to him from Banyan Tree, via the company Bonham Industries Limited (BVI) which, according to the Organogram, is owned indirectly 100% by KKP and Soo Lay.  Hence, dividends paid by Banyan Tree appear in his accountants&#8217; schedules as income of the husband.

He said in his answers to a Questionnaire that he had no relationship with the shareholders or directors.  This is inherently unlikely, since the company manages the Estate which the husband effectively purchased: which for the last 16 years he has used free of charge, when in England; and of which, through the chain of corporate ownership set out above, he is the ultimate owner.  Cross-examination revealed that the directors are all well-known to him and that he knows that its assets comprise &#8216;nothing really significant&#8217; (viz &#163;250,000).

In fact, as he accepted in cross-examination (774 to 777) it is owned by one of the companies in the group and it used to be on a Rolls Royce (also owned by one of the companies) available for his use when in this country.  It is now on some kind of van with seats, in which he was brought to-and-fro for the hearing.  Clearly, the personalised number plate has a connection with him, because it has been on vehicles in respect of which he has had free use, and it is owned by a company which either indirectly belongs to him, or else in which he has a direct or indirect interest.

Neither has a clean bill of health as to reliability as a witness.  However, it would have been a quite remarkably devious thing for the wife to do: to assimilate and collate all this accurate information; to produce a false document; to incorporate it amongst other Imerman documents; and then dishonestly to produce it to her solicitors, purporting inferentially that it had been prepared by the husband.  All this would have been done in order to bolster her case about Fresh Approach, in advance of knowing whether the husband was going to disclose it or not at the time of his Form E later in 2014 (as in fact he did).  It would show a dishonest cunning to an extent and degree which, in spite of the criticisms which can justly be levelled at the wife, I have not perceived in her.  The husband, on the other hand, as I have set out, has sought, in his evidence, to adhere to positions which are not or do not appear to be true.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As just mentioned, in deciding the substantive issue about Fresh Approach (whether it is or is not owned or controlled by the husband), I am concerned with the balance of probabilities.  As part of weighing the probabilities, I take into account the unlikelihood of someone in the husband&#8217;s position, and with his status in Malaysia, maintaining a controlling interest in a listed company without disclosing the fact.  The evidence relied on by the wife has to be sufficiently persuasive, therefore, to surmount that unlikelihood.  I have reached the conclusion that it is.  In so doing, I take account most particularly that Fresh Approach appears on the Organogram annexed to the husband&#8217;s Form E and that the Fresh Approach Certificate of Incumbency was similarly so annexed;  I also take account of document 37/G/110 and of the husband&#8217;s evidence that Fresh Approach is &#8216;part of the whole MUI group&#8217;.  I have specifically not taken into account anything I have read on the topic in the press.  I can understand, given the great complexity of the husband&#8217;s business affairs, that he is likely to rely on his staff to put a lot of this material together.  On the other hand, his solicitors&#8217; letter spoke of the care which had been taken over the Form E disclosure and described the Form E expressly as &#8220;approved&#8221;.  The person who could explain how Fresh Approach became incorporated within the husband&#8217;s disclosure is Dr. Lim.  He could say that it was all a mistake and that Fresh Approach should not have been included on the Form E annexures.  He could explain just how it did come to be accidentally included.  But he has neither been called nor has any explanation been given as to why he could not be called.  Nor has the husband&#8217;s nephew been called (a Director of both Fresh Approach and Fresh Properties), who lives in Kuala Lumpur and who could have confirmed the husband&#8217;s asserted lack of any connection with Fresh Approach.  The issue has been flagged up by the wife&#8217;s team for a long time.</p>

On the other hand, the husband told me (876) that he &#8216;glanced&#8217; at the Organogram, and I can only think that he must have done so with insufficient care to notice Fresh Approach&#8217;s inclusion there, or by way of the annexed Certificate of Incumbency.</p>

My judgment, in all the circumstances, is that the husband owns or is to be treated for these purposes as owning Fresh Approach and, thereby, a further xx% of MUI over and above his holding (through companies) already disclosed, so giving him a majority holding in MUI.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At C.E.68 of Mr Caldwell&#8217;s first report, there were two paragraphs which appeared, at first sight, difficult to reconcile.  The first said that there were &#8220;&#8230;. clear indications that property revaluations could have a significant impact on value&#8221; (referring to revaluations of the substantial portfolio of hotels and other properties owned directly or indirectly by MUI); and the second  paragraph read: &#8220;Having said this, it is quite clear that the market is aware of such &#8216;hidden&#8217; value, which suggests that it should already be factored into the current share price&#8221;.  Some time was taken getting clarification of those two sentences.  On the 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2017, Mr. Caldwell wrote to both sets of solicitors to say that, having considered the matter further, he had come to the view that desktop indicative valuations of the underlying hotels and other properties would be desirable in the context of producing more meaningful valuations of the husband&#8217;s business empire.  Back in February 2016, I had in fact directed that if the SJE considered that valuations of such underlying assets were necessary, then the parties should co-operate in arranging them; but for whatever reason, this had not happened.  Mr Caldwell told me (991) that it was when the wife&#8217;s solicitors suggested to him that the Corus Hotel in Kuala Lumpur might have a development value of as much as 2 billion Malaysian Ringgits (c &#163;377m and much greater than book value) that he decided he needed updating valuations.</p>

I warned the wife that this process might run the risk of jeopardising this final hearing.  It is fair to say (and I shall not overlook this when considering discounts at a later stage) that there are four other properties in the MUI group, namely, in Australia, USA, Hong Kong and Singapore of which, in the interests of proportionality, the wife&#8217;s team did not seek updating valuations.</p>

Understandably, it was heavily caveated, for example in respect of lack of time, lack of detailed trading information, lack of inspection (save as regards three London properties) and lack of discussion with management.  Nonetheless, valuations were given by Ian Elliott, the partner in charge of Hotel and Leisure Valuations, to the best of his ability.  These 2017 valuations increased substantially the historical cost valuations appearing in the companies&#8217; accounts, upon which valuations Mr Caldwell&#8217;s report of October 2016 had been based.  That cumulative increase in underlying property valuations created the bulk of the &#163;50 odd million increase appearing in Mr. Caldwell&#8217;s second report dated 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> March 2017.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the outset of the hearing, Mr. Wagstaffe asked me to exclude Mr. Caldwell&#8217;s second report, on the basis that it had come in too late for the husband fairly to deal with it.  The husband, he said, might have wanted to make a <span style="font-style:italic">Daniels v Walker</span> type application for other valuation experts, for example so as to challenge the Knight Frank desktop valuations: but time had not permitted.  There was discussion about this issue between 49 and 62 of the transcripts.  I took account of the fact that the Knight Frank report had been in play since 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2017 and that no questions had been asked of Mr Elliott on behalf of the husband pursuant to the Rules since that time.  Nor was any evidential base put forward on the husband&#8217;s behalf, even on a specimen basis, to suggest that any valuation proposed by Knight Frank might be unreliable, not more so than already covered by their own caveats.  I further bore in mind Mr. Caldwell&#8217;s definitive opinion that updating valuations would help him to give the court the most reliable opinion as to the current value of the husband&#8217;s businesses.  I therefore told Mr. Wagstaffe (339 to 341) that I was at that stage against his application to put out of my mind Mr. Caldwell&#8217;s second report (which was in the core bundle and which I had already read as part of my preparation); but that I would not give a formal ruling to that effect and would be willing to consider his application further, if he raised it, once I was deeper into the case.  He forewarned me (341) that this might lead to an application on behalf of the husband for the entire case to be adjourned.  In fact no further applications were made on behalf of the husband about disregarding Mr Caldwell&#8217;s second report, nor to the effect that the entire hearing should be adjourned.  So I am left in the position of considering the validity of Mr. Caldwell&#8217;s opinion based on the updated valuations of MUI&#8217;s underlying property base.</p>

In summary, his view is based on the fact that the Stock Exchange price is generally geared to or influenced by transactions involving small minority shareholdings.  Such shareholders, he said, tend to be interested in dividend; whereas MUI has not paid a dividend over several years.  So the price tends to be depressed on that basis.  However, MUI has a substantial asset base such that, when one moves &#8216;up the chain&#8217; of shareholders and reaches 46% or more, then the potential exists to access and unlock the sums represented by the underlying asset base.  Looking at it from the perspective of a potential vendor of those higher proportion shareholdings, &#8220;&#8230; they are not willingly going to sell off underlying value without extracting something for it&#8221;.  Mr. Caldwell said that he would expect such shareholdings &#8220;&#8230; to be sold in a way that would maximise the value&#8221;.</p>

It is most unlikely that an astute businessman like the husband would permit his indirect majority shareholding in MUI, amounting as I find to around yy% (as defined at paragraph 76 above) to be sold at listed share prices influenced by an absence of dividend, when he knows full well that the asset base is now greatly increased in value above that contained in the company accounts.  As an example, one particular hotel, which I will not identify here, appears in the accounts at approximately &#163;56 million, but was valued by Mr Elliott (with all his necessary caveats) at &#163;135 million; and the husband himself spoke more in the region of &#163;200 million.  That example is at the extreme end, but it serves to support Mr. Caldwell&#8217;s point.  So I do propose to accept Mr. Caldwell&#8217;s evidence as regards the valuation of the husband&#8217;s business interests as per his March 2017 report at C.E.111 (subject to what I have to say about discounts at paragraphs 136 to 139 below) namely that if the husband owns Fresh Approach (as I have now held he does) the valuation of the business empire is: &#163;173,513,187.</p>

This would leave the husband&#8217;s beneficial interest in the sum of &#163;6.75 million affixed to the chose-in-action comprising Norcross&#8217;s right to enforce the debt of &#163;6.75 million as against Central Point.  But in such circumstances, the husband&#8217;s beneficial interest would not flow through to attach to the Rossway estate itself, as per Mr Todd&#8217;s submission. Mr. Todd also maintained without elaboration that there would have been a &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Quistclose</span> trust&#8217; in the husband&#8217;s favour, but I cannot see that there would have been, nor that it would advance the wife&#8217;s case if there were.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Most important to my mind in all this is the fact that the husband has not chosen to deal in evidence with any of the details in respect of the purchase; and the companies have chosen not to call any evidence at all.  Nor have they given any discovery as I ordered them to do on 16th January 2017 at the Pre Trial Review (paragraphs 13 and 14 of my order at A.B.115).  When I made the point to Mr. Bheeroo that there must somewhere be at least some paper trail about these transactions, he was unable to assist me in any way (1042 and 1043).  It is all very well arguing that, as is the case, the burden falls on the wife to prove her case; but the information here is entirely within the knowledge and custody of the companies and/or the husband, who said he thought that the conveyancing documents were &#8216;held by the banks or something&#8217;.  Yet they have not been vouchsafed.  What is known nevertheless is that the &#163;6.75million used as the purchase price of the Estate was the husband&#8217;s money.  He accepted as much in terms when he gave evidence to me at the October 2014 hearing.  Put to him by Mr. Todd that it was his money, he answered: &#8220;Yes.  All this was purchased with my own money&#8221;, which he confirmed on the following page [Bundle 26:1045 and 1046].</p>

It is inherently unlikely in my experience, where entities are used in this way, that the husband wrote out a cheque to, or otherwise paid Norcross Ltd, which in turn wrote out a cheque to, or otherwise paid Central Point, which then paid the conveyancing solicitors the &#163;6.75m as the consideration for the purchase.   Much more likely is that the husband simply put the conveyancing solicitors in funds using his money (as he accepted it was); that the property was duly purchased from the vendor and placed in the name of Central Point Ltd; and that the company accounts were then so prepared as to state a loan by Norcross Ltd to Central Point Ltd.  </p>

I accept it is established from Land Registry documents [File 12:228-235] that Central Point transferred the property to Dunross for &#163;495,000 and that stamp duty was paid, but there is no evidence at all as to where that money came from, nor to show that it was a mere accounting exercise.  The accounts of Norcross<span style="color:#000000"> Ltd</span> before me do refer to loans to subsidiaries, the subsidiaries being stated as being Dunross<span style="color:#000000"> Ltd</span> and Central Point<span style="color:#000000"> Ltd</span>. But the figure of &#163;495,000 is not identifiable within the sums of money stated.  Likewise in the Dunross accounts, its liability to Norcross is stated as being much greater than &#163;495,000, and so may or may not include the particular sum of &#163;495,000 which the companies&#8217; Defence asserts was lent to Dunross by Norcross.  So again, I am left with no evidence and no proper documentation as to how this &#163;495,000 was raised by or made available to Dunross<span style="color:#000000"> Ltd</span> as the consideration for the transfer of the main house to it (Dunross<span style="color:#000000"> Ltd</span>) by Central Point<span style="color:#000000"> Ltd</span>.  The impact of this was discussed with counsel during their respective submissions (Mr. Wagstaffe at 1221 and 1222 and Mr. Todd at 1329).  Having reflected on the point further and more carefully and in the absence of any evidential help from those who could have provided it, I consider that the appropriate inference is that the same funding arrangement was put into effect by the husband in respect of this second transaction as occurred in respect of the original purchase of the whole Estate, namely, that it was funded by him and not as a lender.  In drawing this inference and on this point generally, I note the further words of Lord Sumption in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Prest</span>, at paragraph 52 where he said: </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Whether assets legally vested in a company are beneficially owned by its controller is a highly fact-specific issue.  It is not possible to give general guidance going beyond the ordinary principles and presumptions of equity, especially those relating to gifts and resulting trusts.  But I venture to suggest, however tentatively, that in the case of the matrimonial home, the facts are quite likely to justify the inference that the property was held on trust for a spouse who owned and controlled the company.  In many, perhaps most cases, the occupation of the company's property as the matrimonial home of its controller will not be easily justified in the company's interest, especially if it is gratuitous.  The intention will normally be that the spouse in control of the company intends to retain a degree of control over the matrimonial home which is not consistent with the company's beneficial ownership.  Of course, structures can be devised which give a different impression, and some of them will be entirely genuine.  But where, say, the terms of acquisition and occupation of the matrimonial home are arranged between the husband in his personal capacity and the husband in his capacity as the sole effective agent of the company (or someone else acting at his direction), judges exercising family jurisdiction are entitled to be sceptical about whether the terms of occupation are really what they are said to be, or are simply a sham to conceal the reality of the husband's beneficial ownership.&#8221;</p>

Whilst the main house at Rossway cannot be described as <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">the</span> matrimonial home, it was undoubtedly <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">a</span> matrimonial home of this family.  This was dealt with at paragraphs 13 to 16 and 44 to 46 of my judgment dated 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2014 on jurisdiction and <span style="font-style:italic">forum conveniens </span>(C.F. 45).  I there recorded that the husband&#8217;s case throughout had been that the Rossway Park Estate was and is just &#8216;a commercial venture, a good investment and somewhere to stay when attending Board meetings in this country&#8217;.  However, I also noted there that the husband himself referred to Rossway as &#8220;home&#8221; in his evidence before me in October 2014; also that in an affidavit of his dated 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2013 in the Malaysian proceedings, he had said: &#8220;&#8230; In October 2012 we went for a holiday in England and we stayed at our home at Rossway Park Estate&#8221;.  Elsewhere in that same statement, he had described Rossway as &#8220;our England home&#8221;.  In the same judgment of October 2014, I mentioned that each of the five children has had a room for them at Rossway and that the housekeeper told me rooms were always kept ready for them should they visit.  I recall that the architect&#8217;s plans actually show bedrooms identified by the children&#8217;s respective names.  The main house was never rented out to third parties, but was kept exclusively for family use.  There is no evidence or suggestion that Dunross<span style="color:#000000"> Ltd</span> made any charge to the husband for the use of it, nor Central Point any charge for the use of the surrounding land.

That, of course, presupposes however that the relevant authorities would be aware of any such beneficial interest.  The alternative viewpoint is that anonymous and complex structures like these allow what is actually beneficial ownership and usage to exist, but below the radar.   I note in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Prest</span> itself, that Moylan J (as he then was) made a finding that the husband&#8217;s purpose had been &#8220;wealth protection and the avoidance of tax&#8221; (per Lord Sumption at paragraph 36): but that the Supreme Court did not thereby consider itself disabled from making findings that the various properties in this jurisdiction were held on resulting trusts for Mr. Prest.  That way his beneficial interests in them were able to be transferred to the wife.</p>

She says that the husband confirmed this agreement on repeated occasions during the marriage, namely that their worldly wealth would be shared equally.  It was in reliance on this, according to the wife&#8217;s pleading, that she agreed to marry the husband and that she subsequently performed &#8220;all those wifely services&#8221; which she did.

Whatever the wife may think she believed now, I do not accept she would have believed it as a young woman happily entering into matrimony, when the relationship was fresh and new.  I note in this context that at D158w in the wife&#8217;s Further and Better Particulars of her Points of Claim, it is pleaded: &#8220;&#8230; it would not have mattered to the wife whether the husband had just one dollar or a fortune, so long as he was willing to share his life with her on equal terms&#8221;.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I will accept, having seen and heard both parties, that there are likely to have been (i.e. were) occasions when the husband said the sort of things which the wife alleges.  However, whether they were said romantically or (later on in the marriage) to smooth over some of the parties&#8217; many arguments, I do not consider that the wife would, at the time, have seriously thought or did seriously think that such remarks were intended to clothe her with enforceable legal rights (and obligations).  I reject the notion that the husband would have intended that, or that the wife would have understood him to do so.  In my judgment there was, to put it more legalistically, no intention to create legal relations; nor (where detrimental reliance is necessary) any detrimental reliance.  One only has to think it through for a moment: Mr. Wagstaffe has demonstrated that the wife disclaimed part of her mother&#8217;s estate in favour of a brother.  How does that work, he asks, if all of each party&#8217;s assets were intended by them to be shared/owned equally?  How trivial would personal assets have to be before one would ignore the all-embracing partnership of equal ownership: A set of golf clubs?  Items of jewellery?  And so on.  It is so vague and unworkable that I cannot countenance the wife having seriously relied on it as a matter of enforceable right, whatever she may have now come to think and believe in the course of this bitter litigation.  Those, then, are my findings of fact in respect of the wife&#8217;s civil claims.</p>

If this were the principle applied in cases like this, then wives would never receive an award, in case they could not enforce it.  In one or two places, the husband said that if the court ordered something he would comply; for example, at 687 and 842.  At paragraph 52 of his case summary of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> March 2017, Mr. Wagstaffe himself wrote that &#8220;&#8230; [The difficulty or impossibility of enforcement] is not to say that the husband proposes to thumb his nose at this court&#8217;s judgment.&#8221;  In short, I do not propose to make any different orders on the ground of possible enforcement difficulties from those that I would consider to be fair and just as between the parties.</p>

Running through them, I think I have covered the ground which they are intended to capture, except perhaps (a) the husband&#8217;s income and (b) the parties&#8217; standard of living.  As to the former, I have found it surprisingly difficult to identify in one place his current gross and net income from all sources.  I propose to content myself with saying that it is very substantial.  For example, he turned out not to be seriously praying in aid any inability to pay the wife&#8217;s MPS and LSPO at the combined rate of &#163;1,320,000 per annum, accepting (as he did) that his occasions of non-payment had been caused because he objected to the quantum.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the question of standard of living, there is the frequently seen performance of the husband tending to minimise it and the wife tending to maximise it.  I have regard to the properties of which they have the use: at 10 Ukay Heights, a fully-staffed property of 12,000 square feet over four floors, with a separate guest wing, swimming pool, gymnasium, sauna and spa, and tennis court; at 163 Gardenwood Court, Canada, a property of 20,000 square feet, set in 10 acres of grounds with (when the house was still the family home for the wife and children) a nanny, housekeeper, personal trainers, a massage therapist, full-time gardeners and employees to maintain the swimming pool, a gym, spa room, theatre, tennis courts, peacocks, waterfalls in the garden, a miniature pony farm, two cottages, a chapel and a 2,000 square foot guest house; at Rossway itself, 15 bedrooms, five of them forming the husband&#8217;s suite, an indoor swimming pool, a gym, a games and billiard room, a cinema, staff quarters, lovely gardens, and two lakes which were constructed for over &#163;100,000.  The wife told me of Rolls Royces, Bentleys and Mercedes vehicles, all with chauffeurs.  She spoke credibly of First Class flights and fine hotels.  From a lot of this, the husband did not greatly dissent, although he did not agree some aspects of it.  Periods of time were put to the wife as to how she was able to manage on greatly less than, for example, the current order for MPS; but I am satisfied that this was because the husband reduced his support for her and that she was just making do.  That is why, as she told me, the Canadian property, in particular, came to look run down (as photographs placed before me show) in that she could not continue with all the necessary maintenance of such a large property.  Taking account of all this, I am satisfied that the standard of living was, as one would expect in a case like this, very high.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Turning, at long last, to the computation of the wife&#8217;s award, I have already determined at paragraph 109 above that the overall &#8216;kitty&#8217;, subject to any further discounting, is in the sum of &#163;205,895,894.   Such further discounts are appropriate, in my judgment, for the following reasons.  The Knight Frank desktop valuation is, as I have said, heavily caveated.  Mr. Elliott explains in his report that where, as here, trading information is not available, hotels are more difficult to value and/or sell, and that the value could well be adversely affected.  He also had to make key assumptions, for example, that there is no deleterious material within the buildings, that they are under competent management and that there is no need for immediate capital expenditure.  With more time, these deficiencies might have been overcome.  But the application made on behalf of the wife for the whole updating valuation exercise was not got on for hearing until 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2017, although the possibility of needing it was flagged up within Mr. Caldwell&#8217;s report of October 2016.  I appreciate the wife&#8217;s case that the absence of information was down to the husband and (whilst this has not been much investigated) I do accept that he was not as co-operative as he could and should have been.  Even so, all these materials going to asset valuation are company materials, not the husband&#8217;s personally.  In spite of his being the Chief Executive of MUI, he may have had difficulties with the rest of the Board, whose CVs I have read (in one of MUI&#8217;s Annual Reports) and who are gentlemen of status in Malaysia (877 to 879).  The Board did, on the face of it, refuse in writing to allow the husband to produce informal valuations in respect of the hotel stock of MUI, even though the husband asked for permission to disclose such valuations far later in the process than he should have done.  In their response to him dated 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2017, the Board relied on certain rules of the Malaysian Bursa restricting the disclosure necessary to provide Mr. Elliott with all the information he would ideally have required; and there is nothing before me to suggest that those restrictions are not genuine.</p>

I also have in mind the substantial measure of illiquidity here and the difficulties which the husband may well have in actually finding a buyer (whether for the MUI shares themselves or, much more likely, for one or other, or perhaps a percentage of the two ultimate holding companies, KKP and Soo Lay, which he owns).  Mr. Caldwell told me that this area of realising the underlying value was not his specialty and there is no evidence before me (ignoring speculation and assertion) as to whether there will be a ready market.  In my view, a further discount of some 20% would be fair, to take account of the factors in this paragraph.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Taking these two broadly-assessed discounts together, I propose to reduce Mr. Caldwell&#8217;s figure for the MUI shares by 30%.  He has stated by e-mail that his figure for those MUI shares is &#163;149,141,079 (being part of the total asset figure of &#163;205,895,894 mentioned above).  30% of &#163;149,141,079 is &#163;44,742,323, which needs to come off the total of &#163;205,895,894, giving a recalculated figure of &#163;161,153,571.  So that is what I hold the ultimate &#8216;kitty&#8217; to be for the purposes of these proceedings.  <span style="font-style:italic">At a hearing on 7</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span><span style="font-style:italic"> April 2017 set up to finalise the Order, I was told that both parties have some further costs which do not appear in the agreed Schedule of Assets, and which will serve to change the overall kitty a little.

For the purpose of this Judgment however, I will retain the figures as per the Schedule of Assets used at the hearing.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having rejected the husband&#8217;s arguments about &#8216;a sideways look&#8217; at Malaysian law, and about pre-acquired wealth, and about special contribution, I can see no reason why the starting point should not be the yardstick of equality.  However, the wife would prefer to have a lump sum rather than shares.  That must be preferable to the alternative of her perhaps facing the difficult and expensive task of having to chase shareholdings halfway round the world; quite apart from the fact that the share transfer option would leave this couple financially linked.  It is a familiar approach to depart from equality of outcome where one party (usually the wife) is to receive cash, while the other party (usually the husband) is to retain the illiquid business assets with all the risks (and possible advantages) involved.  Both sides have put in mini-skeletons on this and provided me with various authorities, which I have considered.  I appreciate Mr. Todd&#8217;s point that the husband is elderly and not in the best of health and so could soon sell up.  But if, as he told me, (645), he does not wish to pack it in yet, it would I think be wrong to approach the division of the wealth in a paternalistic way that it would be better for him if he did.  To try to take account of this difference in the type of the assets with which the parties will be left (which I do not think is double-counting any discounts already applied) I propose to award the wife 40% of the kitty of &#163;161,153,571, namely &#163;64,461,428.  That will be her &#8216;worth&#8217; with which she will leave the marriage.  Some steps in getting to the final amount of the kitty have been very broad-brush and necessarily so; as also my reduction from perfect equality.  But standing back and looking at all the circumstances, especially the nature of the resources, I am entirely satisfied that this outcome is as fair as can be to both parties.  It is, I stress, not intended to achieve precision and any enforcement issues should be addressed in that spirit.  Similarly, the fact that the husband is left with all the business assets (plus only Ukay Heights and the pensions) necessarily means that he may end up worse off or better off than this judgment predicates.  For their own peace of mind going forward, both parties need to realise and accept that what this order creates is finality.  They must not feel the temptation, or if they do they should resist it, to look over their shoulders to see if the other party is doing better or worse than expected.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I propose to transfer to the wife, the husband&#8217;s beneficial interest (as found) in the Rossway Estate and the main house. I did try (890 to 893) at the end of the husband&#8217;s evidence, to put to him the possible merits of agreeing to transfer Rossway to the wife as part of her award (given her wish to stay there) if the award turned out to be higher than its value.  He said he would think about it and I subsequently asked Mr. Wagstaffe (1085 to 1087) to discuss it with the husband, as I am sure he has done, but nothing has come of this.  The transfer to the wife of Rossway will put a monetary value of &#163;17,818,125 net towards her award.  That would leave what would have been a lump sum of &#163;46,643,303.  However, I then need to factor in the wife&#8217;s agreement throughout that all moneys paid to her under the MPS and LSPOs should be on account of her final award.  As per paragraph 37 above that sum is &#163;5,980,000 which, deducted from &#163;46,643,303, leaves a lump sum of &#163;40,663,303.  So, that is the lump sum order which I shall make.  I do not accede to Mr Todd&#8217;s submission to the effect that, since the wife agreed to have all her interim provision credited against her final award, then the same should apply to the husband on the asserted ground that he too has been spending family resources in the interim on his living expenses and legal costs.  That was never agreed, nor flagged up.  If it were to be applied now, it would undermine the basis of how the wife has put her case throughout, which may well have influenced in her favour the several interim provision decisions taken as the case has proceeded.</p>

So in principle, the periodical payments should be reduced pro rata; but I shall leave the detail of this to the parties to discuss when they are drafting the Order.  Further stepped reductions to the periodical payments should be factored into the order to provide for the transfers to the wife of the Canadian and Australian properties and any payments made to her on account of the lump sum.
