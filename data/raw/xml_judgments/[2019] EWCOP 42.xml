The Applicants describe an incident more than a decade ago when X physically attacked P, threatening to kill him and requiring intervention from an armed police team [<span style="font-weight:bold">260</span>]; and numerous acts of violence towards other family members and strangers. They have provided transcripts of voicemail messages left by X for J [<span style="font-weight:bold">217 -221</span>] and H [<span style="font-weight:bold">266 -274</span>], and I have listened to the recordings of a sample of them.  They are exceptionally ugly and oppressive. They focus on demands for money, accompanied by explicit threats to hurt or kill the Applicants, H&#8217;s children or himself. Of course, the Court has not heard X&#8217;s account of these described incidents but the Applicants have also filed evidence of his violent behaviour which is beyond dispute: a copy of a restraining order [<span style="font-weight:bold">223</span>], and confirmation </p>

He is known to have made at least 5 wills, the latest (and therefore current) one some 10 years ago (&#8220;the 2009 will&#8221;). This will included provision for X as a beneficiary of two trusts. In respect of the second trust, P wrote a letter of wishes making clear that the benefit of the trust was primarily intended for X, but a trust structure had been provided because of concerns that outright inheritance would be contrary to his interests. </p>

A draft found on his computer and in his &#8216;to do&#8217; folder suggests that P may have been considering making provision for an outright interest to X. Nothing of that nature was ever concluded however before P&#8217;s stroke intervened. The Applicants&#8217; account is that P would have gone on to take professional advice about his draft will and it is &#8216;inconceivable&#8217; [<span style="font-weight:bold">214</span>] that P would not have imposed a trust structure when he finalised the draft. </p>

There was said (at paragraphs 58 &#8211; 60) to be &#8220;no doubt&#8221; that &#8220;the physical and moral integrity of an individual is covered by the concept of private life. The concept of private life extends also to the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves&#8230;.. While the essential object of Art 8 is to protect the individual against arbitrary action by the public authorities, there may in addition be positive obligations inherent in effective &#8216;respect&#8217; for private and family life and these obligations may involve the adoption of measures in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves&#8230;.Under Art 8 States have a duty to protect the physical and moral integrity of an individual from other persons. To that end they are to maintain and apply in practice an adequate legal framework affording protection against acts of violence.&#8221; </p>

Such is their fear of X&#8217;s behaviour (to P, to themselves, and to members of the wider family) that, if X must be informed of the proceedings, they would withdraw the application.  </p>

Without such dispensation, they would not proceed with the application and P would be deprived of the opportunity of appropriate provision by the court. Partial participation (eg by redaction of addresses) would not assist because X already knows too many of the addresses and contact details of relevant people. On balance, the Official Solicitor concluded that any potential unfairness to P and the Applicants if X has to be served outweighs the unfairness to X of not being served.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.04in">If X is served with or notified of the application, the Official Solicitor supports the Applicants&#8217; request that the papers in respect of this hearing are not disclosed to him, provided that neither the Applicants nor the OS seek to rely in the substantive application on any of the information contained in these papers unless fresh evidence is adduced (which can be disclosed to X) and the final hearing is before a different judge. If there is no requirement to serve or notify X, the OS contends that future hearings should be held in private: though the risk of X finding out about proceedings through a public (but anonymised) hearing may be small, it would undermine the whole purpose of the decision not to serve or notify. However the OS contends that there is no need in such circumstances to &#8216;seal&#8217; any of the documents because, pursuant to rule 5.9, as a nonparty, X would in any event have to apply to the court for permission to see such documents. It is not presently possible to predict all of the reasons why someone, including X, may make such an application and therefore better to leave the decision until the circumstances arise.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.04in">The regard which the court must and does give to matters of procedural fairness is indeed high. Even with &#8216;credible&#8217; and partially corroborated accounts of quite extreme behaviour on the part of X, an application to exclude him completely from proceedings which are brought on a basis that will materially and adversely affect him challenges procedural instincts. If it comes down to balancing unfairness to X of being excluded from proceedings against unfairness to M, H and P of choosing not to pursue proceedings, in circumstances where a capacitous P has already made testamentary provision (albeit not recently), the element of choice is relevant. However, as a result of change to the terms of the application, the court is not required to determine that balancing exercise on this occasion. </p>

	      </authorialNote>. X is therefore not within those categories of person identified at paragraph 9 of PD9E who must be joined as respondent (and therefore served with the application papers.) He is still however within those categories of persons identified at paragraph 5 of PD9B who should be presumed to have an interest in being notified of the application. If he is notified he could of course apply to be joined as party and in any event the Applicants&#8217; fears are engaged. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.04in">The presumption that X has an interest in being notified can be displaced but, in my view correctly, the Applicants have not sought to argue that X&#8217;s position is as envisaged in paragraph 6 of PD9B. Even if X has not seen P recently, he is still P&#8217;s child and the evidence is clearly that, even latterly and after the experience of incidents which form the basis of this application, P wished to make testamentary provision for him. The Applicants&#8217; contention that X should not be informed of the application is not because he is uninterested, but in order to prevent him from expressing his interest inappropriately. </p>

I am satisfied that there is good reason for not making the &#8216;ordinary&#8217; order that future hearings be conducted in public. X&#8217;s interests are not going to be affected by the application, so any evidence heard will relate only to potential provision for others. In those circumstances, even though the evidence of matters on which their fears are  based is untested, I am satisfied that there is need for the court to take an approach which protects P, the Applicants and members of the wider family from the kind of behaviour which has led to imprisonment for breach of a restraining order. The (very real) public interest in open justice can be met by an order permitting publication of this judgment, and future consideration of such an order in relation to any judgment on the substantive application.  </p>
