The allegations made by the local authority against the adults responsible for their care include sexual abuse, failure to protect, physical abuse, and neglect. </p>

Her first two children, now aged eighteen and seventeen, have lived with their father since they were small children. Her third child, a girl, E, was born in February 2002 and is therefore now aged fifteen. She lived with her mother until 2016 but then moved to live with her father in circumstances described below. The mother&#8217;s fourth child, a boy, A, was born in April 2004 and is therefore now aged thirteen. There is no record of his having any direct contact with his natural father who has declined to be involved in these proceedings. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In July 2004, the mother married a man who is, in fact, not the father of any of her children. The marriage lasted for only a few weeks and, according to the mother, ended when she discovered that her husband had committed a sexual offence against her niece. Although the mother and her husband then separated, they remain married. In May 2006, following a relationship with another man, the mother gave birth to her fifth child, a boy, F, now aged eleven. Like E, F has had regular contact with his father and is now living with him in circumstances described below. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In 2005, the mother met another man, X. They started a relationship and, in August 2007, moved into a home together. At that point, therefore, the household consisted of the mother, X, and three of the mother&#8217;s children &#8211; A, E and F. X remained in the family home for the next seven years. Both he and the mother say that he became the father figure to all of the children and that they shared responsibility for looking after the children. Shortly after moving into the property, however, X began to sexually abuse A and continued doing so for several years. He made video recordings of the acts of abuse on his mobile phone. The fact that he abused A, and the extent of that abuse, which included rape, are not in dispute. What is an issue, however, is whether the mother knew, or ought to have known, about the abuse. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In May 2008, the mother gave birth to her sixth child, B, now aged nine. In March 2010, she gave birth to her seventh child, C, now aged seven. X is the father of both of these children. During this period and over the next few years, there were several referrals and complaints made about the family to social services, some from the school and others by anonymous persons. The complaints include allegations of neglect and claims by E that she was being bullied at home. Although various assessments and strategy meetings took place, the local authority took no further action about the family. In May 2012, having carried out a section 47 assessment in respect of E, the local authority identified that further core assessments should be carried out in respect of the other children. It seems that no such assessments were ever completed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In 2012, a teenage boy, W, then aged fifteen, moved into the family household. In his oral evidence, W described meeting X outside the family home when X was working on his car. Subsequently, he visited the house with his father, who lived nearby. Then, after one evening when he had visited the mother and X without his father, he had a row with his own mother who told him to leave. The mother in this case and X offered to put him up. He said in evidence that he intended only to stay for one night but in the event he stayed for several years. Whilst living at the family home, W slept on the sofa or in a spare bed in the boys&#8217; bedroom.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">At some point after W moved in, X started a sexual relationship with him. The fact that a relationship took place is not in dispute, but the date on which it started is not agreed. There is also an issue as to when the mother became aware of the relationship. She says that she was unaware of what was going until she discovered X and W in bed together. X alleges that there was also a sexual relationship between the mother and W. Both the mother and W deny this allegation. Meanwhile, the steady pattern of referrals to social services continued. In particular, the children&#8217;s schools complained about evidence that the children were neglected and being ill-treated at home. It is now accepted by the local authority that its response to these referrals was inadequate. </p>

The police informed social services. On 9 September, X was arrested and a thorough search of the property carried out. During the search, a police officer informed the mother that the police were in possession of intelligence that X had uploaded indecent images of children. She was informed that he would be released from custody later that day on bail but that it would be a condition of his bail that he should have no unsupervised contact with children. </p>

On the same day, F went to live with his father. Subsequently, a child arrangements order was made in respect of F providing that he should live with his father and have contact with his mother.

The officer in the case telephoned her back and explained these conditions in more detail. The mother subsequently signed a written agreement agreeing that she would not allow X to have contact with the children at home. Inexplicably, that agreement has now been lost and there is no precise evidence of its terms. Although she signed an agreement, however, the mother told social services that she did not regard him as a risk to the children. When the children were visited by a social worker at school on 19 September, A and B said that they missed X, wanted to see him and wanted him to come back home. The local authority made arrangements for contact between X and E, A, B and C. Because of the nature of his of alleged offences, he was not allowed to attend a children&#8217;s centre and thus the local authority arranged for contact to take place at the family home, supervised independently.  </p>

Notwithstanding the mother&#8217;s assurances, the local authority continued to receive reports that he was visiting the property. On 17 November, the social services and police visited the property together. During this visit, the mother alleged that the previous social worker had told X that he could attend the property as long as the children were not present. She said that she suspected that her neighbours were making malicious and untrue complaints about X visiting the property. </p>

According to the local authority, XX said that he understood that he would not be able to leave the children alone in the room with X. He said, however, that he did not think that X posed a risk to the children, adding that social care had &#8220;blown all of this out of hand&#8221;, but he told social services that he would stick to the supervision requirements. Following this visit, a further strategy discussion took place to consider the renewed concerns about X visiting the family home and, in addition, about the conditions at the property which were said to have deteriorated after X&#8217;s departure. No further action was taken at that stage and for the next few weeks contact continued to take place as before, supervised at the family home. In the period leading up to Christmas 2014, X and the mother made several requests to social services to arrange contact on Christmas Day, but the local authority declined to make such arrangements. At the start of the next school term, however, B produced a piece of writing about her Christmas holidays in which she stated that she had seen her father at her grandmother&#8217;s house. On 26 January 2015, B told a teaching assistant that she had seen her father the day before. </p>

At this point, the mother told social services that she no longer agreed that X&#8217;s contact could take place at the family home. X again suggested his father as a possible contact supervisor. On 16 April, a family group conference took place to discuss contact arrangements and it was agreed that XX would supervise contact at his home with effect from 21 April. After a preliminary visit, social services agreed and thereafter X had contact with the children at his father&#8217;s home. The local authority now alleges that XX failed to supervise that contact adequately. </p>

The local authority continued to receive anonymous calls alleging that X was having unauthorised contact with the children at the family home.

After a further home visit, the mother agreed not to allow the children to come into contact with Z&#8217;s lodger. During the autumn school term 2015, E, who had become increasingly unsettled at home, made a series of complaints and allegations about her treatment, for example in December 2015 alleging that the mother had shouted at and head-butted her. </p>

The phone had been seized at the time of his first arrest eighteen months earlier but had not been analysed at that stage, apparently because of the huge demand for technical analysis of electronic equipment in other cases. When X&#8217;s phone was finally analysed, it was found to contain a large number of images and videos of X sexually abusing A. Another strategy discussion took place leading to another section 47 investigation. The following day, X was arrested again. X&#8217;s home was searched by the police who seized, amongst other items, a diary belonging to X which disclosed a number of entries about unsupervised and unauthorised contact between him and the children. </p>

It is the local authority&#8217;s case that, given the risk of harm the mother knew to be posed by X, she ought not to have allowed such contact to take place. The local authority relies on a number of specific allegations in support of this finding. In particular, the local authority alleges that the mother allowed A, B, and C to stay overnight with X at XX&#8217;s home when she knew or ought to have known of the risk and further knew or ought to have known that he was effectively unsupervised. The mother denies that she knew X posed a direct risk to the children prior to his second arrest in February 16, but further denies that she allowed any unauthorised or unsupervised contact to take place. She asserts that she relied on the local authority&#8217;s risk assessment with regard to the suitability of XX to supervise the contact. She accepts that the three children did stay overnight at XX&#8217;s home but denies that she knew or ought to have known that X would be present in the property overnight. It is her case that she was told and believed that he would be sleeping in his car. </p>

The local authority draws attention to her association at various times with her husband (to whom she remains married, notwithstanding the fact that they separated over a decade ago), X, and also a man called R, who is regarded as a serious risk to children, having been linked to a large number of families for many years, and who has been involved, on and off, with the mother for much of her life. The local authority relies in particular on evidence that R attempted to re-establish contact with the mother following X&#8217;s departure from the family home and that there has been contact between R and the mother through the internet. It is asserted that the mother does not have sufficient insight into sexually abusive relationships to enable her to protect the children. The mother accepts that she remains married to her husband and is aware of his conviction for sex offences against a child but relies on the fact that she terminated the relationship when she became aware of the allegation against him and has had no contact with him for over ten years. She accepts that she has associated with R and acknowledges that, although he has no criminal convictions, he has been assessed as posing a sexual risk to children. She denies that any of her children have had unsupervised contact with him. She denies that she lacks sufficient insight into sexually abusive relationships so as to prevent her from protecting the children. She adds that she will be willing to undertake further training to help her protect the children in future. </p>

It relies on various allegations made by the children between 2008 and 2011, notwithstanding the fact that the local authority at that time did not take significant steps to protect the children. It is asserted that the mother knew about X&#8217;s behaviour and the risk posed to the children and yet failed to protect them.

It is asserted that, insofar as he was a part of the family from the early months of 2015, he was also culpable for the failure to protect the children from the risk posed by X and others after that date. Z states that he was informed by the mother that A, B and C stayed at XX&#8217;s home but that X would not be present at the property overnight. It is denied that Z knew or ought to have known that X will be present. The local authority further asserts that Z had concerns about the relationship between X and W but failed to take any steps to intervene. In response, Z states that, whilst he thought that the relationship was strained, he had no reason to believe that there was a sexual relationship, or that any sexual abuse was being perpetrated on W, until W told him about the relationship it 2016. The local authority relies further on the fact that Z has been aggressive in an earlier relationship on an occasion when he was intoxicated and in possession of cannabis. Z accepts this allegation. He accepts further that he has smoked cannabis regularly but asserts that he never smoked it in the family home. </p>

He concluded that she was of average cognitive ability, but presented with dyslexia which had a significant adverse impact upon her reading and writing ability. When required to use her literacy skills or oral skills in circumstances when she feels she is under scrutiny, she becomes more anxious so that her cognitive deficits become more pronounced. She has some difficulty comprehending more complex written language and is unable to follow and comprehend long sentences with more complex words. As a result, particular care was taken to ensure that her oral evidence was taken in circumstances that would not put her at a disadvantage.  </p>

The most recent example is her relationship with Z, which started only shortly after the end of her relationship with X, and developed very quickly so that Z started staying overnight in the home within a matter of days. This is but the latest example of a pattern of behaviour stretching back over a number of years.

The number of relationships by itself is therefore a cause for concern. In addition, as Ms Fottrell submitted in closing submissions, central to evaluating the evidence in this case is the mother&#8217;s wider history of relationships and associations with men who either sexually abuse children or present sexual risk to children. It was Ms Fottrell&#8217;s submission that, when her failure to protect their own children from X is considered against the backdrop of her own personal history, a picture emerges of someone who is both incapable of recognising sexual risk to children and disinclined to protect them from such risks.

First, he gave a graphic account of his relationship with X. As described by him, X made determined advances towards him which he was unable to resist, leading to regular sexual activity over a period of years in various locations both at the family home and elsewhere. He described X as an intimidating and frightening man who was frequently angry and on occasions violent. Secondly, he spoke in very warm terms about the mother. Although he firmly denied that there had ever been a sexual relationship between them, or that he had ever sat on her knee or flirted with her as described by other witnesses, it was plain from his oral evidence that he had a high opinion of the mother both as a person and as a mother. Crossexamined by Miss Judd, he said: &#8220;in my eyes she has done nothing wrong, nothing at all&#8221;. Later, when questioned by Mr. Hyde he said he thought she was &#8220;a lovely woman&#8221;, and in answer to questions from the court he described her as &#8220;a brilliant mum&#8221;. Thirdly, he had no concerns about the way in which the children were being looked after. He had no criticism of the mother&#8217;s care. When questioned about allegations of neglect, for example, or the mother&#8217;s treatment of E, he did not endorse the criticisms of the mother.

M in particular was plainly aggrieved at being summonsed to court, but in the event answered all the questions put by counsel. He was plainly extremely angry with his brother because his own children had been left unsupervised with X at XX&#8217;s house. At one point there was a brief exchange of words between them across the court room. M was bitter in his condemnation of the way X had behaved, not only the abuse of A but also what he perceived as his manipulation and exploitation of their father, XX. He was also contemptuous of the mother and what he described as her &#8220;track record&#8221; with men. In view of his strong feelings, I have taken particular care when assessing his evidence, but I am satisfied that he was a truthful witness whose evidence I should accept.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In support of its allegation that the mother knew that X was abusing A and E and that he posed a risk of sexual abuse to all the children in the family home, the local authority relies on the following matters. First it cites the layout of the property which, as demonstrated in photographs included in the court bundle, is a small threebedroom house. For a number of years, several internal doors have been missing in the property. There is an open stairwell and no effective soundproofing. At the time when the abuse was taking place, there were five children living in the house. The mother and X shared one bedroom, E and B shared the second bedroom and A, JF and C shared the third. The local authority asserts that the family was together in the property for most of the time, except when the children were at school. The mother and X shared the responsibility for looking after the children and, as stated by the mother in her police statement, were together most of the time. The evidence of the photographs and videos on X&#8217;s phone indicated that much of the abuse occurred around bath time when, the local authority asserts, the mother and other family members would be present in the property and aware of what was going on. The videos also show A being vocal while he was being abused, protesting about the things that X was trying to do to him. In one video, C&#8217;s voice can be heard talking in the background while abuse is taking place in the bathroom. It is the local authority&#8217;s case that the mother was present on one occasion. The evidence relied on in support of this assertion is contained in one video taken by X of A naked in the bath in which A is heard to say &#8220;you leave me to do all the clearing up again mum&#8221;. Finally, the local authority rely on the observation made by E during her ABE interview that it was &#8220;kinda obvious&#8221; that X was abusing A. </p>

She said that she had noticed this early on and questioned X about it. He had replied that he just wanted to father A because his dad wasn&#8217;t around. The mother said that this behaviour did not make her anxious. She thought that X was &#8220;stepping up to be the father figure A never had.

There are a number of issues between the parties on this aspect of the case, in particular whether the mother was aware of the relationship between X and W, the significance and extent of &#8220;play fighting&#8221; that took place between the three adults, and whether there was a sexual relationship between W and the mother. </p>

As is clear from W&#8217;s own evidence, he came to regard the mother in this case as a substitute mother figure and X as a father figure. The local authority asserts that X abused W&#8217;s trust and established a sexual relationship with him. For a period of years, sexual activity took place regularly between X and W in the property and elsewhere, at various times of the day.

In the early months, it was further stipulated that all contact must be professionally supervised. The local authority relies on evidence of several conversations between the mother on the one hand and police and social workers on the other as to the terms on which such contact had to take place. It is clear that she was present on the morning of the arrest and told by the officer of the stark fact that X was considered to pose a sexual risk to children. The police officer who give evidence at the hearing stated that he returned to the property later that day and explained the risk to the mother again. A few days later, a new social worker visited the property to introduce herself to the mother. When the mother sought to minimise X&#8217;s activity &#8211; asserting that he had told her that he had opened some inappropriate videos and closed them as soon as he realised what they were &#8211; the social worker challenged the mother and said that he had also uploaded images from the internet onto his computer. Subsequently, the social workers and police visited the mother on several occasions, updating her as to the investigation and reiterating the message about the risk. In November 2014, following anonymous referrals that the children were having unsupervised contact with X at the home, a social worker visited and repeated the warning to the mother that she was not to allow X to have contact with the children outside the local authority arrangements. </p>

Ms Fottrell submits that the mother&#8217;s narrative that she was simply following the advice of the local authority when she agreed to contact between the children and X is put forward as an excuse or explanation for her own lack of action or vigilance in respect of that contact; masks her personal responsibility for breaching the supervision agreements; obscures the fact that she did not investigate whether contact was properly supervised, allows her to abdicate responsibility for her own actions and is a blanket explanation for deceiving the local authority, the police and the court as to the frequency and duration of overnight contact between X and children.  </p>

A week after the first arrest, she was recorded as saying that although she was angry with him she still loved him and was not ready to give up on their relationship. A further week later she was recorded as saying that she and X were spending time decorating the children&#8217;s bedrooms. At the end of October there was an allegation that she spoke of having &#8220;date nights&#8221; with X. At Christmas 2014, she pressed for the father to be allowed additional contact on Christmas Day. Ms Fottrell submits that it was the mother who promoted the suggestion of XX as a contact supervisor when it should have been painfully obvious to the mother that XX could not perform the most basic supervision of any activity upstairs in the home. Ms Fottrell acknowledges that there is a real issue as to the failure of the local authority to protect the children but submits that that failure must be viewed separately from that of the mother and did not cause the mother&#8217;s own failure to protect her children. </p>

Miss Judd further contended that there was also uncertainty about an allegation that E had been shut out of the house. Miss Judd also pointed out that none of the children had been interviewed in accordance with the Achieving Best Evidence guidelines in respect of these allegations of violence by the mother. Most of E&#8217;s allegations are now several years old. The local authority investigated at the time and concluded there was no need for statutory intervention.

She describes the evidence of neglectful care in this case as overwhelming. The family home was in poor condition for a number of years, with several internal doors missing, as is evidence from the photographs provided for this hearing, and accumulated rubbish piled in the garden for a number of years. Attempts to persuade the mother to clear the garden were met with a number of excuses. X&#8217;s brother M described the house in his oral evidence as &#8220;a flipping tip&#8221;. Conditions in the home were compounded by the large number of people living there. When W moved in to the property in August 2012, there were eight people living in the three-bedroom property.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The court was presented with a considerable amount of evidence about B&#8217;s problem with head lice. On behalf the local authority, Miss Henke acknowledges that it is common for children of school age to have head lice at one stage or another, but contends that for B this was distressing and prolonged. The court heard evidence from a schoolteacher about the many occasions when B came to school with a large volume of nits plainly visible. Furthermore, it is clear from the evidence of the teachers, which I accept, that B found this acutely distressing, on occasions hiding under the table and refusing to go home because people were saying she had nits. M described how his own daughter had caught head-lice from B. A further acute problem for the school was C&#8217;s soiling difficulties, which continued for several months, and culminated in at least one occasion when he arrived at school on a Monday wearing underpants which he had soiled the previous week and which had apparently been unchanged over the weekend. Overall, the local authority asserts that the lack of care of the children lasted until they were ultimately taken into the care of the local authority in June 2016. At that point, the older three children were noted to be malodorous and wearing ill-fitting clothes. </p>

In assessing the evidence of neglect, Miss Judd invited the court to consider the evidence of the many witnesses who had spoken of the fact that the children are delightful and well-behaved. There were no reports of difficult behaviour in foster care or at school. Miss Judd submits that these positive features must be attributable to the care received from their mother. </p>

She adds that the evidence from the school suggests that the problem had largely abated by the summer of 2015. By the time of the child protection case conference in May 2016, shortly before the children were taken into care, it was reported that B&#8217;s presentation at school had improved. Cross-examined by Miss Judd, B&#8217;s schoolteacher AE conceded that cleanliness in general was not a significant issue for B. It is accepted on behalf the mother that C had an issue with soiling, but it is pointed out that the evidence suggests that this occurred over a relatively limited period, after X left the family home, when the mother was likely to have struggled to care for the children by herself. It is the mother&#8217;s case that by early 2016 the home conditions in the property had improved, a point confirmed by M in crossexamination. In her evidence, the mother accepted that there had been complaints about the state of the garden because of the amount of rubbish there, but added that she had eventually cleared the garden after X&#8217;s first arrest. </p>

Both Miss Henke and Ms Fottrell draw attention to inconsistencies about some of the details of Z&#8217;s evidence concerning his lodger, for example where he slept when the children were staying at the house. One notable piece of evidence about this issue was the explanation given by Z, and supported by the mother, that he had not thought it was up to him to tell her about the lodger&#8217;s offending, but rather leaving it to the lodger himself to do so. </p>

He systematically set about grooming A and W, using similar methods, and his abuse of both boys was of a similar nature and frequency. It was relentless, extreme and profoundly damaging. X has been highly selective about what he says he can remember, and self-serving in everything he says, including the diary. I conclude that he is lying when he says he cannot remember details of his offending. He has been deliberately selective about what he has chosen to share with this court and other professionals.

Given his predilections, it is to my mind extremely unlikely that he would be able to refrain from abusing A when they shared a bedroom at XX&#8217;s home. XX was completely ineffective as a contact supervisor, and I accept M&#8217;s assessment that X intimidated and exploited his father, and that XX would struggle to see what was going on between X and the children.

Similarly, although there is some evidence to suggest that X may have abused C, I do not think it sufficiently clear to support a finding on a balance of probabilities.

The mother emphatically denies it but there is considerable circumstantial evidence to suggest that she may have known what was going on. I acknowledge in particular the small size of the property and the fact that X seems to have been fairly open when photographing A. Perhaps the most striking piece of evidence is E&#8217;s statement to the police officer that it was &#8220;kinda obvious&#8221;. As noted above, E has not given oral evidence and I must be careful to avoid speculating and over-interpreting what she has said. I understand her to mean that it was never discussed that X was abusing A but obvious to her that this was going on. The question is: if it was never discussed, can the court conclude that it was obvious to the mother? I accept that it would be obvious to most people but, as Ms Fottrell observed, the picture that emerges from the totality of the evidence in this case is that the mother is someone who is incapable of recognising sexual risks to children. I looked several times at the video clip from X&#8217;s phone in which A, standing naked in the bath, is heard to say &#8220;you leave me to do all the clearing up again mum&#8221;. I have concluded that the mother was not present when this clip was recorded.

W accepts that he had a crush on the mother, but denies flirting with her. The mother states that W did flirt with her, but denies doing anything to encourage him.

I find that W sat on the mother&#8217;s knee, that she sat on his knee, that she put her arms round him, and that he followed her around &#8220;like a shadow&#8221;. In short, he was besotted with her and she did nothing to discourage him.

After careful consideration, I therefore conclude that the evidence is insufficient to lead to a finding on a balance of probabilities that the mother had a full sexual relationship with W. In my judgment, however, her highly inappropriate behaviour towards him was further serious evidence of her lack of understanding of sexual boundaries, and was in itself abusive behaviour towards a boy whom she was supposed to be looking after. </p>

In its response to the human rights claim brought on behalf of the children by the guardian, the local authority accepts that it failed to properly appreciate or assess the risk X posed the children; failed to convene a child protection case conference following X&#8217;s first arrest; failed to implement a child safety plan which was fit for purpose; failed to make safe contact arrangements between the children and X; failed to carry out any adequate assessment of XX&#8217;s suitability to supervise X&#8217;s contact with the children and failed to assess the risk of him doing so adequately or at all; and failed to carry out any adequate assessment of the mother or her ability to protect the children from the risk posed by X to the children. The local authority accepts that XX was an ineffective contact supervisor and that the children were thus exposed to a continued risk of harm from which they ought to have been protected. In addition, in the light of X&#8217;s behaviour during contact, the local authority accepts that it failed adequately to appreciate the potential for X to use contact to groom the children and wrongly saw his physical touching and interaction with the children as an expression of genuine affection, failing to be alert to the possibility that such behaviour reinforced behaviour learnt at home which might have been abusive. </p>

I accept that at the time the mother expressed some confusion about the bail conditions. I also take into account that, inexplicably, the local authority is unable to produce a copy of the written agreement signed by the mother after the first arrest. But I think it more likely than not that she was told by the police and the social workers about the nature of the material found on the computer and that it was not safe for the children to be left alone with X. It is the mother&#8217;s case that she did not appreciate the risk that X posed to the children after the first arrest. But any mother with an appropriate awareness of sexual risk would have realised that a man in possession of pornographic images of children posed a risk to children. The risk was clearly understood by others, including the fathers of the older children who stopped all contact with X at that point. </p>

She wanted to carry on the relationship and to resume living with X. She plainly invited him to the house when the children were not there and, on a balance of probabilities, I find that she also allowed him to visit the property when they were there. This continued until the mother started a relationship with Z. From April 2015, the father had contact at X&#8217;s house. This unquestionably included unauthorised overnight contact. I find that the mother knew that X was sleeping in the property. I do not accept her evidence that she thought he was sleeping in the car.

E did not repeat the allegations in her ABE interview and did not give oral evidence before me. Such evidence as there is is therefore contained in local authority records and school referrals. For similar reasons, I do not find that the evidence is sufficient to lead to a finding that the children were ever physically assaulted by the mother. The evidence of the children&#8217;s allegations is largely contained again in the local authority&#8217;s records.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">Miss Henke describes neglect as a fundamental failure to achieve the basic requirement of caring for children, adding that, in order to grow into stable adults capable of managing their own lives, children need to be secure that the adults caring for them will keep them safe, reasonably clean, nourish them and ensure they have appropriate clothes and living conditions. I agree. But the level of neglect in this household was not on a scale that is often encountered in care proceedings. The local authority was aware of many of the concerns about the physical care of the children but concluded that they were not on a scale to justify statutory intervention. Had it not been for the local authority&#8217;s eventual realisation of the extent of sexual abuse in the family, it is in my judgment likely the proceedings would never have been started. The extent of the sexual abuse, the level of sexual risk and the magnitude of the failure to protect children from sexual abuse dwarf the features of neglect in this case.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">I do find that children&#8217;s living conditions in the family home were poor. I also find that the mother failed adequately to treat B&#8217;s head lice. I do not accept the mother&#8217;s explanation of B&#8217;s allergic reaction to certain medications as providing a full or reasonable excuse for her failure to tackle the problem. I accept the evidence of school staff that C was sent to school on occasions in soiled underwear, although this seems to have been confined to a relatively short period. I also accept the local authority&#8217;s evidence that, when he arrived in care, J was malodorous and in dirty and ill-fitting clothes. I agree that the neglect, and the consequential shame and indignity suffered by the children, was harmful. Accordingly I do make the specific findings of neglect sought by the local authority, but I repeat that the level of neglect was not on a scale frequently encountered in care proceedings, nor as serious as the level of sexual abuse, and the risk of sexual abuse, that existed in this family. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">In my judgment, the allegation that the mother sought to suppress the truth of what was happening at the house is supported by little evidence of substance. Put at its highest, it adds only marginally to the local authority&#8217;s case. I do not propose to make any findings on this aspect. The most substantial evidence of the mother&#8217;s failure to cooperate with the authorities lay in her failure to comply with the local authority&#8217;s requirement that X should not have any unauthorised or unsupervised contact after the first arrest. In addition, I do not consider that the allegations of drinking or drug use add anything of substance to this case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">I turn finally to the allegations against Z. I agree with Miss Henke&#8217;s description of Z as a rather passive figure. That accorded with my impression of him in his oral evidence. Importantly, however, unlike the mother, who had a startling lack of awareness of sexual boundaries and whose protective instincts are manifestly very limited, I found that Z had an understanding of the need for boundaries and an awareness of sexual risk, but failed in a number of respects to take proactive steps which would normally be expected of someone in his position. He knew of the charges that had been levelled against X after his first arrest. When present during contact, he noticed the way in which A sat on X&#8217;s knee, which, as he acknowledged in cross examination by Ms Fottrell, made him think that A was infatuated with X, and agreed that they had a bond that was closer than that between father and son. He did not, however, challenge the mother about this nor take any other action because, in my judgment, his protective instincts are not sufficiently developed. This is consistent with his attitude other issues &#8211; for example, the play fighting between the mother and </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">In short, I conclude that Z ought to have realised that the children were at risk from X, and taken more active steps to ensure that the children did not have unsupervised contact with him. He has an awareness of the risk of abuse, and the need to take appropriate steps to protect children, but his passive character and his relationship with the mother stopped him intervening. His culpability for failure to protect is not as serious as the mother&#8217;s. It is possible that, with help, he may acquire a greater capacity to safeguard his daughter. There are aspects of his past behaviour which suggest a degree of fecklessness, notably his cannabis habit, but in my judgment these are not so serious as to exclude him as a potential carer for D. Following this fact finding hearing, I anticipate that he will undergo further assessment to test his responses and to establish whether he does indeed have the capacity to care for his daughter. </p>
