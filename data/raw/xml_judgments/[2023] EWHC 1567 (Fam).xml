	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Astonishingly, the wife&#8217;s application for financial remedies was made 21 years ago. Although the claim was resolved by a consent order made in 2004, that order was set aside by Moylan J by reason of the husband&#8217;s non-disclosure in September 2012. That set-aside order was overturned on appeal but reinstated by the Supreme Court on 14 October 2015 (<ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2015/51" uk:canonical="[2015] UKSC 51" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] UKSC 51</ref>).</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The judgment of Lord Wilson sets out in detail the reasons for the extreme delays that  beset this case up to 2015. He recounts how in November 2010, after an 8-week trial in the Crown Court,  the husband was found guilty of laundering money corruptly obtained by Mr Ibori, a state governor in Nigeria, to the tune of &#163;25 million. Following that conviction, the husband  pleaded guilty to further offences, resulting in him being committed to prison in April 2011 for a total of 10 years.</p>

Believe it or not, those proceedings have not yet concluded, although I am told that on 21 July 2023 a perfected judgment containing the relevant factual findings will be handed down and confiscation orders will be made.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although back in 2017 I had indicated that perhaps a way could be found for the same judge (maybe even me) to have heard the confiscation proceedings in the Crown Court in tandem with the wife&#8217;s financial remedy proceedings in the High Court, this was not possible to arrange. Accordingly, there will be a directions hearing before another judge of this Court in September 2023 when a decision will be made for the best way for the wife&#8217;s claim to be determined in the light of the confiscation orders which I am confidently told will have been made on 21 July 2023. If that has happened then it seems to me that the only course that can plausibly be followed is as set out in the well-known case of <span style="font-style:italic">Webber v Webber</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 1 WLR 1052" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 1 WLR 1052</ref> namely that the CPS shall agree, following the making of confiscation orders, not to seek to enforce them pending the determination of the wife&#8217;s claims. Once those claims have been determined it will then be for the wife to apply to the Crown Court to vary the restraint order to allow her financial remedy award to be met. Separately, an application to vary the confiscation order under s. 23 POCA could be brought by the husband, or the CPS or a receiver (but not the wife - see s. 23(1)(b) POCA), but that step would not be essential for the wife&#8217;s purposes.</p>

However, the prohibition on communication of the contents of the draft judgment other than to clients is easily construed as having an injunctive character and so it is possible to infer a prohibition equivalent to that applying in the civil courts. That said, it is obviously highly undesirable that something as important as contempt of court should or could be derived from such ambiguous language.</p>

Written rulings are routinely made and are habitually sent out in draft for typographical and other obvious errors to be corrected. Yet, there is no rule or practice direction which regulates the use of such draft embargoed judgments, and the judgments which are sent out in draft contain no warning rubric at all.</p>

On the other hand, in circumstances where it is now well known that misuse of an embargoed judgment is a contempt of court, it is possible to infer a comparable prohibition to that applying in the KBD. Yet again, it is surely strongly arguable that  someone cannot be guilty of contempt of court for breaching an implied, unwritten, embargo.</p>

It is unacceptable that someone would almost certainly be in contempt of court if she discloses a draft KBD judgment to a journalist; might well not be if she discloses a draft Family Division judgment; but in all likelihood would not be if she discloses a draft criminal judgment. This is an unacceptable example of arbitrariness.</p>
