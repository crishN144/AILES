The hearing to determine the matter on 7 September was understandably adjourned. The determination of this matter is now pressing. Delay is contrary to the welfare interests of the children, a matter I must consider in the context of the overriding objective found in the Family Procedure Rules. Ultimately, however, it is not unjust to proceed to determine this matter at the hearing. The applicant has instructed solicitors and counsel. She had filed a witness statement setting out her evidence and position. The factual matters are not particularly in dispute. The decision whether to make the declarations or not requires legal adjudication of jurisdiction and habitual residence. Ideally, of course, the applicant would have joined the hearing remotely on 16 October, but as I had to hear an urgent matter at 14:00 on the same day, there was no further time to adjourn the matter to resolve whatever technological or other problems had arisen. It was therefore necessary, and not unjust, to refuse a further adjournment of this matter and proceed to make a decision for the children. </span></p>

But, on the other hand, the wrongful removal, if it persists, is a fact that cannot be ignored to such a point as to deprive the authorities of the new State, which has become that of the new habitual residence of the child, of this jurisdiction over protection. </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman'">The difficulty consists therefore in determining the temporal threshold from which jurisdiction would pass from the authorities of the State from which the child has been wrongfully removed, to those of the country to which he or she has been taken or in which he or she has been retained. </span></p>

However, in reliance on Article 16 of the 1980 Convention (which is unaffected by the 1996 Convention) in respect of custody rights, the courts of England and Wales have jurisdiction. I am therefore concerned with whether the French courts may have retained jurisdiction in respect of access rights and any wider issues of parental responsibility which are not included with &#8216;rights of custody&#8217; (see Article 1 of the 1996 Convention). There is plainly an overlap between the exercise of parental responsibility in English law and the 1980 Convention concept of &#8216;rights of custody.&#8217;  The separate definition of &#8216;access rights&#8217; itself demonstrates rights of custody is not the same as the rights that come with the &#8216;zone&#8217; of parental responsibility. This is not surprising in the context where rights of custody form part of the 1980 Convention and fall to be interpreted in the context and purpose of that Convention, which largely focuses on change of residence.  </span></p>

They were habitually resident in France on 18 August 2022. I did not require to determine their habitual residence on 8 August 2023 for the purposes of determining the exceptions relayed upon by the respondent to the applicant&#8217;s return order application. In a summary jurisdiction it is not always helpful to add issues for the court to decide other than those which are strictly necessary. The application for the declarations was issued on 22 August 2023. The hearing of that application took place on 16 October 2023.

I have re-read paragraph 83 of his witness statement in which he describes informing the applicant had he was in England with the children.  The applicant gives evidence she was not provided with details of where in England the children were, but her written evidence does not dispute she knew the children were in England. What then is the meaning of &#8220;whereabouts&#8221; for the purposes of Article 7 of the 1996 Convention? It is not defined. Professor Lagarde&#8217;s report does not appear to cover this topic. I am not aware of any case law on it. The evidence demonstrates that the applicant was aware the children were in England on 19 August 2022 but not that she knew of their exact address.

The applicant acquiesced in X residing here as far back as December 2022. She has attended school in her local area since January 2023, therefore had been at school for two full terms or nearly eight months. She had lived in the UK for just over a year. She has friends and family here. She is integrated into daily life and received her medical care. Her state of mind is also relevant given her age and England is where she wants to be. Her links with France by 22 August 2023 had diminished very considerably. I weigh up carefully the long period of time she lived there and her cultural and linguistic integration into France.  It must also be recorded that her life in France was rather peripatetic with frequent changes of home and school, therefore her rate of integration into England and Wales has been achieved more quickly. Her life in France was peripatetic. She had frequent moves around the country and many different homes. She was not in formal education from around March or June 2021 and the applicant&#8217;s evidence was that she was making arrangements for X to attend school in Switzerland from September 2023, but that if she were returned she would attend school in France instead.  I have no hesitation in concluding that she was habitually resident in England and Wales on 22 August and 16 October 2023. Looking at all the factors the degree of integration into England is much more profound than in France.  With the making of the non-return order her residence in England is significantly more stable.</span></p>

He has attended school in England since March 2023, a considerable period of time. I accept his success and integration into school life and the creation of friends and a wider peer group that his father reports in the written evidence. Whilst he is younger, I also take into account that CAFCASS reported his strong preference to remain in England in June 2023 as evidence of his state of mind (see paragraph 103 of the 8 August judgment). I place some weight on his state of mind, even although he is young. As in respect of his sister, the dismissal of the application for a return order cemented the stability of his residence in England over France. Whilst I am not applying any legal gloss, it removed some uncertainty for Y. I take into account the paucity of links to France and the lack of integration there on 22 August 2023, absent the desire to see his mother. Like his sister, I place weight on the long period of time he lived in France and cultural and linguistic integration, however, his lifestyle there was also peripatetic.  Considering all relevant factual matters, I have little hesitation concluding that on 22 August 2023, Y was habitually resident in England and Wales. It also follows from my factual review of these matters I am satisfied that Y is settled in his environment, which includes the home he lives in, the school he attends and the community/family life he shares with his big sister, father and other wider family members, as the respondent evidences. </span></p>

The Convention does not say the wronged parents must know the address. The address may in any event change. It is important to focus on the purpose of the Convention when considering the interpretation of &#8216;whereabouts&#8217;. The applicant was able to notify English law enforcement authorities and to notify the UK Central Authority of the children&#8217;s  presence in England. That would be sufficient to begin the process of giving effect to the 1980 Convention to seek a return order and certainly a location order application could have been made by her. Therefore, by 22 August 2023, a year had passed and no pending return order was yet to be determined by the courts. I do not consider the fact the applicant may have sought an extension of time to appeal against the non-return order, as having the effect that there remains a pending return order application. Finality in litigation dictates against such an approach.  </span></p>

She made allegations of violence against the father, who was arrested, and Tamara was handed over to her mother. The mother then took Tamara to England without informing the father. On arrival in England she instituted divorce proceedings and obtained an interim custody order and an injunction restraining the father from removing the child from England. The father instituted proceedings under the Convention on the ground that the mother had wrongfully removed Tamara from the State of Ontario. The application came before Hollis J. on 20th June 1991 who found that the mother had wrongfully removed Tamara and ordered her immediate return to Ontario. The mother returned with the little girl. On 22nd November 1991 in the Ontario Court, Provincial Division, sitting in Toronto, Judge Nevins made a consent order that gave the custody of Tamara to her mother. The mother was given the option to live either in Ontario or in England and there were detailed access arrangements for Tamara with her father in Ontario from 1992 onwards to include three weeks in July/August and two weeks in December/January. At the time of this order she was two years old. The mother has settled in England with Tamara and they are living with the maternal grandparents.&#8221;</span></p>

In most cases it may not be necessary for such declarations to be made, but the long procedural history and the unusual facts of this case give rise to this satellite matter. </span></p>
