	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">AB is a 28 year-old woman who has over many years suffered from anorexia nervosa.  She was first diagnosed when she was a teenager of 13 and now has a formal diagnosis of a Severe and Enduring Eating Disorder (&#8216;SEED&#8217;).  She has lived for more than half her life with the increasing and catastrophically debilitating effects of this illness.  All of those treating her recognise that her illness is both chronic and severe.  It is one which has proved impossible to treat with any lasting benefit.  AB&#8217;s weight is now so low and her physical state so fragile that she is at serious risk of death.  She could die at any time from cardiac arrest as a result of the ravages caused to her body by the illness and/or any attempts to deliver the only form of lifesustaining treatment which is now available to her in the form of tube feeding using physical restraint or chemical sedation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In essence, there is only one treatment option available to AB given the significant deterioration in her health and that is to undergo forced nasogastric feeding through the insertion into her stomach of a tube through which liquid nutrients can be delivered.   AB would probably not tolerate this treatment and would probably resist as forcefully as her weakened resources would allow thereby exposing her to a very significant risk of injury given the degree of physical restraint which would be required.  If such physical restraint is to be avoided, AB would need to be heavily sedated throughout the procedure.  Dr B, a consultant psychiatrist who leads the team of treating clinicians caring for AB, told me that if this regime were to have any prospect of success, she would need to be hospitalised as an in patient over at least six months and, because of the risk that AB might pull out the tube, this procedure might need to be undertaken at least twice a day.  It is properly described by her leading counsel, Ms Katie Gollop QC, as a horrific scenario which AB herself cannot contemplate.  Her doctors agree it is not in her best interests.  Whilst I will need to be satisfied that it is not in AB&#8217;s best interests to receive further treatment of this nature before I can grant the declaration which is sought, no one in this case is asking me to impose such a treatment regime on this young woman.  For reasons which I shall explain, and as I assured AB at the conclusion of the hearing last Friday, I am entirely satisfied that it would not be in her best interests to undergo further treatment of this nature.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">An important point needs to be made at the outset.  AB accepts and understands that her life is at risk and that she could die at any point as a result of cardiac arrest, if not eventually of starvation.  She currently weighs only 4 stone (or 25.8 kg).  Her potassium levels are dangerously low and she suffers from a number of different presenting conditions as a result of severe and chronic malnutrition.  These include osteoporosis, oedema (painfully swollen legs), anaemia (low blood count leading to extreme fatigue and tiredness) and unstable blood salts (the result of low potassium levels which expose her to possible heart complications and the risk of a cardiac arrest as well as adding to her debilitating fatigue).  Yet despite all of this, AB sees reason and purpose in what remains of her life.  She is cared for in the home which she shares with her devoted and loving parents.  She acknowledges that her illness is a part of her but she is clear in her written statement which was read to the court that she does not regard it as defining the essence of who she is.  Life, even in the context in which she currently experiences it, continues to bring some pleasure to this young woman.  She is surrounded by those she loves and those who love her (principally her parents, her brother and sister, and their children).  She leads her life one day at a time and she makes the most of each day knowing that one day she may simply not wake up.  Whilst much of her waking day is spent engaging with her treating team both as an out-patient and within the community, there are still activities which bring her much pleasure on a day to day basis.  She places enormous value on the time she spends with her parents even when they are doing simple activities such as watching favourite television programmes together.  She has a number of pets with whom she continues to engage. </p>

It is one which she wishes to own as an aspect of her personal autonomy.  She said this in her statement: </p>

Many, many aspects of it are aspects that I have chosen for myself.  That is what I mean when I say that it is a decision made by me as opposed to my illness. </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">This resonates with the clear evidence I had from Dr B that a coercive feeding regime is now the only treatment option available for AB in the circumstances in which she now finds herself.  The only purpose of such an option would be to re-nourish AB&#8217;s body to the point where she is well enough to engage in psychiatric or psychological therapies.  Her treating team agrees that the advanced effects of her illness are now such that she would not be able or willing to engage in this next stage. Because of the physical and psychological trauma which would be inflicted on this young woman were she to be subjected to a further trial of nasogastric feeding, both they and she are in agreement that she should not receive any further active treatment for her anorexia nervosa.   Each of her parents have agreed that their beloved daughter should not receive any further treatment.  Their love for their daughter is too great to watch her suffer despite the fact that they are aware of the inevitability of the outcome given the path which her illness has taken to date. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">It is now agreed that AB has litigation capacity for the purposes of these proceedings.  Both she and her clinical team agree it would not be in her best interests to receive further medical treatment beyond that in which she voluntarily participates through regular health checks and visits to the hospital and her GP in addition to palliative care when that proves necessary.  The single remaining issue for this court is whether AB has capacity for the purposes of making this decision in relation to her own treatment.  If she does, there is no further role for the Court of Protection.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">This flows from the fundamental principle that a person who has capacity is entitled to decide for himself or herself whether or not to accept or decline medical treatment.  Even treatment which has the potential to save life is subject to that absolute principle and basic human right once a court is satisfied that the person concerned has the capacity to make the decision.  This fundamental right to choose is not limited to situations and decisions which others might regard as sensible. It matters not that the reasons for making the choice are &#8220;rational, irrational, unknown or even nonexistent&#8221;:  see <span style="font-style:italic">Re T (Adult: Refusal of Treatment) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1993] Fam 95" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1993">[1993] Fam 95</ref> at 102 per Lord Donaldson. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">The issue of litigation capacity was raised.  The applicant&#8217;s position was that AB may lack litigation capacity and thus the threshold for the involvement of the Official Solicitor on an interim basis was met although she had not yet formally accepted the invitation to act.  Having spoken to AB prior to the hearing, Ms Gollop QC reported that she was well able to communicate her views about the proceedings in a manner which was thoughtful, intelligent, articulate and insightful.  She was able to appreciate the difference between her ability to instruct a solicitor to represent her views in proceedings about her future treatment and whether or not she should have treatment.  I was told that she had instructed her own solicitor in previous tribunal proceedings concerning her mental heath and had been successful in achieving the discharge of a compulsory treatment order.  She had been judged to be competent to give her consent to the instruction of a medical second opinion and had consented to the disclosure of her medical records for these purposes.  The applicant Trust&#8217;s own evidence in relation to capacity was narrow and restricted.  It is accepted that AB has the capacity to understand, retain and communicate information relating to her condition.  Dr B&#8217;s evidence related only to her inability to weigh and use information in the limited sphere of decisions relating to her need to put on weight.  It was accepted that in all other medical decisions, she had capacity.  She was accepting and compliant of the need to attend weekly blood tests, observations and hospital appointments.   In circumstances where there was no evidence of a related condition such as body dysmorphia or schizophrenia, the Official Solicitor was concerned that the applicant may be making assumptions about AB&#8217;s inability to instruct her own solicitor for the purposes of a final determination of its application. </p>

Whilst this capacity might fluctuate were she to become more gravely ill, he considers that she does not need a litigation friend at the present time. </p>

That would be to put the cart before the horse or, expressed another way, to allow the tail of welfare to wag the dog of capacity.  Any tendency in this direction risks infringing the rights of that group of persons who, though vulnerable, are capable of making their own decisions.  Many who suffer from mental illness are well able to make decisions about their medical treatment, and it is important not to make unjustified assumptions to the contrary.&#8221; </p>

Dr B&#8217;s professional opinion, which is relied on by the Trust for these purposes, is that AB cannot make a decision for herself about her medical treatment because the effect and chronic nature of the severe disease from which she suffers has so infected her ability to use or weigh information as part of the decision-making process that it has disturbed, or impaired, the functioning of her mind or brain in such a way as to render her unable to reach a capacitous decision.   Whilst the Trust accepts that she is perfectly capacitous in relation to some other aspects of decision-making, including her acknowledged ability to instruct her own solicitor, in decisions relating to her anorexia and her obsessive and overriding fixation on reducing her calorific intake to the barest minimum, she has elevated that imperative and those beliefs into &#8220;an overvalued idea&#8221;.  She now follows that imperative to such an extreme level that she is compelled to attach to it an extreme and undue level of weight with the result that she has lost the ability to properly weigh in the balance other factors.

In its severe form it is life-governing and potentially fatal.  In order to stay alive, a human being needs air, water and food.  The normal energy intake for an adult woman is about 2,000 calories a day.  A healthy Body Mass Index (BMI) is between 18.5 and 25.  If the body uses more energy than it gains over a prolonged period, the result is malnutrition, with a global effect on well-being.  The physical consequences can include endocrine disorder preventing the onset of puberty, slow heart rate, low blood pressure, hypothermia, anaemia, reduction in white blood cells, reduction in bone density and reduced immune system functioning.  The social consequences for individuals and their families can be devastating, as they damage or destroy normal social development.  The psychological consequences for the sufferer include a mental life dominated by thoughts of food.  The act of eating is all too easy for most people in developed societies.  But for the sufferer, whose life would be utterly transformed by the most modest food consumption, the ability to eat is seemingly overpowered.  Years are spent thinking and talking about eating, but talking about eating is not the same thing as eating.&#8221; (para 1)  </p>

A sufferer may otherwise appear perfectly rational and may well be able to make entirely appropriate capacitous decisions in relation to a whole range of issues affecting his or her daily life.  As the illness takes a grip on an individual over what may be a number of years, it can, and often will, cause a deficit in capacity specific to issues relating to food and an inability to consume what the body needs because of this fundamental fear.  In a serious case, a sufferer may have a full appreciation that he or she is putting their life at risk; he or she may understand what is required to redress progressing malnutrition; but unless treating clinicians are able to address the underlying psychological causes, the illness and its effects on the sufferer can be completely overwhelming. </p>

By July 2014 she weighed just 35.4 kilograms.  By March 2019 her weight had dropped to 31.3 kilograms. In January 2019 she was discharged after two months in hospital on the basis of a compulsory treatment order (CTO). In June last year, she was recalled to hospital on a further compulsory detention when the CTO was revoked.  By August 2019 it was clear the degree of distress she was suffering when further attempts were made to feed her via a nasogastric tube.  By February this year, she was in significant pain and had been diagnosed as suffering from osteoporosis.  There were concerns regarding her skin integrity which was breaking down.  In May 2020, she was struggling with oedema in her legs which was causing significant pain and affecting her mood, sleep and mobility.  By June 2020, shortly before this application was issued, her weight had dropped to 28.5 kilograms (a BMI of 9.7). </p>

I wondered about interpersonal functions of the illness.  You did not think that it communicates distress to others, nor that it brings others closer.  I explained that nobody plans to have anorexia for the functions that it provides, these happen as a consequence of living with the illness. Moreover, the functions are not always helpful, but the fear of living without them can make it very difficult to consider recovery. &#8230;  I asked what you fear you would lose if you get better.  The most important of these is that you fear that you would not be able to cope with what life will bring you without anorexia, the demands of normal life.

Dr B concluded that this interfered with her ability to make a reasoned decision as to the level of input she was willing to accept in terms of calorific intake.

There was a clear medical consensus that a regime of nasogastric feeding against AB&#8217;s will was entirely contrary to her best interests.  It was, quite simply, physically and psychologically too traumatic for her and there was a clear risk that she may suffer a cardiac arrest as a result of &#8220;refeeding syndrome&#8221;.    Even the suggestion of re-implementing this regime was producing acute panic attacks in AB.  She was exhibiting signs of anorexic hepatitis.  Given the extent of her osteoporosis, there would be an inevitable risk of broken bones if she were to be forcibly restrained during such a process.

The depth of her emotional attachment to, and love for, her parents and close family is transparently clear.  She has a voice and views which she is keen the court should hear.  At the hearing on 7 August, she had prepared a short statement which she wanted to read to the court.  I made a careful note of what she told me.  She read her statement to me sitting next to her father in her family home into which they had both invited me along with Ms Gollop QC and Mr Anderson. </p>

He stressed to me that it was <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> the Trust&#8217;s case that the medical advice it had offered to AB was not being accepted.  Further, this was not a case where the wisdom of AB&#8217;s decision to refuse further tube feeding was the focus of its approach to capacity.  What the Trust relies on in this context is the fundamental impairment of, or disturbance in the functioning of, AB&#8217;s mind or brain.  It is her inability to properly </p>

AB&#8217;s anorexia is thus the causal connection between that functional element of the test and the impairment or disturbance required by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 2(1)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.  The root of her incapacity is her inability to properly weigh the importance of consuming calories as a life sustaining imperative in circumstances where her illness prevents her from accepting the necessity of eating and putting on weight.  Whilst she understands clearly the consequences of what is likely to happen to her and has clearly expressed a wish to continue to live, she is overborne, in effect, by the stronger and much more powerful need to control the nourishment which she allows to enter her body.  It is this inability to carry out any real or effective balancing exercise which renders her incapacitous in relation to issues of feeding, forcible or otherwise.   Mr Sachdeva QC submits this impairment or disturbance in the functioning of her mind or brain goes way beyond using her personal values or outlook when she considers her options.  It strikes at the very heart of her ability to undertake that task.  This, he submits, is what Dr B was referring to when he says in his most recent statement that: </p>

She shows the overvalued ideas that are typical of this disorder &#8211; an over evaluation that being low weight is desirable and that being considered fat is so aversive it is to be avoided at all costs.

Clarity was plainly required although there are other issues in relation to the timing of its application and the speed at which representation has had to be arranged. However, she submits that the issue for the court to determine is: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;Does AB have capacity to decide whether or not to be tube fed ?&#8217; </span>and not <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;Does AB have capacity to make decisions about treatment relating to anorexia nervosa ?&#8217;</span>.  She argues that to frame the question more widely in the second way may be disproportionately restrictive of her personal autonomy.  It would, for example, remove her ability or agency to make decisions about whether to undergo therapy or counselling, or admission to hospital for these purposes as opposed to forcible feeding, or whether to accept injections of dextrose or intravenous nutrition or hydration. </p>

As she says in her written skeleton argument, <span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;The risk that all people suffering from anorexia may be treated as or assumed to be lacking capacity in both regards is real and not theoretical: the applicant&#8217;s initial assumption about litigation capacity demonstrates this&#8230;&#8221; </span>(para 21). </p>

There is a concern that, whilst her current treating team will not force her to have treatment if she does not consent to it, this might not be the position if she were to be admitted to a different hospital on an emergency basis. </p>

She recognises that the consequences for her are likely to be trauma and pain.  Because of her experience of that treatment option (so vividly described in her own words in her statement as I have recorded extracts above), she is using that experience of past trauma and its likely effects upon her as part of the balancing process which is envisaged by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/3/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 3(4)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> (i.e. the reasonably foreseeable consequences of deciding one way or the other or failing to make the decision).  She is also clear that there is no real prospect of the tube feeding resulting in a successful outcome for her in terms of her ability to sustain weight gain in the medium to longer term.  She recognises that she is now so ill that an attempt to tube feed could result in cardiac arrest and death.  This is in direct contradistinction to the applicant Trust&#8217;s approach which says that her use of previous traumatic experience of this treatment is in fact her illness compelling her to avoid weight gain so her reasoning is incapacitous.  Ms Gollop QC makes a distinction between AB&#8217;s wish not to endure further trauma and her avoidance of the option of tube feeding in order to avoid ingesting calories and putting on weight.

I have read, and re-read, all that she has said to me through the two very personal statements which she has prepared.  No one who heard (or reads in this judgment) her account of her experience of tube feeding could fail to be both moved and appalled by its graphic detail.  I recognise fully the effects upon her of that experience.  I understand completely why, even in the context of a life-critical decision, she does not wish to endure further treatment.  I accept that she is aware of the options which are currently available to her and the likelihood that tube feeding is very unlikely now to produce any sustainable benefits.  I acknowledge that she understands the risks of any attempt to restart tube feeding.  In this context she has shown remarkable dignity in her contemplation of a very significantly shortened life expectancy.  Despite all she has endured in the past fifteen years (which is the majority of her life), there is still much which makes her life worthwhile.  She has the love of a devoted family and it is abundantly clear to me from all the material I have read that the unstinting love and support they have provided over the years has been a very precious resource to this young woman in coping with all she has had to endure.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The issue at the heart of this case is the ability of this particular illness in its current presentation in AB&#8217;s case to so infect to such a significant extent the very nature of her decision making processes which are engaged in relation to food, calories and weight gain that any decisions flowing from those processes cannot be considered as legally capacitous decisions.  This is not to introduce any generalisations or circularity of argument into the decision which is now before the court.  I am concerned only with AB, the powerful evidence which she has presented to the court, and the professional views of those charged with the responsibility of caring for her.   I have weighed fully in the balance the fact that she is intelligent, articulate and demonstrates clear insight into some of the aspects of her illness.  She is also a delightful young woman despite all that she has gone through.  That she has managed to retain personal and emotional resilience to the extent she has is humbling to any reader of the chronology of interventions she has endured in the attempts of professionals to reverse the progress of her illness.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Ms Gollop QC reminds me that the opinion of Dr B that AB lacks capacity is based upon the profound effects of her illness which gives rise to a compulsive desire not to put on weight.  To achieve that seemingly irresistible end, she has starved her body of the nutrition which it needs.  Ms Gollop points to the fact that nowhere in her evidence does AB herself cite this as a reason for resisting this final treatment option.  She submits that there are no references in any of the medical records which refer to discussions with her therapists or counsellors about a compulsive desire not to put on weight as the basis of her resistance to forcible tube feeding. This may have informed her submission to me that any compulsion not to put on weight experienced as a direct result of her illness and the impact of any potential mental disorder which may impact on her ability to use and weigh the relevant information &#8211; so far as is demonstrated by all of her reasons &#8211; is &#8216;tangential at best&#8217;. </p>

It seems to me that, given the chronic nature of AB&#8217;s illness and its current clinical presentation, her decisions in connection with food, calorific intake and consequent weight gain are so infected and influenced by her fixated need to avoid weight gain at all costs that true logical reasoning in relation to </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">these specific matters is beyond her capacity or ability.  Whether one calls this an &#8220;overvalued idea&#8221; or the fundamental manifestation of an illness which renders a sufferer powerless to resist a compulsion which, in this case, has proved incompatible with a normal life expectancy seems to me to matter not.  It is the effect on AB which this illness has had which lies at the heart of the decision I have to make in relation to capacity.  She plainly has the ability to use and weigh information about many aspects of the life she currently experiences.  She has very sound and straightforward reasons for not wishing to experience the trauma and pain of further admissions to hospital for the purposes of tube feeding with all that it will entail.  Those reasons are based solidly on her lived experience of previous episodes and the anticipation of being forced to undergo similar trauma on a future occasion.  It seems to me that is different from her ability to respond rationally to the advice which she is being, and has been, given about the overriding imperative to gain weight if her death through starvation or some related cause is to be avoided.  Her judgement in relation to this is critically impaired by an intense and irrational fear of weight gain.  She may objectively appreciate that she will only avoid death in the weeks or months ahead if she finds the ability to overcome this illogical fear but she appears powerless to reach any other decision which will preserve her life.  In my judgment, the fact that she does not want to die and sees many reasons to continue living are, in themselves, the clearest manifestation of the extent to which her judgment is impaired in relation to this narrow field of decision making.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Whilst it has been described as a finely balanced decision by Ms Gollop QC, I have reached a clear conclusion that AB lacks capacity to decide whether or not she should be tube fed.  In my judgment, the applicant Trust has established on the balance of probabilities that the statutory presumption in this case has been displaced. It seems to me that it is unnecessary to go beyond that in terms of the wider aspects of potential treatment for her anorexia.  No other treatments are available or contemplated.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">My finding in relation to AB&#8217;s incapacity will not have the result of requiring her to undergo further tube feeding.  As I promised her at the conclusion of last Friday&#8217;s hearing, that was a course which I was unwilling to contemplate in this case despite the potentially life-threatening consequences of her weight reducing further still.  In this context the wishes and views of the professionals, the family and AB herself are entirely aligned.  No one is suggesting that this is a case where forcible tube feeding or tube feeding under sedation is in AB&#8217;s best interests.  To embark on that course now is likely to be futile and may well precipitate her death in any event.  There is a clear plan moving forwards in terms of the palliative care which will be made available when it is required.  The fact that all parties appear to agree that a declaration that tube feeding under any circumstances would not be in AB&#8217;s best interests does not relieve the court from balancing all the relevant factors and reaching an independent conclusion as to where her best interests lie.  I have done so and endorse such a declaration as being in AB&#8217;s best interests. </p>

I have not attempted to embark on that course in this judgment since I did not hear submissions on these points.  Whilst I will invite counsel to submit a draft of the declaratory relief (if any) which is considered to be appropriate over and above the principal declaration in relation to capacity, it should, where possible, enable AB to make autonomous decisions in relation to the care she is to receive as her illness progresses in accordance with the capacity she is acknowledged to have now in relation to other aspects of her medical treatment.  Whilst I accept that capacity is always subject matter specific and can fluctuate, AB deserves to make her own decisions about the life which she will continue to experience from the love and warmth of her home with her family.   She is quite right to remind me that she has at last found a path for herself.   She wishes to continue along that path living the life she loves for as long as she can and that is what this court would wish for her.  </p>
