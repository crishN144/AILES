	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It will be recalled that, for the reasons set out in that judgment, I ordered the father-in-law to pay the wife&#8217;s costs of what I referred to as the appeal and the application for an injunction, such costs to be assessed if not agreed (paragraph [56]). At the same time I ordered the wife to pay the father-in-law&#8217;s costs of his intervention in the proceedings (other than his costs of the appeal and the application for an injunction), to include his costs of the inspection appointment order made against him on 28 December 2007, such costs also to be assessed if not agreed (paragraph [72]). The order was dated 18 November 2008 and sealed on 3 December 2008. It was common ground that the amount payable by the wife to the father-in-law exceeded the amount payable by the father-in-law to the wife. On the basis of the information I had been given I indicated that the net amount payable by the wife to the father-in-law was of the order of &#163;40,000 (paragraph [36], footnote [1]).</p>

Recording the fact that in the interval between the hearing before me and the handing down of judgment the husband had been declared bankrupt on his own petition, I observed (paragraph [75]) that:</p>

The June 2009 issue of Family Law contained a letter from the wife&#8217;s solicitors complaining that the facts of the case had been &#8220;incorrectly reported in your comments&#8221;, stating that my judgment was &#8220;currently under the appeal process at the Court of Appeal&#8221; and expressing the hope that &#8220;the Court of Appeal will take the opportunity to give advice to the legal profession as to joinder in this area of the law&#8221;: [2009] Fam Law 550.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By then that hope had in fact been dashed. The wife had sought permission from the Court of Appeal to appeal against the order I had made in favour of the father-in-law. Her application came before Wilson LJ on 18 May 2009. He dismissed it in robust terms, as being so &#8220;totally without merit&#8221; as to justify an order under CPR 52.3(4A) that the wife might not request that the decision be reconsidered at an oral hearing. Wilson LJ was scathing in his reasons, referring (paragraph [3]) to &#8220;the ruination of the family already wrought by legal costs of &#163;553,000&#8221; and questioning both (paragraph [3]) the proportionality of an appeal at all and (paragraph [5]) the proportionality of the way in which the application for permission to appeal had been conducted. (I am told, however, that the application for permission to appeal was carried out without cost to the wife.)  It is also to be noted that he recorded (paragraph [2]) the wife&#8217;s case before the Court of Appeal as being that her net liability for costs might be up to &#163;80,000 rather than the &#163;40,000 I had suggested.  </p>

On 28 May 2009, His Honour Judge Kaye QC, sitting as a Judge of the High Court in the Chancery Division and, simultaneously, the Family Division, had before him both the bankruptcy proceedings in relation to the husband and the ancillary relief proceedings. In relation to the remaining monies in the joint account (see paragraphs [11]-[12] of my previous judgment) Judge Kaye sanctioned a compromise providing for the sum of &#163;46,980 to be paid to the husband&#8217;s trustees in bankruptcy and the balance to be paid to the wife&#8217;s solicitors. I understand that the wife received a little over &#163;100,000, all of which has gone in discharging what I am told was a substantial part of her outstanding legal costs, the payment of outstanding school fees (see paragraph [37] of my previous judgment), and payment of some of her outstanding debts. </p>

After discharge of the costs of the sale, the outstanding mortgage and the sum of &#163;52,000 payable to the mother-in-law (see paragraph [44] of my previous judgment), the balance was to be divided equally between the husband&#8217;s trustees in bankruptcy and the wife. The compromise further provided that out of the wife&#8217;s half share there were to be paid the amount required to discharge a liability to a bank, the details of which do not matter for present purposes, and the amount required to discharge the wife&#8217;s indebtedness to her solicitors pursuant to a deferred payment agreement dated 28 November 2008.

Our client does not subscribe to Family Law and if he did, the opinion of Professor Gillian Douglas in respect of his family affairs would no doubt be deemed utterly irrelevant. You may remember that our client did not wish to become a party to the proceeding and it was your client, no doubt acting on legal advice, that caused him to incur such costs.</p>

His application was supported by an affidavit sworn on 3 July 2009 by his solicitor. Having rehearsed the correspondence the affidavit set out how the day before, on 2 July 2009, the father-in-law had discovered that a legal document relating to the sale of the former matrimonial home was to be signed the following day (3 July 2009). Inquiries which his solicitor then made of TBI, the conveyancing solicitors, elicited the information that the wife and the husband were due to sign the contract on 3 July 2009, completion being anticipated to take place on 10 July 2009. The affidavit observed, correctly, that despite the agreed completion date completion could theoretically take place immediately upon exchange of contracts on 3 July 2009.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The draft order put before Singer J was, as Mr Richardson says, in entirely conventional terms. The draft had provided for the wife&#8217;s share of the proceeds of sale to be injuncted, with the qualification that the order would cease to have effect if she provided security in the sum of &#163;50,000 either by paying that sum into court or by another method agreed with the father-in-law&#8217;s legal representatives. The order made by Singer J was in the same terms. The draft order had also provided in the usual way for a return date (paragraph 3) and for costs to be reserved (paragraph 7) to the judge hearing the matter on the return date. At the suggestion of Singer J the provision for a return date was deleted and paragraph 7 was amended to provide that the wife was to pay the father-in-law&#8217;s costs of the application, to be assessed if not agreed. As the note of the hearing records, Singer J was of the view that it would be &#8220;unfortunate&#8221; if there was to be a return date. As Mr Richardson told me, Singer J explained that his concern was to minimise costs &#8211; and in particular to avoid committing the parties to the further costs of a return hearing, when it could potentially be avoided by making a preliminary determination as to costs in what in the light of the correspondence between the parties appeared to be a fairly clear-cut case &#8211; while emphasising that the wife could of course apply to vary the order.</p>

Saying that they had taken counsel&#8217;s advice, they said they were satisfied that the wife had &#8220;every prospect&#8221; of having Singer J&#8217;s order set aside with costs. They suggested that the father-in-law&#8217;s solicitors themselves might &#8220;face a certain amount of difficulty given the fact that that you must now accept that you misled Mr Justice Singer as to certain key facts&#8221;, an allegation that was then amplified together with the related allegation that the father-in-law&#8217;s solicitors had failed to provide Singer J with all the relevant information. Furthermore, it was said, there was no evidence to justify any alleged likelihood of dissipation.

(There is no costs schedule in relation to the hearing before Singer J and I am not invited to make any order in relation to those costs. As Mr Richardson points out, Singer J has already ordered those costs to be assessed if not agreed.) The difference is perhaps explained in part by the fact that the wife&#8217;s solicitor had to travel to the hearing on 22 July 2009 from Harrogate, and her counsel from Leeds, whereas both the father-in-law&#8217;s solicitor and his counsel had to walk only a matter of yards. In part there is a difference in the solicitor&#8217;s charging rates, the wife&#8217;s Grade A solicitor charging &#163;265 per hour plus VAT and the father-in-law&#8217;s Grade A solicitor who had done most of the work charging &#163;220 per hour plus VAT. (This needs to be put in context: some of the work done on behalf of the father-in-law was undertaken by a Grade A solicitor with a charging rate of &#163;280 per hour plus VAT.)</p>

The application for a freezing order, he says, was made without notice because of the concern that, if put on notice, the wife would seek to accelerate the date of completion and the receipt of purchase monies with a view to disposing of them. </p>

In their letter of 9 June 2009 the father-in-law&#8217;s solicitors clearly hinted that, failing satisfaction, they might have to apply to the court; in their letter of 22 June 2009 they said that absent a satisfactory response &#8220;we shall proceed upon the basis your client is unwilling to provide the undertaking that is being sought and invite the Court to conclude that the reason she so refuses is that she intends to defeat any attempt to enforce the judgement&#8221;, adding that the failure of the wife&#8217;s solicitors thus far to respond adequately &#8220;leaves our client at risk and leaves us with little option&#8221; &#8211; which in context could mean only &#8216;little option but to go to court&#8217;; in their letter of 29 June 2009, faced with the <span style="font-style:italic">fact </span>that, for whatever reason, the undertaking seemingly proffered in the letter of 23 June 2009 had not been produced, they spelt matters out very clearly: &#8220;If we do not have a response, then we can only but assume that your client intends to dispose of or otherwise deal with the net proceeds of sale&#8221;. And what was the response? Silence. And, moreover, a silence made all the more worrying because the perfectly reasonable requests for information in their letters of 2 and 9 June 2009 had likewise been met with silence. Is it really surprising that in those circumstances the father-in-law&#8217;s solicitors feared &#8211; and reasonably feared &#8211; the worst? Hardly. And is it to be wondered at that Singer J granted the order? Certainly not. </p>

And why, more particularly, when they received notice of the injunction did they not immediately contact the father-in-law&#8217;s solicitors saying &#8216;this is all getting out of hand, whatever you may have thought there is nothing to worry about, here are our proposals for sorting it out&#8217;? But again, there was merely silence, a silence broken only when on 10 July 2009 the wife applied to have Singer J&#8217;s order set aside &#8211; not on the basis that the father-in-law&#8217;s judgment would be protected in some appropriate way but simply set aside. </p>

The suggestion that the father-in-law and his son were coordinating their litigation strategies in order to put pressure on the wife is simply devoid of any evidential foundation. And the suggestion that if the monies are &#8216;rolled over&#8217; into the purchase of a new house the father-in-law will have no cause to complain, because the monies will not have dissipated, seems to me more attractive in theory than realistic in practice. Is it really to be said that the father-in-law should be put in a position where the only way he can enforce his judgment is by obtaining and enforcing, by order for possession and sale, a charging order on the house in which his grandchildren are living? Surely not.</p>

And they never resiled from that figure. So how can it be said that Singer J was misled? Suppose he had been told, or had spotted, that I had referred in my judgment to the lower figure of &#163;40,000, what then? The simple answer, to which it is impossible to see any effective rejoinder, would have been &#8216;well that may be what Munby J thought last November, but their letter of 23 June 2009 is what matters now, and it shows the wife and her solicitors treating the relevant figure as being &#163;50,000&#8217;. That disposes, in my judgment, of most of the wife&#8217;s complaints. The others seem to me to be neither here nor there.

So how does any non-disclosure there may have been before Singer J affect matters?

So the wife could immediately escape from its toils by securing the agreed sum of &#163;50,000.

And, contrary to what seems to be suggested by the terms of the proposed agreement set out by her solicitors in their letter of 21 June 2009, there is no reason at all why any security she provides in substitution for the injunction granted by Singer J should cease upon a future event &#8211; the final distribution by the trustees in bankruptcy of what may be a sum which is inadequate to meet the wife&#8217;s liability to the father-in-law &#8211; which so far as concerns her liability to him is completely irrelevant.</p>

First, he suggested that it had not been necessary for the father-in-law&#8217;s solicitor to spend 1 hour and 48 minutes considering the wife&#8217;s application and the affidavit in support &#8211; with the consequence, he said, that the sum of &#163;504 (charged at &#163;280 per hour) should be reduced accordingly.
