This procedure, if authorised by the court, is planned for 9 June. The Trust submits these orders are in SA&#8217;s best interests as he appears to remain in pain and discomfort but despite the best efforts of the relevant medical professionals they have not been able to examine SA due to his lack of co-operation, levels of agitation and unpredictable behaviour.</p>

They have been served with these proceedings. SA&#8217;s mother has responded and informed the court that she speaks for both parents. In the documents filed by the mother she does not consent to the proposed treatment and requests the Trust and the court consider whether any treatment SA does have includes a frenectomy. This is not supported by the Trust. They have provided evidence to support their position in relation to the frenectomy. Although given notice and served with all relevant documents the mother has not attended this hearing, or the earlier directions hearing. There is a statement from her, a position statement and a number of emails which I have seen and read.</p>

It was not possible to examine S at that appointment due to the level of his agitation. As no extra swelling was observed no antibiotics were prescribed, it was thought the cause may be a partially erupted wisdom tooth. The plan was to review the position two weeks later.</p>

SA&#8217;s carers reported he held the right side of his face, his right ear and picked at his teeth with his hands. Again it was not possible to examine him due to his level of agitation. Antibiotics were prescribed following a diagnosis of possible wisdom tooth, gum infection or a carious tooth causing an infection. In consultation with the care team it was decided that the only way a full examination could be undertaken was under a general anaesthetic.</p>

The unanimous view of those who attended was that SA lacked capacity. The statements from Dr P and Ms PL describe SA&#8217;s position. Ms PL describes his language level as that of a 2 year old. He understands only very basic commands, he can only make one or two unintelligible sounds and largely communicates by pointing. One record suggests the mother said he would say &#8216;gag&#8217; instead of &#8216;dad&#8217;. His diagnosis of severe learning disability and associated communication difficulties means that whilst he can, at times, follow simple instructions from his care team, he cannot understand more complex information. Due to his needs he has resided in 24 hour residential placements for about 10 years.</p>

Prior to that she had spoken to SA&#8217;s mother twice, but has not been able to contact her following the assessment. In her statement she refers to a letter dated 10 November 2016 from an ENT Consultant which stated that SA had seen two different consultants regarding his tongue tie who explained that since he can project his tongue it would not be in his interests to give him a general anaesthetic to correct his minor tongue tie, although it suggested that could always be done if he required a general anaesthetic at some point.</p>

In her observations Ms RR observed that whilst his tongue tie did limit the range of his tongue movements during the meal she observed his mouth was clean and emptied after he had finished swallowing a mouthful. In relation to his communication she observed SA&#8217;s verbal comprehension is at a single word level, he communicates mainly by pointing at things concluding <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;there was no evidence that SA was trying to produce a significant amount of speech/language that could not be understood because of his tongue tie. SA has a significant learning disability and speech and language disorder that affects his comprehension and expressive language&#8217;. </span> Ms RR concluded &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">From a SALT perspective it is not considered that there would be any real benefit to SA to having his tongue tie cut (frenectomy).  He is eating and drinking well and his communication problems are not likely to be improved by a frenectomy due to the nature of his language difficulties and learning disability.  Although there is some limitation of his tongue movements which may be restricting his ability to clean his teeth with his tongue, any potential risks associated with this are mitigated by SA clearing his mouth after eating drinking well to rinse his mouth of any food debris, using his fingers to remove food debris and being supported to brush his teeth twice daily.&#8217;</span></p>

As regards the benefits of the procedure being done he set out in his statement that this related to possible improvements in speech and feeding. As regards speech he considered in SA&#8217;s particular circumstances, bearing in mind his limited speech, his learning disabilities and his autism he did not consider SA&#8217;s tongue tie impacted on his ability to develop speech. His lack of speech was more likely to be related to his learning disabilities. He also did not consider a frenectomy was likely to improve SA&#8217;s feeding having considered the observations of Ms RR that SA is able to eat foods of most consistencies.</p>

Whilst they both recognised the reference to this benefit in the studies, they both expressed some caution in too much reliance on the studies due to the particular features of the individual studies, SA&#8217;s particular circumstances and the benefits of brushing teeth and eating a healthy diet in managing dental hygiene.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr B&#8217;s statement sets out the risks of a frenectomy procedure. There is the relatively low (less than 1%) risk of significant complications, for example caused by bleeding during and immediately after the operation and the more frequent (around 10%) risks of minor complications such as pain and persisting ulceration. There are also the risks associated with SA&#8217;s inability to comply with post operative management. This concerns the risks from SA interfering with the wound arising from a history of SA picking at his wounds, causing them to become more serious and the difficulties in management, for example caused by SA removing any form of plaster. This has resulted in any wound taking much longer to heal and leaving scars. Mr B&#8217;s concerns centre on the risks of SA provoking bleeding post operatively. Also the possibility of SA removing the stitches with the consequence the healing process would be interrupted and making it likely that chronic ulcers would form which will periodically become infected causing pain and discomfort. If this happened it could also interfere with his ability to brush his teeth, with the consequent risk of dental complications through tooth decay. The risk of post-operative interference was based in part on the evidence from Ms JE, the manager of SA&#8217;s current placement. She described how SA had picked at a relatively small spot on his head that became much worse as a result and was difficult to manage as SA would remove any plaster or dressings. This was not an isolated event as she described SA often picks at his skin.</p>

ENT would then undertake an investigation of the ears to try and identify any source of pain and if any issue is identified (such as a build-up of wax) it would be treated. Then blood samples would be taken. The plan goes on to set out the management of SA's post operative care, initially in the hospital and then by the care team when SA is discharged from hospital. This plan was revised to take into account the additional responses to questions to the medical professionals by the Official Solicitor.</p>

They recognise that due to the circumstances of this case where the cause of pain is unknown and various potential causes are being investigated the risks and benefits of precise treatment options are difficult to set out with any precision.  The Official Solicitor has asked for amendments to the treatment plan that incorporates Dr P&#8217;s response to further questions, where he confirmed that in relation to the dental treatment it is a guiding principle to restore all carious teeth where the caries is deemed not to be too advanced, thereby preserving a functional bite where possible. As Mr Hallin set out in his position statement &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua';font-size:11pt">The Official Solicitor supports the proposals set out in the amended care plan, and is content that the plan strikes the correct balance between affording the treating dentists clinical discretion, whilst endorsing certain principles (such as teeth and bite restoration) that can be said in advance to be in S&#8217;s best interests. The Official Solicitor also supports the proposed ENT investigations and treatment for possible ear pain, which appear uncontroversial and clearly in SA&#8217;s best interests. &#8216;</span></p>

The situation is being led by the circumstances SA is now in. He is likely to be in pain and discomfort which he demonstrates by self-harming behaviour such as hitting the lower right side of his face, hitting his head on a sideboard, picking his teeth and holding the right side of his face and ear. Through the careful efforts of the clinical dental team, led by Dr P, they have tried in different ways to examine SA, with no success due to the level of his behaviour and agitation. Their judgment is there is no other way of undertaking the investigations other than under general anaesthetic. That is the only way they are likely to be able to identify the source of the problem and if they do to treat it. Whilst there are inherent risks in doing that the benefits of being able to establish what the cause of the pain and discomfort are and to treat SA outweigh those risks.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Turning to the issue of whether a frenectomy should be undertaken as well, as the mother requests, I am satisfied that procedure would not be in SA&#8217;s best interests. SA has a good routine of oral hygiene through regular toothbrushing, has a balanced diet and enjoys his food supported by the mealtime plan provided by his carers. Ms RR&#8217;s evidence from her assessment concluded that neither SA&#8217;s communication needs or his functional eating would benefit from that procedure. Whilst there is some evidence that such a procedure could possibly make it easier for SA to use his tongue to clear his mouth of food the research evidence about that benefit was far from clear, it was not supported by the medical professionals who have clinical responsibility for SA and there was no evidence this was a functional difficulty that SA had. The risks arising from such a procedure outweigh any benefits. Whilst there are relatively small risks of significant complications during the procedure the much larger risk, in my judgment, would be how SA would manage the post operative care. Mr B confirmed the wound would be 2cm long, it would take 6 weeks for the pain to settle and sutures to dissolve and 3 months to be fully healed. The advice would be oral analgesia for 2 weeks, regular mouthwash (the evidence was SA was most likely to swallow this) and gentle exercises to help improve tongue movements (which it was thought SA would struggle to do). The evidence from Ms JE the care manager and Ms PL is that SA has a habit of picking at wounds, as he has done in the past, making a small wound more serious and in turn more difficult to heal. In my judgment, it is very likely in this case that SA would interfere with any wound following a frenectomy, that would result in complications of further pain and risk of infection and very likely need continued medical attention and intervention. This would be a time when SA may be managing the consequences and changes following any dental treatment and could impact on his day to day needs of eating and his oral hygiene regime.</p>
