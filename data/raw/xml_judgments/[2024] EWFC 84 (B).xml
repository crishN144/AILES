This short judgment comes at the end of care proceedings which for a time proceeded within the pilot of the Cardiff and Vale Family Drug and Alcohol Court (&#8220;FDAC&#8221;). I am going to refer to M by her first name in this judgment, as I did through each of the six non-lawyer reviews that I conducted during these proceedings.</span></p>

I know this will devastate M, even if I am confident that, with a clean sober mind, she would understand. I have no doubt that M has always wanted what is best for D. I hope, in time, if she reads this, D will trust me in that. It is not a throw away comment intended to soften the blow; it is a statement of fact. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">M is just 27 years old, but her life to date has been hard. She came to the attention of the LA when just 16 as her father had returned home drunk and assaulted her. It was around this time that M also became involved in an abusive relationship, and was introduced to alcohol, drugs, and criminality. Substance misuse then remained the constant in M&#8217;s life as it descended into chaos. Between 2010 and 2023, she received 25 convictions for 50 offences, and in 2021 she received a 12 month custodial sentence for assault. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">At the time that M became pregnant, she was involved in two separate relationships, and it was initially not clear who D&#8217;s father was. I shall return to this in a moment, but for now I record that she experienced domestic violence at the hands of both men. Both were also known for their general criminality and substance abuse issues. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">With that context in mind, it is easy to understand why M initially failed to respond to her pregnancy. She continued to drink and use drugs, including benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine, methadone, and methamphetamine. She failed to engage with safeguarding professionals, and missed antenatal appointments and scans. D was born 16 days prematurely, experienced significant symptoms of withdrawal, and required a course of morphine treatment given the extent of her discomfort. M was drunk whilst giving birth, and returned to her drinking the next day.</span></p>

The Local Authority then issued its application for a care order on 19</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> June 2023, with an interim care order being made by consent at case management hearing on 27</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> June 2023. </span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">By this point, the Local Authority had already highlighted M as being potentially suitable for FDAC, and she received a positive screening report that did not identify any clear or obvious reasons why it would not be possible to proceed to an initial assessment. The initial assessment was directed at the CMH, and is dated 19</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> July 2023. This recommended that M sign up to the Trial for Change, noting that she had found some stability since D&#8217;s birth in a refuge, although also recording that M found it difficult to trust others, and that it would likely be a challenge for her to develop an open and trusting relationship with her keyworker. </span></p>

M&#8217;s approach, supported by the FDAC team and other professionals, was self-imposed abstinence. It is impossible to underestimate the extent of this challenge given her longstanding dependency, but M attacked it with consistent determination notwithstanding her obvious vulnerabilities. She returned negative drug and alcohol tests, and engaged well with all professionals and the range of support on offer. She always attended contact, and took great delight in showing me photos of her caring for D. M also took an active role in D&#8217;s medical treatment, which escalated in complexity further to D&#8217;s diagnosis of craniosynostosis in October. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">M visibly thrived in her work with the FDAC team. Her physical and emotional recovery from years of abuse was slow but evident fortnight to fortnight. Issues such as her time keeping and perhaps an over dependency on support workers were worked upon and improved, but it was her apparent willingness to start trusting professionals that felt like it could be a pivotal change. Sober, M appeared to have a new lease of life. She engaged in exercise, and I remember vividly the pride in her face when showing me a photograph of herself at the top of Pen y Fan at a NLR on 14</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> September 2023. Having the inclination to take herself climbing would have been unthinkable just months earlier, let alone also having the focus and ability to see it through. M saw this as the platform for a new start, and spoke enthusiastically about her plans to join her local gym and start learning karate. </span></p>

This was confirmed via testing before being volunteered by M, and M was initially evasive when the test results were put to her. That said, there was no rush to judgment at the next NLR on 20</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> October. All understood that this was part of the condition, with the attention on what had triggered her use on these occasions. The shame and disappointment felt by M was palpable, but she appeared motivated to ensure that these lapses would not define her within the process. </span></p>

The FDAC team concluded that further work and assessment was required before a final recommendation could be made, and endorsed an extension to the proceedings to allow this to happen. </span></p>

It identified that M had exhibited a pattern of avoidant behaviours, which was a significant barrier to her accessing help and support when needed. It concluded that the original recommendation required revision, with it being the FDAC team&#8217;s view that M would not be able to effectively complete the work necessary to meet her own needs and D&#8217;s needs even within an extended timetable to the proceedings. </span></p>

I note with immense sadness that M&#8217;s life has once again spiralled into devastating chaos in the intervening period. On the occasions that she has contacted the social worker, she has accepted continued use of crack cocaine, cannabis, and alcohol. She has refused to provide her current contact details, ceased engagement with drug support services, and has missed important appointments for her Buvidal injections. Her mental health has deteriorated significantly. The Local Authority has received PPNs suggesting that she has been the victim of domestic abuse, but also that she has stabbed a former partner on two separate occasions (no charges have been pressed). She has also been reported missing for periods of time.</span></p>

D would be at significant risk of harm if returned to her mother, and it is difficult to see how that risk might be capable of management. Even if a safety plan was capable of being established, it would be wholly reliant on honesty to succeed, and there is evidence to show that M has found this a difficulty notwithstanding the intensively supportive environment of the FDAC process. </span></p>

I say that, because it is not suggested by any party that it would be realistic for D to remain in long-term foster care in the event that the court concludes that she cannot be placed with her mother. Given her age, the well-known demerits of long-term foster care would be with D for a very long time. Those include keeping D the subject of Local Authority intervention until she is 18 and the potential changes in placement given the unstable nature of long term foster accommodation and the general lack of permanency.</span></p>

I hope that she will one day be able to reflect on the progress that she made when she started to allow herself to trust those wanting to work with her.

This is the course most likely to promote D&#8217;s welfare throughout her life. I am satisfied that nothing short of adoption will do to meet her welfare needs, and that care and placement orders are a necessary and proportionate interference with the parents and D&#8217;s Article 8 rights given the risks posed and her need for a permanent placement to be secured without further delay.</span></p>
