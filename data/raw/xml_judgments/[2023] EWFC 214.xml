The primary motivation to apply for adoption rather than a parental order is that an adoption order is more likely to be recognised in Italy, which will enable H to apply for EU citizenship. The applicants have been informed by the Italian consulate that an adoption order is the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;best and quickest&#8217;</span> way for this to be done in Italy. Although their initial application was a joint application this has now been amended to a step-parent adoption by E, the non-biological intended parent who is an Italian national. The Italian legal advice E and L have received states that a parental order would not be able to be registered in Italy in the same way as an adoption order.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Powell recognises the conventional order that would be sought in these circumstances would be a parental order and the relevant criteria for making such an order would be met, however the application to pursue a step-parent adoption order is founded in advancing H&#8217;s welfare needs. There is no statutory obligation imposed on intended parent(s) to apply for a parental order, although it is accepted that is the order that secures the optimal legal relationship with the intended parents and best reflects the circumstances of children born as a result of a surrogacy arrangement.</p>

Making a step-parent adoption order would, Mr Powell submits, secure the Article 8 rights of the applicants and H, which includes their respective identities. There is a positive obligation on the State to respect both family life and private life and when considering the child&#8217;s lifelong welfare needs the court can include the potential of a child to be able to secure the nationality of an intended parent.</p>

He submits that the reality in this case is E has a legitimate entitlement to apply for a step-parent adoption order and, submits Mr Powell, meets the necessary requirements. The court is required to consider the application on its merits, having regard to H&#8217;s lifelong welfare needs.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Powell submits the continued evolution of what constitutes a &#8216;family&#8217; within an international context and jurisdictions where certain family units might not be recognised is not unheard of and will continue to change over time (e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">S (Parentage and Jurisdiction) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2023/897" uk:canonical="[2023] EWCA Civ 897" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2023">[2023] EWCA Civ 897</ref>).</span> Mr Powell acknowledges that a step-parent adoption order would not reflect H&#8217;s life story as accurately as a parental order, although it would reflect what E and L intended. That is that they each be recognised as H&#8217;s legal parent and that she should have the ability to obtain the citizenship of each of her parents. Therefore, on the facts of this case, the benefits of making a step-parent adoption order significantly outweigh the practical benefits of H being made the subject of a parental order.</p>

R has not cared for H nor has she or wishes to assert her parental responsibility for her. On the contrary, R fully supports an adoption order being granted. The welfare checklist is carefully addressed in the Children&#8217;s Guardian&#8217;s report. H has had her home with E and L since birth and has known no other care givers. It is with them that she has formed her primary attachments and she recognises them as her parents. The observations of H with E and L was of &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">reciprocally loving relationships, where she anticipated that her needs would be met</span>&#8221;.  H enjoys a secure, loving home with E and L and views them both as her fathers.  She is thriving in their care, making excellent developmental progress and presents as a happy, confident and active child. E and L intend to be entirely open with H as to the circumstances of her birth, and they intend to have a life-long connection with R and have regular contact with the egg donor.</p>

The Registrar General confirmed that in the event of a step-parent adoption order being made the newly issued birth certificate both the names of the biological father and the step-parent will appear. This will replace the original birth certificate, which can only be used for information purposes and cannot be used for any official purpose. The applicant&#8217;s Italian lawyer has confirmed that the names of E and L appearing on a birth certificate is capable of registration in Italy. The lawyer has stated that such an adoption measure that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;does not include or indicate references to surrogacy is required&#8217;.</span></p>

Particularly if there are identified welfare benefits that support a different order being made, as a step-parent adoption differentiates between H&#8217;s fathers in a way that a parental order would not. Whilst this does not affect H&#8217;s lived experience, it does not fully reflect the circumstances of her birth in the way a parental order does.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By making the step-parent adoption order it would have the effect of transforming the legal status of the child with the result that both E and L would be recognised as legal parents, both with parental responsibility with the added welfare benefit of recognising E&#8217;s Italian heritage, her sense of identity and the family culture. The evidence demonstrates they are an international family; spending time in other countries and experiencing other cultures form a significant part of their shared identities. E and L identify H as being a child with Italian heritage, her name includes an Italian name and it is a heritage E strongly identifies with. In the particular circumstances of this case the making of a step-parent adoption order is more likely to enable that heritage to be recognised in a tangible way for the benefit of H.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the particular facts of this case the making of a step-parent adoption order will secure and safeguard, now and into the future, the established central relationship, legal and factual, between H and E and L and is the order that secures H&#8217;s lifelong welfare needs, with identified welfare benefits. Any suggestion that a step-parent adoption order may not fully reflect H&#8217;s background in the way a parental order would is met by the powerful evidence in this case. It demonstrates E and L are clear about the importance of H understanding from an early age her background and the circumstances of her conception. As a result of the secure ongoing meaningful relationships that exist between the relevant adults, in particular with R and the egg donor, their role in H&#8217;s background will be an integral and lived part of H&#8217;s life going forward. H&#8217;s lifelong welfare and identity needs are best met by the court making a step-parent adoption order in favour of E.</p>
