The appellant filed a notice of appeal on 11 October 2016, and, on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October, I listed the matter for a hearing of the application for permission to appeal, with appeal to follow if permission was granted.

The parties were married in 1987 but prior to that lived together for twenty years. There are two children of the marriage, B, aged 41, and D, age 38.

The matrimonial home is a substantial property in Essex with 7 bedrooms, held in the husband&#8217;s sole name.

She also alleged that he had been unfaithful and latterly disinhibited in his behaviour. The wife described the husband as an extremely difficult man of whom she was genuinely frightened. She said that for the duration of the marriage she had been the emotional punch bag for his insecurities and frustrations. She alleged that she has been completely dependent on him financially, in particular on cash provided by him. The husband denied that he has ever ill-treated her and contended that it is she who has behaved in an intimidating fashion towards him. He denied her assertion that she has been unhappy for many years, pointing out that they frequently went on holiday together until shortly before the breakdown of the marriage.</p>

During this period, the wife concluded the marriage had broken down, and sought legal advice. She continued to visit him in hospital on a daily basis, but stopped doing so after 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March when, it is alleged, he was abusive to their son B. At that point, the wife changed the locks on the matrimonial home and subsequently changed the code to the electric gates to the property. On 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> April, the wife arranged for B to deliver a letter from her solicitor to the husband in hospital, informing him of her intention to seek a divorce.</p>

Thereafter, according to the wife, the husband and D attended the property on a number of occasions each day and sat outside in a manner which she described as intimidating. It was the husband&#8217;s case, however, that he had suffered continual harassment and surveillance from the wife, B, and the wife&#8217;s older son. He asserted that his health problems had left him extremely frail and vulnerable.</p>

On 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> June, she filed a petition for divorce under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/1/2" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18 s. 1" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(2)</ref>(b) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>, seeking the full range of financial relief orders. On 6 June, the husband filed a cross-application for non-molestation and occupation orders. On 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June, the district judge directed that both applications be listed together on the 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> June.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:-0.39in">10.<marker name="tab"/>That hearing took place before Judge Murfitt on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August. At the outset of the hearing, the husband indicated that he did not wish to pursue his application for an occupation order against the wife, contending that the property was sufficiently large to accommodate both of them. After hearing evidence and submissions, judgment was reserved. A draft judgment was circulated to counsel on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September and a final order made on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> September. Under the occupation order, the judge declared that the wife was entitled to occupy the matrimonial home and had matrimonial home rights in the property which would not end when the husband died or the marriage was dissolved. The judge further ordered that the husband should allow the wife to occupy the matrimonial home, should not loiter in the vicinity of the property, nor obstruct harass or interfere with her peaceful occupation of it, and having left should not return, enter or attempt to enter the property. The occupation order is expressed as lasting until the conclusion of the financial remedy proceedings pendingbetween the parties. The judge further made a non-molestation order under which the husband &#8220;is forbidden to use or threaten violence against the wife and must not instruct, encourage or in any way suggest that any other person should do so.&#8221; The non-molestation order further repeats the injunction against loitering in the vicinity of the property set out in the occupation order. The non-molestation order was expressed as lasting until 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 17, i.e. 6 months after the hearing on 4 August. It also provided that the husband should pay the cost of the proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:-0.39in">11.<marker name="tab"/>In her judgment, Judge Murfitt recorded that the wife alleged that the husband had physically hit heron numerous occasions over the years, although she was not specific as to dates or details. She had sought legal advice to start divorce proceedings in 2007 but was too frightened to see it through. In 2011, the police had been called following an incident at the home and the husband had accepted a caution in respect of an offence relating to domestic violence. There was no allegation of violence after that date. But the wife alleged that she had been unhappy in her marriage for a long time and asserted that she was genuinely frightened of her husband because of his excessive drinking and volatile intimidating and provocative behaviour. The husband denied ever being abusive towards the wife in any way. In his statement, he asserted that it was the wife who was intimidating towards him, although in oral evidence he denied ever saying that. He challenged the wife&#8217;s claim that she had been unhappy in the marriage as she claimed, pointing to the fact they enjoyed many holidays together until very recently.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:-0.50in">&#8220;the impression I formed of Mr F&#8217;s credibility was as poor as my impression of Mrs F&#8217;s was good. When their evidence diverged, in general I preferred that of Mrs F. I found her to be a straightforward witness, not given to lengthy or over-elaborate descriptions of her married life, but someone who nevertheless conveyed that she has reached the end of a road she has trodden unhappily for many years, and who no longer feels strong enough to manage it&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:-0.50in">She accepted that the husband had been controlling and concluded that she did not consider it likely that he would honour a division of the living space within the home. She further found (at paragraph 28) that the wife was likely to suffer significant harm attributable to the husband&#8217;s conduct if an order suspending or restricting his right of occupation was not made, and that the behaviour which the judge accepted the wife has had to endure hitherto would simply continue. She found that the husband&#8217;s insight into the impact of his behaviour upon the wife was extremely limited and that the wife has been made to feel vulnerable, anxious and intimidated, such that her sleep and concentration was affected. The judge found that the significance of the emotional harm the wife was likely to suffer may well exceed the physical, but was no less acute in the light of her age. The judge therefore concluded that the making of the order sought by the wife was mandatory under the statute, unless the husband was able to demonstrate that he would suffer significant harm if such an order was made. Having analysed his evidence, the judge concluded that any harm which he would suffer would be less than that which the wife would suffer by reason of his conduct if an order was not made. On that basis, the judge held that the making of the occupation order was mandatory under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, but added that in her judgment such an order was not only mandatory but also just and reasonable. The judge then added that in all the circumstances, including the need to secure the wife&#8217;s health, safety and well-being under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, she was satisfied that a non-molestation order should also be granted.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:-0.39in">17.<marker name="tab"/>On the half of the husband, Mr Johnstone makes the following submissions. First, he contends that the judge was plainly wrong to make an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/33/7" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27 s. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.33(7)</ref>. He submits that no finding of significant harm was made and there was no evidential basis to justify such a finding. The wife did not allege that she had been physically assaulted by the husband for over 5 years. There was no finding of recent infliction of violence, nor of any threat of violence. Had it appeared to the judge that the husband had used or threatened violence, she would have been bound to add a power of arrest under s.47(2) (supra). As she decided not to attach a power of arrest, it must be concluded that it did not appear to her that there had been any use or threat of violence. Mr Johnstone accepts that, conceptually, it is possible for a court to conclude that there is a likelihood of significant harm which does not involve physical violence, but he submits that there was no evidence here to justify such a finding. The wife made assertions as to her state of mind, but Mr Johnstone points out that no medical evidence was adduced about this aspect. A finding of a likelihood of significant emotional harm was inconsistent with the fact that the wife had accompanied the husband on holiday on many occasions in the preceding 12 months and had visited the husband daily in hospital for over 10 weeks after his admission.</p>

In that case, Otton LJ, citing an earlier case decided under the previous legislation, defined &#8220;significant&#8221; as &#8220;considerable or noteworthy or important&#8221;. In the same case, Thorpe LJ observed:</p>

I do not myself think that the wider statutory provisions contained in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1996</ref> obliterate that authority.

Occupation orders are intended to be relatively short-term interim protection measures and are not intended to provide long-term housing or to create a &#8220;status quo&#8221; for the purposes of financial provision. The duration of financial remedy proceedings, which could last up to 2 years, is wholly unrelated to the need for an occupation order.</p>

Judge Murfitt had ample opportunity to assess their credibility and her conclusion was clear - that her impression of the husband&#8217;s credibility was as poor as her impression of the wife&#8217;s was good. She relied in particular on the blatant contradiction in the husband&#8217;s evidence between his assertion in his written statement that his wife had been intimidating and his flat denial in oral evidence that this was the case. The judge was plainly unimpressed by his attempt to explain this discrepancy. Mr Johnstone complains about the judge&#8217;s failure to address two inconsistencies in the wife&#8217;s evidence in her judgment, but as described above the judge addressed this point in her supplemental reasons refusing permission to appeal. In the circumstances, I do not consider that these can be regarded as a significant omission in her judgment. In my view, any challenge to the judge&#8217;s assessment of the parties&#8217; credibility is hopeless.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:-0.39in">25.<marker name="tab"/>In the circumstances, I conclude that the judge was entitled to accept the wife&#8217;s assertion as to the husband&#8217;s intimidating and provocative behaviour throughout the marriage. She accepted that wife &#8220;has reached the end of a road she has trodden unhappily for many years and &#8230; no longer feel strong enough to manage it&#8221;. The judge found that there was evidence to support her allegation that the husband was controlling and intimidating. Although she did not expressly say so in her judgment, it is manifestly clear that she concluded that the harm which the wife had suffered as a result of the husband&#8217;s intimidating and controlling behaviour, and was likely to suffer if the order was not made, was significant harm within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/33/7" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27 s. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.33(7)</ref>. In my judgment, this was plainly a conclusion that she was entitled to reach. The concept of significant harm is one with which all family judges are very familiar. I see no merit in the complaint that the judge failed to refer to the two Court of Appeal authorities cited on behalf of the husband. Furthermore, the judge was in my view entirely right to draw attention, when setting out her reasons for refusing permission to appeal, to the changes in understanding and awareness of the nature and extent of domestic abuse that has occurred in the last fifteen years.</p>

As stated above, &#8220;harm&#8221; includes mental, as well as physical, ill-treatment. It was the wife&#8217;s case that she had suffered harm as a result of enduring years of the husband&#8217;s abusive behaviour. The judge was plainly entitled to find that the harm was significant, and therefore obliged to make an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/33/7" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27 s. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.33(7)</ref>, unless the harm which wife would suffer if the order was not made was exceeded by the harm caused to the husband if it was.

Furthermore, as Mr Johnstone submits, the court must impose the least interventionist order necessary to achieve the object of protecting the applicant, and it is only where an order regulating the occupancy of the property would be insufficient to protect the applicant that the court is entitled to make an order excluding the respondent from the property altogether. On one view, the larger the property, the greater the likelihood that the applicant would be sufficiently protected by regulating the occupancy and dividing the property between the parties. In this case, however, the judge found it unlikely that the husband would honour any division of the property. This conclusion was plainly within her discretion, and consistent with her overall assessment of the husband and his evidence. Given the fact that the husband owned a significant number of other properties, and was a man of some means, an order excluding him was one which the court was plainly entitled to make under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/33/3" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27 s. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.33(3)</ref> and (7).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:-0.39in">28.<marker name="tab"/>In refusing permission to appeal, the judge observed that, unusually for such hearings in the family court, the case had been listed for a full day&#8217;s hearing of the oral evidence with lengthy written and oral submissions presented by counsel on both sides. She added that, in those circumstances, it was reasonable for the court to undertake a careful appraisal of all the documents before delivering a reserved judgment. I endorse the judge&#8217;s comments. When a decision requires a careful assessment of the evidence and submissions, it is usually advisable to reserve judgment. I do not accept Mr Johnstone&#8217;s suggestion that such an order should only be made in circumstances where the outcome &#8220;jumps off the page&#8221; in a way that enables the judge to deliver an ex tempore judgment. Judges are expected to take care when reaching these difficult decisions, which have to be made alongside all the other demands of sitting in a busy family court. </p>

In other words, as Mr Kefford submits on behalf of the wife, the court has a complete discretion to determine the appropriate duration of an order, having regard to the facts of a particular case and the findings made. In this case, given the court&#8217;s findings as to the husband&#8217;s behaviour and the overall evidence as to the parties&#8217; means, I consider it entirely reasonable for the judge to conclude that the order should continue until the conclusion of the financial remedy proceedings. </p>

An order under s.42(5) can have serious consequences since it can lead to the immediate arrest of the party who is the subject of the order. There was no explanation in the judgment as to why an order was needed, nor any evidential basis for making such an order. In the alternative, Mr. Johnstone submits that the normal duration for such an order is 3 months and there were no grounds for imposing a longer order in this case.</p>

He submitted that it was clear that the trial judge rejected the words &#8220;intimidate, harass or pester&#8221; which were far wider in scope and an alleged breach would enable arrest in far less serious circumstances than envisaged by her. He added that there is no Respondent&#8217;s Notice seeking to expand or vary the non-molestation order on appeal. He therefore submitted that in those circumstances an appeal against the non-molestation order can only be discharged or upheld in its current terms. On behalf of the wife, Mr Kefford stressed that the wife&#8217;s case is that permission to appeal should be refused and contended that, if permission to appeal was refused, the order could not be expanded to include the words &#8220;intimidate harass or pester&#8221;.
