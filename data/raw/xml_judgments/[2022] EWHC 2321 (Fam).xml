The Local Authority (&#8216;LA&#8217;) alleges in its Threshold Document that the Father caused Y&#8217;s injuries by shaking her.  On 7 October 2020 the Father called an ambulance saying that Y had suffered a fall from the bed and was in need of urgent medical assistance. On later examination it was discovered that she had subdural haemorrhage (&#8216;SDH&#8217;) and retinal haemorrhages (&#8216;RH&#8217;). The LA assert that these injuries followed an Abusive Head Trauma (&#8216;AHT&#8217;). The Father, supported by the Mother, says that he did not shake Y in any way and that the injury followed a fall from the bed.</p>

Given the criticality of the neuroradiological evidence in this case it was felt by all parties, and I agreed, that a new neuroradiologist should be instructed. Dr Hogarth was then instructed to take on this role and the Court heard his evidence on 24 June, and further submissions from the parties on 27 June. </p>

Professor Fielder also concluded that a shaking injury was the most likely cause but was somewhat more guarded in his conclusions. Dr Hogarth&#8217;s opinion was that the injuries were consistent with a shaking injury, but he did not rule out the possibility that they were caused by a short fall. He too referred me to some academic papers. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is a major issue around Y&#8217;s head circumference (&#8216;HC&#8217;) and whether it was growing normally. This is relevant as to whether Y could be described as having macrocephaly, and thus fall within some of the growing literature which relates head size to the likelihood of brain injuries in infants following short falls. Having heard the evidence it became clear that macrocephaly has no one precise definition, and there are no clear criteria within the literature that relates particular head size to particular outcomes. However, the general issue of whether Y&#8217;s head size, or its pattern of growth was unusual, is relevant to the academic literature on the causation and likelihood of such injuries. </p>

Dr Hobbs replotted the agreed weights on the WHO-UK chart, which is based on UK babies, on the basis that he considered this a more useful and appropriate chart for UK babies. I will refer to both charts where relevant but use the general WHO chart first.</p>

By 24 February it was 35.8cm (91-98th centile). On 16 March it was 36.9cm (91st centile) and 2 April, 37.8cm (75th centile). The health visitor had raised a concern because Y&#8217;s head had grown rapidly, and the GP therefore said it should be measured every 2 weeks. From 14 April the parents took over measuring Y&#8217;s head because of the Covid epidemic and the fact that health visitors stopped visiting the home. The Mother was shown how to measure the head, and I have no reason to believe her measurements were not accurate.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Y&#8217;s weight at birth was 2kg (50th centile). She then dropped to the 9th centile, as is quite normal. By 16 March it was 3.52kg (25th centile) and by 7 July it was 7.54kg (91st centile). Ms Marshall points out that Y was on a milk supplement, which may in part explain her significant weight gain. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Hobbs&#8217; argues that the growth in Y&#8217;s HC up to July 2020 was entirely normal. It followed her weight gain and her somewhat larger than average head was probably just a genetic inheritance, the Mother being reported to have a larger than normal head. He says the most important point is that her head growth did not accelerate before October.</p>

There is a major disagreement as to whether this growth was as a result of the injury, or whether her head was likely to have been growing disproportionately between July and October, i.e. before the injury occurred. I will return to that when considering the evidence. </p>

She is at the stage where she can roll more than once, but only with breaks in between. The video shows her rolling four times. I note that rolling on a hard surface, i.e. here a floor, is easier than rolling on a bed.</p>

He gave her breakfast in her high chair and then played with her on the floor. She had a nap around 10.00am, again as was normal. He sent the Mother photos of Y at 9.30am and 10.36am and these show Y well and happy. He remembers that she was asleep at 10.36am when he sent the photo. After she woke up, he did a short workout whilst she was sitting in a Bumbo chair. They then went upstairs and he put her in her cot whilst he had a shower.</p>

For the June 2022 hearing Dr Hogarth provided some further papers I will only refer to the ones principally relied upon by Dr Saunders, Dr Hobbs and Dr Hogarth on the central issues of the likelihood of a short fall causing injuries such as Y&#8217;s. I appreciate that a judge is not in a particularly good position to assess such papers and decide what weight to place upon them. However, the content of those papers lie at the heart of the medical evidence in this case, and in my view I have no choice but to consider them.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are a number of difficulties with research in the field of infant head injuries and its causation. The most obvious is that it is not possible to carry out any empirical research, which leaves the data very difficult to analyse in a wholly objective and comparative manner. There are relatively few cases where there is unequivocal evidence, such as CCTV footage, that proves whether the infant was shaken or suffered a short fall. Even in cases where an adult has &#8220;confessed&#8221; to the shaking, some authors cast doubt on whether those confessions can always be relied upon. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to the case studies in the papers relied upon by Dr Saunders, there are often problems with the detail of the studies and the degree to which the cases are self-selected. Many of the case studies relate to cases where parents are seeking to establish that the injuries were not caused by AHT and thus can be criticised as being self-selecting. Further, it is very difficult to be confident that when a case is categorised as not being subject to abuse, the reader can be sure that is actually the case.</p>

This paper is particularly important because it is a Consensus Statement produced by neuroradiologists from a very wide range of institutions in different countries and supported by many paediatric and radiological societies. I agree with Dr Hobbs that those factors give it a particular weight. The statement explains that it is seeking to set out the general physician acceptance on specific topics, and to rebut the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;denialism of child abuse [which] has become a significant legal and public health problem&#8221;,</span> particularly in the US legal system.

In her initial report of 12 June Dr Saunders had concluded that it was unlikely that the injuries had resulted from a fall from the bed because such falls usually result in no injury; injuries that do occur usually show scalp swelling or skull fractures; haematomas of the sort shown here are a very rare outcome of falls from a bed; subarachnoid haemorrhages have usually only been seen with falls from a greater height; injuries such as are seen here are a well recognised injury following shaking injuries.</p>

Dr Saunders questioned whether the expansion of Y&#8217;s head when measured on 8 October was as a result of the injury and the SDH, as Dr Hobbs and Professor Vloeberghs suggest. The mechanism for a short term head expansion following an injury would be for the sutures to expand (there having been insufficient time for the skull to have expanded after the injury) or possibly for the fontanelle to bulge. However, Dr Saunders said that she did not see any expansion of the sutures on the neuroimaging and there was no evidence of a bulge in Y&#8217;s fontanelle. Therefore, she believed that most, if not all, of the head expansion (onto the 98-99.6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> centile) must have been growth before the injury.</p>

The mother's two other children had experienced apparent life-threatening events taking a similar form. The Court of Appeal Criminal Division quashed the convictions. There was no evidence other than repeated incidents of breathing having ceased. There was serious disagreement between experts as to the cause of death. There was fresh evidence as to hereditary factors pointing to a possible genetic cause. In those circumstances, the Court of Appeal held that it could not be said that a natural cause could be excluded as a reasonable possible explanation.

As Cannings teaches, even where, on examination of all the evidence, every possible known cause has been excluded, the cause may still remain unknown.&#8221;</span></p>

In other words, there has to be factored into every case which concerns a discrete aetiology giving rise to significant harm, a consideration as to whether the cause is unknown. That affects neither the burden nor the standard of proof. It is simply a factor to be taken into account in deciding whether the causation advanced by the one shouldering the burden of proof is established on the balance of probabilities.&#8221;</span></p>

In order to make a finding that a particular person was the perpetrator of non-accidental injury the court must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities. It is always desirable, where possible, for the perpetrator of non-accidental injury to be identified both in the public interest and in the interest of the child, although where it is impossible for a judge to find on the balance of probabilities, for example that Parent A rather than Parent B caused the injury, then neither can be excluded from the pool and the judge should not strain to do so.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The burden of proving their case rests on the LA, but only upon the balance of probabilities. In reaching my conclusion I must look at the totality of the evidence and not focus on one aspect of that evidence to the exclusion of other parts. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Absent the medical evidence in this case, I would have no doubt that the Father did not shake Y and therefore did not cause the head injuries found. There are no &#8220;red flags&#8221; in this case in respect of the Father; there is no history of drug taking, excessive alcohol, domestic abuse or mental health problems.  However, the factors against the Father having shaken Y go further than that.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> Y was an easy contented baby. That is the evidence not just of the parents and the wider family, but of all the photos and videos I have seen, and of the health visitor. Y was a baby who slept well, and both parents say she had slept through the night the day before the injury. I have seen the photos of her that morning appearing happy and smiley. In my view this is important because, although the conventional wisdom is that many people could shake a baby with a momentary loss of control, they are significantly less likely to do so in the middle of the day when there is no reason to believe that the Father was tired or stressed. The evidence of the Father, backed up by the photos and the Mother&#8217;s evidence, is that he and Y were having a normal contented morning.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Norton has suggested that the Father might have lost control because Y was &#8220;grumbling&#8221;. I have to say I think that this is very unlikely.  A parent might lose control with a baby who had been crying for hours or screaming with distress, but absent the red flags referred to above, I do not think it at all likely that the Father would have lost control because Y was somewhat discontented.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Next is the Father&#8217;s demeanour as a witness. He was a calm and, in my view, honest witness. He has been consistent in his account, subject to a minor change from saying he turned his back for &#8220;a second&#8221; to perhaps a minute. That is the kind of use of language that in my view means nothing. The Father is accepted by the LA to be a loving and caring parent, and the parenting assessment was wholly positive. I find the Father was a wholly believable witness. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">An important piece of evidence was the 999 call when the Father is palpably distressed and can be heard saying &#8220;why did I turn my back&#8221;. The LA have to argue that this was either a deliberate lie to create a false story, or a deliberate attempt to minimise what had happened. For the Father to have lied in this situation, when he was obviously distressed about Y, would suggest a degree of calculation which seems wholly out of keeping with the Father&#8217;s presentation in the witness box. Further, if the Father had lied in this situation he would have been potentially harming Y&#8217;s care by misleading the first responders. This would have not been the action of a loving parent. I think it is extremely unlikely that the Father would have acted in this way. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn then to the medical evidence. This amounts to findings of retinal haemorrhages and subdural haemorrhages and Y&#8217;s physical presentation. There were no other physical signs of a shaking injury &#8211; no bruises and no fractures and no brain injuries. I fully accept that a shaking injury can take place without these other indicators, but their absence must be a relevant consideration in taking an overview of the evidence. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In respect of the RHs and the SDHs, all the experts whose opinions I am now in a position to rely upon say that they were more likely to be caused by a shaking injury rather than a short fall. However, I heard the evidence of Dr Saunders in November and have read the papers to which she referred. Critically Dr Hogarth, although he thinks a shaking injury is more likely than a fall, does accept that a fall is a possibility.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not accept Dr Hobbs and Professor Vloeberghs&#8217; criticism of Dr Saunders for having changed her mind (twice) during the course of these proceedings. Although I understand their frustration, in my view Dr Saunders has done what any expert should do. She kept an open mind and conducted as thorough a review as possible of the literature before reaching her ultimate conclusion. It is obvious that this is a highly contentious field where unhelpfully litigation, particularly in the US, seems to have led to a polarised approach. However, as far as I can tell, and I rely on Dr Saunders for this, there are many reputable and independent experts who are open to the argument that there are cases where infants have suffered both SDH and RH from short falls. That is not in any sense to reject the point that those factors will often if not usually be indicators of AHT - they may well be in the vast majority of cases. But it remains important to acknowledge that there will be outlier, or unusual, cases.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is a case where it is particularly important to bear in mind the various judicial dicta referred to above about considering the unusual or unlikely cause, and not simply following the medical evidence without question. I found Dr Hogarth&#8217;s evidence very helpful in his appreciation that unlikely events necessarily happen, and there will be outliers to the normal clinical presentation. The academic literature does indicate that there are cases of young children suffering both SDH and (very infrequently) RHs from short falls. I give considerable weight to Professor Fielder&#8217;s evidence that he has never seen a case where he thought a RH resulted from a short fall. However, the literature does suggest some such cases do exist. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although Y does not appear to have had the indicators of BESS, there is evidence she had an unusually large head before the injury, that it had grown in an unusual manner. The issue of whether Y had widened extra axial spaces has fallen away, Dr Hogarth stating that in his view the images do not support any such finding. However, he accepted that there was no sign of the sutures having splayed on 8 October, which is an indicator that her head was already large before the injury. It is neither possible nor necessary for me to determine the degree to which Y&#8217;s head circumference (or its growth) may have played a part in her becoming injured from a short fall, but I accept that it has some possible relevance.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ultimately, I have to look at the evidence as a whole. The factors I take into account in concluding that on the balance of probabilities Y was not shaken by the Father are as follows. The lack of any other physical signs of shaking, such as bruising or fractures. The lack of any &#8220;red flags&#8221; in relation to the Father or the family circumstances. The lack of any evidence of any stress factors on the morning of the incident - the evidence strongly points to this being a normal, happy morning. The Father&#8217;s demeanour during giving evidence and what he said on the 999 call, which would have involved a deliberate lie or subterfuge which in my view would have been wholly out of character.  The fact that there is a body of literature which supports the possibility of infants, usually with larger than normal heads, having SDHs and, in a few cases, RHs after short falls. The evidence of Dr Hogarth that although it is more likely the injury was caused by shaking, given the relatively slight injuries here, he accepts the possibility of a short fall as the cause. </p>
