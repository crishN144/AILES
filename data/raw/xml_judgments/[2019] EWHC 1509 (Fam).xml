		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in;margin-right:0.69in;text-indent:1.07in">The basis of the appellant, the mother&#8217;s, claim can be briefly summarised as follows.  She married a man who immediately after the marriage began to abuse her.  She attempted to leave him but by persuasion of her own family, particularly her brothers, and her husband and his family, she returned to him.  She reported some incidents of violence to the police but they laughed at her, partly due to culture but also because the appellant&#8217;s husband had relatives within the security forces.  The final straw came when the appellant found her husband sexually abusing her son.&#8221; <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:8pt">OPUS 2 DIGITAL TRANSCRIPTION </span></p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1.48in;margin-right:0.57in">I found the appellant to be articulate, detailed, specific, consistent and credible in her evidence.  I accept her claims that she and her son would be located in DD on return by her husband via his family members and computer records.  She gave details of the names of the appellant&#8217;s brothers and their positions within the police and prison force.  This is far more information than is usual in asylum seekers claiming that they fear persons with influence and the security forces of the country from which they have fled.  I accept that her husband has filed a missing persons report and that the immigration authorities would be alerted to this fact on their return at the airport.  Assuming they were returned, I find it has been established that there is a real risk both the appellant and her son would face ill treatment at the hands of her husband. </p>

She has established that her fears of persecution on return are well founded, the Refugee Convention is engaged, and she has established that she and her son are entitled to international protection.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.01in">The mother, therefore, has been granted asylum by the UK government applying to both herself and her son as her dependent; they have refugee status.  Since the father commenced these Hague Convention proceedings and when she was acting without legal representation, the mother subsequently made an application specifically for H to be granted asylum.  This may have been unnecessary but is nonetheless pending a decision.  The child himself was joined as a party to this Hague Convention application on 15 February by order of Keehan J.  His interests are represented through his guardian, Emma Huntington, who has filed a report dated 20 March concluding, amongst other things, that H is settled in this country. </p>

On 25 January 2019, at a hearing before Roberts J, the mother appeared in person and it is recorded in the order that she volunteered to file and serve her asylum documentation.

As I understand it, Roberts J agreed that the papers be returned to the mother. </p>

There then follows a final hearing before the same Judge listed by Roberts J for five days beginning on 10 June.  It can be seen that I am not the trial judge.  Whether this disclosure application should have been listed before the trial judge is, to a certain extent, now irrelevant since it was, in fact, listed before me and no one suggested that it should be adjourned in order to be heard by the trial judge. </p>

Both on 8 May and 16 May, I heard detailed submissions from all advocates and what follows in this judgment is a summary only of the very full, comprehensive submissions made. </p>

Further, he argues that the grant of asylum on a false basis undermines the mother&#8217;s case that the child and she would be at grave risk of harm or intolerability pursuant to Article 13b.  Further, that the grant of asylum effects the settlement defence because, the father argues, the grant of asylum on a false basis undermines any argument that the child is settled here.  It was argued on his behalf that the only way that the father can, as his Counsel put it, &#8216;penetrate the shield of the grant of asylum&#8217; raised by the mother is to have the tools to challenge the original determination by the Immigration Tribunal.  If not, it is said he is denied the opportunity to participate. </p>

At the adjourned hearing on 16 May, for the first time, Mr Devereux QC raised orally in submissions whether the correct procedure in an application such as this, for disclosure when there are questions of asylum, should be a public interest immunity application (PII) with the court being assisted by the Secretary of State for the Home Department in looking at the documentation. </p>

He has lived in England happily, according to the mother, for over three years, nearly half his life.  Further, the mother relies on Article 13b, the harm/intolerability defence and the child&#8217;s objections.  As a result of the mother having raised the Article 12 defence, the child was joined as a party and a guardian appointed.

Mr Hames QC reminded the court that the mother has already exhibited to her statement filed in these proceedings a copy of the decision and reasons of the tribunal judge to which I have already referred.  So, it is argued by the mother, the father and the court already have detailed information as to why the mother was granted asylum and, therefore, it is submitted the father does not need and should not receive any more disclosure.   </p>

Surprisingly, this question has apparently never before been determined in England and Wales, although it has been addressed in the USA and Canada.  The Home Secretary has intervened in the proceedings, and argues that a grant of asylum to the subject children, if made, would act as an absolute bar to a return order being made under the 1980 Convention.  While the application is pending (and for these purposes a pending application is one that has not exhausted all appeal rights) the Home Secretary argues that a return order cannot be implemented.  Such an order can only be made, or take effect, where the asylum claim has been refused and where all appeal rights have been exhausted.&#8221; </p>

Equally, it is impossible for a return order to be made while an asylum claim is pending.  Such an order would place this country in direct breach of the principle of non-refoulement.  It is impossible to conceive that the framers of the 1980 or 1996 Hague Conventions could have intended that orders of an interim procedural nature could be made thereunder in direct conflict with that key principle.  In my judgment, the existence and resolution of the asylum claim amount to &#8216;exceptional circumstances&#8217; within the terms of article 11.3 of the Brussels 2 revised regulation. </p>

Passport and visa applications relating to children will often need to be resolved before the Court can make decisions in their best interest.  An application for Asylum however, has an entirely different complexion to it.  It will invariably involve material of a highly distressing and personal nature.  Asylum seekers are informed, precisely because of these often exquisitely sensitive issues, that the information they provide will be treated as confidential and will only be disclosed where there is a requirement in law to do so.  As Mr Norton [leading counsel for the Secretary of State] emphasised, this is made plain to those seeking asylum in very clear terms at the start of the asylum process. </p>

All advocates accept that there is a balancing exercise to be carried out by the court and in respect of the father&#8217;s application for disclosure, this court needs to consider whether this would be compatible with the mother and the child&#8217;s rights, in particular, their Article 3 and Article 8 rights.  I must attach particular weight to the wider public interest in protecting the confidentiality of the asylum process, especially as here where the applicant is the alleged persecutor.  It is also, of course, extremely important to weigh the father&#8217;s Article 6 and Article 8 rights and the impact on him of not having the disclosure which he seeks.  As Hayden J said, there is no presumption that there would be disclosure only in an exceptional case and the balancing exercise is one for the court.  I accept, as did the learned Judge, that the Secretary of State will frequently be better placed than the court to conduct the balancing exercise when identifying whether or to what extent disclosure should take place but, nonetheless, the decision is one for me alone advised by the parties before me including the Secretary of State. </p>

The role of the court is to consider how those rights might be respected.  The father has a great deal of information about the mother&#8217;s asylum application already, far, far more than &#8216;a gist&#8217;.  He has the detailed refusal letters and the full unredacted ruling by the independent judicial tribunal describing the mother&#8217;s consistent account.  He has the mother&#8217;s detailed statements and exhibits provided both in these proceedings and in the asylum proceedings.  He puts a great deal of emphasis on a forged affidavit produced by the mother.  The mother accepted from the point of her asylum interview that she forged it and the Tribunal Judge knew of her account and accepted its use in order to leave DD.   Quite frankly in those circumstances, I cannot see why emphasis is being placed on its disclosure. I fail to see how disclosure of this document necessarily outweighs the other competing arguments as to confidentiality.   </p>

In my judgment, I find it very hard to see what effect the asylum documentation, over and above what else the father has, would have upon consideration of the question of settlement.  The father is able to ask questions of the guardian, if the trial judge permits.  He may make submissions on the many documents that the mother has made available and also make submissions upon the guardian&#8217;s report.
