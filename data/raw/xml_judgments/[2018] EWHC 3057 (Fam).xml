The property was purchased in joint names and the Form TR1 filed with the Land Registry recorded that the beneficial interest was held by the parties as joint tenants. The wife&#8217;s case is that the purchase price and costs associated with the purchase were provided from jointly-owned funds held in the parties&#8217; joint account. The husband&#8217;s case is that the funds for the purchase, and for subsequent improvement works at the property, were provided entirely from his inheritance from his uncle and only paid into a joint account for administrative purposes. Subsequently, the parties and I moved into the property and occupied it as a family home. The wife claims that building work was started at the property but never finished.</p>

The petition or application initiating the proceedings included requests directed at the President, in respect of provisional and urgent measures, and at the Court, in respect of final orders. The provisional and urgent measures included authorising the parties to live separately, orders in respect of I (joint custody mainly at the wife&#8217;s home with defined contact to the husband), no obligation for spousal maintenance, and an order for child maintenance. By way of final order, he asked the court to order the legal separation of the spouses, to order that custody of I be jointly shared between the parents, with physical custody mainly at the home of the wife and defined contact to the husband, and to find that he should pay a monthly allowance for the maintenance of the daughter in the sum of &#8364;500, plus further payments in respect of her healthcare and education. The petition did not include any application for capital orders or orders in respect of the London property or any other property. </p>

Subsequently, however, she conceded that the husband&#8217;s judicial separation proceedings had been made first in time and that Italy was properly seised of those proceedings. On 1 June 2016, her divorce petition was therefore stayed by consent.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 17 October 2016, a First Hearing Dispute Resolution Appointment (&#8220;FHDRA&#8221;) in the mother&#8217;s application for orders under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.8</ref> took place at the West London Family Court before District Judge Bloom. Both parties were represented. The order recorded that the Cafcass safeguarding checks had disclosed allegations that the husband had physically, sexually and emotionally abused the mother and physically and emotionally abused the child. The order further recorded a number of issues about which the parties were agreed, including (1) that there would have to be a fact-finding hearing to determine the truth of the mother&#8217;s allegations; (2) that I was currently living with the mother; (3) that I was habitually resident in England; (4) that the mother and I should be permitted to travel to Italy for Christmas; (5) that the father should not attend the school at present, and (6) that the father should have indirect contact with I every day by telephone. The issues to be resolved were (1) whether I should live primarily with the mother or under a shared care arrangement; (2) what contact the father should have with I; (3) the truth of the mother&#8217;s allegations, and (4) whether, if findings were made in respect of those allegations, any work should be undertaken with the father prior to final decisions being taken with regard to the child arrangements being resolved. The court made various case management directions, and listed the matter for a Dispute Resolutions Appointment hearing in January 2017. In view of subsequent events, it should be noted that the order of 17 October 2016 did not contain an express recital that the father accepted the jurisdiction of the court to determine issues relating to parental responsibility, although there was nothing on the face of the order to suggest that he challenged the jurisdiction.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 19 October 2016, the husband filed a further claim against the wife in the Turin court (hereafter referred to as &#8220;the Italian property proceedings&#8221;) seeking the equivalent of declaratory relief, and asking the court to affirm that the wife has no rights in respect of his inheritance from his uncle and to rule that he was the sole owner of the assets and property inherited from his uncle and the profits derived therefrom. In this claim, the husband asserted <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span> that these assets were all subject to the <span style="font-style:italic">separazione dei bene</span> regime, that there was no intention on his part to give any property to the wife, and that the burden of proving that he did intend to make a gift rested with the wife. In his claim, the husband described the purchase of the London property in these terms:</p>

In the alternative, if the Italian court rejected her request for such a declaration, she requested that the court grant custody of I to her with limited contact with the husband, and order that the husband pay maintenance for the child plus her school fees. </p>

In respect of the Schedule 1 application, however, it was contended on behalf of the father that the court had no jurisdiction to entertain the application because the Italian court was seised of all financial matters relating to the divorce, including financial provision for the child which in turn included provision of school fees. District Judge Willans ordered the parties to instruct a single joint expert to advise as to whether Italy or England had jurisdiction with regard to school fees provision, and gave consequential case management directions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 22 March 2017, District Judge Jenkins made an order in the Schedule 1 proceedings in which he recorded his decision that the English court had jurisdiction relating to a school fees order and any future application for child maintenance, and that the Italian court did not have jurisdiction relating to those matters. The order provided case management directions leading to &#8220;an FDR style&#8221; hearing on 5 May 2017. The directions included arrangements for valuation of 68 properties owned by the father in Italy. The transcript of the hearing reveals that an expert report from Mrs Rebecca Bailey-Harris, a barrister and academic specialising in family law, on the issue of jurisdiction had been filed and served on the morning of the hearing in which, relying on the decision of the CJEU in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">A v B</span> (<ref href="#" uk:canonical="Case C-184/14" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case">Case C-184/14</ref>), she advised that jurisdiction lay with the courts of the country seised of proceedings relating to parental responsibility rather than &#8220;status&#8221; proceedings (i.e. relating to divorce or judicial separation). It seems that the husband and his lawyer had not seen the report before that morning, and the judge therefore adjourned the hearing until later in the morning to give them time to consider it. When the hearing resumed, it was briefly submitted on behalf of the father that the present case was distinguishable from the decision in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">A v B</span> because (according to the husband, though not accepted by the wife) the wife had herself applied for relief from the Italian court. The district judge indicated that he did not consider this to be a material distinction and that, in the light of the report, he was of the view that jurisdiction in respect of child maintenance lay with the courts of the country seised with proceedings relating to parental responsibility. He expressed his view in these terms:</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;it seems to me that, even if this mother had made an application to the Italian courts for exactly the same relief that she is seeking here, the points of principle that have been established in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">A v B</span> are that it does not really matter who has brought the proceedings, the question is a jurisdictional one, and questions of determination of jurisdiction and which of the national courts might be seised of that jurisdiction doesn&#8217;t depend on applications that individuals may have made but where the &#8230; substantive proceedings are currently proceeding, and where there are proceedings that deal with status, as there seems to be in the Italian courts, and proceedings here in relation to parental obligations, then the points of principle that have been determined seem to me to apply irrespective of who made the initial application where.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The ToLATA application was listed for a preliminary hearing before HH Judge Parfitt on 12 May 2017 to determine the question of jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the terms of the husband&#8217;s application for a stay, it was conceded on his behalf in the course of the hearing before Judge Parfitt that the ToLATA claim had as its subject matter title to English property and that as a result was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts. It was asserted on behalf of the wife that the husband&#8217;s Italian lawyers had made a similar concession in the context of the Italian proceedings. Judge Parfitt noted that the concession was well made, in the light of the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Magiera v Magiera</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2016/1292" uk:canonical="[2016] EWCA Civ 1292" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWCA Civ 1292</ref>. It was further conceded in the course of argument that, given the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts, there was no residual inherent jurisdiction to stay the proceedings on the grounds of <span style="font-style:italic">forum non conveniens</span>. The issue for Judge Parfitt to determine, therefore, was whether or not the court should stay the ToLATA claim to enable the issues to be dealt with in the context of the matrimonial proceedings.

Secondly, the normal exercise for that discretion would be to allow, or enable, the Court to consider what should happen to the jointly-owned home in the context of the wider discretionary and more holistic approach provided for by the financial remedies jurisdiction, rather than the more limited ToLATA jurisdiction. But that, in exercising the discretion, the Court should bear in mind in particular whether it is reasonable to leave the matter to be resolved within that context, and also in particular have regard to the likely timeframe, as well of course as in an exercise of any discretion, to have a very tight regard to the particular circumstances of the facts before the court. In the present case, it is not a situation where there are two sets of proceedings or are likely to be in the very short future, two sets of proceedings in this jurisdiction.</p>

Furthermore, on the particular facts of this case, he observed that it was difficult to see what substantive advantage the husband would gain from putting off these proceedings. His case was that the whole of the beneficial interest of the property belongs to him. It was the wife who asserted that the property was held on trust as set out in the TR1. He concluded that it was:</p>

Both parties were again in attendance with their lawyers. What precisely took place has again been a matter of dispute between the parties, in part because of issues over translation of the relevant documents. It is clear, however, that the parties were in disagreement as to whether the Italian court had jurisdiction to deal with issues relating to parental responsibility and child maintenance. On behalf of the wife, it was contended that jurisdiction lay with the English court because I was habitually resident in this country. On behalf of the husband, it was contended that jurisdiction lay with the Italian court because the issues were ancillary to the judicial separation proceedings. According to the husband, however, the wife&#8217;s lawyer indicated in the course of the hearing that her client accepted the jurisdiction of the Italian court to avoid further delay.

I adjourned the applications, giving further directions, including for the translation all applications, statements and orders from the Italian proceedings, the cost to be borne by the husband in the first instance. The translation of the documents continued to give rise to disagreement between the parties, and on 7 November, I gave further directions concerning that matter. Notwithstanding those directions, the issues were unresolved by the the next hearing on 10 November. I therefore adjourned the hearing again to 26 January 2018. I recorded that the court was of the view that translation of the Italian documents was necessary for the determination of the appeals but that, in the interests of justice, the translations had to be provided by 12 January 2018 and that, if they were not so provided, unless the date was varied by further court order, the applications for permission to appeal should stand dismissed. At the hearing, the husband also undertook to pay the school fees and all reasonable extras for the child as they fell due pending determination of the appeal, without prejudice to any ongoing proceedings in England or Italy.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his statement, Signor Giambrone stated that the first phase of Italian judicial separation proceedings, known as the &#8220;Presidential Phase&#8221;, involves a preliminary hearing and investigation leading to an order authorising the parties to separate, and consideration of urgent and interim measures. After the Presidential Phase, the case is transferred to a trial judge who will deal with the matter as any contested civil claim. The final order in separation or divorce proceedings is made by a panel of three judges, known as &#8220;the Collegio&#8221;. In this case, the Presidential Phase concluded with the order of Judge Giannone in February 2018 and the appeal therefrom which led to the order of 9 May 2018. Signor Giambrone points out that both the order of Judge Giannone dated 12 February 2018 and the order of the Turin Appeal court dated 9 May 2018 refer to the fact that the final decision as to jurisdiction rests with the Collegio. He states that the parties&#8217; respective positions remain the same - the husband, relying on the &#8220;principle of prorogation&#8221; in Article 12 of Brussels IIA, contending that the Italian court has jurisdiction on all matters as a result of the wife&#8217;s express acceptance of that jurisdiction is recorded in the order dated 22 May 2017 and 30 August 2017, whereas the wife, relying on the &#8220;principle of proximity&#8221; contends that the Italian court should cede jurisdiction in respect of matters related to parental responsibility, including child maintenance, to the English court on the basis that I is habitually resident in London. Signor Giambrone contends that whether the principle of prorogation or the principle of proximity should take precedence is not a matter for this court as it is a live issue to be determined by the Italian court in due course.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Signor Giambrone also draws attention to the fact that, following the Turin appeal court decision on 9 May 2018, his client, the husband, has filed a further statement in the Italian separation proceedings seeking exclusive custody over I and an order that she should mainly reside with him. In response, whilst continuing to contest the Italian court&#8217;s jurisdiction, the wife has responded by asking the court, in the alternative, to order that she should have sole custody. Signor Giambrone contends that the position adopted by both parties before the Italian court is therefore relevant to this appeal. In addition, he points out that the Italian trial judge has wide powers to make orders in relation to the assignment of the former matrimonial home and can order that the child shall live at that property with the custodial parent. He adds that there is no specific statutory provision or case law in Italy which prevents the judge making orders in respect of the matrimonial home located overseas. He therefore contends that this is a further reason for staying the English ToLATA proceedings. He concludes by inviting the court &#8220;for the sake of clarity&#8221; to set aside all interim orders and judgments made within the Schedule 1 and the ToLATA proceedings.</p>

It is true that a judgment for the purposes of Brussels I is final even if an appeal is pending &#8230;. But the object of Article 27 is to prevent irreconcilable judgments, and as a matter of policy it would be very odd if proceedings in the court second seised could continue even if on appeal the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established. Consequently, we consider (contrary to the view of the judge) that Article 27 applies until the proceedings in the court first seised are finally determined in relation to its jurisdiction. That would mean that the expression in Article 27 (1) &#8216;until such time as the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established&#8217; should be interpreted to include the case where the court first seised has to be clear that it has no jurisdiction, but an appeal is pending against that decision and that it would be unsatisfactory for the matter to be dealt with through a discretionary stay in the court seised second.&#8221;</p>

On 19 May 2016, the mother took the children to Poland and on 2 June 2016, started custody proceedings in a court in that country. On 29 June, while those proceedings were still pending, the father removed the children back to England, and subsequently on 4 July, at a hearing without notice to the mother, obtained a child arrangements order and a prohibited steps order from the Family Court in Brighton. On 14 July, the Polish court declined jurisdiction on the basis that the children were habitually resident in England. At the return hearing of the father&#8217;s application in Brighton on 18 July, the mother informed the court that proceedings in Poland were pending, but not that her application had been dismissed. The English court stayed its proceedings, making provisional orders preventing the children being removed from the jurisdiction, save for the purposes of a court hearing. On 30 July, the mother removed the children to Poland (ostensibly for the purposes of a court hearing), where they have remained ever since. On 1 August, the mother applied to the Polish court to review its decision of 14 July and assume jurisdiction. On 5 August, the Polish court granted her application, set aside the earlier order and accepted jurisdiction. Subsequently, an application by the father under the Hague Child Abduction Convention was dismissed by the Polish court which held <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span> that the children were not habitually resident in England on the date of their removal by the mother. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In March 2017, the father applied for the stay of his English Children Act proceedings to be lifted. In June 2017, the Polish appeal court upheld the dismissal of the father&#8217;s child abduction application. The father&#8217;s application for the lifting of the stay of the English proceedings came before Mostyn J who held on 14 November 2017 that the English court had exclusive jurisdiction and ordered the mother to return the children to this country. In his judgment, Mostyn J held <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span> that the children had been habitually resident in England on 2 June and 4 July 2016 and that the decision of the Polish court dated 14 July 2016 that the children were then habitually resident in England was correct. He further held that the mother&#8217;s application to the Polish court dated 1 August 2016 was not an appeal but a new application which should have been stayed by the Polish court pursuant to Article 19(2) of Brussels IIA. Having reviewed the evidence, he declared that the decision of the Polish court in December 2016 in relation to habitual residence was incorrect and that there was nothing in the judgment of the Polish appeal court in June 2017 &#8220;explaining how it could rationally have been accepted that at the relevant time the children were habitually resident in Poland&#8221;. In his judgement, it followed that, although the Polish court had been first seised on 2 June 2016, it lost that seisin when the proceedings were not served on the father and in any event by 14 July 2016, when the mother&#8217;s application was dismissed. It re-acquired seisin on 1 August 2016 but that seisin was subservient to the seisin by then established in the English court on 4 July 2016. Accordingly, the Family Court in England had exclusive jurisdiction to determine the welfare proceedings upon the basis of Article 8. The mother, who had not attended the hearing before Mostyn J, applied to the judge to set aside his decision but her application was refused.</p>

In my view, these remarks cannot be regarded as observational or incidental, but were integral to the judge&#8217;s critique of the approach of the Polish court and to his conclusion that exclusive jurisdiction lay with the English court. Whatever its merits, the critique amounted in a review of jurisdiction and a substance that was impermissible by virtue of Articles 24 and 26.&#8221;</p>

The case concerned an Italian couple who had lived in England during their marriage, where their two children were born. When the marriage broke down, the husband started proceedings in the Italian court seeking a declaration of separation and shared custody of the children, on the basis that they resided with the wife. Within those proceedings, he proposed to pay a sum towards the children&#8217;s education and healthcare. The wife contested the jurisdiction of the Italian court on issues of parental responsibility on the grounds that they were habitually resident in England and that the courts of this country therefore had jurisdiction in respect of such issues under Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) 2201/2003 (&#8220;Brussels IIA&#8221;). The Italian court held that it had jurisdiction to entertain the legal separation proceedings but not in respect of matters of parental responsibility. It further held that, whilst it had jurisdiction to entertain proceedings concerning spousal maintenance on the ground that it was a matter ancillary to status proceedings, it lacked jurisdiction to rule on the children&#8217;s maintenance as that matter was ancillary to the proceedings concerning parental responsibility. The husband appealed the judgment and the Italian appeal court sought a preliminary ruling from the CJEU. That court held that Article 3(c) and (d) of the Maintenance Regulation must be interpreted as meaning that, where a court of a Member State was seised of proceedings involving the separation or dissolution of a marriage between the parents of a minor child, and a court of another Member State was seised of proceedings in matters of parental responsibility involving the same child, an application relating to maintenance concerning that child was ancillary only to the proceedings concerning parental responsibility, within the meaning of Article 3 (d) of that Regulation.

The Court of Appeal rejected her argument, holding, following the decision in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Webb</span>, that the ToLATA proceedings did not fall within Article 22 because they were not based upon rights <span style="font-style:italic">in rem</span> but upon rights <span style="font-style:italic">in personam</span> and there was nothing in dispute which required any on the spot investigations or enquiries. The Court further held that it was self-evident that the ToLATA proceedings and the French ancillary relief proceedings were not the same causes of action but, rather, related actions pending in different Member States. As a result, the Court was not obliged to stay the proceedings under Article 22 of Brussels I but rather had a discretion to stay the proceedings under Article 28 of Brussels I (which contained provisions in identical terms to Article 30 of Brussels I Recast). On the facts of that case, the court concluded that there was a risk of irreconcilable judgments, given that the wife&#8217;s application for financial provision in France was fundamentally focused on the husband&#8217;s ownership of various properties, including the London properties, and given that the object of the ToLATA application was to achieve an equitable share.</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220; &#8230; I find it hard to conceive that where a married couple are engaged in contested ancillary relief proceedings, the application of a ToLATA claim by one against the other could possibly be justified. As the decision of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">White v White</span> makes plain, issues between a husband and wife are to be determined within the four corners of the Matrimonial Causes Act and on the application of the statutory criteria that are set out. The issue of separate proceedings to establish relatively arcane questions as to equitable entitlement between them is deprecated. I cannot see how that general proposition can be dis-applied simply because the ancillary relief proceedings have been instituted in one Member State and the parties to the proceedings are not both attached to that jurisdiction.&#8221;</p>

It would be quite inconsistent with the objectives and underlying policy of Brussels IIA were we now to say in the exercise of the discretion that it was perfectly in order for the wife to bring civil proceedings in this jurisdiction which only thinly disguise their true competitive objectives.&#8221;</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;I am clear that, confronted with an application under ToLATA between separated spouses, the court should embark upon the discretionary exercise by asking itself whether the issue raised by the application can reasonably be left to be resolved within an application for ancillary relief following divorce. It is in principle much more desirable that an issue, as here, about sale of the home should be resolved within an application for ancillary relief. For there the court will undertake a holistic examination of all aspects of the parties' finances, needs, contributions etc; will devise the fairest set of arrangements for the future housing and finances of each of them; and, to that end, will provide for the transfer of capital, as well perhaps as for payment of future income, from one to the other. By an order under ToLATA, on the other hand, the court lays down only one piece of the jigsaw, namely that the home be sold, without its being able to survey the whole picture by laying down the others. So at this threshold stage of the enquiry into an application under ToLATA between spouses the court will, in particular, have regard to the question whether, within a time-frame tolerable in all the circumstances, the parties will become able to apply for ancillary relief. Furthermore if, at first sight, there appears to the court to be any measurable chance that, on an application for ancillary relief made within that time-frame, the respondent to the application for an order for sale under ToLATA will be able to preserve her or his occupation of the home by securing an outright transfer of ownership of it or a variation of the trust, it is hard to conceive that an order for sale would reflect a proper exercise of discretion.&#8221; </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Leech and Ms O&#8217;Malley submitted that the effect of Italy being seised with the matrimonial status proceedings is that the &#8220;primary jurisdiction&#8221; in all financial matters lies with the Italian court. It is not disputed that Italy is seised of issues relating to spousal maintenance. So far as I&#8217;s maintenance is concerned, Mr Leech and Ms O&#8217;Malley relied principally on the fact that Italy was first seised of the issue by virtue of the husband&#8217;s petition for legal separation and that the wife&#8217;s application under Schedule 1 was second in time. In their initial argument at the hearing in January 2018, they submitted that, under article 12 of the Maintenance Regulation, it was therefore for the Italian court to decide as to its jurisdiction and that the English court, as the court second seised, had no option but to stay the proceedings pending the Italian court&#8217;s enquiry into its jurisdiction and only assume jurisdiction in the event that the Italian court declares that it has no jurisdiction. Accordingly, they submitted that the order made by District Judge Willans on 9 January 2017 giving directions for a hearing of the application under Schedule 1 fell foul of Article 12(1) of the Maintenance Regulation and should not have been made. Similarly, the hearing before District Judge Jenkins on 22 March 2017, which is the subject of the current appeal, infringed Article 12(1). Mr Leech and Ms O&#8217;Malley point out that Article 12(1) was not cited to, nor considered by, the district judge. They submit that, had the judge been referred to that Article, he would not have made the observations quoted at paragraph 19 above.</p>

As recorded on the face of the order made by Judge Arisio on 22 May 2017, she seemingly abandoned her challenge to the Italian court&#8217;s jurisdiction, thereby empowering the court to rule on all issues concerning parental responsibility. It was submitted that the facts of the present case are materially different from those in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">A v B</span>. In that case, the wife had immediately disputed the jurisdiction of the Italian court, whereas, in the present case, the wife had expressly accepted the jurisdiction of the Italian court by filing a counter-petition and making specific requests for child maintenance and school fees. Mr Leech and Ms O&#8217;Malley noted that the wife had apparently renewed her challenge to the Italian court&#8217;s jurisdiction at the hearing in Turin in December 2017 but, at the date of the hearing before me in January 2018, Judge Giannone had not delivered her judgment. Accordingly, it was submitted at that point that the Schedule 1 proceedings should be stayed and the appeal therefore allowed.</p>

Mr Leech and Ms O&#8217;Malley relied, however, on the statement of Signor Giambrone, which they contended was the only admissible evidence before the court as to the Italian proceedings. They submitted that his statement makes it clear that, notwithstanding Judge Giannone&#8217;s decision and the subsequent decision of the Turin appeal court upholding that decision, the issue of jurisdiction remains pending before the Italian court so that nothing has changed since the hearing in January 2018. In oral argument, Mr Leech drew attention in particular to the fact that, subsequent to the decision of the appeal court in May 2018, the wife&#8217;s Italian lawyer in his latest submission for the trial judge and the Collegio had advanced arguments as to the question of jurisdiction on matters relating to parental responsibility and also, in the alternative, arguments as to merits of those issues. </p>

She argued, however, that the husband&#8217;s petition for judicial separation makes clear that the Italian court will only be asked to make &#8220;provisional and urgent measures&#8221;. Ms Jackson further pointed out that, in her response to the husband&#8217;s petition, dated 29 October 2016, the wife averred that jurisdiction in respect of all matters relating to the child, including living arrangements and financial support, should lie with the English courts and not in Italy.

Ms Jackson submitted that the minute of the hearing demonstrates that the wife&#8217;s Italian lawyer waved his objections to the Italian court&#8217;s jurisdiction only for the purposes of urgent and interim orders, given the serious financial circumstances at that time. Ms Jackson submitted that the order made by Judge Arisio on 22 May 2017 following that hearing confirmed that the wife&#8217;s acceptance of the Italian court&#8217;s jurisdiction related only to urgent and provisional measures. She submitted that it is manifestly not the case that the wife has accepted &#8220;expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner&#8221; the jurisdiction of the Italian courts in relation to matters relating to parental responsibility so as to vest the Italian courts with jurisdiction under Article 12 of Brussels IIA. On the contrary, the wife has expressly objected to the Italian courts exercising jurisdiction save in respect of interim and urgent matters. Furthermore, Ms Jackson submitted that the Italian courts cannot exercise jurisdiction under Article 12 because it is manifestly not in I&#8217;s interests for matters relating to parental responsibility to be determined in Italy, given that (a) I has lived in England since 2010 and is habitually resident here; (b) all of her education has taken place in this country; (c) there have been extensive proceedings under the Children Act relating to child arrangements, including a fact-finding hearing; (d) there has been an assessment by a Cafcass officer who has interviewed I; and (e) litigating in Italy would involve considerable cost and inconvenience for the mother who cannot afford either the expense or, as I&#8217;s primary carer, the time.</p>

She submitted that this is entirely consistent with the basis of jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility under Article 8 of Brussels IIA which provides that such jurisdiction lies with the courts of the Member State where the child is habitually resident. In addition, the husband&#8217;s acceptance of the jurisdiction of the English court has been unequivocal and furthermore plainly in the best interests of the child.</p>

She submitted that it was now clear that, insofar as the Italian court had been first seised of any issues regarding parental responsibility, and an ancillary claim for financial support for the child, it had definitively declined jurisdiction. She contended that there was no significance in the way in which the wife&#8217;s Italian lawyer had drafted his latest argument for the Collegio.

There was no admissible evidence as to the powers available to the Italian court or the nature and scope of the financial proceedings there. The concession made by counsel who appeared for the husband before Judge Parfitt was erroneous. In circumstances where it should have been clear that Italy was the court of primary jurisdiction, the English court ought to have made enquiries as to the Italian proceedings before reaching a conclusion on the application for a stay. The Italian property proceedings in Italy are well advanced. A principal issue in those proceedings is the extent of the wife&#8217;s interest, if any, in the funds utilised to purchase the land and property and whether or not there was any intention to gift an interest to her. Any findings made by the English court in the ToLATA proceedings will have no effect on the issue in the Italian proceedings which will determine the parties&#8217; respective interests. It is submitted that allowing the ToLATA claim to proceed runs the real risk of incompatible rulings as to the beneficial interests in the London property and that the ToLATA claim is a costly and pointless exercise. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of the wife, Ms Jackson submitted that jurisdiction in respect of proceedings concerning ownership of the London property is determined by Article 24 of Brussels 1 Recast, since the proceedings &#8220;have as their object rights <span style="font-style:italic">in rem</span> in immovable property&#8221;. She contended that the property rights at issue in the ToLATA proceedings are plainly not rights &#8220;arising out of a matrimonial relationship&#8221; so as to place the proceedings outside the Recast Regulation. The parties&#8217; proprietary rights in the London property arise out of their joint purchase and the declaration of trust in the TR1 document that the beneficial interests of the property were to be held by the parties as joint tenants. Ms Jackson relied on the decisions in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Magiera</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Komu</span> as authority for her submission that the wife&#8217;s ToLATA claim concerns rights <span style="font-style:italic">in rem</span> in immovable property, arguing that the facts of the present case are on all fours with the facts in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Magiera</span> but distinguishable from those in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Prazic</span>. She submitted that the argument advanced on behalf of the husband that the real issue at the heart of the ToLATA claim is the extent of the wife&#8217;s beneficial interest in the London property is inaccurate. The TR1 document recording the wife&#8217;s 50% beneficial interest in the property is an express declaration of trust which is conclusive as to the parties&#8217; beneficial interests, absent fraud or mistake: <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Goodman v Gallant</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1986] 1 FLR 513" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1986">[1986] 1 FLR 513</ref>, <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Pankhania v Chandegra</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2012/1438" uk:canonical="[2012] EWCA Civ 1438" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWCA Civ 1438</ref>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Jackson pointed out that, in his application to the Italian court for declaratory relief in respect of the assets inherited from his uncle, the husband has not sought any order in respect of the former matrimonial home in London, although he referred in documents filed with that court to the property having been purchased using funds received from the inheritance. When the wife applied to the Italian court for a stay of the husband&#8217;s application for declaratory relief in so far as it related to the London property which was the subject of the ToLATA claim, the husband opposed the application on the grounds that the two sets of proceedings were dealing with different subject matters and that the Italian proceedings concerned the determination of the ownership of property not including the London property. It was expressly conceded by the husband through the Italian lawyers that, regarding the ownership of the share of the London property, jurisdiction was held exclusively by the English court. Having considered submissions at the hearing on 1 June 2017, Judge Perego, as described above at paragraph 28, refused the application for a stay, holding that the issues before the Italian court differed from those in the ToLATA proceedings in England, noting that husband had clarified his case in a memorandum filed for that hearing. Ms Jackson submitted that it is emphatically clear from the minute of the proceedings in Turin on 1 June 2017 that the Italian court has declined to exercise any jurisdiction in respect of the London property and that the husband has expressly stated in the course of those proceedings that jurisdiction to deal with the issues of the ownership of the London property lies exclusively with the English courts. Ms Jackson submitted that in those circumstances the fact that the Italian property proceedings are well advanced is irrelevant and that there is no prospect of irreconcilable judgments arising in respect of the London property.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Jackson submitted that the concession made on behalf of the husband before Judge Parfitt that the Italian court did not have power to make any orders in relation to the London property was well-founded and in line with the concession in documents filed in the Italian property proceedings and confirmed a few days later in the hearing before Judge Perego. The ambit of the husband&#8217;s argument before Judge Parfitt was therefore limited to a submission that he should exercise his discretion to grant a stay on the basis that the wife might at a later date have recourse to an application under Part III of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref>. Ms Jackson submitted that the judge&#8217;s decision that it seemed preferable to deal with the issue of the property sooner rather than later was entirely within his discretion, and not undermined by his error in stating that an application under Part III would not be open to the wife before the grant of a decree of divorce rather than a decree of separation. She submitted that the judge&#8217;s reasoning was understandable, given the position on the ground with a wife and I living in rented accommodation which consumed the majority of the wife&#8217;s monthly income. There was a clear urgency mediating firmly against the granting of a stay simply on the basis that the wife <span style="font-style:italic">might</span>, at some indeterminate point in the future, be able to make a claim in the English courts. Furthermore, given the potential for a claim by the wife under Part III to exceed the value of her current claim under ToLATA, it was plainly open to the judge to conclude that the husband&#8217;s motivation for seeking a stay of the ToLATA claim was to achieve a procedural advantage. </p>

Article 19(2) of Brussels IIA clearly establishes that the court second seised shall of its own motion stay proceedings until such time as the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established. In this case, however, Judge Giannone has clearly ruled that the Italian court has no jurisdiction over matters of parental responsibility and her decision has been upheld by the appeal court in Turin. The position at present, therefore, is that the Italian court has declined jurisdiction to make orders in respect of parental responsibility. </p>

I do not regard the fact that the Italian Collegio at the final hearing will give an ultimate ruling on the question of jurisdiction as requiring the English court to stay proceedings any longer. The position is, in my judgement, markedly different from that which existed in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re M</span>. The Italian court has declined jurisdiction and, if the English court were still required to stay proceedings, it would mean that no forum would be available for the parties to determine matters of parental responsibility or child maintenance. The courts must adopt a sensible and pragmatic approach to jurisdictional rules. A party cannot be without a remedy. The Italian court has declined jurisdiction in unequivocal terms. Accordingly, this court is entitled to exercise jurisdiction.</p>

I is habitually resident in this country. The issue of parental responsibility has been before the English court for a prolonged period. Until November 2017, the husband did not object to the English court&#8217;s jurisdiction. On the contrary, he expressly accepted it before Judge Willans on 9 January 2017. He participated fully in the proceedings, taking an active part in the fact-finding hearing and co-operating, at least initially, with the consequential directions designed to address the findings made against him. In her judgment dated 12 February 2018, Judge Giannone stated that the jurisdiction had been expressly accepted by the husband at the hearing in West London on 17 October 2016. As stated above, I can see no recital recording such an express acceptance in the order made on that occasion, although it can plainly be inferred from the rest of the order. As recorded by the Italian appeal court in its order dated 9 May 2018, however, the subsequent order of the West London court dated January 2017 does contain an express declaration that the parties agreed that the English court had jurisdiction in respect of all matters about where the child should live and what contact she should have with her father. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is difficult to see any basis upon which any Italian court could possibly conclude that jurisdiction was prorogued under Article 12 of Brussels IIA. A key requirement is that jurisdiction must have been accepted &#8220;in an unequivocal manner by the spouses and by the holders of parental responsibility, at the time the court is seised&#8221;. As set out above at paragraph 68, all three EU Regulations under consideration contain identical provisions as to the date of &#8220;seising&#8221; &#8211; in effect, when the application originating the proceedings was filed. In this case, the jurisdiction of the Italian court to make orders concerning parental responsibility was not accepted on an unequivocal basis by both parties at the time the Italian court was seised. On the contrary, all the evidence indicates that the wife did not accept that jurisdiction. In her response to the husband&#8217;s separation petition, she expressly challenged the jurisdiction of the Italian court. Furthermore, she had by that stage already issued proceedings in the West London Family Court under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.8</ref> of the Children Act. The fact that, at one stage, she invited the court to accept jurisdiction for the purpose of making urgent orders manifestly does not satisfy the requirements of Article 12 that the jurisdiction of the court be accepted expressly or otherwise in unequivocal manner at the time the court is seised. In any event, Article 12(1) further requires that the prorogation of jurisdiction must be in the superior interests of the child. I respectfully agree with the analysis of the Italian appeal court that it is in the best interests of the child for the English courts to continue to exercise jurisdiction in respect of parental responsibility.</p>

On the contrary, it was expressly conceded before him by the husband&#8217;s representative that a claim in respect of the property was exclusively within the jurisdiction of the English court.

In any event, if the husband wishes to argue that the property should be retained for family purposes, it will be open to him to put forward such an argument in opposing the wife&#8217;s application for sale within the ToLATA proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During the period while I have been considering my decision, the court has received emails direct from the wife asserting that the husband is in breach of his undertaking given to this court on 10 November 2017 to maintain payment of the school fees pending determination of this appeal. I am in no position to decide whether she is correct in that assertion. But for that reason, and others, it is plainly desirable that the issue returns to court as soon as possible and I shall therefore direct that the wife&#8217;s application under Schedule 1 be listed for an urgent hearing in the West London Family Court before HH Judge Rowe QC, the designated family judge. It may well be that the judge will decide to consider at the same hearing further  ongoing case management directions in the child arrangements proceedings which are not directly before this court.  That is entirely a matter for her.</p>

If they are unable to agree, they must each submit written submissions, incorporating the terms of the order(s) for which they contend, by 9.30 on the morning when judgment is to be handed down. It will then be unnecessary for any party to attend at that hearing.</p>
