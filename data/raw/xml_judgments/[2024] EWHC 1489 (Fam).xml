The appeal is opposed by the respondent husband, NN, who is represented by Fiona Stewart, Counsel, who did not appear at first instance.

The respondent filed a Respondent&#8217;s Notice on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2023 seeking to uphold the decision on the basis of different or additional reasons although these were not set out in the Respondent&#8217;s Notice which rather simply cross-referred to the respondent&#8217;s composite skeleton argument.</p>

It will be seen from earlier that the parties had spent (depending on whose figures are relied upon) either all or nearly all of the equity on legal fees. W&#8217;s fees had largely been paid by a loan from her family &#163;43k with some &#163;17k outstanding and other loans/CC giving hard debts of &#163;26k. H had borrowed &#163;80k from family in addition to  owing legal fees of around &#163;47k together with an HMRC bill of &#163;54k and credit cards etc which gave him a total of hard debt of around &#163;140k. Thus, even allowing for the soft nature of the &#8216;family&#8217; loans after providing for hard debts the clear capital was only in the &#163;60-70k region. </p>

This was based on H&#8217;s argument that having had a cancerous lump removed in 2021, he had changed his outlook on life. H admitted in cross examination that if he needed more money, he would get another job that paid more. The judge asked himself if H had the capacity to earn more and found that H could. However, having found that, the judge then ruled that H shouldn&#8217;t have to. S.25 (2)(a) requires the court to consider whether it was reasonable to expect H to increase his earning capacity. The evidence suggested that H could and should do so.  The court should not have contemplated the Husband taking his foot off the pedal in this way and should have ascribed an earning capacity to him closer to that which he earned during the marriage - &#163;74k net per annum.</span></p>

In particular she reminded me that this was an ex-tempore judgment given at the conclusion of 2 days of evidence and submissions and that it was a classic example of such a judgment where an appellate court must accept a degree of imprecision of analysis or explanation unless it could be shown that the Judge was manifestly wrong. In particular she emphasised that this was a case where the parties had an equal need for housing, and that the judge&#8217;s conclusions left both with housing but with the Wife with the lion&#8217;s share of the available capital. She emphasised that the Appellant was not directly challenging any findings of fact, save the attribution of H&#8217;s earning capacity   and that the judge&#8217;s conclusions on the facts were therefore undisturbed and that there was no basis for going behind them.

The judge correctly concluded that spousal maintenance was not payable on H&#8217;s current salary and it would not have altered had WC been sold. The judge considered the parties&#8217; respective earning capacities and the judge should not have ordered periodical payments on that basis. It was not a binary choice of leaving the husband with WC or providing W with periodical payments. The judge was right to give the Husband the opportunity to buy out the Wife in accordance with authorities and to run the risks associated with doing so. That met his housing need which was correctly prioritised over periodical payments to the Wife and he could not have met his housing needs had it been sold.  The approach to housing and periodical payments was consistent with the authorities on short marriages. As it happens H has now found a way to finance the house to remain there. </p>

It seems clear that the judgment was given under some pressure of time at the conclusion of a 2 day hearing. It was delivered very soon &#8211; if not immediately-  after closing submissions had been heard. The judgment follows a fairly familiar structure. At paragraph 7 the judge identifies 5 key issues; what constitutes a matrimonial asset, what are the earning capacities of the parties; whether litigation conduct is relevant; the ultimate division of the assets and whether it is a clean break case or not. Whilst it may be said that the meeting of the housing needs of the Wife and child and the husband are incorporated into &#8216;ultimate division&#8217; the issue which seems most obvious from the documents are how the housing needs of the parties are to be met having regard to their respective earning capacities and the assets and the liabilities. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The majority of the judgment contains a consideration of the section 25 factors. The priority afforded to the welfare of the child and the need for accommodation receives a brief reference, but the majority of the judgment is taken up with consideration of the Husband&#8217;s earning capacity. The Wife&#8217;s earning capacity is dealt with briefly and the judge concludes that it is reasonable to assume that within a year she will return to full earning capacity notwithstanding the medical and child-care issues. The Husband&#8217;s earning capacity receives &#8211; understandably given the way the Wife put her case much more extensive treatment. At paragraph 29 the judge accepts the Husband&#8217;s work-life balance explanation for becoming an employee. The judge says he will return to this again &#8211; I read this to mean in relation to his future earning capacity.  Later he poses the questions whether it is reasonable for him to exercise the ability to increase his earning capacity &#8211; the Husband having said he would look for another job if he needed to increase his income to pay increased mortgage payments. The judge concludes his net income during the marriage was &#163;74k pa. He rejects the Wife&#8217;s arguments that there are hidden income streams, saying that he cannot determine where the &#163;80k to pay the husbands costs came from and he rejects the Wife&#8217;s case that the Husband has hidden bank accounts, another company or is continuing to work for his former client; this is where misdirection comes into play. By the time the judge reaches the end of his consideration of income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources he has not returned to his conclusion on the Husband&#8217;s earning capacity going forward and whether it would be reasonable for him to increase it. Paragraph 40 does not address it amongst the other conclusions. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the section on financial needs, obligations and responsibilities the judge confirms the priority to be given to housing the Wife and child and the housing need of the Husband but there is no explicit recognition that if the needs of both cannot be met, that it is those of the child and their primary carer which will be prioritised. The judge concludes that the Husband on his &#8216;[<span style="font-style:italic">income] at the moment is &#163;65k</span>&#8217; cannot afford to pay periodical payments as he doesn&#8217;t have the means on his outgoings &#8216;at the moment&#8217;. When dealing with periodical payments the judge says <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;&#8230; there is significant uncertainty going forward as to where W&#8217;s income may go, I may be wrong about the 12month point it may take longer. It may well be H goes back into Project Management and suddenly finds himself earning types of figures he has been earning historically.&#8217; </span>On that basis the judge concludes the Wife should have an insurance policy in nominal periodical payments. The other aspects of s.25 are dealt with in appropriately brief terms.</p>

In the context of a case with these figures &#163;80k is a very material number. In a brief discussion the judge concludes the Wife can re-house for &#163;250k which can be achieved as rehearsed above and that the Husband should be left with WC with sufficient equity that if he is forced to sell will leave him enough to pay off HMRC. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">  The task facing a judge of the FRC in a case such as this is not an easy one. A two day time estimate with a Bundle in excess of 2500 pages and allegations of non-disclosure and tight finances presents a significant challenge. Delivering an ex-tempore judgment at the conclusion of 2 full days inevitably means that the judgment is likely to be less structured, less detailed in its survey of facts and arguments and less comprehensive in its evaluation of the relevant factors and the ways in which the permutations before the court are considered and either accepted or rejected. Clearly this case had been hotly fought and a host of issues put in play and so the judge&#8217;s task was an unenviable one even for an experienced FRC judge. I am for those reasons, and more, generally  conscious that it is not the role of the appellate court to substitute its own view for that reached by a judge after consideration of the oral evidence and to prefer one imperfect solution to another; nor should the court subject an extempore judgment to a detailed textual analysis so as to illustrate an error which might provide a basis for saying the judgment is wrong. The judge has seen the witnesses, read much evidence and his judgment must be accepted as having a surrounding and unexpressed penumbra.  A judge such as Recorder Howling is entitled to a considerable margin of appreciation  in such a judgment but ultimately must identify the issues, explain his reasons in sufficient detail for the parties and court to understand how he reached the decisions he did and must operate within the parameters set by the appellate authorities in directing himself appropriately, determining the issues necessary to reach a decision and in determining those issues weigh the relevant factors in a way which is justifiable and thus ultimately reaching a conclusion which was a permissible one.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span class="cf01" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">It is clear that the judge&#8217;s self-direction is a mis-direction and thus an error of law. The only circumstances in which the criminal standard of proof is applicable in a financial remedy case would be in relation to 'committal'. Fraud or other dishonesty is subject to the same balance of probabilities standard as any other factual issue even if issues of fraud should not be pleaded without an evidential basis. In this case the evidence clearly provided a basis on which to pursue allegations of non-disclosure, dishonesty or possible suppression of income or financial resource. The issue the judge was considering at the relevant point in the judgment was the Wife&#8217;s case that the Husband was not being honest about his actual income and that the new PAYE position with a 'friend' was part of a tactic to depress his income for the court proceedings. The Wife alleged that he had hidden bank accounts, was working for his previous employer or had another company. These were all part of the Wife's case that the Husband was painting a misleading or dishonest picture of his finances which was relevant both to the extent of his resources (the &#163;75k + to pay his legal fees or the late emerging &#163;85k to buy her out) and his future earnings. There was much evidence on which she was entitled to rely &#8211; not least the recording of the conversation in which the Husband said he would hide assets and his forging her signature. In the relevant passage the Judge does refer also to whether it is established on the balance of probabilities and Ms Stewart relies on that to submit the misdirection does not have any impact on the actual outcome because the judge also applied the correct test. That he says this is true but it begs the question of what he is thinking when referring to criminal standard and to what degree that may have influenced his thinking in other components, The judge refers to it also in para 30 in this way &#8216;</span><span class="cf01" style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Can I fairly draw the inference that H has lied to the court and has lied to his wife and has</span><span class="cf01" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> </span><span class="cf11" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">committed another effective fraud by failing to disclose the bank account? I can&#8217;t see that I can&#8230;. Can I believe his oral evidence? There is nothing to say I shouldn&#8217;t. I am uncomfortable on this point&#8230;. I don&#8217;t think I have an evidential basis on which I can actually reach a conclusion&#8230;. So I am making no findings on what I have been asked to by Mr Jeffrey. He may say I am ducking the point , how on the balance of probabilities can I reach a conclusion? I can&#8217;t". </span><span class="cf01" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> It is not entirely clear whether the judge is saying he is unable to reach a conclusion at this point or whether he is saying the Wife has not proved her case - the overall sense of the paragraph is that the judge is left in a state of uncertainty and is unable to make a conclusion one way or the other. This is unsatisfactory when the sum involved is something like 25% of the total possible assets. If it was a family loan that had consequences as to how it impacted on the Husband&#8217;s resources going forwards &#8211; if in fact it was from an undisclosed bank account it had profound implications for the Husband&#8217;s credibility and the courts evaluation of financial resources that might be available to him to discharge debts or meet his housing needs. The Husband was under a duty to provide full and frank disclosure of his financial resources and if he had been loaned &#163;80k by family/friends ought to have produced that evidence but he had not. The way the paragraph is expressed along with other observations in the judgment such as </span><span class="cf11" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">'If one wished to be harsh it could be said to be a fraud on HMRC</span><span class="cf01" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">' point to a judicial reticence to identify dishonesty save where the evidence forced that conclusion  - which would be more consistent with an approach of being 'sure' rather than being the appropriate 'more probable than not&#8217; standard. In dealing with the Husband&#8217;s credibility the judge seems to accept that all the concerns about his honesty (forgery, misleading HMRC (at best), misrepresenting his income to the WC mortgagor) were explained by naivety. This was a conclusion based on the Judge&#8217;s evaluation of the Husband&#8217;s demeanour in giving evidence. Although the judge directs himself correctly about being cautious  about judging credibility based on demeanour in court, overall the conclusion the Husband is naive rather than dishonest can only come from his demeanour in court as the other documentary evidence strongly supports the argument the Husband was indeed dishonest and financially manipulative and the judge does not explain how it is that this documentary record of dishonesty (together with non-disclosure and alleged non-compliance with disclosure requests) is displaced to result in a finding of naivety. This also suggests a judicial reluctance to apply a more likely than not approach but a rather higher standard which ends up in this case with a conclusion of naivety not dishonesty generally, a non-finding on a significant resource and no finding of fraud based on the criminal and civil standard.   Taken in its entirety I accept the Appellant&#8217;s case that the mis-direction is such that it affects the confidence which one can place in the other components of the judgment. As with procedural irregularity cases where the court may not require a party to specifically identify the consequence of the procedural irregularity in rendering the decision unjust so in this case I am driven to the conclusion that the judge's approach to the evaluation of the Husband&#8217;s evidence, its honesty and reliability was tainted by an approach that sought a higher quality of evidence or higher level of proof than the simple more likely than not standard. </span></p>

That though is one of the dangers of a compartmentalised approach. The court must at the end of the process of looking at the s.25 criteria stand back and look at the case in the round - in all the circumstances &#8211; to reach a conclusion. When one adds all the compartments together in this case and looks at the case as a whole, I am satisfied that the judge was in error. This is not a case where the judge preferred one imperfect solution over another but where it seems clear that in various respects the judge gave undue weight to some aspects and failed to give due weight to others which lead to an outcome that was ultimately wrong. A number of points coalesce to lead to that conclusion. Ms Stewart also submitted that much of the criticism of the judgment ought to have been subject to a request for clarification. I am satisfied that would not have been appropriate in the context of this case. The appeal goes to the heart of the Judge&#8217;s approach and absent delivering a re-written judgment I do not think a request could have sensibly been made or met. </span></p>

In this case the most pressing need other than housing was to reduce the debt burden to free up income to meet current needs. The most significant debt was the &#163;577k the Husband had borrowed (on false income information) to buy WC and which was unsustainable on his own evidence and the judge&#8217;s apparent conclusions as to his earning capacity. He was to pay &#163;2,400pcm out of net income of &#163;3,900pcm on mortgage payments &#8211; a staggering 60% of his net income and the remainder was ascribed to child support and legal fees payments. What was the Husband to live on? </span></p>

Ms Stewart argues that if the Wife and child&#8217;s needs had been met more securely by selling WC and freeing up a capacity to pay periodical payments such might not have been possible as the Husband&#8217;s income would in any event be eaten up by debt and he would be left in an insecure position obtaining housing. However, had the judge asked this question of the two options the security of the Wife and child or the insecurity of the Husband it would be that which best promoted the welfare of the child as a first consideration would usually win out.  </span></p>

	    <p class="pf0" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span class="cf01" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Ms Stewart might be right that on fuller analysis a judge might properly conclude the Husband remaining in WC was the least worst option all round and struck the right balance. But the difficulty with this is that the judge did not carry out any evaluation of the Husband&#8217;s expenditure if he were to remain in WC or to move to another property; other than to say all his net income was taken up by mortgage, CS and debt payments such that he couldn&#8217;t pay periodical payments. But how did that make it viable or economically sensible for the family for him to remain? Digging a little deeper would highly likely give rise to the conclusion, as Mr Jeffrey argued, that retaining WC was simply not viable and this consideration could be given to the alternatives including whether that meant the Husband could be housed elsewhere with a far lower mortgage and whether this would have freed up income which could have supported the wife and child&#8217;s transition into securer housing. This exercise was not undertaken. Given on the evidence before the court the Husband remaining in WC was impossible on his predicted income leaving him there is hard to understand. Logically it only makes sense to leave him in occupation if he has some expectation of being financially able to remain there and better off by doing so; neither was so unless in fact there was an expectation he had other resources likely to come to him to support that and if that was so why are they not a feature of the evaluation of H&#8217;s earning capacity or other resources. Providing an opportunity for the Husband to remain in WC only makes any sense if in fact the Husband&#8217;s earning capacity, or some other component is different to the evidence put before the court. As it happens the Husband now says that rather than his mortgage payment doubling or tripling in early 2024 it can remain the same which is good news but begs the question of what other alternatives in terms of mortgage would be available to him to re-house whilst freeing up his income to support W and the child in obtaining housing.</span></p>

It seems the judge did reach this conclusion &#8211; otherwise the order makes no sense but the judge at the same time explicitly referred to the fact that the Wife&#8217;s ability to secure the &#163;40,000 per annum was uncertain.  Nor did the judge explicitly take into account that his housing solution required the mother and child to commute from Ilford to Wanstead and the impact that had on her finances, childcare and ability to resume full time work. Had there been great clarity about the Wife&#8217;s ability to resume full-time work these other features might have been a matter which could be glossed over but in the context of all the other uncertainties the overall effect is to leave the Wife and child in a highly insecure position on housing.</span></p>

All of this seems to have fed into consideration of likely earnings potential for the Husband in the future. However, it did not result in a conclusion that the Husband would not be able to earn in the future sums akin to those he had earned in the past but rather the judgment reaches no clear conclusion on this and moves onto consideration of the reasons for the Husband now being employed. The judge seems to have ultimately concluded that the Husband&#8217;s decision to take employment at a gross salary of &#163;65k per annum was based on achieving a better work/life balance than historically rather than it being the most he could earn. What the judge does not say - but it must be implicit in the ultimate outcome that this was a position that would endure for the foreseeable future and was a reasonable one.</span></p>

Whilst the judge says he will return to it he does not do so. In some cases, it might be acceptable not to say so explicitly and for the appellate court to infer that was what the finding was and that it was a reasonable one. However, in this case it was a critical finding in that it set the Husband&#8217;s net income at about &#163;48k per annum compared to &#163;74k per annum (historic marriage average) and was a hotly contested one and so required explicit determination &#8211; the absence of such a reasoned conclusion is an error.  The point that Ms Stewart makes that a finding of a higher presumed earning capacity would not translate into the possibility of periodical payments is not sustainable; if the court imputes an earning capacity it will make orders on the basis of it being fulfilled.  There is to some extent an interplay with Ground 6 here but this was a case where the Husband&#8217;s honesty and reliability in relation to finances were front and centre and where there was much evidence (including the taped conversation in which he said he would hide his assets from W) which pointed strongly to the possibility that H might be seeking to depress his finances and in those circumstance it was imperative that the judge consider and evaluate that evidence and set out clearly his findings on it and the conclusions which flowed from it. As I say above a clear conclusion that his net income was only &#163;3,900 pcm for the foreseeable future calls into question the decision to allow him the opportunity to buy out WC rather than sell it and refresh his financial arrangements.</span></p>

The mis-direction as to the standard of proof does not necessarily mean that the Husband would be found to be dishonest and have hidden assets. The absence of a clear conclusion on the Husband&#8217;s future earning capacity and whether it is reasonable for him to increase does not mean it is inevitable that he will be ascribed a higher earning capacity. The lack of analysis of the alternatives which might have opened up if a sale of WC were more fully explored does not mean that periodical payments will emerge as the answer. </p>
