A case against his doing so has to be made. But the weight to be given to that proposition will vary enormously from case to case. What may be best for him in the long run may be different from what will be best for him in the short run. It should not be assumed, in this or any other case, that allowing a child to remain here while his future is decided here inevitably means that he will remain here for ever&#8221; [32];</span></p>

The father obtained drugs from a person called [K] with whom he socialised and with whom the mother also was in contact both before and after the relationship. The only piece of evidence I have of interactions between either of them and [K] do not support a finding that he presents any threat to any of the parties. There is no evidence of drug debts or gang involvement or threats being made. In her own evidence, the mother says that in her communications with [K] he was not aggressive or nasty, and was trying to appear supportive, while seeking to remove himself from being a conduit between the parents (to sort out returning the mother&#8217;s possessions to her).</p>

This individual had been earlier mentioned within these proceedings as someone who the father might call upon to give a statement about one of the allegations of physical abuse. There is no evidence to suggest that the friend made contact with the mother as a result of being prompted by the father, and there is nothing within the exchange itself to suggest that it was anything other than well-intentioned. </p>

It is neither necessary nor appropriate to set them out in full in this judgment. I make it clear that counsel was manifestly not seeking to reargue the case nor water down the judgment. But in my view the points of clarification raised went beyond what is intended by the authorities and the recorder was not obliged to answer them. The recorder's refusal to respond to any of the points of clarification was not a ground of appeal raised on behalf of the intervenor. In my view, had it been raised, it would not have led to a successful appeal.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.64in"><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">When giving judgment in a complex children's case, no judge will deal with every point of evidence or every argument advanced on behalf of every party. The purpose of permitting requests for clarification to be submitted is not to require the judge to cover every point but rather, as the Practice Note emphasised, "to raise with the judge and draw to his attention any material omission in the judgment, any genuine query or ambiguity which arises on the judgment, and any perceived lack of reasons or other perceived deficiency in the judge's reasoning process." It is therefore rarely if ever appropriate for counsel to enquire as to the weight which the judge has given to a particular piece of evidence. If, as frequently happens, a judge draws together various strands of the evidence in giving reasons, it is neither necessary nor appropriate for counsel to separate out each strand and enquire what weight the judge has or has not attached to each piece, unless it can be said that in giving his reasons in a general way the judge has failed to address material parts of the evidence, or has created an ambiguity, or failed to provide sufficient reasons for his decision.</span></p>

The question of &#8216;protective measures&#8217; is closely linked to the assessment of risk. It was noted that the father offered undertakings but that with no protective measures in place, there had been no incidents giving rise to a concern that the father might seek to approach the mother&#8217;s home, place of work, Sophie&#8217;s nursery or otherwise disrupt or destabilise them.

It is not for me now to respond to all the matters raised; they are new points that were not put before the Court and cannot be categorised as requests for clarification.
