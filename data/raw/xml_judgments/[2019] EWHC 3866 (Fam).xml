	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in">Mr and Mrs H had a long marriage spent in England.  The marriage ran into difficulties and in April 2017, the husband (&#8220;H&#8221;) left the former matrimonial home in Berkshire, and set up home with his new partner in Jersey.  I am told that within about six weeks of arrival, he commenced divorce proceedings in Jersey.  It is the belief of the wife (&#8220;W&#8221;) that he did so because Jersey does not have provision within its family law for the making of a pension sharing order. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in">W instructed solicitors in Jersey to act for her and they negotiated a financial settlement with H&#8217;s solicitors.  The agreement, which was signed by both parties and both solicitors, was embodied in a consent order made by the Royal Court on 28 March 2019.  It essentially provided for a clean break between the parties with the former matrimonial home being ordered to be sold and the proceeds divided, 55 percent to W and 45 percent to H. W made it plain to her Jersey solicitors that she was not happy with the deal but, nevertheless, she entered into it.  Correspondence suggests that she had already, by that time, decided or had been advised, I know not which, to make an application under Part III of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Family Proceedings Act 1984</ref> in England and Wales.  The divorce was made final in Jersey in April 2019. </p>

The application came before Cobb J on 21 May 2019 who gave W permission to apply for a pension sharing order.  W appeared in person although I apprehend that she had been advised in the background by Mrs Rice, a solicitor who has acted for W before me today and has been, I understand, involved throughout these proceedings.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in">This would appear to be an insuperable objection to W&#8217;s application but in an ingenious argument, which does great credit to Mrs Rice&#8217;s industry and scholarship, she argues as follows.  First, she says, I must look at the Law Com. No. 117 Family Law: Financial Relief After Foreign Divorce report.  It was this report that was the precursor to this part of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref>.

		    <content>
		      <p style="margin-left:1.48in;margin-right:0.48in">We have considered whether the proposed jurisdiction to award financial relief should extend to cases where a decree of divorce or nullity was obtained in Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man.  These countries all have their own legal systems and the grounds for matrimonial relief, and the financial provision orders available, differ from country to country... and the courts in Guernsey and Jersey have powers which are in most important respects similar to those in England and Wales.  In Scotland, however, the courts have no power to order the transfer of property on divorce. </p>

		      <p style="margin-left:1.48in;margin-right:0.58in">It would nevertheless in our view be inappropriate to allow those divorced elsewhere in the British Isles to apply to the courts in England and Wales for financial orders; there will be few if any cases in which a person divorced in another part of the British Isles will have suffered the &#8216;serious injustice&#8217; which we believe it should be necessary to establish as a condition precedent to the exercise of the powers we propose.&#8221; </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in">That was the position in 1982.   Subsequently, as Mrs Rice points out, reforms have been made to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> which permit pension sharing orders to be available as part of the range of powers under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref>.

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in">From that starting point, Mrs Rice says that there is a serious injustice and, in particular, she points to the fact that H&#8217;s pension income is apparently some 2.5 times that of the income of the wife.  Accepting that at face value, it does not, of course, necessarily follow that substantial injustice has occurred or would occur because the absence of powers to pension share can be dealt with in other ways by, for example, offsetting.  I do not know whether offsetting was part of what led to the unequal division of the proceeds of sale of the matrimonial home because I do not have the information before me to form a view.  </p>

The mischief rule has taken me to the authority of <span style="font-style:italic">Heydon&#8217;s Case </span>[1584] EWHC Exch J36, a judgment of Sir Roger Manwood CB and I think also the other Barons of the Exchequer.

If the words of the statute are in themselves precise and unambiguous, then no more can be necessary than to expound those words in that natural and ordinary sense.  The words themselves alone do, in such case, best declare the intention of the lawgiver.  But if any doubt arises from the terms employed by the legislature, it has always been held a safe means of collecting the intention, to call in aid the ground and cause of making the statute and to have recourse to the preamble which, according to Chief </p>

W has known from the outset of the proceedings, or at least since well before the first hearing at Reading when the costs started to escalate, that her case was on weak ground and she knew exactly what was going to be said on behalf of H.  There is no reason why H should be penalised as a result of W&#8217;s determination to run this point.  I work on the basis that on a standard basis of assessment, a costs order would be made in the region of about 70 percent of the solicitor&#8217;s bill.  There is a small element of duplication in counsel&#8217;s fees for this hearing as it was very much the same argument as would have been run in Reading at the earlier hearing. </p>
