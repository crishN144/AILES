	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application by the mother was made orally at this hearing.  The Position Statement lodged on behalf of the mother for this hearing dated 6 June 2016 makes no mention of an application to terminate the appointment of the children&#8217;s guardian.  Indeed, whilst deprecating strongly what is described in that Position Statement as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">a partial analysis of emerging material</span>&#8221; by the children&#8217;s guardian, the Position Statement goes on to state: </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within this context, the precise grounds of the mother&#8217;s oral application to terminate the appointment of the children&#8217;s guardian were not entirely clear.  However, the mother appears to base her application on an allegation of &#8220;apparent bias&#8221;, contending that the Position Statement filed and served on behalf of the children&#8217;s guardian gives the impression of being partial in circumstances where the guardian expresses a view that favours the father&#8217;s case before all the evidence he was directed to consider has been filed and served.   At points during his submissions Mr Perkins also appeared to broaden his attack to encompass wider generalised assertions of unfairness arising out of the conduct of the children&#8217;s guardian in this respect.</p>

It is not necessary for the purposes of this judgment to set out the background again.  On 15 October I determined that <span style="font-size:11.5pt">the High Court could exercise its inherent jurisdiction in proceedings concerning the living arrangements for T in circumstances where she has been adopted in Nepal by British citizens and is a British national resident in Dubai but where the English court is the only court which can remedy the fact that the Nepalese adoption is not automatically recognised under English law.  </span>The case is listed for final hearing before me in July 2016 and is listed to today for a pre-hearing review.</p>

It is the latter issue of child arrangements that gives rise to the application made by the mother to terminate the appointment of the children&#8217;s guardian.</p>

Whilst the need to replace the children&#8217;s guardian meant that the final report of the guardian would not be available for the pre-hearing review, in an effort to maximise the efficacy of that pre-hearing review I directed CAFCASS to file and serve by 9.00am on the morning of this hearing a Position Statement &#8220;summarising the position of the guardian&#8221; having regard to the outcome of a meeting with T due to take place on 6 May 2016 (which meeting actually took place on 20 May 2016) and certain further evidence I directed be filed.

However, the Position Statement prepared on behalf of the children&#8217;s guardian by Mr Hinchliffe is dated 2 June 2016.  In the circumstances, the Position Statement was compiled prior to the children&#8217;s guardian having seen the report of Ms Hamade (which was due on 10 May 2016 but is late due to delay in CAFCASS settling Ms Hamade&#8217;s fees) and the father&#8217;s evidence (which was due on 3 June 2016).

Neither r 4.10(9) of the Family Proceedings Rules 1991 nor the corresponding provision of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (r 21.7(1)) specifies any limit on the court's power to terminate the appointment of a guardian ad litem or litigation friend. The President focused on the particular situation in which the court is asked to replace a guardian ad litem because the guardian has in the conduct of litigation taken a course of action (in which we include an omission), or is about to take a course of action, which is manifestly contrary to the best interests of the child whose interests it is the guardian's duty to safeguard. If the guardian (or litigation friend) does act manifestly contrary to the child's best interests, the court will remove him even though neither his good faith nor his diligence is in issue.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Overall, it would appear that whilst the court&#8217;s discretion to terminate the appointment of a children&#8217;s guardian under FPR 2010 r 16.25(1)(b) is a full one, it is nonetheless a discretion that should be exercised sparingly, taking into account the imperative of the overriding objective in FPR 2010 r 1.1 to deal with the case justly having regard to the welfare issues involved.   Within this context, where the grounds relied on in support of an application to terminate the appointment of the children&#8217;s guardian concern the methodology adopted by the guardian, the court may terminate the appointment where the guardian acts manifestly contrary to the child&#8217;s best interests or, but only in very rare circumstances, where the guardian has engaged in conduct that the court would ordinarily be invited simply to take into account when deciding whether to accept or reject the guardian&#8217;s evidence or recommendations.</p>

The role of the children&#8217;s guardian is not a judicial or quasi-judicial role.  Whilst he is under a statutory duty to advise the court he is not the decision maker in these proceedings.

The views of the guardian are plainly grounded in statements made to him by T.  The missing statement of the father could only have acted reinforce the conclusion reached by the guardian.  The matters which Ms Hamade has been asked to consider do not go to interpreting the nature or significance of T&#8217;s wishes and feelings.  The child&#8217;s guardian makes clear in his report that he spoke to T after she had met with her mother specifically to check whether her views had changed.  </p>

It is clear that in coming to his views the children&#8217;s guardian considered the position of the mother, both in terms of the quality of T&#8217;s attachment to her and her travel difficulties with respect to the United Arab Emirates and appreciated that the matter remained subject to final determination by the court.  However, statement that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">The children&#8217;s guardian takes the view that T has suffered enough change and suggests a formula of arrangements that add, expand and compliment the advantages that accrue to her living with F in Dubai</span>&#8221; does have the appearance of a recommendation regarding the final outcome of this matter and both parents appear to have taken it as such.  Further, it is beyond dispute that the guardian reached his conclusion without seeing the totality of the evidence he had been directed to consider.  Whilst, once again, the missing evidence of the father may well only have reinforced this conclusion, the report of Ms Hamade was potentially relevant to it in circumstances where it bore on the question of how easy ongoing contact between mother and daughter would be to maintain in light of the nature and extent of any continuing issues regarding the mother&#8217;s ability to enter and leave the United Arab Emirates.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, during the course of that process the children&#8217;s guardian enjoys no special status relative to other witnesses before the court (<span style="font-style:italic">MW v Hertfordshire County Council</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2014/405" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCA Civ 405" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCA Civ 405</ref> at [21] and [32]).  The fact that the children&#8217;s guardian is under a duty to advise the court the options available to it to make recommend what order should be made does not mean that the advice and recommendation of the children&#8217;s guardian carries with it preferential, let alone determinative weight in the proceedings.  The views of guardian, even when set out in a final analysis and recommendations report, are not binding on the court.  At all times it is the application of the principles and factors set out in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1</ref> to the totality of the evidence before the court that drives the court&#8217;s conclusion as to what is in the child&#8217;s best interests. There would be more force in mother&#8217;s application if the court was bound to follow recommendations of the children&#8217;s guardian or if the recommendations of the guardian carried preferential weight in the proceedings.

Specifically, the evidence of the children&#8217;s guardian will be the subject to forensic scrutiny by the court through the medium of cross-examination.  Within this context the mother will be able to test the aspects of the guardian&#8217;s methodology that concern her and make submissions to the court on the consequences of any challenges she makes good.  In particular, she will be able to put to the children&#8217;s guardian that he has pre-judged the issue of T&#8217;s living arrangements and the court can consider whether the guardian&#8217;s recommendation is thereby undermined.   The court is well used to hearing and considering challenges mounted in cross examination by way of an allegation of prejudgment against social workers and children&#8217;s guardians.  </p>

That worry and work could have been avoided had CAFCASS Legal complied with the directions made by the court or applied to vary the same. I hope that CAFCASS Legal will reflect on this.</p>
