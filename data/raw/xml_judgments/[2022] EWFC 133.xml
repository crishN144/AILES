	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;border-left-width:0pt;border-left-style:none;border-left-color:initial">On 12 October 2022, H, through the parties&#8217; solicitors, gave 1 hour&#8217;s notice that he intended to apply to the Urgent Applications Judge, sitting at the Royal Courts of Justice, for a freezing injunction. The application was framed in that way, rather than pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s37</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>, because it sought to restrain W from dealing with, inter alia, her overseas assets. The application, supported by a narrative statement from H, came before Morgan J that afternoon, who refused to make the immediate order sought. Instead, she gave directions and relisted the application on 19 October 2022 before, as it turned out, me. Pursuant to her directions, H filed a supplemental statement, and W filed a statement in reply. As it was once again in the Urgent Applications list, and there was insufficient time for me to deal with it substantively, I adjourned to 25 October 2022 before me for determination. I made one specific direction, for an exchange of letters setting out concisely each party&#8217;s financial position. By the time of this hearing, H had modified his position such that he sought orders in respect of W&#8217;s assets in this jurisdiction only. W resists the application. This is my judgment, which I reserved for a short time after hearing submissions. </p>

Cases where no notice at all can be justified are very rare indeed. The order of the court should record on its face the reason why it was satisfied that no or short notice was given.</p>

The giving of an undertaking in damages, whether to the respondent or to an affected third party, is an almost invariable requirement; release of this must be clearly justified.&#8221;</p>

In late 2021, they moved to England when H obtained employment in London. Their flat in Dubai was rented out. The rental income was paid into a joint account in Dubai, from which W would then transfer the monies into an account in her sole name so as to meet family expenses. All of this took place with H&#8217;s knowledge. </p>

W does not seem to have been secretive about her financial circumstances which were shared openly with H. In his first witness statement, H estimated W&#8217;s wealth at about $15m, held in the UK and overseas, identifying specific properties, companies in which W has an interest, and financial instruments. Pursuant to my direction, W set out her wealth in correspondence which she puts at about &#163;5m; a further &#163;2m of assets held under legal title in her name is, so she asserts, beneficially owned by her father. It is not in dispute that her wealth results from gifts made to her by her family; it seems likely to me that the bulk of her assets will be treated by the court as non-marital in the substantive financial remedy proceedings. In contrast with W&#8217;s wealth, H&#8217;s total assets appear to be under &#163;10,000. </p>

She invited H to issue a divorce petition; I am told she anticipated this would take place in Pakistan. H did indeed issue a petition, albeit in England rather than Pakistan, on 14 September 2022, followed by a Form A on 27 September 2022. W moved out of the jointly rented property with the parties&#8217; daughter, into a property, which has been owned by her mother since 2010 but is in the process of being transferred into W&#8217;s name by way of gift. At about the same time, W sent to H a draft separation agreement which provided that neither would pursue a financial claim against the other, albeit the document was prepared by reference to Sharia law at a time when W was contemplating resisting the jurisdiction of the English court. She has since confirmed that she accepts the jurisdiction of this court. </p>

Attached to the letter was a formal draft undertaking, which H required W to sign, whereupon it would be lodged at court. No justification was given for this request, nor, it seems to me, was there any such justification. H had received no intimation of any step which had been taken, or was intended to be taken, by W to defeat his claims. The undertaking sought encompassed the entirety of W&#8217;s wealth, in such a way as to negate her ability to exercise any financial autonomy. And so began a chain of events leading to these proceedings, considerable legal costs, and, no doubt, heightened family tensions.</p>

H replied on 11 October 2022, again seeking undertakings which continued to extended, so far as I can discern, to the entirety of W&#8217;s worldwide wealth, thereby potentially causing her economic paralysis. </p>

Beyond the &#163;32,000 and $18,000, neither of which in my view justified the application, H has not been able to point to any malign, or even suspicious, disposal of assets, or improper dealing with assets which are, on W&#8217;s case, &#163;5m, and on H&#8217;s case possibly substantially more.  Had she truly been intending to defeat H&#8217;s claims, whether in collusion with her family or not, far greater sums would surely have been withdrawn, or transferred beyond H&#8217;s reach. </p>

This did not form a significant part of the original application, but was fleshed out in H&#8217;s second statement. As I have already indicated, the property was bought by W&#8217;s mother in 2010. In late 2021, at a time when the parties were planning to relocate to this country, W&#8217;s mother decided to gift the property to W. A TR1 was signed in January 2022.  The registration of title in W&#8217;s name for some reason has not proceeded. According to an attendance note of a conversation between H and a person at HM Land Registry on 17 October 2022, H was told that W&#8217;s conveyancing solicitor cancelled the registration in September 2022. On the face of it, that appears suspicious given the timing. However, (i) there is no evidence that W gave direct instructions to her conveyancing solicitor to cancel the transfer, (ii) according to the attendance note, the cancellation was requested due to problems with the requisitions on the title, (iii) W says that she believes she owns the property beneficially as a result of the signing of the TR1, (iv) W expressly includes the property within her list of assets, (v) H seemed unconcerned about the delay in registration in his first statement, of which he was well aware (admittedly before he became aware of the cancellation by the conveyancing solicitor), and (v) there is no evidence that this step was taken to defeat H&#8217;s claims. W confirmed to me through counsel that she fully intends and expects that the registration will be completed.</p>

Thus, some &#163;2.75m is capable of being realised to meet his claims out of, on W&#8217;s case, about &#163;5m, or, on H&#8217;s case, somewhat more. This must be seen in the context of a financial remedy dispute which, at first blush, is likely to be confined to H&#8217;s needs, given that W&#8217;s wealth emanated from her family. There is a further bank account in this country in W&#8217;s name holding &#163;400,000, but in my judgment that falls into a separate category as W uses it for general financial purposes, unlike the Investor Visa portfolio and the property, neither of which need to be realised. </p>

There is little in terms of objective evidence to indicate a solid risk of dissipation of assets. Mere suspicion, or anxiety, on H&#8217;s part is not sufficient. I am not satisfied that there is any basis upon which to assert that W by her actions was and is seeking to defeat H&#8217;s financial claims. </p>

It is worth remembering not only that the ex parte procedure is intrinsically unfair but also, and very importantly, that a case which begins with an ex parte order is usually poisoned from that point onwards. The unilateral step taken at the beginning of case echoes down its history. Often the respondent is enraged by the step taken against him and looks to take counter-offensive measures. Every single subsequent step is coloured by that fateful first step. Costs tend to mount exponentially. And even after the lawyers close their files and render their final bills the personal relations of the spouses will likely remain forever soured&#8221;.</p>

True, the application was not made without notice, but with only 1 hour&#8217;s notice to W it was to all intents and purposes a unilateral step. There is no novel point of law in this case, nor are the facts themselves particularly notable, although the wealth is far beyond that of most people. But this case is a salutary reminder to practitioners, if reminder is needed, that the legal and procedural pre-requisites of a freezing order application, or <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s37</ref> application, as set out in <span style="font-weight:bold">UL v BK</span> must be complied with before the court will be willing to entertain granting such an order. </p>

Both counsel invited me to determine costs in this written judgment. In the event, I have refused H&#8217;s application. The &#8220;clean sheet&#8221; principle applies to a freezing application; that is to say there is neither a starting point of no order as to costs, nor a starting point that costs follow the event. I bear in mind CPR 44.2, save for sub paragraphs (2) and (3) which are disapplied by Rule 28.2(1) of the Family Procedure Rules 2010. I consider that H should pay W&#8217;s costs on the standard basis. Although I have found against him, in my view the threshold for making an indemnity costs order against him is not made out. I will assess those costs summarily. W&#8217;s Form N260 puts her total costs of the application and three hearings at &#163;39,027. Looking at the statement of costs in the round, I propose to take a 30% deduction to reflect the likely outcome of a detailed assessment. H shall therefore contribute &#163;27,318 to W&#8217;s costs. That sum shall not be enforced until the conclusion of the financial remedy proceedings. To make him liable now for the costs order would not be fair given that he does not have assets to pay the sum due. I anticipate that this debt to W will be deducted from his final award.</p>
