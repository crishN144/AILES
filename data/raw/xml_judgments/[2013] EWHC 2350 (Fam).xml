	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">This is a relatively short judgment on a very important point.  The point is, can a police force apply for a person to be committed to prison for contempt of court for breach of a forced marriage protection order (FMPO) when the police themselves were not the applicants who obtained the order?  It is an issue as to what lawyers call "standing" but is, in my view, one of some constitutional importance.  The reason why the point is overall of great importance is that the facts of this case reveal, or illustrate, serious weakness in the scheme of the forced marriage protection provisions which were inserted as Part 4A into the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1996</ref> by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2007/20" uk:canonical="2007 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007</ref> and which came into force in November 2008.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">For the purposes of this judgment I can summarise the essential facts in an abbreviated way.  FF was born in October 1996.  At all times material to this judgment she was, and still is, aged 16.  She is a child of a Muslim family of Pakistani descent who live in Luton and are clearly part of the Muslim Pakistani community there.  During November 2012 FF contacted the police in Luton and told them that her mother had assaulted her and that she was afraid her mother would take her to Pakistan and force her into marriage there.  She was directed to a local firm of solicitors, who made a without notice application on her behalf on 27 November 2012 for an FMPO, which was granted.  It is quite clear that FF herself was in the role of applicant, and there has never been any suggestion that she lacked sufficient capacity to instruct her own solicitor and make her own application.</span></p>

The application came before His Honour Judge Sir Gavyn Arthur.  It is relevant to mention that as the Luton County Court is one of the designated specialist county courts for the making of FMPOs, and His Honour Judge Sir Gavyn Arthur is the designated family judge of that court, he must have great experience of this vital but sensitive field.  He made a further order in the prescribed form to expire on FF's 21</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">st</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> birthday or earlier further order.  He was later to say at a hearing on 1 March 2013 that, "It was, in fact, the standard FMPO, with various associated clauses attached to it."</span></p>

Paragraph 2 forbad the mother "... to aid, abet, counsel, encourage or assist any other person to take any steps to force or attempt to force or to cause or otherwise permit FF to enter into a marriage ...".  Pausing there, paragraph 2 includes references to "force", but paragraph 1 does not.  In other words, paragraph 1 was absolute.  The mother was forbidden to cause or permit FF to undergo any marriage at all, whether forced or not.  Paragraph 5 of the order forbad the mother from removing FF from England and Wales.  A power of arrest was specifically attached to all the injunctive paragraphs of the order, including paragraphs 1 and 2.</span></p>

They both gave oral evidence.  Their story was that the mother's grandmother was seriously ill in Pakistan.  With characteristic shrewdness, the judge said in his judgment "... the court, I regret to say, is not satisfied that they are telling the full story.  In particular, the evidence about the grandmother's illness did not satisfy the court ...".  He declined to discharge any part of the FMPO.  He concluded his judgment by saying "I am concerned she [viz FF] has brought this application under considerable parental oppression.  In fact, I am wholly satisfied that is why it has happened."</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">On 26 April 2013 a Muslim ceremony of marriage took place at the family home in Luton between FF and a man whom she knew only by sight, who is, I understand, related to her.  I say at once that in the eyes of English law that marriage is a total non-marriage.  It does not even purport to be a marriage under the provisions of the Marriage Acts.  It has no legal force whatsoever.  But within the Muslim community it may be of huge significance and may, indeed, make it very difficult for FF ever to marry again, at any rate within her own community.</span></p>

On the same day they also arrested a paternal aunt of FF, whom I will call "the aunt".  The aunt had not been named in the FMPO and was not at that stage a party at all to the FMPO proceedings; but she was arrested on the basis that she had been well aware of the existence and terms of the FMPO and had been involved in some of the organisation of the wedding.  Therefore, she was within the scope of the power of arrest which was expressly stated to "also apply to any third party who frustrates the terms of the order or otherwise acts in contempt of court in relation to this order, even where they are not a respondent to the original proceedings."</span></p>

His detailed order recites that he heard legal representatives for the mother, the aunt, the Bedfordshire Constabulary and the Luton Borough Council, who had applied for an interim care order in relation to FF on 23 May 2013.  The judge made a series of orders as to evidence, discovery and other matters.  Paragraph 1 of the order provided that "The Bedfordshire Constabulary are made interveners in the proceedings with the consent of all parties".  I stress the word "interveners", not applicants.  I understand that was done at that stage because much discovery was sought from the police.  The judge fixed a further hearing for 31 May 2013 and again remanded the mother and the aunt in custody.</span></p>

The formal order made that day is entitled, "Bedfordshire Police - applicant, [the mother] - first respondent, and [the aunt] - second respondent".  It recites that the court heard counsel for the applicant [viz therefore Bedfordshire Police], the mother and the aunt, and for Luton Borough Council "who attended as an interested party".  A large number of topics were discussed and ruled upon at the hearing with regard to evidence and discovery and other case management matters.  Some consideration was given to whether FF herself should give, or be available to give, oral evidence.  The judge released the mother and the aunt on conditional bail.  One recital to the order provides that, "AND UPON the court confirming that the Bedfordshire Police is the applicant in this matter ...".  Paragraph 1 of the operative part of the order provides that, "The Bedfordshire Police is the applicant in these proceedings."</span></p>

She did give a judgment at the end of the hearing, of which I have an informal note, although not an official approved transcript.  It does not address the role of the police as applicants.  It does refer to the order made on 31 March 2013 and recites, referring to that order, that, "An apparent gap has been pointed out between the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1996</ref> and the Contempt of Court Act as regards who is a party to these proceedings ... ."</span></p>

He submits that the statutory power of arrest provisions and machinery quoted above indicate that Parliament intended that the police may have a role when a person is, "in breach ... or otherwise in contempt of court in relation to the order".  He submits that there is no reason why that role should not extend to formally applying for, and advancing the case in support of, committal for contempt, and, he says, very good reason why the police should be able to do so.  He stresses, rightly, that it is of the essence of this area of the law that although vulnerable young people may apply for and obtain an FMPO, they may then be placed under very great family pressure not to seek to enforce it.  In this very case, FF has made clear that she does not want to enforce it, first, because she claims that the marriage was not forced and that her mother and aunt have done no wrong; second, because, as reported in paragraph 20 of a witness statement by a social worker, Danielle Davies dated 24 May 2013, and now at bundle, section 33, page 145, "... she was clear that she did not want her parents to get into trouble".  It is precisely for that reason, submits Mr Weston, that the police, in the wider public interest, must be able to enforce forced marriage protection orders and take action to commit for breaches in, as the police say, so flagrant a case as this one.</span></p>

They are likely to become involved, as they did in this case, by executing the power of arrest.   They will often, as in this case, have been involved at a much earlier stage, even before the forced marriage protection order was first made.  They have dedicated local forced marriage and honour based crime units.  They are particularly attuned to the problems in their own local area and more sensitive to the public interest in that area than, for instance, the Attorney General and his office in London.  They can act quickly, whereas, with respect to him, the Attorney General, not being local, cannot.</span></p>

However, I am very clear that, unless and until Parliament decides to provide a proper statutory basis for them to do so, the police simply have no standing to, and cannot act as applicants to, apply for and (as they wish in this case) press for committal in these circumstances.  It is important to stress that breach of an FMPO is not of itself currently a criminal offence, although the circumstances may, of course, also involve a range of criminal activities, such as assaults, kidnapping or false imprisonment.  If the police have evidence of any criminal offences, then of course it is open to them, in conjunction with the Crown Prosecution Service, to prosecute, and I say nothing at all to discourage such prosecution when appropriate if there is evidence of actual crimes.</span></p>

In our society, and within our constitution, it is the role and duty of the police to prevent crimes (including the crimes which may be associated with forced marriages) and, in conjunction with the CPS, to prosecute when crimes have been committed.

In my understanding, the (very important) role of the police under powers of arrest has always been limited to arresting the person concerned, bringing him before a judge, further remanding him in custody if so ordered, and giving written or oral evidence as to the circumstances of the arrest and whatever else of relevance that the police witnessed.

The order is made so as to assist the litigant in obtaining his rights, and he may consult his own interests in deciding whether or not to enforce it.  If he decides not to, there may in some cases be a public element involved, and the Attorney General will judge whether the public interest requires him to intervene in order to enforce the order.  If neither the litigant nor the Attorney General seeks to enforce the order, the court will act of its own volition in punishing the contempt only in exceptional cases of clear contempts which cannot wait to be dealt with, cases in which, in the words of Lord Denning MR, 'It is urgent and imperative to act immediately' ...

There seems to be a clear case for considering whether there should be some relaxation by the courts of their present restraint on themselves in enforcing their orders in cases where these are being openly flouted and the administration of justice is being brought into disrespect.  For the courts to say, as they often say, that, 'Orders of the court must be obeyed', becomes idle if there are daily instances of open and notorious disobedience remaining unpunished.  If the courts become more ready to enforce orders of their own motion, no doubt consideration should be given to the machinery by which this might be done.

It would be a huge leap in a legal framework that has been regarded as settled for many decades.  It would involve the police becoming "prosecutor" in all but name in civil proceedings in which no crime is alleged.  It would ignore that Parliament had an obvious opportunity to create equivalent provisions to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/28/section/42" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 42</ref>A but chose not to do so.  Further, it is of some significance that the Lord Chancellor has, by order, specified local authorities as "a relevant third party" for the purpose of making the original application for an FMPO, but has not specified the police.</span></p>

He, and the police whom he represents, focus on the public interest, including the importance of deterrence in areas such as Luton.    But there is a very important place, too, for consideration of the welfare of the vulnerable young person concerned if, as in this case, their parent or other close relative faces the threat of imprisonment or other quasi criminal punishment.  The police are not necessarily best placed to weigh these considerations.</span></p>

For the reasons I have already given in paragraph 17 above, I do not consider that I am.  Her order did not preclude the judge at the substantive hearing from giving much more profound consideration to the issue of standing.  Having done so, I am clear that the police cannot properly make, nor now pursue, the present application.  In any event, it would be unconscionable for me to consider committing a person to prison (assuming the case to be proved to the required criminal standard) in a situation in which I consider, as I do, that the applicants have no standing.</span></p>

It is vital that FMPOs have real teeth and that people bound by them, or having notice of them, appreciate that they are capable of being enforced and will be enforced even though the applicant young person may not seek enforcement himself or herself.  The scope for psychological or other pressures in this field is obvious and is enormous.  I note in the footnote to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 63</ref>I of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1996</ref>, on page 1017 of the current, 2013, edition of the Family Court Practice, that, "Following a consultation process, the Government announced its intention to make forced marriage a criminal offence and for a breach of a forced marriage protection order to be criminalised."</span></p>
