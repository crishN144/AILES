	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These are ancillary relief proceedings which would be straight-forward but for three factors: the fact that vast wealth was generated during the last three years of a marriage which lasted for twenty years; the unusual nature of the business that enabled the husband, with his partners, to generate that wealth; and, as a consequence, the more than usually difficult task &#8211; assuming the task to be both relevant and feasible &#8211; of assessing the true value of the business as a prelude to determining the share (if any) of the business to which the wife can appropriately lay claim.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That said, the reality is that this is and always was a comparatively simple case which has become extended in its scope and protracted in its length almost beyond reason by the forensic enthusiasm with which it has been pursued on both sides. The trial bundles extended to 15 lever arch files. The written opening submissions ran in all to 140 pages. The written submissions in relation to certain tax issues (see below) ran to more than 60 pages. The time estimate (10 days, the first day being a reading day) soon proved to be unrealistic, for the trial, excluding the reading day, lasted for 15 days which, because of the over-run, had to be spread over the period from 28 April 2009 to 9 July 2009. Final oral submissions followed at a hearing which had to be listed at Newcastle upon Tyne, where I was then sitting, on 27 July 2009. The written closing submissions ran, in all, to more than 150 pages with almost a further 100 pages in relation to alleged litigation misconduct. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The skill with which, on both sides, all this effort was deployed was first class; whether the endeavour was really necessary is, perhaps, another matter. But in venturing this observation I emphasise how acutely I am conscious not merely of the priceless advantage of hindsight but also of the forensic experience that the inner realities of a case are often much more apparent to the judge who watches the battle played out before him than to those engaged in the fray &#8211; this, after all, is one of the consequences, as also one of the advantages, of the adversarial process.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I make these points not to criticise but to explain why in this judgment I propose to concentrate on what, at the end of the day, matters. Doing so means that I pass by in silence much of what has been put before me, whether in evidence or in submissions. I intend no disrespect to counsel but if I was to deal with every topic that was canvassed before me this judgment would extend to a length grossly excessive even by my standards and, I am satisfied, all to no useful purpose. I make it clear however that in coming to my conclusions I have, of course, had regard to all the evidence and all the submissions. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are two other preliminary points I should make. In the first place, such is the scale of the wealth here, even taking the most pessimistic view, that there is not, generally speaking, much point in analysing the figures with an excessive degree of precision. Much of the time, and except when a greater degree of accuracy is called for, I will therefore round the figures to the nearest million or fraction of a million. Secondly, for convenience and subject only to what, in the great scheme of things is a tolerable degree of inaccuracy, I propose to refer to most amounts in &#163; sterling, even though significant parts of the husband&#8217;s business activities are conducted and some of the assets are held in other currencies which have from time to time moved in relation to sterling. I have taken into account these exchange rate movements but, generally speaking, I need not refer to them.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband was born in 1958, the wife in 1955. They married in 1987. There are three children born of the marriage: twins (a boy and a girl) born in 1991 and a girl born in 1996. The matrimonial home, a prestigious property in London, was acquired in 1996 for &#163;2.4 million; a further &#163;1.5 million was spent on refurbishment. The husband, who is by profession an accountant, began his current business (see below) in August 2004. The parties separated in March 2007, the wife remaining in the matrimonial home with the children. She issued her petition in September 2007. Both parties filed a Form A in October 2007. The decree nisi and the decree absolute were both granted in June 2008. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">After much interlocutory skirmishing (including hearings before Hogg J and Baron J, an unsuccessful FDR before Coleridge J and further hearings before Baron J and Black J) the final hearing came on before me on 27 April 2009. It concluded, as I have said, on 27 July 2009. The wife was represented by Mr Charles Howard QC leading Mr Harry Oliver and, on the tax matters, by Miss Emma Chamberlain; the husband was represented by Mr Lewis Marks QC leading Miss Hannah Baker (during July 2009 Miss Katie Cowton) and, on the tax matters, by Mr Stephen Brandon QC leading Miss Harriet Brown. I am very sorry that my new commitments, which began only two days later and which in the event and partly for unforeseen reasons have been more onerous than I had initially imagined, should have delayed this judgment for much longer than I would have wished.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband&#8217;s business, carried on with a small number of partners, his share being 25.5%, is in what is called quantitative long-short equity trading. It takes advantage of price mismatches and predictable patterns of stock price movements over very short timescales &#8211; a few hours at most, sometimes minutes or even seconds &#8211; which typically are generated by structural imperfections in the market. The business involves huge numbers of stock market transactions every day, the massive profits which have resulted being generated, despite the often minute profits on individual transactions, by the sheer volume of the daily trading. The trading is fully automated &#8211; computerised &#8211; with almost no manual interaction. The &#8216;cutting edge&#8217; computer systems which the business has developed have been the key to its success. Computer based strategies involving complex algorithms are used by the business, first to test against historical data whether a strategy in development will &#8216;work&#8217; (as it was explained to me, &#8220;strategies are developed and comprehensively back-tested&#8221;), secondly, if a strategy has been demonstrated to work, to conduct the actual trading (&#8220;high speed electronic connectivity to permit fast execution of orders&#8221;) and, thirdly, to monitor the trading so as to ensure that the automated process is profitable and that unprofitable trading is automatically stopped in time.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The gross revenues of the business have been plotted on various graphs and subjected to much statistical analysis. As it happens I do not need to go into any of this in any great detail. The final version of the key graph (which I am satisfied is both factually accurate and statistically valid<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		  <p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"><span/><marker name="tab"/>In paragraph 81 of his written final submissions Mr Howard sought to argue that that the &#8216;ski-slope&#8217; profile of the graph was distorted, being &#8220;drastically affected&#8221; by &#8216;outlying weeks&#8217; where the actual figures were either particularly high or particularly low compared with the prevailing trend. Removing the highest and lowest 15% of figures the graph shows, he said, not a &#8216;ski slope&#8217; but a flat consistent line. This was all convincingly rebutted by Mr Marks in an analysis &#8216;Rebuttal of #81 of W&#8217;s written submissions&#8217; which I accept.  </p>
		</authorialNote>) shows the gross revenues in terms of both the actual weekly figures and moving averages calculated over the previous 13, 26 and 52 weeks. Although, inevitably, the moving averages follow somewhat different tracks, the overall picture, so far as is relevant for present purposes, is precisely the same. From a starting point of zero in August 2004 the graph climbs fairly rapidly and steadily to a peak of between $4 million and $5 million per week in June-July 2006 (the 13 and 26 weeks moving averages), then falling equally steadily, albeit at a shallower gradient, to less then $1 million in June 2009 (the most recent figure I have), indeed reaching perilously close to the &#8216;breakeven&#8217; figure of $410,000 required to meet the trading expenses but <span style="font-style:italic">before </span>the payment of staff bonuses. Calculations based on the moving averages from the peak in June-July 2006 suggest that the decline since then will, if continued at the same rate, have taken the gross revenues below the &#8216;breakeven&#8217; figure in about September 2009 and back to zero by about February 2010. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The overall trajectory is clear: taking the overall period from August 2004 until February 2010, a period of 66 months, and assuming that the decline since June 2009 follows the trend over the previous three years since June 2006, the gross weekly revenues of the business increased from zero to a fraction short of $5 million (the highest actual figure) in July 2006 &#8211; a period of some 23 months &#8211; before returning to zero between then and (say) February 2010 &#8211; a period of 43 months. I might add that, consistently with this general picture, for the downward slope has been fairly constant, the gross revenues were at about $3 million per week at the time the parties separated in March 2007. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although the downward slope has, as I have said, been fairly constant it is also clear that the business returns have tended to be more volatile (that is, the standard deviations have been greater) and therefore riskier in the second half of 2007 and since mid-2008. </p>

I do not propose to explore the matter further. It is far from clear that the husband has any such interest and, if he has, the material before me suggests that his interest is worth somewhere between &#163;250,000 to &#163;500,000 &#8211; an amount almost trivial in comparison to the other matrimonial assets. And the fact that the matter remains even now far from clear does not, I am satisfied, cast any doubt either on the propriety of the husband&#8217;s disclosure overall or, more generally, on his credibility.</p>

I do not agree. In the context of this particular case, and given the very large wealth involved, it seems to me unnecessary to adjust the table of assets to reflect such a small amount as the suggested value of what is after all a wasting asset. And the holiday expenditure, even if it was as large as Mr Howard suggests, and I am not wholly persuaded that it was, does not justify an &#8216;add back&#8217;; this was not reckless extravagance or spendthrift expenditure, merely a reflection of the cost of the kind of expensive hobby that the very rich can afford to indulge in as part of their wealthy lifestyle.</p>

Mr Howard points out that 28 February 2009 was the date fixed at the FDR and submits that, unless everything is valued at essentially the same date one is simply not comparing like with like. Mr Marks characterises Mr Howard&#8217;s approach as &#8220;artificially freezing&#8221; the exchange rates at an inappropriately early date. At the end of the day, as it turns out (see below) this point scarcely matters. But if anything turned on it I would prefer Mr Howard&#8217;s approach.</p>

On 20 March 2008 the husband&#8217;s solicitors wrote to the wife&#8217;s solicitors to inform them that the husband &#8220;has today implemented the following arrangements&#8221;, which, so far as concerned capital provision, included the unilateral transfer by the husband to the wife of: the matrimonial home free of the mortgage, stated in the schedule annexed to the letter to be worth &#163;21 million; cash of &#163;7.234 million and the benefit of two life policies worth &#163;106,815. The letter explained that these arrangements &#8220;assuming our client&#8217;s figure for the value of the matrimonial home, take your client&#8217;s total wealth to over &#163;34m&#8221;, which was contrasted with what was said to be &#8220;the total value of the parties&#8217; wealth &#8230; in the region of &#163;101m gross.&#8221; However, the letter also acknowledged that &#8220;there may be issues about the value of our client&#8217;s business interests and the [matrimonial home].&#8221; </p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;although initially portraying the &#8230; payments as fiscal planning, &#8230; was also clearly a tactical device designed to place a great deal of pressure on W not to continue with her financial application.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">I reject that accusation.

For the husband&#8217;s solicitors had been told by Savills on 7 February 2008 that the property was &#8220;very unlikely&#8221; to be worth as much as &#163;20 million and had on their file an unsigned draft short-form valuation from Savills dated 28 February 2008 &#8211; less than a month before the letter &#8211; giving the value as only &#163;17.75 million, facts which were not revealed until <span style="font-style:italic">after </span>the hearing before me had begun and even then only after a process akin to drawing teeth.</p>

Having asserted that the division of the assets effected by the husband in March 2008 &#8220;certainly <span style="font-style:italic">was </span>&#8211; and arguably <span style="font-style:italic">still is </span>&#8211; distinctly advantageous to W compared to H&#8221; (emphasis in original), and having then proceeded to attempt to justify the latter proposition, Mr Marks said this:</p>

As he rightly says, the giving of evidence is not supposed to be a memory test and the question, if it goes to credibility, is whether the husband, as he assured me, had indeed forgotten or was only pretending to have done. And he recognises that my decision as to whether or not the husband was indeed lying on this topic will be based as much as anything on my view of him as a witness overall, having had the opportunity, as Mr Marks reminds me, of having seen him give evidence over five days.</p>

But having had the opportunity of watching him over many days in court, and not only when he was in the witness box, I am satisfied that the husband was an honest, truthful and, for the vast majority of the time, also an accurate and reliable witness. He did not lie. And on the comparatively few occasions when he was &#8216;caught out&#8217; it was not for lying but rather, I am satisfied, because, quite genuinely, his memory was at fault. </p>

According to Mr Marks, Mr Howard&#8217;s allegations of litigation misconduct are crucially reliant upon the proposition that the husband was under a legal duty to disclose the valuation, either because it was not privileged or because, even if it was, the privilege was &#8216;overridden&#8217; by the ancillary relief duty of full and frank disclosure. He says that if Mr Howard fails to establish either proposition his case as to litigation misconduct on this issue must &#8220;necessarily&#8221; fail, for on that basis the husband was legally entitled not to disclose the draft report.</p>

The point is really the same as that encapsulated in Darling J&#8217;s famous aphorism that &#8220;A fishmonger need not cry &#8216;stinking fish&#8217; &#8230; but if a fishmonger knows that his fish do stink, he is not entitled to cry: &#8216;Fresh fish, fresh fish&#8217;.&#8221;<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="4">

Let it be assumed for the sake of argument that Mr Howard was to succeed in his argument that the February 2008 valuation was discoverable. That of itself would not, could not, justify a finding of litigation misconduct, for there is nothing whatever to show that any of those involved were deliberately deciding not to disclose a document which they knew or believed was or might be discoverable. There is no reason to think that it ever occurred, either to the husband or to his advisers, that the valuation might be discoverable. Indeed, I doubt that it would have occurred to many, if any, family lawyers, however experienced, to think that it might be discoverable.</p>

To that extent I agree with Mr Howard. But beyond that I am not prepared to go.

At the end of the day the forensic reality is, as Mr Marks explained, that to take into account any argument the wife wished to make to share in the post-separation increase in the value of the business, the March 2008 division included, or at least took into account, a whole year of post-separation accrual. </p>

And, as Mr Howard submits, the salient facts here &#8211; for instance, the fact that the husband did not himself invent quantitative long-short equity trading, the fact that he is only one of a number of partners each of whose disparate contributions has gone to create the wealth in what is a collegiate enterprise and that he, in contrast to at least one of his partners, has no expertise in high frequency algorithm based computer trading, the fact that the highly technical computer trading strategies as developed by the paid employees are key drivers of the ongoing business, and the fact, as Mr Howard puts it, that &#8220;whilst the rewards in the present case are huge by any normal standards that says more about the sector than  the individual&#8221; &#8211; simply do not demonstrate the &#8220;exceptional circumstances&#8221; which the authorities show to be essential if a claim of &#8216;special contribution&#8217; is to succeed. </p>

This, I emphasise, is not a criticism, merely a fact &#8211; and a fact reflecting a state of affairs which, as I find, is likely to continue into the future. That said, it is perhaps unlikely that even the most skilled advice will enable him wholly to immunise himself from future charges to tax. And in any event, as Mr Marks points out, however successful his ongoing tax saving strategies may turn out to be, the husband is probably going to have spend significant sums in obtaining expert advice and going to have to submit to a lack of flexibility in his financial arrangements and the deployment of his resources as the price he pays for avoiding or minimising tax.</p>

So to the suggested purchase price of &#163;12 million one has, says Mr Marks, to allow for a further &#163;8 million (grossed up at 40%) or &#163;12 million (grossed up at 50%) for tax.</p>

As we have seen, the foundation of his case is the assertion that the division unilaterally implemented by the husband in March 2008 was an objectively fair division of all the then existing assets and resources of the parties, with the single exception of the unresolved question of the future profits of the business. He elaborates the argument by pointing out that the division left the husband with what he calls the riskier and potentially tax-laden assets.</p>

After all, as he points out, an <span style="font-style:italic">Edgar</span> agreement derives its force from the fact of agreement, and although the court faced with an <span style="font-style:italic">Edgar</span> application obviously has to have regard to issues of fairness, absent vitiating features the fact of agreement is, as he rightly says, strongly supportive of it being fair. </p>

And central to his argument as to why, in these circumstances, the court should not go behind this division is the proposition that, having actually implemented the division, the husband has ceased to &#8220;gamble with the undivided share&#8221; of the wife in the assets, with the result, he says, that each should bear the consequences, good or bad, of any subsequent changes in the values of their respective portfolios.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As part of his analysis, Mr Marks has helpfully sought to recast this table to show the value and distribution of the assets immediately following the division in March 2008. He makes clear that the exercise cannot be done with complete precision, his figures, as he puts it, being indicative rather than definitive, in part because neither the exact value then of the Trusts nor the amount of the surplus cash then is known and in part because of controversy as to the then value of the former matrimonial home. Taking an approach which he says is &#8220;favourable&#8221; to the wife &#8211; for example, taking the value of the former matrimonial home then at what he says is the minimum figure she could realistically contend for &#8211; he comes up with the following table (all figures expressed in &#163;millions) which I accept as being the closest approximation to accuracy which is realistically achievable:</p>

It represents, he says, the husband&#8217;s share of the undistributed profits of the business between March 2008 and May 2009, in other words, as he puts it, profit earned by the husband&#8217;s endeavours not merely in the period <span style="font-style:italic">after </span>the March 2008 division of the assets but, moreover, in a period which commenced a year after the parties&#8217; separation in March 2007.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As will be appreciated, the value to the wife of the division as at March 2008 depends in part upon the value then of the former matrimonial home. Mr Marks has done a number of helpful calculations which put this point into context. As the table shows, if the property is valued then at &#163;14.6 million the wife&#8217;s share of the then overall value of the assets (<span style="font-style:italic">including</span> the surplus cash but not including any further value for the business) amounted to 48.4%. The corresponding figures for other values are &#163;17 million &#8211; 50%; &#163;19 million &#8211; 52%; and &#163;21 million &#8211; 53%. </p>

	    <num>69.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In these circumstances Mr Marks submits that if the value of the former matrimonial home was anything from &#163;14.6 million upwards then, even ignoring what he calls the obviously superior nature of the wife&#8217;s assets compared with the husband&#8217;s, the division was sufficiently proximate to equal to be objectively fair, <span style="font-style:italic">regardless of the fact that the wife did not receive any part of the surplus cash</span>. But, he goes on to say, once the tax, liquidity and risk issues applying to the husband&#8217;s assets are taken into account, the division in March 2008 can be seen to be &#8220;extremely generous&#8221;, irrespective of the value attributed to the former matrimonial home. Accordingly, he says, the objective fairness of the division implemented in March 2008 had, and can be seen to have had, nothing to do with the assertion that the property was worth &#163;21 million and nothing to do with the fact that the wife received no part of the surplus cash.</p>

	    <num>70.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So, says Mr Marks, the issue, so far as concerns the fairness of the division in March 2008, really comes down to the question &#8211; not in any way precluded or foreclosed by the letter of 20 March 2008 &#8211; of whether the wife had and has any claim to a share in the business (other than the surplus cash as at that date), that is, any claim to the husband&#8217;s share of either (a) the additional surplus cash that has accrued since March 2008, or (b) the other assets of the business or (c) the future income of the business.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thus far in his analysis I agree with Mr Marks. <span style="font-style:italic">If </span>the division actually implemented in March 2008 was fair, then there is, for the reasons he has given, no principled basis for going behind it. And, subject only to the question posed in the last paragraph, I am satisfied that the division implemented in March 2008 was indeed objectively fair, amounting in substance to an equal division of the matrimonial assets as they were then worth.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The husband&#8217;s share in the business is unsaleable and thus a &#8216;market value&#8217; would be illusory.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It would be a work of wearisome supererogation to trace the evolving views of the experts from the time they were first instructed down to the point when their evidence concluded. Suffice to say that, at the beginning of the hearing, Mr Allen was assuming that the husband would go on working for somewhere between 15 and 25 years and was contending for a capitalisation rate of 30%-20% applied to maintainable distributions, calculated as the average of the profits of the business over its entire life to date, of &#163;15.6 million. Mr Clokey was assuming that the husband would go on working for 15 years and was contending for a rate of 40% applied to maintainable distributions, calculated as the average of the profits of the business over its most recent six months, of &#163;3.8 million. Taking 15 years as the period for comparison, the difference between Mr Allen and Mr Clokey came to this: Mr Allen valued the business at between &#163;51.1 million<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="8">
		  <p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"><span/><marker name="tab"/>The corresponding figures assuming a longer working life were &#163;51.8 million (20 years) and &#163;52.0 million (25 years).</p>

Thus, taking Mr Allen&#8217;s figures, somewhere between 45% (20% discount rate) and 56% (30% discount rate) of the value is found in the first three years; taking Mr Clokey&#8217;s figures, 64% (40% discount rate) is found in those three years. As will be noted, the higher the discount rate the more &#8216;front-loaded&#8217; the calculation.</p>

Within that range, Mr Marks, submitting that the true figure is &#8220;most probably towards the lower end of that range&#8221;, invited me to adopt, if any, the figure of &#163;8.4 million. </p>

Indeed, Mr Clokey accepted in his oral evidence that the phrase was something of a misnomer; what he had been looking for was a realistic assessment of the current run rate of the business, though even that, given the relentless downward slope of the graph, is, I have to say, little more convincing as a concept. </p>

Helpfully, Mr Marks illustrated the point mathematically with a variety of graphs, but the point can be put in more homely terms. A glass is, on average, half full whether it is being filled or emptied, or indeed if it is first filled and then emptied; but whether, at the point when it is half full, its contents are going to increase or reduce depends not upon the mathematical formula (the average) but upon whether the glass is in the process of being filled or being emptied &#8211; in other words it depends upon the underlying <span style="font-style:italic">trend</span>. Mr Allen&#8217;s approach, says Mr Marks, simply ignores the current trend &#8211; which for the last three years has been relentlessly downward &#8211; and merely assumes, without any evidential or other articulated basis, and despite the ski-slope shape of the graph, that the maintainable distributions for the future can be calculated on the basis of the average figure over the whole five year period.  </p>

Mr Howard seeks to persuade me to the contrary view. In pursuit of these objectives both counsel have addressed me both orally and in writing in very great detail. I trust they will forgive me if I do not follow them into the maze. However, standing back from this morass of detail there is, at the end of the day, one &#8216;big&#8217; point of compelling force to which Mr Howard really had no answer. Bearing in mind the shape and content of the graph, bearing in mind that, taking Mr Allen&#8217;s discount rates, some 50% of the &#8216;current value&#8217; is to be found in the first three years, it is, as Mr Marks says, &#8220;inconceivable&#8221; that any theoretical purchaser of the business, looking at the graph, would contemplate paying an immediate sum anywhere remotely close to even Mr Allen&#8217;s lower figure &#8211; and, I might add, equally inconceivable that the husband would actually receive over that three year period anything remotely approaching the kind of sums implicit in Mr Allen&#8217;s capitalised figure.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I should mention one other matter if only to get it out of the way. Because the husband&#8217;s business generates its profits by identifying and exploiting imperfections in the market and price mismatches, its profitability is not directly dependent upon how &#8216;well&#8217; the market is doing. So there is, as I am satisfied, no basis for linking the relentlessly declining profitability of the business (a phenomenon which, after all, began in June-July 2006, long before the onset of the crisis) with the current global financial crisis or for asserting that when &#8216;normal&#8217; conditions return the business will therefore return to profitably. Plainly there is <span style="font-style:italic">some </span>effect. If the market is depressed, with reduced trading volumes overall, the trading volumes of the husband&#8217;s business may be reduced, and, more directly, if market prices are reduced the tiny slice which the business skims off out of price mismatches will be correspondingly smaller. And the overall state of the market affects the leverage rates the business can achieve. But the causes and scale of the business&#8217;s relentlessly declining profits &#8211; a decline which preceded the current economic crisis &#8211; are to be found elsewhere.</p>

So, he submits, the figure of &#163;6.44 million would not be appropriate, even if an award to the wife is properly to be calculated on that basis (which, of course, he says it is not).

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">As to (c), I agree with Mr Marks that she is not. The husband&#8217;s future income is not a capital asset, whether to be characterised as goodwill or in any other way. It is simply <span style="font-style:italic">income</span>. Accordingly, although I must have regard to it as a factor in accordance with section 25, it is not an asset properly susceptible to the sharing principle.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Conversely, as to (b), these are in principle capital assets which the wife is entitled to say should be brought into account and which were not brought into account in March 2008. What are they worth? Potentially, Mr Howard suggests, they are of &#8220;immense&#8221; value. Mr Clokey&#8217;s analysis suggests a figure in the range of some &#163;2.8 million to &#163;4.1 million.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Given the wife&#8217;s entitlement in principle to a share in (b), the capital assets, it follows, in my judgment, that she has a claim to some part of (a), the additional surplus cash of &#163;8.5 million that has accrued since March 2008. This share should, as a matter of principle, reflect the extent to which, because the division in March 2008 did not extend to her share of the capital assets, the husband thereafter continued, to &#8220;gamble with the wife&#8217;s undivided share&#8221; of the assets.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The question then becomes, as it seems to me, how I should most fairly and justly, and having regard to the overall principle of equality which must apply in this case, give effect to the wife&#8217;s additional claims as I have identified them in sub-paragraphs (v) and (vi) above. This in turn, in my judgment, raises two questions: </p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">First, does the fact that the wife has these additional claims justify a complete re-opening of the division which was implemented in March 2008, or can justice fairly and appropriately be done by simply awarding her an additional lump sum?</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to the first of these questions, the answer in my judgment is quite clear. There is no principled basis for completely re-opening the division which was implemented in March 2008. Subject only to the points I have identified, it was objectively fair then, and it does not cease to be fair merely because of the events which have since occurred. And given the comparatively modest adjustments which are called for by reason of those assets which were not included in the March 2008 division, I am quite satisfied that full justice can be done to the wife by simply awarding her an additional lump sum.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The most difficult question in the whole case is as to the appropriate amount of that lump sum. Although I must have regard to all the factors referred to in section 25 (assessed, of course, in the light of the crucial fact that all I am really concerned with is the appropriate adjustment to be made to a division which in large part has already been implemented), as also to the various matters pressed upon me by Mr Marks, the justice of the case requires, as it seems to me, that the lump sum is essentially the amount required to give the wife her appropriate share in respect of the two matters referred to in paragraphs [105(v)] and [105(vi)] above. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is, not least given all the valuation uncertainties in this case, an exercise which is hardly amenable to any very precise process of calculation. The starting point, in my judgment, has to be the figures referred to in paragraphs [105(v)] and [105(vi)] above, though always bearing in mind, as I do, that, as he himself accepted, Mr Clokey&#8217;s figures as I have quoted them in paragraph [105(v)] are at best only crude approximations to reality and that the tangible assets <span style="font-style:italic">may</span>, as Mr Howard would have it, be worth significantly more. </p>

As to the first point, he submits that this amount is appropriate having regard to the fact that the children will for much of the time be living in London &#8220;which will be expensive&#8221;, that the husband makes no indirect contribution to their maintenance, for example by taking them on holiday, and that they are the children of a very rich father who have been used to a very high standard of living. In relation to the other point, it is, he says, and not least given the current unhappy state of the relationship between the father and his children, wholly inappropriate that they be left to fend for themselves in negotiating with him.</p>
