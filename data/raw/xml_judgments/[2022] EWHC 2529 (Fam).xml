He told me that having listened to the audio recording, he was &#8220;disgusted&#8221; by his conduct and sent an e-mail of apology to the Judge.  I asked to see the message.  I do not propose to reproduce the totality of the message, but it includes the following:</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:1.05in">&#8220;Dear Judge, I write to you with a sincere apology for my behaviour within previous proceedings, my attitude and vile language. I'm very sorry and will conduct myself in an appropriate manner in the future. I hope that when I return to Durham family court, it is you whom is the judge so I can show and prove this to you... hearing the recording and myself behave in such a way makes me very sad and disappointed with myself. However its made me extremely determined to turn things around. &#8230; I hope you can accept my apology but I totally understand if not.&#160; I can't change what has happened in the past but I can do better and make sure the same doesn't happen in the future.&#8221;</p>

I find that Mr Duggan spoke with great anger and aggression.  His language and tone throughout the hearing was inappropriate at times escalating in both intensity and abuse.  He was disrespectful to the judge and was also disrespectful to the applicant, referring at one time to her as: &#8220;&#8230; still fucking doing shit&#8221;.  </p>

He referred to his reliance on his suicide prevent support worker. He spoke of his anxiety at leaving his house; I note that he said he was away from his home when participating in the hearing.  He said that he was &#8220;suffering from many, many &#8230; mental disorders&#8221;.   At one point he said &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for swearing but this is how I am.  I can&#8217;t help how I am&#8221;, adding &#8220;if I could I wouldn&#8217;t even be speaking like this?  I&#8217;d be speaking nicely&#8221;.

In fact, no such evidence was, to my understanding, filed.</p>

I am satisfied, having regard to the totality of the discourse in the court hearing on 27 May 2022, and on what Mr Duggan has said to me today, that he intended to disrupt, or create a real risk of prejudicing, the administration of justice on 27 May 2022 (see <span style="font-style:italic">Att-Gen v Sport Newspapers Ltd</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1991] 1 WLR 1194" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1991">[1991] 1 W.L.R. 1194</ref> at 1200; [1992] 1 All E.R 503 per Bingham LJ) and/or that this was a foreseeable consequence of his verbal abuse directed at the Judge. </p>

She was also very evidently concerned for the welfare of the applicant who had filed a statement complaining of similar conduct towards her, and who &#8220;was present and listening to his aggressive behaviour in a court hearing&#8221;.  I note that the District Judge was &#8220;&#8230; concerned that a court environment was being used by [Mr Duggan] to air his grievances and to expose a vulnerable applicant to further unacceptable conduct.&#8221;</p>

This charity provides Mr Duggan with emotional and practical support; Mr Corbett is his suicide prevention officer.    Mr Duggan receives sickness benefits, and for the last few months has been in receipt of the state-funded Personal Independence Payment (available for those with a long-term physical or mental health condition or disability, and difficulty undertaking certain everyday tasks as a consequence).  Therefore, although I have no expert medical evidence before me, I accept &#8211; by reason of the above &#8211; that Mr Duggan has a relevant history of mental ill-health, and that this may have contributed to his uninhibited behaviour at the hearing.  </p>
