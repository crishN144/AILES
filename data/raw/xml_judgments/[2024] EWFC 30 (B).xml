It was her first year teaching in England, so she was getting to grips with some differences of approach, and the system for recording safeguarding and other concerns on the CPOMS database.  However, I have not seen anything concerning about the entries she had made in the records, which accorded with her own clear memories. As a teacher who saw the children every day, it is not surprising that she may not have a recollection of particular conversations.  Her evidence was nonetheless clear about the repeated issues that she noticed with the children throughout the year, and the difficulties she experienced in engaging the mother in addressing them. She described D often arriving late at school, being upset, and her mum nowhere to be seen. She said D often said she wasn&#8217;t given breakfast in the morning (the mother said often the children would not eat breakfast before school but she would offer them a croissant or similar to take with them). <span style="font-style:italic">Ms J</span> described D being worried about her mum&#8217;s reaction to &#8216;bad things&#8217;, for example she asked her teacher to tell her mum she could not find her coat. At the same time, D would repeatedly ask her if she was having a good day or had done well at something, and if so, would ask her teacher to tell her mum about these &#8216;good things&#8217;.</p>

Her oral evidence was consistent with the conclusions she reached in her assessment, and the views that the other professionals have reached in the case. While she noted the mother was able to describe aspects of good parenting, she remained concerned that the mother was not able to see where her own parenting had fallen short in the past or what the impact had been on the children. She gave some examples to illustrate this. The mother felt she was being judged on the past and not on her ability to change. If time had allowed there could perhaps have been more discussion of what the mother might do differently the next time. For example, Mrs Norris described a discussion about the mother not appreciating the potential dangers of leaving two young children in a locked car while she went into the shops. It might have been helpful to have a discussion about the way one might structure your day so as not to find yourself needing to go to the shops when you have your children with you. But Mrs Norris&#8217;s evidence was that the mother was at such a very basic level when they were having these conversations, that it was not possible to go further.</p>

Nonetheless, telling a child off while holding a knife in your hand, where there is a history of hitting that child with hands and implements, and a history of threatening to hit the child if they do not behave, would be very likely to cause that child to feel scared and afraid.

When the guardian descried D&#8217;s conflicted feelings, of wanting to come home but at the same time displaying a high level of anxiety about it, the mother&#8217;s response was that it must be that D was anxious about her father being at the home.  The guardian wrote in her analysis: </p>

The tone of much of her evidence was that the children were the ones who had misbehaved, the children had been the ones to ask for the sweet drinks, she had not been able to &#8216;make&#8217; the children brush their teeth, that it was D who wanted to help around the house.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Mrs Norris&#8217;s concern was that the parents were focused on work and earning money, to the detriment of the children. In her final analysis the guardian recorded that the mother told her if she had the children back, she would work largely at weekends and have time off in the week.  The mother denied this was the case and said she had meant that she would only work sometimes at weekends, and if that happened, she would rely upon her sister or her close friend [<span style="font-style:italic">name redacted</span>] to look after the children. I doubt that the guardian was mistaken, but even assuming the mother had shifted her view by the time of the final hearing, that does not remove all concern.  In her witness statement of December 2023 she explains, entirely reasonably, that she would need to continue to work in order to provide a home for her children. She says that she would make sure <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;when they first came home I was around in case of settling in difficulties&#8217;</span>.  It is not clear after what period of time she feels she would need to up her hours with the result of her being around less. Of course working parents cannot be expected to look after their children every minute they are not at school, but there is a sense from the mother&#8217;s evidence as a whole that she has not fully understood the extent to which she would need to spend time with her children in order to learn and understand their needs, for them to gain confidence that she was someone they could rely upon to understand them and to respond to their needs, so that they felt safe and cared for.</p>

He did not appear to understand this was not safe, and seemed to be of the view that his work took priority.  He has accepted that the children were exposed to parental arguments and conflict in the home, but shown no understanding of the impact on the children. He has been quick to blame the children&#8217;s mother and has taken no responsibility himself for the way his children have been parented.</p>

While their mother hopes of course that she may be able to make changes in time for the children to spend more time with her and eventually for them to be restored to her care, that is not in my judgement likely to be a reality for some time, likely to be years.  <span style="font-style:italic">LM</span> spoke with some optimism about this, but there is some fundamental work for the mother to do, that goes beyond learning basic parenting skills. She will need to work towards accepting responsibility for the experiences her children have had that have led to them being removed from her care, understanding the factors that led to her parenting them in the way she did, and then learning how to bring about change.  Working with an organisation such as FASS (Family Assessment and Safeguarding Service) may help, although it is not clear that they take referrals where parents are separated from their children. I would hope that a referral can be made to Pause Oxfordshire, which works one to one with women who have had children removed from their care. The mother has engaged very well with VM in one to one sessions, and says she has got a lot of benefit from that.  It seems likely therefore that the Pause model would suit her, and I hope will give her access to the support and help she needs and she deserves, following the decision I have made for her children to remain in foster care.</p>

A part of that is living their lives according to the rhythms and routines of their new carers, and with their friends, interests and activities prioritised.  If they are travelling to see their parents every other week, this will disrupt both their routine, and their sense that their home is with their foster parents now. </p>
