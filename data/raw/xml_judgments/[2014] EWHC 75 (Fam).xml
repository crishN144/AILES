They were then both about 33; they are now both about 45.  Sadly they were unable to conceive a baby.  It was discovered while they were still living in Nigeria that the mother suffered from fibroids.  She underwent surgery for their removal in the hope that this would enable her to conceive.</p>

The father was found to have a low sperm count, for which he was given medication, and the mother was found to have further fibroids.  She was given treatment to reduce them.  In 2005 she underwent IVF treatment for which they had to pay &#163;5,000, being ineligible under the NHS.  In part the treatment was a success as the mother became pregnant, but at a very early stage she miscarried. </p>

The friend told the father that he had another friend in Lagos and that friend and his wife had had similar problems, but recently had undergone some herbal treatment in Nigeria as a result of which the wife was then pregnant with twins, and that the father&#8217;s friend could put them in touch with his other friend.</p>

The two couples did not know each other and had never met.  Mrs Ediare had given birth to twins following &#8216;herbal treatment&#8217;.  The father told me that once he knew there was evidence, being the arrival of the twins, he accepted the idea of trying herbal treatment.  The mother also decided it was something she wished to undergo.  The Ediares provided the herbalists contact details. In about February 2011 the mother, with the father listening in, contacted the herbalist and spoke to him on the telephone about the herbal treatment on offer.</p>

She had made an appointment and on 31 May 2011 she visited the Treatment Centre at an address in Lagos.  There, by appointment, she met Dr Okolo&#8217;s assistant, a woman called Joy, who examined her abdomen and prescribed three herbs, giving instructions as to their use. There were two herbs for the mother and one for the father.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On her return to London and following Joy&#8217;s instructions the mother took the first of the herbs for her, which she had been told would move her fibroids to one side; and the father took the herbs for him. Both took his/her respective herbs over a period of 30 days.  The herbs were initially put into water and allowed to infuse, and the infused water then drunk.  The parents had been told to abstain from sexual intercourse during this period.  After 30 days the mother started to take the second herb prescribed for her.  Again, it had been infused in water and she drank the infusion every morning until the day of delivery.</p>

She ceased to menstruate; she had only one period after her return to London in early June, may be a bit later.  Her ankles and legs became swollen, her face, cheeks and nose swelled up, her arms, abdomen and body became swollen.  She told me she became large.  From a dress size 12/14 she became a size 16/18.  She had to buy larger clothes and wore baggy, loose tops.  She also bought maternity jeans, but was able to use larger but ordinary leggings, not maternity leggings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr R saw her abdomen and observed that she looked about seven months pregnant, and possibly felt her abdomen.  In evidence he confirmed he accepted from his brief observation and examination, and from what he had been told that she was pregnant.  He also observed that the mother looked much happier than when he had previously seen her.  He was pleased for the couple because he had known they dearly wanted a child and IVF had not been successful.  He admits that in retrospect he should have tried to find the foetal heart and asked her about any ante-natal care and more about her plans for delivery in Nigeria.  In this he accepts that he assumed too much and allowed his professional mind to be clouded by his real delight at the pregnancy.  He told me he had no suspicion that the mother was not pregnant, and I accept that evidence.</p>

The parents tell me that they paid the total amount in local currency, Naira, and in cash.  The father&#8217;s sister contributed a significant sum in cash.  The father told me this came from monies which from time to time he sent home to Nigeria.  There are no clear receipts and the only available document is one purporting to be signed by Dr Okolo: &#8220;Treatment successful, patient delivered of a baby girl.

By this time they had met and were staying with Mr and Mrs Ediare in their home in Lagos.  At the &#8216;Treatment Centre&#8217; they were greeted by Joy.  The mother was given another infused drink, the &#8216;third&#8217; herb.  It tasted bitter and was brown in colour.  She was made to walk up and down the corridor of the centre.  In due course she needed to go to the lavatory, after which she was led into a room and the door was shut.  The father remained in the corridor:  he did not witness the birth, but in due course heard a baby cry.</p>

The mother described the delivery to me.  She was told to lie down on the floor and to push.  She did not experience much pain, which she attributed to the herb she had been given.  In due course she felt the baby&#8217;s head, and the baby&#8217;s body emerging and something sliding against her leg.  She was lying on her back with her knees up.  She could not see what was happening.  She then passed the placenta, after which she was allowed to get up from the floor and the father was allowed into the room.  She thought the whole process from when she drank the last infusion until the birth was about 1 hour 45 minutes.  The father thought it took about 20 minutes after the mother went into the room leaving him outside.  Both agreed it was not a prolonged labour.</p>

He has accepted his own shortcomings.  He also accepts on reflection that after he received the letter from the GMC dated 25 January 2013 he should not have made contact with the father and seen him on two or if not three occasions, or in the father&#8217;s own home.  His explanation for doing so was he panicked.  The letter had caused him great distress, worry and anxiety; he could not sleep and could not concentrate.  He was aware that the investigation by the GMC could eventually lead to him being struck off the Register.  When he contacted the father he wanted reassurance that the mother had been pregnant and the baby was theirs.  The father was able to give him that reassurance on 8 February at the meeting in the father&#8217;s home.  Being reassured Dr R calmed down.

He was perhaps too accepting of the mother&#8217;s account of the treatment and wish to travel back to Nigeria for the birth.  I accepted his openness in the concessions he made in his evidence.

The junior doctor saw her in April.</p>

In my view the simple explanation for there being no such records and for the mother&#8217;s strange account of the birth is that she never gave birth to A.</p>

Nothing is known about his qualifications and nothing is known about Joy.  Neither gave evidence, Dr Okolo particularly failing to arrive for the video link despite his assurances.</p>

They are both hard working and no criticism has been levelled at their life style.  They were desperate to have a child of their own.  I ponder did that desperation lead them to do something unlawful and fundamentally wrong by buying a baby who would have been removed probably at birth from the mother, or did that desperation lead them into the hands of wicked fraudsters.</p>

With him the father brought a bag of herbs for the doctor to see.  Later in July the police removed bags containing three different herbs from the family home which to date have been partially analysed by scientists at Kew Gardens.  Regrettably the analysis has not produced evidence of the properties of the drugs and whether any would have been able to reduce the mother&#8217;s fibroids or would have in some way caused the mother&#8217;s abdomen and body to swell, so as to appear she was pregnant. The final herb which the mother says she took to trigger labour was taken in Lagos and was never brought to London.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">What is striking in their evidence is that the mother attended the surgery three times in March and April when she says she was 7 plus months pregnant and approaching her due date.  If the mother had known that she was not in fact pregnant this was an extraordinary action, not just once but three times.  It would have been very risky because a doctor may have wanted to examine her, and the truth would have been ascertained relatively easily and quickly, and had she refused an examination the doctors may well have been sufficiently concerned to raise child protection issues with the Local Authority.  Had she known she was not pregnant it would have been more prudent to stay away and if necessary forego any maternity benefits or sick leave.  Or, I ask myself did she go to see the doctors with a form of arrogance and bluster thinking she could bluff and delude them.</p>

They so much wanted a baby. They come from Nigeria with the heritage of traditional herbal medicine, and allowed themselves to fall under the spell of the herbalists believing what was said to the mother, and acting faithfully upon the instructions given to them.  Contrary to the submissions of the Local Authority and Guardian I do not find the parents were wilfully and knowingly involved with or parties to a wrongful removal of A from her mother, or that they cynically &#8216;bought&#8217; a baby.  Throughout this evidence the father referred to &#8216;a process&#8217; they went through.  I accept there was a process, a charade in which they were unknowing players, in which they were deceived.</p>

There is no one in this country who has Parental Responsibility for her, and no information as to her birth, her parentage or background.  Nor is it known what happened to her mother, by whom she was removed from her mother, or  the exact date and place of birth or her circumstances until she arrived at the side of &#8216;the mother&#8217;.  The Threshold Criteria required by Section 31 of the Children Act has clearly been crossed in circumstances and at the hands of persons unknown.</p>
