A significant increase in the media interest in reporting the case resulted and this formed part of the background to the hearing of the application before me on 9 December 2015. The attempt to make an application on 2 December 2015 during court hours and the out of hours application made later that day to Theis J also formed part of that background.  Theis J made a reporting restrictions order over 9 December 2015 and I continued it on that day.</p>

Rather, it seems to me that, as reflected in the stance taken that the restrictions should end when the youngest child reached the age of 18 (which I rejected and commented on at paragraphs 136 to 143 of my judgment which have a link to paragraphs 27 to 35 thereof), the opposition of the Respondents at the out of hours hearing and the hearing on 9 December 2015 was based on an understandable approach from their perspective in the circumstances that then existed, namely that an injunction that would restrict what, and the way in which, the media wanted to report should be resisted on any properly arguable grounds.</p>

But, of itself, an approach that lacks compassion or is callous (see paragraphs 29 and 143 of the judgment) does not mean that it is wrong or contrary to the balance of competing Convention rights (see paragraph 35 of the judgment).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Also, there is a significant difference between the helter skelter of an out of hours application and one when there has been more time for thought and in my view the legal arguments advanced by, and later abandoned by, the Respondents were ones that they could properly advance.  The other side of this street at the out of hours application is reflected in my rejection of the criticisms of the Applicant&#8217;s counsel at paragraph 184 of my judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my view, the points made in the last two paragraphs mean that the fact that the Respondents advanced the arguments they did at the out of hours hearing (and on 9 December 2015) is not a valid reason for ordering them to pay costs.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In any event, and in my view importantly, if the Applicant wanted reporting restrictions to continue after the death of C the reality was that she had to make, and support by evidence and argument, an application to the court for a reporting restrictions order.  In theory she could have obtained undertakings from the Respondents to the same effect if the undertakings were to the court.  But that would not have covered all of the media coverage and approach that was troubling and distressing her and was not a practical option in the circumstances that existed.</p>

However, I leave open whether in other circumstances equivalent conduct could properly be taken into account to found either an order for costs or the basis of their assessment.</p>
