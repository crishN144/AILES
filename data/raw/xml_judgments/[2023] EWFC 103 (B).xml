Periodical payments for XFR were varied by consent to continue in the sum of &#163;1 pa after her nineteenth birthday.  The judge&#8217;s order exhorts the parties to mediate over periodical payments for XFR thereafter.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The benefits payable to the wife and XFR are even more complicated to calculate now that XFR has started college.  This was foreshadowed in my earlier judgments.  The local Welfare Unit has again provided helpful advice about that to which both are entitled.  The automatic care element of XFR&#8217;s Personal Independence Payment (PIP) has ceased and is subject to the wife accounting to the DWP for the number of days XFR is in her care.  Owing to her own heart condition the wife receives a PIP of &#163;505.40 pcm, split &#163;258 as to mobility and &#163;247.40 as to care.  The important point to keep in mind is that the amounts payable are variable on an almost monthly basis.  I calculate the wife received &#163;1,845 for the month of January 2023, which is consistent with Mr Taylor&#8217;s figure.  It is made up of Carer&#8217;s Allowance, Personal Independence Payments (for both) and Universal Credit (for both); some of the benefits are paid calendar monthly, others lunar monthly.  In addition, the wife has received two government payments, both of &#163;324, to assist with the rise in the cost of living.  However, there can be no certainty about the benefits payable; it will depend on the number of days XFR spends in the wife&#8217;s care.  It is not possible, in my judgment, to rely, as the husband does, on receipts to the wife&#8217;s account to establish a greater income from benefits, or from elsewhere for that matter, than I find to be her income now or as I found in my earlier judgments.  I find that there is double accounting here.    I use &#163;1,845 for January 2023 as only a guide.  The figure will increase by 10.1% from April 2023 in line with inflation.</p>

If she is found to have limited capability for work-related activity, she would be entitled to an additional &#163;354.28 pcm.   Equally, if found fit to work, she would be entitled to a work allowance of &#163;573 pcm.  The husband&#8217;s point is that the wife cannot have it both ways.  She must claim one or the other.  However, as Mr Taylor points out, the wife has not been &#8216;signed off&#8217;.  Her case is squarely put on the basis that she already undertakes more hours than full-time work and given her own health is unable, at least at present, to work in paid employment on top of &#8216;the many roles she performs for XFR&#8217;.</p>

This is set out in the bundle [p. 221] and is much reduced from the figures in 2021.  It is accepted that she could request an assessment for budgeted hours to enable her to undertake a part-time job.  However, XFR&#8217;s forthcoming operation and the wife&#8217;s own health problems do not make that a realistic option, at least at this time, and she gave detailed evidence of being unable to find carers, such as she has had in the past (particularly Tracey) who have the competence and commitment to manage XFR.  Even if such assistance could be found, there is still the need for XFR to be taken to hospital appointments and be cared for during outbreaks of covid and other viruses at college such as occurred recently.</p>

She has complex congenital heart disease, with clinical and biochemical evidence of heart failure, alongside cardiac arrhythmias.  The condition can lead to the wife becoming acutely unwell as when she was hospitalised for a week in May 2022.  Her treating consultant, wrote in her penultimate report the following:</p>

The wife&#8217;s GP shares that view; the wife may be able to undertake part-time sedentary work in isolation but not on top of caring for XFR, even when XFR is at college.  Even during those weeks, the wife provides about sixty-six hours care for XFR, considerably more during the holidays.</p>

She points to her deteriorating health in the last 18 months, which is supported by the medical evidence, both from her treating consultant and GP.  The demands of caring for XFR at weekends and during the holiday remain substantial.  I accept her evidence as to the number of hours this entails.  I also accept her evidence as to the number of medical appointments she is required to attend with XFR; these are set to increase further with whatever further investigations are needed in advance of any foot surgery.  While direct care payments are available to meet the cost of alternative carers, I accept the wife&#8217;s evidence that she has been unable to find reliable staff.  In short, I find the burden of meeting XFR&#8217;s care, at least at this time, falls entirely on the wife.</p>
