This is to my mind both a tragic and a pitiful state of affairs.  It concerns significant arrears of maintenance payments in relation to a son who is now in fact aged 25.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">  The essential factual background is as follows.    The mother, who is the appellant at this hearing, is now aged 66.  She is a fully retired teacher and lives in Scotland.  The father is now aged 64.  He is a solicitor, who has been practising here in London.  Around 1988, when the mother was aged about 40 and the father a little younger, there was some relationship between them.  They were in fact each married to other people at the time, and the father, but not the mother, has other children as well.  </span></p>

He is therefore, as I&#160;have said, now aged 25.  He is a highly intelligent and very well educated man, who has both a first degree and now also a higher MSc from Edinburgh University.  He appears to be a normal, healthy 25 year old man of considerable intelligence, although he currently does not have any job, nor, apparently, any means of support.  There can, however, be no possible question of any current or future liability on the part of his father to support him and, indeed, any possible liability must have ended at the very latest in summer 2011 when he completed his first degree.</span></p>

In May 2007 District Judge Waller, who was then the Senior District Judge, heard an application by the father for a variation downwards of the then level of periodical payments, and a cross application by the mother for enforcement of arrears.  The upshot of the order of District Judge Waller was, in summary, that the arrears were crystallised as arrears of general maintenance of &#163;21,500, plus school fees in the sum of &#163;36,319, plus some costs in the sum of &#163;10,000; so that as the case moved from District Judge Waller in May 2007, the father owed the mother &#163;67,819.  </span></p>

By then it seems to have been agreed that the arrears of maintenance, costs and interest stood at, in round terms, &#163;70,000.  The father undertook to pay off those arrears at the rate of &#163;1,000 per month by standing order of &#163;700 per month into a bank account of the mother and &#163;300 per month into a bank account of the son (who was by then of course fully adult and nearing the end of his first degree at Edinburgh University).</span></p>

According to paragraph 2 of the judgment of Deputy District Judge Simpson, the arrears at that date stood at &#163;62,000.  Deputy District Judge Simpson acceded to the proposal and draft order proposed by counsel who appeared on that occasion on behalf of the father.  She remitted all the arrears as at that date, &#8220;save to the extent of &#163;23,400&#8221;.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">  The mother was understandably very dissatisfied by that outcome and applied to the High Court for permission to appeal from that decision and order.  At a hearing before Mr&#160;Justice Peter Jackson in September 2013, that judge helpfully identified and summarised in a preamble to his order the &#8220;grounds of appeal &#8230; potentially available to&#8221;  the mother.  I&#160;will not set them out in this judgment but I&#160;have read them and have them all firmly in mind.  He granted to the mother permission to appeal.  It is that appeal which is now before me today.  Meantime, however, by an application finally issued on 17 February 2014, the father himself has applied for permission to appeal, and permission to appeal out of time, from the same order of Deputy District Judge Simpson made on 3 May 2013.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">  It is clear, however, that the father&#8217;s own application for permission to appeal should properly be characterised as an application to vary the order of 3&#160;May 2013 on the grounds of a subsequent change in circumstances.  As I&#160;have already mentioned, the actual order made by Deputy District Judge Simpson was to all intents and purposes (although she fixed a slightly higher monthly repayment figure) an order as proposed by the father himself through his counsel, so he is scarcely able now to say that the decision and order of Deputy District Judge Simpson was wrong on the facts and in the circumstances that prevailed as at 3&#160;May 2013.  </span></p>

Accordingly, as I&#160;have said, his proposed application is properly not one for permission to appeal but one to vary.   In order to be practical and having regard to the overriding objective in rule&#160;1 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010, I&#160;propose to refuse his application for permission to appeal, but to treat that application as an extant application before me today to vary the order of Deputy District Judge Simpson on the grounds of a subsequent change in circumstances.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">  The present circumstances of each of these parents are, frankly, as I&#160;have already said, both tragic and pitiful.  Starting with the mother, she suffered a stroke during September 2013.  That has left her with a number of physical problems which she has described to me, but which I&#160;will not set out in this public judgment; and it has left her with a number of what she describes as &#8220;cognitive problems&#8221;.  In particular she has problems now in coping with numbers and sequences, and problems, for instance, in organising in any rational way the papers in this case.  She says that she now has no savings whatsoever.  She lives with her own sister, aged 64, in a rented flat in Scotland under a settled arrangement between them.  Her only sources of income are a combination of her state old age pension and a very modest teacher&#8217;s pension.  She says that her combined income from all sources is about &#163;10,000 per annum.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">  Clearly, therefore, any further payments that the mother can recover and receive from the father will be enormously welcome to her.  The fact of the matter is that, as of May last year, he owed her under court orders that he had simply failed to obey the sum of around &#163;62,000.  To her, in her present circumstances, &#163;62,000 would make an enormous difference to her security and comfort in older age and as she adjusts to living with the physical and mental disabilities following her stroke.  The father never fully complied with maintenance obligations for many years during the childhood of his son.  The result was it was the mother who bore the brunt of supporting their son as well as paying for private education for him.  The father still, on any view, morally owes her all this money, and it is in part because of his failure to pay it that her own circumstances are now so exiguous.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">  On his side, however, the situation also appears to be a bleak one.  He says &#8212; and for the purposes of today I&#160;will accept &#8212; that prior to 2003 he was a senior partner in an apparently prosperous firm of solicitors which unfortunately became insolvent and &#8220;went bust&#8221; in 2003.  As a result, he himself became personally bankrupt, and being bankrupt, was unable to practise his profession as a solicitor between 2003 and 2007.  He did then re-establish himself as effectively a sole practitioner under the name of a limited company A &amp; M Legal Services Limited.  He says, however, that the work of that firm was essentially publicly funded family law work.  As is well known, there have been crippling cutbacks in the provision of public funding or legal aid for family work recently, with the result indeed that a significant number of &#8220;High Street&#8221; firms in that field have been forced to close down or, at any rate, branch out into different spheres of legal practice.</span></p>

There is, indeed, a practice (I&#160;expressly do not describe it as a rule) that the courts may not enforce arrears which are more than about 12&#160;months outstanding.  Whilst that approach appears not to have weighed with District Judge Waller back in 2007, it obviously did weigh more with Deputy District Judge Simpson in 2013.  </span></p>

By now, as I&#160;have said, the child concerned is well and truly adult, being aged 25, and very highly qualified.  By now, the mother has, of course, reached the age of 66 and is retired and not entirely well &#8212; but also the father has reached the age of 64.  Undoubtedly, small firms of solicitors such as his practising in the field of publicly funded family law have recently faced a financial hurricane, and however the case may have struck District Judge Waller in 2007, it clearly looks very different now.</span></p>

That is possible, but I cannot have sufficient confidence that he will be able to, to make an order which assumes that.  At his age he is vulnerable to potential ill health and he made the point, which is valid, that there have already been changes in the payment structure from government in relation to legal aid and his type of work could be vulnerable to more of that type of government intervention.&#8221;</span></p>

He did, however, after the lunch break, offer that, however dire his situation, he will make payments at the rate, not of &#163;650 but rather of &#163;400 per month.  He also told me quite openly that he has been in communication with his own elder son (who is, of course, the half-brother of the son concerned in this case).  He said that his elder son is a high earning lawyer, and implied, without saying so directly, that he may be able to get some help in his own parlous circumstances from his son to enable him to discharge his own legal obligations to the mother of this other son.</span></p>

It is not at all to the credit of the father that so much arrears have been allowed to arise and accumulate over the years.  He has already had a very substantial reduction in the arrears from &#163;62,000 down to &#163;23,400.  I&#160;am simply not prepared to exercise a discretion further to reduce that amount, nor indeed to reduce the rate of repayment.  If the rate of repayment is reduced from &#163;650 to some lesser amount a month, the obligation to repay will stretch so far ahead as to become almost meaningless in the hands of the mother.</span></p>
