In May she gave in to his requests.  She is reported by the probation officer to have said that her nephew had asked her to have sex with her son and to film it and send the footage to him.  She denied being coerced.  She is reported to have, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;expressed neither surprise nor dismay at the nature of his request.&#8217;</span>   No context is given for how she persuaded her son that she could masturbate him, give him oral sex, have penetrative sex with him, let alone get him to record it on his phone.  This is highly unlikely to have begun and ended on one day &#8211; a &#8216;one off&#8217; as mother seems to suggest.  There could have been coercion, but equally there could have been grooming, a build-up of trust over time, or some mixture of both.  </p>

It has been made clear to him that if he separated from Ms A, then he might be able to care for A on his own, not just by these professionals, but by social workers and the guardian.  But he has not so far ever been able to maintain his separation from A&#8217;s mother for more than a few months.  Still in his oral evidence before me appeared bewildered about why the local authority did remove A from his and Ms A&#8217;s care at birth.

This is wholly unrealistic, not just because of the professional assessments of her, but because her placement on the sex offenders register and the restrictions imposed by the sexual harm prevention order would make it virtually impossible for her to have a child in her care or come into contact with other children.

Mr and Mrs H have been extensively assessed, shown their commitment to A by spending time in England this summer, and have established a relationship with him.  The local authority has obtained appropriate legal advice and put in train all the steps necessary towards achieving permanence for A as soon as reasonably practicable, via the route of a Convention adoption.  Holding off the making of a placement order until Mr and Mrs H have been confirmed as prospective adopters would build in unnecessary delay for A, and is not justified on the evidence.</p>

It is of course of benefit to him to have life story work, to understand the make up of his family of origin, the reasons that he has not grown up in the care of his parents, and maybe in time to know that he has older half-siblings in [redacted].  It will be important for him to know who his mother is.  I am not at this point sure that continuing regular virtual contact with his mother will add benefits over and above this life story work, compared to the potential risks to him of that contact.  However, I accept that this will be a matter for the local authority to consider further, and keep under review.

Mr S does not pose a direct risk of harm, but there remain serious concerns about his ability to protect A from harm.
