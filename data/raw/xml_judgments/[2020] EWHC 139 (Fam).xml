The application for an order was made by Hertfordshire County Council on 10 December 2019.  The application is opposed by AK&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Guardian, Catherine Stephens.

In February 2018, AK pleaded guilty to two offences of arson. From May 2018, AK was regularly reported missing and has continued to be reported missing throughout the involvement of the local authority.

The court has not had the opportunity at this hearing to undertake an exhaustive investigation of the authorities.  However, in <span style="font-style:italic">Cheshire West</span>, Lord Kerr at [77] formulated the relevant question as one of whether, <span style="font-style:italic">in actuality</span>, a person&#8217;s liberty is restricted. In <span style="font-style:italic">Re RD (Deprivation or Restriction of Liberty)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2019] 1 FLR 173" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] 1 FLR 173</ref> at [37] Cobb J made clear that his focus was on RD&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">actual</span> circumstances in placement.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Re D</span> at [42] Baroness Hale spoke in terms of children who <span style="font-style:italic">are</span> subject to a level of control beyond that which is normal for a child of their age. Finally, in <span style="font-style:italic">Guzzardi v Italy</span> [1980] 3 EHRR 333 the ECtHR observed that to determine whether someone has been &#8220;deprived of his liberty&#8221; within the meaning of Art 5, the starting point must be his or her <span style="font-style:italic">concrete situation</span>. In this context, the authorities suggest that in determining whether to make a DOL order, ordinarily the task of the court is to consider whether the current circumstances of the child amount to a deprivation of liberty for the purposes of Art 5 of the.  In this case, AK is not actuality deprived of his liberty at the present time for the reasons I have described.  That is not his concrete situation as matters stand.   </p>

However, and again assuming that the care plan if implemented would amount to a deprivation of liberty such as to justify a DOL order, this gives rise to a further and significant concern with the granting of a contingent or anticipatory DOL order.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The local authority&#8217;s position amounts to the court being asked to confer upon an applicant local authority a continuing and contingent authority to deprive a child of his or her liberty <span style="font-style:italic">if</span> it becomes necessary to do so at some unidentified future point upon the <span style="font-style:italic">local authority&#8217;s </span>assessment that this course of action is in the child&#8217;s best interests. In <span style="font-style:italic">Re D</span> at [41] Baroness Hale made clear that the protection afforded by Art 5 of the ECHR is precisely so that there can be an <span style="font-style:italic">independent </span>assessment whether the arrangements that constitute a deprivation of liberty can be said to be in a person&#8217;s best interests.  It is implicit in the authorities that I have mentioned above that that assessment by an independent authority falls to be made at the point at which it is said the person is deprived of their liberty.  Within this context, the making of an anticipatory order in favour of the local authority that will govern a situation that may or may not pertain in the future deprives the court of the ability to conduct an independent assessment of the circumstances of AK at the point in time his liberty is said to be deprived, in a situation that is likely to be highly fluid and that could change on a day by day basis.   </p>

In an urgent situation, this can be achieved by an immediate application to the urgent applications judge sitting in the Family Division, made to the Out of Hours Judge if necessary. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Fourth, in addition to these difficulties, it is possible to identify wider disadvantages to the making of contingent or anticipatory DOL orders authorising the deprivation of liberty of vulnerable children on the happening of some future event.  The current use of DOL orders to restrict the liberty of children in residential placements is a remedy that sits outside the statutory regime established by Parliament, after due consideration and debate, for the secure accommodation of children pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In these circumstances, in the absence of a clear legislative intent and where the liberty of the subject is at stake and any restriction on that liberty will constitute a serious interference with the fundamental rights of the individual, the court must be <span style="font-style:italic">extremely</span> chary of proceeding in a manner that would have the effect of conferring on a local authority a wide discretion to regulate the deprivation of a child&#8217;s liberty (as I am satisfied would be one of the clear effects of granting a contingent or anticipatory order to be implemented at some future date upon the local authority&#8217;s own best interests assessment at that time) without the strict oversight that comes with granting a DOL order only after the <span style="font-style:italic">court</span> has evaluated the child&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">current</span> situation by reference to the demands of the imperatives contained in Art 5 of the ECHR.  I agree with Mr Sharp that this would amount to a significant, and undesirable, extension of the use of the inherent jurisdiction in cases of this nature.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">All this is not, of course, to say that there will <span style="font-style:italic">never</span> be a case in which a court will grant a DOL order in respect of a child on the basis of a regime (whether set out in a care plan or otherwise) that has not yet been implemented but will be.  However, I anticipate that before making such an order the court will need cogent<span style="font-style:italic"/>evidence that the regime proposed <span style="font-style:italic">will</span> be the regime that will be applied to the child if the DOL order is granted, rather than the far more speculative situation that pertains in this case. Namely, that the care plan will be implemented <span style="font-style:italic">if </span>in the assessment of the local authority at some future point AK&#8217;s behaviour deteriorates to the point where the application of those provisions becomes in his best interests and in circumstances where the existing regime that has proceeded without the need for a DOL order has been stable over a period of time. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It is important that the local authority understands what the decision I have reached does <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">not</span> do.  The decision of the court does <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">not</span> allow the local authority now to implement its stated care plan in full without a DOL order.  Similarly, in circumstances where the local authority has contended before the court that the full implementation of the care plan at some future date would constitute a deprivation of AK&#8217;s liberty for the purposes of Art 5, my decision does <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">not</span> absolve the local authority of the need to apply to the court for a DOL order if it decides at some future point to implement its stated care plan in full.  In such circumstances, if the local authority determines at that future date that AK&#8217;s welfare requires the care plan to be implemented in full, the local authority will need to at that point make the appropriate application and the court will make its determination.  The decision of the court simply reflects, for the reasons I have given above, the consequence of none of these contingent events having yet come to pass. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In closing, I am bound also to observe that on the face of the papers there appears to be a stark contradiction in this case between the position of the local authority over the many, many months over which AK was repeatedly absconding, self-harming, committing crime and suffering with his mental health, during which time the local authority made <span style="font-style:italic">no</span> attempt to seek the relief for which it now contends, and the position now adopted by the local authority at the point that AK is showing improvement and progress, which is to press strenuously for relief that no longer adequately reflects AK&#8217;s current position.
