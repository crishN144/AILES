	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There are two sets of divorce proceedings arising from the marriage of the parties. The first was issued by SK (husband) on 26 April 2022 in the Courts of Kaitha in India and the second application was issued by RR (wife) on 12 December 2022 (reissued on 28 April 2023) in the Courts of England and Wales. SK defends the latter divorce proceedings. At first, he contended that the Courts of England and Wales had no jurisdiction to hear the divorce, and latterly that the proceedings in England and Wales should be stayed or dismissed as the Courts in Kaitha are best placed to hear the divorce and ancillary issues arising from their separation. Therefore, the primary issue in this case is one of forum and convenience. </p>

Subject to paragraph 10(2) of the said schedule, if the conditions in paragraph 8 are met, the court is mandated to stay the proceedings. These conditions are not satisfied and paragraph 8 does not apply to this case. By contrast, paragraph 9 gives the court with a discretion to stay the proceedings in England and Wales in favour of proceedings in another jurisdiction. It provides that:</p>

They were married in India on 11 March 2019 and RR joined her husband in the UK on 11 September 2019. Having travelled back to India in February 2020, both parties remained there until September of the same in observation of the COVID restrictions that were in place at that time. The parties do not agree the date of separation. RR states that she went to India in April 2021 and remined in contact with SK until April 2022. She says she was abandoned there by SK. SK states that they separated in April 2021 and have not had contact since. RR returned to the UK in March 2022 and has since remined living here. </span></p>

She further states that SK has a powerful family in India and that she may be the subject of shame, ridicule and abuse should she return to India. SK denies the allegations and alleges an ulterior motive on the part of RR for marrying him and lying about his sexuality so as to cause shame and division within his family.

In my judgment he was entirely correct to do so as the issue of the jurisdiction of this court was beyond argument and had this issue remained contested, I would have readily found that this court has jurisdiction to hear the parties divorce. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">Tunring to forum conveniens, SK argues that any divorce granted in this jurisdiction is unlikely to be recognised by the Indian authorities given that the parties have a substantial connection to India and were married in India under its subsisting laws. He further argues that allegations between the parties that are likely to require the court&#8217;s determination involve family members who live in India and assets that are in India. Furthermore, he has already incurred the costs of proceedings in India and the ongoing cost are likely to be far less than those that would be in this jurisdiction. Although he has not argued the issue of translation and language, I also take into account that there is likely to be an additional costs associated with these if witnesses from India are required to give evidence in proceedings in this jurisdiction. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">On behalf RR, Ms Davies sets out a number of factors that support the continuation of proceedings in this jurisdiction. These include the parties residence and intention to permanently reside in the UK. SK conducts his business and works in the UK. RR was in the UK when the Indian proceedings were issued. Her travel to India and participation in those proceedings are curtailed by her limited financial resources and health difficulties that are supported by medical evidence. The only matrimonial asset is in the UK.  RR fears for her safety if she is required to return to India. The relevant allegations of conduct of the parties took place in this jurisdiction and not India. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">There are a number of serious allegations that involve the extended family members in India and in my judgment this is one SK&#8217;s strongest arguments that are also relevant to the issues of costs, witness availability and language. However, I cannot see how these allegations would be relevant to the issue of divorce and Financial Remedies proceedings in this jurisdiction. Any action by any of the extended family members in India is not the subject of my considerations in these proceedings as they do not seem to be at all relevant. Furthermore, whilst the relevance of the interparty conduct is yet to be determined, the alleged conduct took place in this jurisdiction. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">Whilst I recognise that he has already incurred the costs of proceedings in India, I must balance this against the streamlined process of divorce that is available to the parties which has been delayed by SK defending the same. I further weigh into the balance the likelihood of  ongoing financial remedy proceedings when both parties reside and work in this jurisdiction and where the only matrimonial asset is. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">I note that SK has not provided any reliable evidence about the lack of recognition by the Indian Courts of a decree of divorce in this jurisdiction. If his assertion is correct, these must be balanced against the other relevant factors that include those that are submitted on behalf of RR, in particular the impact upon her access to justice in the Indian courts where the unchallenged evidence illustrates the limited financial resources that are at her disposal and the impact upon her health should.</span></p>

Accordingly, I dismiss SK&#8217;s application for a stay of these proceedings and order him to take steps to withdraw the proceedings in India.</span></p>
