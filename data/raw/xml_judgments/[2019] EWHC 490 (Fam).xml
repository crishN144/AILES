	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">I am concerned with the two children of the applicant father MR and the respondent mother JN. Their eldest child is Q (born in 2002 and is now 17 years old) and their younger child is V (born in 2006 and is now 12 years old). The father who lives in Poland has made an application for the return of Q to Poland pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the court with respect to the children and an application for the return of V to Poland pursuant to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (The 1980 Hague Convention).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">The application arises out of the removal of Q and V from Poland by the mother in about August 2018. Prior to that date they had both lived all of their lives in Poland.  As the children were habitually resident in Poland prior to August 2018, and as the mother accepts they were wrongfully removed from Poland in breach of the father&#8217;s rights of custody, the 1980 Hague Convention is engaged in respect of V. Because Q is over 16, The 1980 Hague Convention does not apply to him and hence the application in respect of Q is brought under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court, that conferring jurisdiction in respect of young people who have not yet reached the age of 18. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">I hope that Q and V will forgive me for referring to them in this judgment as &#8216;the children&#8217;; I do so only because they are the children of the applicant father and the respondent mother and I am considering applications relating to them as the children of their parents. I am very conscious of the fact that Q is a young man rather than a child in the colloquial sense and that V is on the cusp of adolescence.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">The parents have been involved in litigation in respect of the children since about November 2010, shortly after the parents separated. Although I do not have a complete picture of the Polish courts involvement in this family&#8217;s life over the eight odd years that have followed, it is clear that the parents have been in conflict over the arrangements for the children ever since their final separation in September 2010. At times the children have lived with their mother and at times the children have lived with their father. Since August 2014 the children, pursuant to an order of the Warsaw appeal court, either have been or should have been living with the father; that court having determined that they should do so.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">In or about April 2018 the mother removed V from the father&#8217;s care. Within a short period, thereafter Q also ended up living with the mother. The father says that since then he has had virtually no contact; the mother seems in general terms to accept there has been little contact although she says that the father saw them in around July 2018. The father appears to have issued proceedings in the Polish courts to enforce the order that determined the children should have been living with him but it does not appear that that had been determined prior to the children&#8217;s departure from Poland. It seems that there is a hearing in Poland, probably in connection with the father&#8217;s application, listed for 31 January 2019.  In about August 2018 the mother brought them to England and since then they have been living together with the mother, her partner and their two-year-old son. V commenced school in about December 2018 and Q has been attending an English language school since about January 2019.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">The proceedings commenced in this court on 29 November 2018 when Mr Justice Newton made a location order without notice to the respondent mother. On 18 December the matter came before Ms Justice Russell. Both parties were represented by counsel and directions were given including the court dispensing with the need for the making of a written application in respect of Q.  The mother confirmed that she intended to defend both applications albeit she had had little time to seek advice but an indication was given that she would be relying on the Article 13(b) exception of grave harm or intolerability.  She was directed to file an answer setting out the details of any defence and a statement in support by 5 January 2019. The father was directed to file evidence in response by 15 January. Regrettably the order did not specify that the mother should identify any protective measures that she sought in order to ameliorate any Article 13(b) risk. Nor did the order required the father to identify any protective measures that he relied on to ameliorate any Article 13(b) risk identified.  A Cafcass officer was directed to meet with the children to ascertain their maturity, their position on a return to Poland and whether either raised an objection. A final hearing with a time estimate of one day was listed at risk on 24 January 2019. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">Unfortunately, the mother did not file an answer as required by Ms Justice Russell&#8217;s order and so her defence to the application has to be divined from the witness statement that she filed. The position statement filed on behalf of the mother for this hearing identified only Article 13(b) grave harm or intolerability as a defence. However it is self-evident from the Cafcass report filed that the article 13 child&#8217;s objections exception was also potentially engaged.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">The father&#8217;s statement in response joined issue with the mother&#8217;s account of the history. No protective measures were identified in the statement that addressed the concerns raised by the mother. Having seen the Cafcass report the father offered an undertaking that the children should reside with their paternal grandparents for a period of time. This had not been capable of refinement although I was unable to get to the bottom of why this was so given that the matter had been due to be heard on 24 January and the father had both specialist English solicitors and a lawyer in Poland.  </p>

Ms Papazian provided a detailed skeleton argument for which I am very grateful.

Despite the court having booked two Polish interpreters as required by the order of Ms Justice Russell the contracting agency mistakenly cancelled the booking and so as at 10.30 there was no interpreter for the mother to enable Ms Omideyi to take instructions from her or to assist her in following the hearing. As it happened her English was sufficiently good to enable she and her counsel to confer and for her to follow the proceedings and give instructions. Her proficiency in English was demonstrated by the statement that she had provided to the court which was prepared in English and without the need for it to be translated or interpreted to her. It was also evident in how she followed and gave instructions in response to what I was saying and what the Cafcass officer and Ms Papazian were saying. The absence of an interpreter for the father prevented Ms Papazian being able to take instructions from the father or his Polish lawyer; although given that court interpreters are only booked for the commencement of hearings at 10:30am the emphasis should be on solicitors ensuring that they have taken instructions prior to the commencement of the hearing. Thus the hearing commenced without interpreters. At some point after 2:00pm whilst Ms Demery was giving her evidence, an interpreter for the mother arrived and later an interpreter for the father. </p>

As a 17-year-old whose return was sought against his expressed wishes it seemed to me that there was potentially an argument that he ought to be joined as a party. Ms Omideyi told me that she too had raised this issue upon her arrival at court. </p>

We drew stumps at about 5:00pm. At that point I indicated that I would not be in a position to deliver a decision still less a judgment that afternoon. Ms Demery had identified that both children wanted to meet with me. Earlier in the day I had declined to meet with the children prior to considering and circulating my judgment having regard to the difficulties highlighted by the case of Re KP (abduction: child&#8217;s objections) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2014] 2 FLR 660" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] 2 FLR 660</ref>. I indicated that I would see the children in order to explain my decision to them I being fully satisfied that their views had been comprehensively explored by Ms Demery and her meetings with them and in the letters they had written to me and that it was not appropriate to see them to further reassure them that I understood their position prior to giving judgment. The difficulty of them seeking to give further evidence to me or to persuade me of their views seemed to me to be too great in this case in particular having regard to Ms Demery&#8217;s views on the extent to which the children have been exposed to chronic parental conflict over a period of many years and the pressure they might feel under. Thus in the exercise of the discretion given to me and having regard to the 2010 Practice Note (Guidelines for Judges meeting children who are subject to family proceedings) and Re KP I concluded it was most appropriate to see them after I had prepared my judgment.

Ms Demery is clear that there is evidence of influence both in terms of what she says but also the school&#8217;s concerns. She was not at all clear that she had got either V or Q&#8217;s authentic views. There is also clear evidence that V has no perspective; her inability to describe anything positive about Poland or her father illustrates this and there are signs that they were content living with the father. Given the Polish authorities did not move them this suggests the concerns were not made out. It is likely that her expressed views would alter upon a return. At present she is having no contact with her father and this is not conducive to her welfare. When in Poland living with her father she had regular contact with the mother. Policy considerations in this case weigh very heavily given the mother has failed to comply with Polish court orders in 2014, has breached Polish court orders in 2018 and has abducted the children from Poland; the mother&#8217;s wrongful actions should not be condoned. The Polish courts continue to hear proceedings concerning the children and as a matter of comity a return should be ordered. </p>

There was nothing from Q which indicated that he wanted a lawyer or to be involved in these proceedings. Given his age and his exposure to litigation over the years had he wanted to be more involved he would probably have said. She points out that if he were to become more involved he would no doubt come under intense pressure from the mother to drive her case which would be harmful to him. At present it is reasonable to infer that the views he expresses derive from a desire to align himself with the mother and to avoid being pressed by her. In particular in relation to Skype if he says he is complying with a court order this insulates him from any maternal condemnation. His views are fully before the court and his case has been articulated by the mother balances in favour of him not being separately represented whether for welfare reasons or for autonomy reasons. </p>

He would be entitled to public funding (subject to means) PD 16 A paragraph 7 identifies particular circumstances where it may be appropriate to make a child a party. The Supreme Court also gave guidance in the context of 1980 Hague Convention proceedings in Re LC (reunite: international child abduction centre intervening) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2014] 1 AC 1038" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] 1 AC 1038</ref>. The Court of Appeal considered the position in relation to private law proceedings in Mabon-v-Mabon <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 2 FLR 1011" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 2 FLR 1011</ref>. I have in mind what those courts said and in particular I am very conscious of Q&#8217;s age and the Court of Appeal&#8217;s indication that in private law proceedings concerning fundamental decisions in older children&#8217;s lives that they should be involved in the decision-making. I note that the decision I am asked to make is in no sense a final determination of where or with whom Q should live. It is a decision which would involve him returning to Poland so that the courts there could consider his position; those courts being far better placed given their longterm involvement in this family to understand his position and what would be appropriate for him. Although I don&#8217;t underestimate the importance of the decision to Q it is not in its nature comparable to a leave to remove with long term permanent consequences. I also observe that none of the categories identified in 7.2 (a)-(j) are apt to apply to Q&#8217;s situation. In particular sub paragraph (e) whilst it might <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> apply has to be viewed in the context of what Lord Wilson said in Re LC where he identified that in child&#8217;s objections cases that paragraph should not be taken to indicate joinder in every case.  I also note that Lord Wilson referred to Baroness Hale&#8217;s observations in re M taking account of whether joinder would add sufficiently to the court&#8217;s understanding to justify the additional cost, intrusion and delay.  </p>

The court must also take into account matters such as the need for them to have a separate voice in order to ensure that their position is adequately advocated or understood. The court must weigh the impact of separate representation on their welfare and the potential negative impact of them being drawn into the parental conflict and the court arena but also positives in relation to what they might bring to the process and how it might ensure they bought into the outcome. Lastly the court must also consider the impact on the proceedings in terms of delay or expense. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">Ms Demery is a very experienced Cafcass officer. She has worked for many years in the High Court team dealing with Hague Convention cases. She has considerable experience also of acting as a Guardian for children. When she said in the witness box that she had not thought about separate representation for Q she seemed surprised herself that she had not. However I conclude that she was probably being too hard on herself. In most cases where separate representation is considered by a Cafcass officer it is because either the court has invited them expressly to consider the issue or because it becomes apparent to the Cafcass officer through their interview with the child either that the child&#8217;s own attitude to the case is such that they are either expressly requesting their own lawyer or they are demonstrating an approach which indicates that they would want a lawyer if they knew that option was open to them. Alternatively the situation itself may demand consideration of separate representation. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">It seems clear from Ms Demery&#8217;s interview with Q that he was not expressing himself in a way that indicated a powerful desire to play a role in the proceedings. There are many examples both in the reported cases and otherwise of children, sometimes relatively young children, expressing themselves in a way which plainly indicate their desire to play a fuller role and to have lawyers. I accept Ms Papazian&#8217;s point that the children&#8217;s exposure to court proceedings and professionals over the years is such that had Q wanted to be more involved he would have been able to say so. In fact Ms Demery noted that when she spoke to him about previous interviews with social workers or similar he gave the impression of not really recalling that and I infer from that that he wished to distance himself from the process. Given the very highly conflicted situation between the parents it seems most likely that Q feels caught in the middle and would prefer not to become more involved in the parental dispute than is absolutely necessary. Thus in terms of Q&#8217;s autonomy and his desire to be involved I do not consider this to be a situation which demands separate representation. This is not case where there is a powerful argument by an articulate and mature teenager who has searched out a lawyer in order to ensure their case is heard.  </p>

In welfare terms the chronic parental conflict means that Q is caught between two parents both of whom he probably loves and he should not be forced to take sides where the evidence suggests that he is unable to express himself freely in his current situation. His being drawn into the court arena is likely to be more harmful for him in welfare terms than empowering in autonomy terms. Joining would also result in delay and I&#8217;m not even sure that if I joined him he would particularly wish to instruct a solicitor and become involved. For all those reasons I do not consider it to be in his best interests to be joined. </p>

Inevitably in summary applications under the 1980 Hague Convention the ability of the parties to put clear evidence before the court, in particular documentary evidence is limited by timeframes, access to funds and access to documentation. However even having regard to those to be expected limits it has been a challenge to get a clear picture of the historical background in this case. Whilst in respect of respondents who are not entitled to non-means and non-merits public funding and who might instruct nonspecialist solicitors the same cannot be said of applicants who received non-means non-merits public funding and whose solicitors will always be on the ICACU panel of specialist abduction solicitors. Whilst the father made oblique reference to legal proceedings in Poland since April 2018, it was only when I specifically asked about the position that a letter dated 21 January 2019 emanating from the father&#8217;s Polish lawyers and setting out a summary of legal proceedings in Poland was produced. Ms Papazian informed me that she had asked that the letter be included in the bundle but that it had not made its way in.  In paragraph 15 of the father&#8217;s statement he refers to the children being seen by the court in Poland - possibly in 2017 or 2018. The mother also refers to this in paragraph 20 of her statement. However no documents have been provided which confirm what occurred at court. Both the mother and the father make reference to issues relating to the care of the children being raised with police, possibly social services, the school but there is almost no contemporary documentation; the last formal piece of documentation from the court appearing to be the judgment of the appeal court dating back to 27 August 2014. The mother produced a series of exhibits to her statement many of which were in Polish and which had not been translated; although informal translations were referred to by Ms Omideyi in submissions.   </p>

		  <p style="margin-left:0in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">According to the order of the Warsaw provincial Court of 27 August 2014, on 2 November 2010 the mother applied to the district court for a residential order in respect of the children. On 26 May 2011 the father applied for a residential order and for contact. I note that this contradicts the mother&#8217;s assertion that the father never applied for contact. The judgment says that both parents were active in bringing the children up until September 2010 with him looking after them single-handedly at times. In May 2010 the police attended an incident and the mother was placed in a mental institution. She returned to the family home in July and in September moved out to live with the father&#8217;s brother. In October 2010 she rented a property and without informing the father took V from her nursery to live there and a few days later took Q. This appears to have been the commencement of a pattern of the mother taking unilateral action. There were problems over contact with police involvement as a result of the mother obstructing the father&#8217;s contact; on one occasion she demanded money to buy a new kitchen in exchange for permitting contact. </p>

The school investigated the bullying complaint. V seems to have been doing very well indeed at school and appears to have had friends. This does not suggest that either school or V or the father regarded any issue as a serious one; unlike the mother. It is clear that V was seen by doctors in relation to her alleged arrhythmia. The mother herself agrees that she was seen at the hospital and the mother herself agrees with the father that the doctor concluded there was no serious problem. However the mother infers that the doctor was either coerced or pressured by the father into saying there was no problem. This seems highly improbable. The mother&#8217;s complaint is consistent with her other complaint that the father had secured medical notes in respect of the children by wrongdoing in relation to another doctor. Again this seems improbable and seems to me a pattern emerges of the mother making allegations in respect of those who do not agree with her perspective. The </p>

The curator appears to have reported that the children made no complaints about the father although apparently may have said that they wanted to live with the mother. The court did not act on their wishes. The mother complained that the curator did not do their job properly. What seems to emerge from all of the various strands of the mother&#8217;s evidence and the father&#8217;s is that these children have come to the attention of various agencies with a welfare interest down the years but none of them appear to have upheld the mother&#8217;s complaints. However the mother has not been deterred and has continued to make complaints all presumably in pursuance of her desire to resume the care of the children. As Ms Demery observed this has led to chronic parental conflict although it would seem that the primary source of the conflict has been the mother&#8217;s unremitting refusal to accept the Polish court orders or the father&#8217;s ability to care for the children or the children&#8217;s appreciation of their father&#8217;s care. </p>

This appears to be in stark contrast to the relationship that the father allowed the children to have with the mother when they were living with him.

Given the reports on the father&#8217;s capacity as a parent and the children&#8217;s relationship with him dating back to 2013 together with the involvement of various agencies dealing with the mother&#8217;s complaints and the lack of substantiation of those it seems unlikely that there was any real problem with the father&#8217;s care or any real problem with the children&#8217;s relationship with the father. It seems likely that the children were exposed to the mother&#8217;s unhappiness both with the situation generally and her view that the father was incapable of caring for them properly. Thus the most probable scenario for Q leaving is a combination of wishing to remain with V and the mother&#8217;s pressure. It is clear that Q has a greater ability to connect with his father now than V does. The father describes V being upset during the one telephone call they had and perhaps she is less able to cope with the inevitable tension that exists when she is with her mother who so plainly critical of the father&#8217;s capability as a father.

Prior to reporting she had read the papers in the case although had not seen translated copies of some of the exhibits to the parties&#8217; statements or I think the exhibits to the father&#8217;s second statement. She carried out police checks in respect of the mother and father and the mother&#8217;s partner. The checks came back negative in respect of the mother or father, and the response in respect of the mother&#8217;s partner was awaited. She also made contact with V&#8217;s school and saw Q and V on 17 January 2019. An interpreter was present but was only required for clarification at certain points.  They also wrote letters to me. Ms Demery also gave oral evidence in which she expanded upon or clarified aspects of her report.  She satisfied herself that both understood the purpose of the meeting. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">In her evidence Ms Demery said that she did not feel she had been able to ascertain the children&#8217;s authentic views. She thought they had been exposed to chronic parental conflict which made it difficult to get a sense of the children&#8217;s lives in Poland and any positives of life with their father. She thought their true wishes and feelings were obscured by the parents&#8217; conflict. It was difficult for them to understand the impact that the parental conflict had had upon them. She thought they were aware that their parents don&#8217;t get on and thus it is extremely difficult for them to enjoy relationships with both. Ms Demery thought that the fact that they were unable to have a relationship with the paternal grandparents now was symptomatic of this. She also was surprised at V&#8217;s inability to say anything positive about the father as the evidence suggests in the past she has been positive about him. The same is true of Q and given their ages one might expect a more nuanced approach. The &#8216;Impact of parental conflict&#8217; tool supported her own evaluation of parental influence emanating from the mother. </p>

With V she thought there was an appearance of being slightly rehearsed and guarded and she was concerned about the extent to which V had been able to express her true views. She noted that V&#8217;s views appeared to be aligned with the mother&#8217;s in terms of her complaints and in particular the difference between what V told her during interview about how positive she was about her school friendships was in direct contradiction of what she later said in her letter; which was written after she had returned to her mother. She also was concerned that what the school had observed in terms of V being allowed to express her own views. She noted that there were aspects of what V said that appeared to be her own views; for instance her recollection of the shock at moving from her mother&#8217;s to have father&#8217;s care.

Policy considerations (including swift return of abducted children, comity with other countries judicial processes, deterring abduction,) which in hot pursuit cases will be of great weight must be balanced against factors relating to any defence established and welfare considerations which might support either a return or a non-return.

The exception itself is brought into play when only two conditions are met: first, that the child herself objects to being returned and second, that she has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of her views. These days, and especially in the light of article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, courts increasingly consider it appropriate to take account of a child&#8217;s views. Taking account does not mean that those views are always determinative or even presumptively so. Once the discretion comes into play, the court may have to consider the nature and strength of the child&#8217;s objections, the extent to which they are &#8220;authentically her own&#8221; or the product of the influence of the abducting parent, the extent to which they coincide or are at odds with other considerations which are relevant to her welfare, as well as the general Convention considerations referred to earlier. The older the child, the greater the weight that her objections are likely to carry. But that is far from saying that the child&#8217;s objections should only prevail in the most exceptional circumstances. </span></p>

What may be best for him in the long run may be different from what will be best for him in the short run.

Whilst there are no doubt many components which have given rise to this the most significant aspect, particularly in recent years, would appear to be the mother&#8217;s inability to come to terms with the decision of the Polish courts in August 2014 which settled the children&#8217;s residence with their father. The judgment of the Polish court makes clear that at that point in time the children expressed clear views about how they experienced their mother and their father. Although it appears that both the mother and father were able to meet their physical needs, it seems from what can be gleaned from the Polish appellate court judgment that the view of the psychologist and the court was that the father was better able to meet the children&#8217;s emotional needs. At that time it was clearly the case that the children preferred the father as a parent finding him more stable calm and interested in their matters. Regrettably the mother&#8217;s response to that decision was to refuse to comply with that order thus exposing Q and V to further conflict including enforcement processes and sudden changes of care. That approach has plainly left its mark on V in particular and is an inverse repetition of the mother&#8217;s removal of the children from the father&#8217;s care that the Polish appellate court identified as harmful in their judgment. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">It appears that the mother&#8217;s dissatisfaction with the Polish appellate court&#8217;s order did not abate and she continued to find fault with the parenting that the father provided to Q and V. The mother&#8217;s own account combined with that of the father makes tolerably clear that the authorities in Poland were notified of the mother&#8217;s concerns. Enquiries appear to have been undertaken by V&#8217;s school, by the police, by medical services and by the court. None of the complaints seem to have been made out. The mother&#8217;s response to the involvement of those authorities is to reject the conclusions and to assert that those involved were either not competent or were pressured by the father into refusing to uphold the concerns. In respect of the children&#8217;s medical conditions and in particular V&#8217;s the evidence from the clinicians who have been involved does not provide a clear picture of her having been diagnosed with a heart problem. Both the mother and father seem to be agreed that when she was seen in the Polish hospital in April 2018 the clinicians did not consider she had a physiological problem but rather had been emotionally distressed. The letter produced by the father says both children are healthy and neither require specialist treatment. The letter produced by the mother dated 15 December 2018 appears to be a referral based largely on an account given by the mother, or possibly by V and says that the palpitations are not typical of TSV which is what the mother appears to suggest she suffers from. In respect of Q it seems from all of the evidence that the father had sought treatment for his sinus issues but had opted not to go down the surgical route which the mother preferred.  </p>

Although the mother says (see paragraph 20 of her statement) that they were not asked about contentious issues I find it hard to believe that these articulate and intelligent children speaking in their own language would not have felt able to express serious concerns had they held them at that point in time. I am conscious that they were of course living with their father then but they were having regular weekend contact with their mother and it seems clear that this was at a time when the mother was making complaints about the care given to the children by the father. In assessing the children&#8217;s own accounts of the care given by their father I take account of the views I have reached below in respect of the weight that can be given to their accounts and their views when I deal with child&#8217;s objections or a return pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction. </p>

I do not consider this to be a case where I need to take the allegations at their highest as the evidence, not least that of the mother herself, allows me to reach a summary conclusion on these matters. The totality of the evidence does not support the mother&#8217;s contention that the care given to the children by the father was seriously deficient so as to present a grave risk of harm to them were they to return to his care. The most serious of the mother&#8217;s complaints is that the father ignores V&#8217;s heart condition and that she might be at serious risk if left alone at home by the father. The medical evidence and the accounts of the parents simply does not support the level of risk that the mother contends for and in any event </p>

The decision of the Polish courts in 2013 which settled V&#8217;s residence with her father was a welfare based decision. She appears to have held positive views about her father at the time and to have settled into her father&#8217;s care notwithstanding what she herself says about it being a shock. Indeed it must have been.  The picture which emerges of her whilst in the care of her father is one where she was able to have relationships with her parents and extended family on both sides and where she was doing well at school. This does not suggest that the separation from her mother then or residing in the care of her father was harmful. Although she now expresses the clear view that she wishes to remain in her mother&#8217;s care and does not wish to return to her father&#8217;s care again I must take account of the weight which one can sensibly give to her expressed wishes given Ms Demery&#8217;s observations and the wider evidential picture.  The Polish court was engaged in these children&#8217;s lives in spring 2018 and apparently saw nothing which justified a change in care. I have not had the benefit of copies of documents from the Polish court or any social worker involved at the time but selfevidently the change in the care arrangements was as a result of the mother&#8217;s actions rather than court action. <span style="font-size:11.5pt">It is the mothers case that she cannot return to Poland and Q told Miss Demery that they had to move to the UK for financial reasons. Whilst the mother may now find it harder to return to Poland given her flat appears to have been subject to some process of seizure and sale in Poland and whilst she and her partner may find the economic prospects in England better I&#8217;m not satisfied that she cannot return. It is a choice she has made and continues to make. I am not at all clear as to why she and her partner moved to the UK and whether it was motivated by economic prospects or whether it was to get away from Poland and the system that she is so critical of and the possibility of the children being returned to the father again against her will.  </span>Having regard to the conclusion I have reached that V&#8217;s views must be discounted heavily to reflect the situation she is in and the exposure to chronic parental conflict the mother has not satisfied me that on the balance of probabilities the separation of V from her mother will expose her to a grave risk of physical or psychological harm arising from the separation itself or that such separation would be intolerable for V.  </p>

On balance I consider that Q will return with V to Poland if I make that order and thus the risk of separation will not arise. Their history, in particular in April 2018 and Q&#8217;s protective actions over recent months point to the likelihood on balance that he will return to Poland if V does so.   However even if he did not return, I have reached the conclusion that the separation of Q and V </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">would not create a grave risk of psychological harm to V or be otherwise intolerable for her. I have very much in mind what Ms Demery says at paragraph 38 and 48 of her report, Q and V&#8217;s desire to be together and indeed, both of the parents express the opinion that they should not be separated. The father&#8217;s position is somewhat more nuanced in that he invites the court to order V&#8217;s return even if it does not order Q&#8217;s return but that does not detract from his overarching view that they should if possible remain together. It is clear that the two are close and they must be a support for each other in the atmosphere of conflict that at times surrounds them and to which they have been exposed for so long. Separating them will undoubtedly have an effect on them, particularly having regard to their reduced resilience as identified by Ms Demery. However they have lived apart for periods of time in particular at the instigation of or as a result of the actions of the mother. They lived separately for several months in 2014-15 when the mother refused to comply with the Polish court order, and they were further separated when the mother removed V from the father&#8217;s care in April 2018. It is notable that Q chose to follow his sister at that point.  </p>

For the purposes of the 1980 Hague Convention I&#8217;m satisfied on a robust and straightforward assessment that V&#8217;s views amount to an objection within the ordinary meaning of that term, as explained by Lady Justice Black in Re M (above). Taking into account the positive views she has expressed in respect of her mother, the negative views she has expressed in relation to her father and her expressed desire to remain living in the UK with her mother, stepfather, little brother, and older brother satisfy me that these are more than a preference but are an objection to returning to the care of her father in Poland. Likewise Q&#8217;s expressed views constitute a clear wish to remain living in the UK in this family unit.  </p>

Thus the objection is not of a more fundamental or profound nature that might arise in cases of physical or emotional abuse. In terms of the strength of the objection it is not especially strong, but nor is it particularly weak. Neither V or Q express themselves in particularly strong terms, which evidences very strong feelings about remaining or returning. Ms Demery did not detect the indignance or strength of feeling that is frequently encountered in children and young people the subject of this sort of application. Q in particular expressed views that he was anxious about coming to the UK and he is clearly still wistful about aspects of life in Poland. I suspect that having lived all his life in Poland, having been school in Poland and having a group of friends in Poland as well as an extended family who he had relationships with in Poland that he feels rather more positive about Poland and rather less positive about the UK than he has actually said.  The same is likely to be true of V who also was doing well in school, had good friends and appears to have had good relationships with her extended family on both sides whilst in Poland. Q asks me to think twice before ordering a return and I will do so </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">But having regard to their expressed views, to what extent are those expressed views authentically their own or the product of influence of the abducting parent? Ms Demery is a very experienced Cafcass officer with considerable exposure to this sort of case. It was clear from her evidence that she had considerable reservations about her ability to determine what the children&#8217;s authentic views were. She was clear that they were overlaid or obscured by their exposure to chronic parental conflict. She identified particular features which pointed at influence from the mother or her household; whether direct or environmental. V&#8217;s apparently positive memories in relation to schoolfriends was converted into a complaint about bullying after she returned to her mother in the waiting room and wrote her letter. The history of the children in Poland however in any event makes abundantly clear that they have been caught up in a situation where their mother refuses to acknowledge or accept the Polish court&#8217;s decision that the children should live with their father. That decision was based in large measure on the children&#8217;s then apparently expressed preference for their father over their mother. The concerns expressed by the school about V being able to express herself freely in the presence of the mother&#8217;s partner are a further concern. The fact that the children were able to have a full relationship with their mother and their extended families in Poland but have had an attenuated almost nonexistent relationship with their paternal family since August or September 2018 suggest that they may feel obliged to align themselves with their mother when in her care but are more able to express themselves freely when in the father&#8217;s care. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">This latter point also bears upon the extent to which their views coincide or at odds with other considerations relevant to their welfare. These children were born and grew up in Poland being fully integrated into a family and school community there. Being re-integrated into that community, being able to re-establish their friendships, attend their schools, reengage with their extended families are all beneficial to their welfare and thus their views are at odds with a more objective appraisal of their welfare.  </p>

Thus one has to question the objectivity of their views. One also has to question the perspective of the children. Although Q&#8217;s ongoing relationship with his father and the nature of his description of that suggests something positive he describes it in negative terms. V is wholly rejecting of her father. Neither of those positions appear objectively justifiable or demonstrate any sense of perspective. The evidence of their views ascertained by the court and the psychologist in 2013 is inconsistent with their position now. Of course it may all have changed but the evidence does not suggest that is so. I conclude that their views are likely to be different when they are in Poland and away from the atmosphere of hostility to the father which they currently exist in. Thus there views will be ameliorated upon a return to some degree or another. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I agree with Ms Demery that what all of this indicates is two young people who have been exposed to conflict as their mother has kicked back against the Polish court&#8217;s decision, refusing to accept it in 2014 and since. The mother&#8217;s unhappiness with that decision and her resistance to its enforcement and her subsequent ongoing campaign to undermine the father&#8217;s care of the children and to persuade the Polish authorities that the children should live with her must have exposed the children quite extensively to that conflict. In 2013 the psychologist report identified the mother as being seen by the children as unpredictable, unstable and loud. Although it was only a small illustration I observed at times in the hearing that the mother was unable to contain herself either becoming distressed or agitatedly making points to her legal team. The evidence suggests that she would be unable to shield the children from her views and indeed the track record of the absence of contact with the father and the estrangement from the paternal family since April 2018 all support this. </p>

Going against their expressed wishes may also have some welfare consequences. However on the other side of the equation the children will be reinserted into an environment with which they are wholly familiar as I have identified above. Resuming familiar schools, reacquainting themselves with friends, re-engaging with their extended family not least their father and resuming life with a language and culture in which they have been raised. All of those have clear welfare advantages. </p>

I have concluded that it is in his best interest&#8217;s overall to return but that still begs the question of whether an order is appropriate or not given his age. I have thought more than twice about what the right outcome and order should be in respect of Q. I have considered whether given his age I should decline the application for the order for return but rather to operate on the belief that he will return with V in any event as I believe that he wishes to remain with her and a large part of him wishes to return to Poland anyway. If I leave the choice to him I feel reasonably sure that he will come under significant pressure from his mother and her partner to remain and I do not consider that to be in his best interest. I conclude that there may be some merit in Miss Papazian&#8217;s point that although he describes his contact with his father as being undertaken in order to comply with the court order that may in fact be a mask for an underlying and genuine desire to have a relationship with his father.

The summary welfare assessment comprises many elements and save in respect of his expressed views they point to his welfare being promoted by a return to Poland and the resumption of a full life there. I am fully alive to the unusual nature of making a return order in respect of a 17-year-old who says he does not wish to return. However I am particularly alive to the issue of the impact that the chronic parental conflict is having on the ability of Q and V to truly understand their own positions and to be able to express views which are not tainted by the backdrop to their lives that the conflict has given. I consider that making an order in respect of Q may in fact free him from responsibility which would otherwise be placed on him to seek to remain in England in support of the mother&#8217;s ongoing campaign to remedy what occurred in Poland in 2014 </p>
