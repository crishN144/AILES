As far as children are concerned, secure accommodation proceedings under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> are perhaps the closest parallel to proceedings in the Court of Protection concerning deprivation of liberty, certainly closer than wardship and private law proceedings. In secure accommodation proceedings, as indeed in care proceedings, the child is a party. What this might indicate, it seems to me, is that it is generally considered indispensable in this country for the person whose liberty is at stake automatically to be a party to the proceedings in which the issue is to be decided. The President's conclusion that it was unnecessary for this to be so in relation to an adult without capacity appears therefore to run counter to normal domestic practice. It might, therefore, be thought to require very firm foundations if it is to be regarded as acceptable</span>.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The rule imposes a duty on the court to actively consider P&#8217;s role in proceedings. In addition to being a party, one option is for P to retain non-party status but to have a representative whose functions are effectively to provide the court with information to allow the court to make a best interests decision.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It may be possible to say that P&#8217;s rights are sufficiently protected in a case involving deprivation of liberty by the appointment of a rule 3A representative. Maybe there is scope to argue that the mechanical act of having P&#8217;s name stated as a party in a case and being represented by a litigation friend is not that much different to having a representative whose work is directed and controlled by the court having P&#8217;s best interests in mind. In both cases, P has access to all papers in the case and takes the same role. Perhaps therefore, it could be said that being a party connotes being fully involved and actively represented in a case rather than the more traditional view of a party being someone who takes ownership of a case by having his name on the court documents and who is involved in his case as opposed to a non-party who is excluded from the case. I make these comments as an observation but express no opinion.</p>

So for example, what would be wrong with a long standing friend of P or P&#8217;s family, who is a person of integrity with the clear ability to properly represent P&#8217;s interests in being a representative? Or the family solicitor or accountant or a cleric who has known P for many years and is willing to carry out this task dispassionately?</p>

To address this, I have invited the Vice President to consider staying the cases presently listed such that hearings already listed may be vacated. It occurs to me that he may also wish to consider whether an automatic stay should be imposed on future cases that are issued.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have taken the course of referring these cases to the Vice President because it is vital that a decision is made on these issues as quickly as possible. None of the parties were equipped to fully argue the issues at the hearing as they would need to prepare: this is not a criticism as the issues were not identified until the hearing. There would therefore need to be another hearing and if so, it must make sense that this hearing produces a judgment from a senior judge which will set out the court&#8217;s view on these matters and direct the way forward. There will thus be a saving in time and costs which is consistent with the overriding objective in the court process.</p>
