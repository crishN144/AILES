		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;One highly important aspect of the Lucas direction, and indeed the approach to lies generally in the criminal jurisdiction, needs to be borne fully in mind by family judges.  It is this:  in the criminal jurisdiction, the &#8216;lie&#8217; is never taken, of itself, as direct proof of guilt.  As is plain from the passage quoted from Lord Lane&#8217;s judgment in Lucas, where the relevant conditions are satisfied, the lie is &#8216;capable of amounting to a corroboration&#8217;.  In recent times the point has been most clearly made in the Court of Appeal Criminal Division in the case of R v Middleton [2001] Crim.L.R.251, where it was said, &#8216;In my view there should be no distinction between the approach taken by the criminal court on the issues of lies, to that adopted in the family court.  Judges should therefore take care to ensure they do not rely upon a conclusion that an individual has lied on a material issue as direct proof of guilt&#8217;&#8221;. </p>

I also bear in mind there is no obligation on the party to prove the truth of  an alternative case put forward by way of defence and the failure of the party to establish the alternative case on the balance of probabilities does not, of itself, prove the other party&#8217;s case, Re X (Children) (No 3) [2013][?] EWHC 3651 Fam, and Re Y (No 3) [2016] EWHC 503 Fam. </p>

Yes, she started squeezing my throat, I slapped down the hand, for her to leave me, you know, to leave my throat because I was choking and then she, she stumbled and fell and there was an iron behind her.  Because she has had an operation before, so I rushed for her to stand up, she refused, she refused my help, she grabbed the iron and was going to hit me with it, so I held her hand with the iron in it, so she said she was going to call the police and I thought she was joking&#8221;. </p>
