The mother opposes X&#8217;s summary return to Lithuania on two bases: Firstly, that X is settled here under Art.12 of the Convention and, in the event that the court makes that finding, it should not exercise its discretion to order X&#8217;s return.  Secondly, if she is returned, there would be a grave risk of physical and/or psychological harm or X will be placed in an intolerable situation and, again, if the court makes that finding, it should exercise its discretion not to return X.  </span></p>

In any event, even if the court makes those findings, the court should exercise its discretion in the circumstances of this case to ensure that X is returned back to Lithuania.  </span></p>

It is, as article 13(b) makes clear, the return to the requesting state, rather than the enforced removal from the requested state, which must have this effect.  Thus the English courts have sought to avoid placing the child in an intolerable situation by extracting undertakings from the applicant as to the conditions in which the child will live when he returns and by relying on the courts of the requesting State to protect him once he is there.  In many cases this will be sufficient.  But once again, the fact that this will usually be sufficient to avoid the risk does not mean that it will invariably be so.  In Hague Convention cases within the European Union, article 11.4 of the Brussels II Revised Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003) expressly provides that a court cannot refuse to return a child on the basis of Article 13(b) &#8216;if it is established that adequate arrangements have been made to secure the protection of the child after his or her return&#8217;.  Thus it has to be shown that those arrangements will be effective to secure the protection of the child. With the best will in the world, this will not always be the case.</span></p>

The Convention does not require the court in this country to consider the welfare of the child as paramount, but only to be satisfied as to the grave risk of harm.  I am not satisfied that the child would be placed in an intolerable situation, if the mother refused to go back.  In weighing up the various factors, I must place in the balance and as of the greatest importance the effect of the court refusing the application under the Convention because of the refusal of the mother to return for her own reasons, not for the sake of the child.  Is a parent to create the psychological situation, and then rely upon it?  If the grave risk of psychological harm to a child is to be inflicted by the conduct of the parent who abducted him, then it would be relied upon by every mother of a young child who removed him out of the jurisdiction and refused to return.  It would drive a coach and four through the Convention...&#8221;</span></p>

However, it is not a principle articulated in the Convention or the Act and should not be applied to the effective exclusion of the very defence itself, which is in terms directed to the question of risk of harm to the child and not the wrongful conduct of the abducting parent.

This must be consistent with the status of Art 13(b) as a narrow welfare exception to the general obligation under Art 12, which narrow exception is designed to legislate for those very limited number of cases where an order for return would result in a grave risk of physical or psychological harm or would otherwise place the child in a situation that is intolerable to that child.  To take the present case as an example, were the court to conclude that a return to Holland would expose S to a grave risk of physical or psychological harm or would otherwise place S in an intolerable situation by reason of his being separated from his mother and placed in care in Holland, from&#160;S's&#160;perspective whether that separation, and all that flows from it, is due to the mother's contumelious attempt to frustrate the Convention process or an involuntary inability to travel or something between those two extremes is neither here nor there for S.

Within this context, it is important again to bear in mind that Art 13(b) looks to the situation as it would be if the child were returned forthwith to his or her home country and that the situation which the child will face on return depends crucially on the protective measures which can be put in place to ensure that the child will not be called upon to face an intolerable situation when he or she gets home.  The significance for the situation the child will face upon return of a parent's refusal to return must in each case be evaluated in the context of the protective measures that can be put in place to mitigate the impact of the same.&#8221;</span></p>

However, what the court must remain focused on is the defence and decide whether or not it is established on the basis of the circumstances that will await the child upon return.  If it appears to the court that the child will return without the parent that has removed them, it is against that background that the application and the defence must be considered.  Whether or not that situation will give rise to a grave risk of harm or intolerability, as set out under Art.13 (b), must be evaluated in the context of the protective measures that can be put in place to mitigate the impact upon the child of a situation that they will face upon return.  </span></p>

Whilst the court of course recognises that within these cases there will inevitably be emotional unsettlement on any return, on the information the court has such a return in this particular case will, in my judgment, be deeply damaging to X&#8217;s welfare.  It will undermine all the progress that she has made in relation to the settlement, the security and the stability that she has here.  Even if she returned, whilst her father will be in the same jurisdiction, it is right that there is no guarantee of a positive relationship between him and X being restored and every other aspect of X&#8217;s life will have been turned completely upside down.  </span></p>

Whilst I accept such support in principle may be available in Lithuania, it would have to take place in circumstances that X is very likely to find anxiety-inducing and she is unlikely to be very receptive to receiving such therapy and that is what has caused her such psychological difficulties previously.  </span></p>
