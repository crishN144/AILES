	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The nature of this litigation declares itself in the information appearing on the cover page of this judgment.  In the first place, these are proceedings under the Children Act for the benefit of N, a child.  Secondly, the case number reveals that the proceedings have been on foot since 2003.  Thirdly, the main part of the hearing took place on the day of N&#8217;s 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday, the parents having spent the morning preparing and the afternoon in court.  They had been offered a hearing two days later, but for their own reasons they both preferred a hearing on that day.    </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">N is not represented in these proceedings.  When he was 18 months old his mother applied for financial support for him, and when he was 3 years old the court made an order that his father should put up funds towards the purchase of a home for him and his mother.  He is now 10, and that purchase has not yet happened.  In the meantime, the parents have been locked in continuous conflict about this and other matters.  The abuse of litigation in this case is a scandal.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In applying the law to the applications now before the court, I remind myself that primary and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect to in a way which is compatible with Convention rights.  Like previous courts, I have heard a great deal about the rights of the parents, but in the father's case little or nothing about the rights of N.  These include N&#8217;s rights to a fair hearing and to respect for his family life.  So far he has lived with his mother and grandparents, and with his mother in rented accommodation, when it has long ago been his entitlement to live in a settled address.  Likewise, he is being brought up by parents who have lived in a state of perpetual litigation (including welfare litigation leading in 2009 to a 4 year restriction on applications under s.91(14)).  I consider that the impermanence of his home and the perpetual litigation offend N&#8217;s rights, and that in exercising such powers as it properly possesses the court is under an obligation to act in a manner that brings both anomalies to an immediate end.  To the extent this impacts upon any rights of the parents, it is overwhelmingly justified to protect the rights of this child, whose minority is elapsing all the while.</p>

There is a residence order in favour of the mother and the father has substantial contact.  On 17 October 2003 an order was made requiring the father (who did not attend the hearing)    to settle &#163;220,000 for the purchase of a property to be held on trust for N until the age of 21 or the end of his tertiary education.  The sum of &#163;20,000 was to be paid to the mother for the cost of moving.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The achievement of this simple project has been confounded by a combination of circumstances.  The father made applications in relation to the wording and implementation of the order, and substantial time was lost as a result of protracted residence proceedings.  The matter came before Munby J in May 2006, April 2007, July 2007, November 2007 and July 2008, leading to a judgment that was publicly handed down on 6 January 2009.  This made detailed provision for the implementation of the 2005 order.  An injunction was granted, prohibiting the father from dealing with a particular property, except by letting it on shorthold tenancy, and a charging order made over that property to secure the sum of &#163;20,000.  The father appealed what was described as "a tiny part" of the judgment (see the observation of Thorpe LJ on 18 March 2009).  In November 2009 Wilson LJ refused the father permission to appeal in relation to the residence arrangements.</p>

In particular, he focused on the difficulties in settling the trust deed.  In January 2009, Munby J had expected that to be done within a month, but it was not until 7 February 2011 that the deed was, with Judge Horowitz&#8217;s assistance, settled in its entirety.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In the meantime, in January 2011 the mother had identified an apparently suitable property, which I will describe as  No. 38.  It is a modest three-bedroom property.  A favourable professional survey of 20 January 2011 describes it as being in an excellent condition, apart from some insignificant items requiring attention).  <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;It should prove to be a worthwhile investment and a comfortable and pleasant residence.&#8221;</span>  The mother is in a position to raise funds to supplement the father's contribution.

He raised a variety of objections to producing the funds within the mother's timescale.  The deed had not been executed.  A bank account had not been opened.  The deed could not be executed until the funds had been received.  The property had not been approved by his trustee (Dr Pelling).  Conditions should be attached to Mr Holden&#8217;s actions.</p>

This question precipitated agitation in the father, who gave no answer.  The judge records <span style="font-style:italic">"He assured me the money would be available in six weeks without allowing any further particulars.  Neither he nor Dr Pelling on his behalf were prepared to take urgent steps to keep the purchase.&#8221;</span>  The judge invited a response to the suggestion that the father should pay &#163;220,000 within six weeks.  The father's response was that the court could not make such an order or that it would be wrong to do so.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">As at 11 February 2011, it is plain that the mother was anxious to progress this purchase but that the father and Dr Pelling were not.  I note that on 3 February, Dr Pelling wrote to the vendors&#8217; estate agent (who was asking for comfort for that the transaction was going ahead) that <span style="font-style:italic">"it looks as if an almighty legal battle is imminent and the matter and various aspects including the purchase which is your immediate concern may well end up in the Court of Appeal."</span>  On the following day, Dr Pelling wrote to the agent marketing the property which the vendors hoped to buy: <span style="font-style:italic">"there is a nightmare situation going on over the purchase of [No. 38]."</span>  He sent this message despite the first agent&#8217;s request that he should not do so. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">At the hearing in February, Judge Horowitz asked the father whether he had been to see the property, but he would not say.  During the hearing before me, Dr Pelling revealed that he and the father had visited the property on 3 February, something that neither of them had previously disclosed.  Dr Pelling was able to say that it is in principle a suitable property, but he determinedly reserved the father's rights to insist upon the potentially protracted procedures provided by Clause 2 of the deed.  These provide that, if there were no other cause for delay, the father would have until 7 May 2011 to offer his observations on the property to the trustees.  At that point it would be a matter for the trustees, who might disagree.  The fact that this is a property for a child, and that its fragile availability has been known about since mid-January, evokes no softening of approach.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The correspondence between Dr Pelling (as trustee) and Mr Swycher (as mother&#8217;s trustee) appears at pages C55-64 of the father&#8217;s bundle.  On 21 February Dr Pelling sent a copy of the settlement deed and asked for confirmation that the Lloyds bank forms had been sent to the bank.  On 24 February he sent a robust chasing message, making a variety of critical and legal comments.  These included the statement that the function of the family court was now at an end, and a request for information about the mother's funds.  On 1 March, Mr Swycher confirmed that he had provided the information to the bank and asked for a copy of the trust deed.  He also asked for confirmation that the father's funds would be available and asked for the father's contact details.  On 6 March, Mr Swycher returned the signed bank form and asked for a reply to his earlier message.  There followed an exchange about the identity of the account holder.  On 10 March, Dr Pelling also asked for the information previously requested.  He said that on the father's part <span style="font-style:italic">"he is of course fully aware of the order of the court of 11 February 2011, sealed 1 March 2011</span>&#8221;.  In relation to the purchase of a trust property, in particular No. 38, he reminded Mr Swycher of the procedure laid down by Clause 2 of the trust deed.  He asked Mr Swycher to arrange for the mother and himself to sign and return the trust deed.  Also on 10 March, Dr Pelling was telephoned by the vendor of No. 38, to whom he explained that the trust was in process of being funded, which ought to be in March but possibly April at latest.  On 10 March, Mr Swycher sent a message which crossed, chasing his previous e-mail.  On 12 March Dr Pelling instructed Mr Bance to carry out the necessary steps to enable the trust account to be opened.  On 14/15 March, they again communicated about setting up this account.  On 17 and 18 March, Mr Swycher sent further chasing messages to Dr Pelling.  On 18 March, Dr Pelling wrote expressing concern that he had not received replies to his e-mails.  He referred to <span style="font-style:italic">"the 21st [as] rapidly approaching".  </span>He asked for confirmation that the mother would have the funds deposited in the bank account on or before 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March.  He asked for her contact details so that he could confirm this for himself.  So far as the father's contribution was concerned, he repeated that the father was aware of the terms of the order of 11 February.  <span style="font-style:italic">"He also made his position on the funds quite clear in the court on 11 February 2011 but I cannot repeat that here due to the contempt of court law in relation to proceedings under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> held in chambers.  I can however assure you that [the father] is a man of his word.&#8221;</span>  He referred to the fact that the bank account was not yet open and the deed of settlement is not yet signed.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The father&#8217;s apparent position was therefore that he was complying with the 21 March deadline.  He certainly made no argument of the kind addressed to me, which is that the order was not valid and did not have to be obeyed.  On the contrary, Dr Pelling's correspondence carried the clear indication that the father was working to 21 March as a payment date; Dr Pelling was unable to explain how it could have been interpreted in any other way.  </p>

I appreciate that Mr Swycher is a volunteer but his approach lacked the uncompromising precision that the situation demanded.  Although Dr Pelling was acting as Settlor&#8217;s Trustee a number of his actions and statements would have been questionable had be been acting as advocate.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The matter first came before me in the applications court on the afternoon of Friday 18 March.  The mother applied made a without notice application for a writ ne exeat regno preventing the father from leaving the jurisdiction until payment of the sum of &#163;220,000.  In her statement, she complained that the father and Dr Pelling were frustrating the execution of the trust and the opening of the bank account.  She said that she would lose her sale of the property and her mortgage.  She exhibited "the e-mails&#8221; between her trustee Dr Swycher and Dr Pelling.  She said that N had told her that the father was travelling to Hong Kong and China at the weekend and would not be available for contact in the following week.</p>

In the course of a short judgment, I recorded that no steps had been taken by the father or Dr Pelling to demonstrate that the father was in the process of producing funds.

He blames the mother and her trustee for the failure to carry out the administrative tasks of signing the trust deed and opening the trust account.  He says that there is no reliable evidence that she will lose her purchase or her mortgage.  He says that in the light of paragraph 1(2)(c) of the order of Munby J, which provided that the father's obligation to pay over the sum of &#163;220,000 did not arise before the execution of the deed, Judge Horowitz had no power to set the date of 21 March for payment by the father.  At the same time, he states that the six weeks required by the father runs from 1 March.  He is assured by the father that the funds will be credited to the trustees&#8217; bank account on or before 12 April 2011.  Neither the mother nor the court has any right to investigate the father's financial position.  Dr Pelling describes himself as a trustee and says that the trust is now constituted albeit not fully executed.  Any future proceedings should be brought in the Chancery Division.  </p>

Having considered the presentation of the father and Dr Pelling, I am clear that they are at present determined to obstruct any way of proceeding other than their own way.  In particular, if the father's trip to China is prevented, they will turn their attention to efforts to appeal.  As against that, I have their assurance that the sums will be provided by 12 April, which is now within three weeks.  I consider that any chance of N&#8217;s funds being forthcoming from the father by then is likely to disappear if he is crossed by the continued retention of his passport.  I understand Mr Holden's submission that the father's absence abroad would seem to add a further practical barrier to his compliance with the order, but I believe that the father is even less likely to comply with his obligations if required to remain in England.  I also agree, with regret, that although the matter remains urgent, this purchase cannot go through within the next few days without the cooperation of the father and Dr Pelling.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-weight:bold">Is Dr Pelling's position tenable?</span>  I prefer to defer a final answer to this question, but there are certain observations I wish to make at this stage.  I consider that there are obvious difficulties in his performing the dual role of advocate and trustee.  These would exist if he was performing both roles in a moderate and constructive way, and at present he is doing neither.  He appears to be in the undignified position of a man wearing two hats, neither of them becoming.  I would instance: the undisclosed visit to the property, the e-mails to the estate agents, the arrogation of the right to substitute his own date (12 April) for the Court&#8217;s (21 March), the application for the hearing to be held in public regardless of N&#8217;s interests, the undisclosed argument about the validity of the February order, and the refusal to consider giving immediate approval to a perfectly suitable property.  One of the most significant duties of the trustees is to secure a home for N expeditiously and to avoid conflicts of interest.  To date, the sole lodestar of Dr Pelling&#8217;s actions has been the interests of the father.  If an irreconcilable conflict of interest has not already arisen, it will certainly arise if there is not the immediate and significant progress that I expect, and in particular if there is continued default in payment or a dispute about the suitability of the property.  At that point, Dr Pelling's role as a trustee would come into question and I forewarn the father that I will also review the rights of audience that I have extended at this hearing.  I have allowed Dr Pelling to represent the father for no other reason than that he is already established within the proceedings.  Had the application been made anew, I would have considered it in the light of the Practice Guidance issued on 12 July 2010.  I will review the situation at the outset of each subsequent hearing.  This case is about N and his parents and I will not allow it to be about Dr Pelling or anyone else.</p>
