	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The CAMHS Consultant said AZ lacked competence and explained that she was very idealistic and unrealistic.  Her views involved &#8216;na&#239;ve magical thinking&#8217; in her approach to the pregnancy. She lacked the intellectual development and capacity to process the complexity of the decisions that had to be made and her emotional investment in one outcome was clearly clouding her judgment.  An important factor in AZ&#8217;s decision-making was that the birth of a child would ensure she would not have to return to school.</p>

I accepted that she had stopped self-harming when her mother told her that the loss of blood would harm the child but noted that AZ had told one of the doctors that she will start self-harming again if the termination takes place.
