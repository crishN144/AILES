She was born in England to a white English mother (M) while her Egyptian father (F) had remained in Egypt where her parents met. The case arose as a result of concerns about the possibility of X suffering female genital mutilation (FGM) should she be taken to Egypt. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The exact circumstances in which this concern was raised with the local authority are a matter of dispute, to which I shall return later, but it was as a result of a conversation which took place during a home visit by the Health Visitor shortly after X came home with her mother from her birth in hospital and when the issue of FGM was raised by M. The local authority issued these proceedings after a referral by the Health Visitor to safeguard X and to prevent any likelihood of mutilation by seeking orders preventing her mother or anyone else from taking X to Egypt. The local authority (the applicant bringing this case) are supported by the child&#8217;s guardian and apply for the Female Genital Mutilation Protection Orders (FGMPO) pursuant to Schedule 2 of the Female Genital Mutilation Act (FGMA) 2003 which are currently in force to remain in place until X reaches her sixteenth birthday. This is opposed by both M and F.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">F was born to Egyptian parents in Egypt on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 1986; he is thirty-one at the time of writing this judgment. The court has limited evidence before it regarding the details of his upbringing and family. He is clearly a well-educated man who speaks good English. He had the assistance of an interpreter throughout the trial, which he attended by way of video link from Egypt. He works in the tourist industry and lives several hours&#8217; travel away from his parents and his family home. He has siblings including two sisters, one of whom is married with a daughter; neither gave evidence in these proceedings but both his parents gave evidence, also by video link from Egypt. There was some evidence before the court emanating from M, that F&#8217;s mother (who I shall refer to as PGM) was not happy with her son&#8217;s marriage to M, but that she had come to accept it on meeting M. The PGM had been subjected to FGM as a child. It is F&#8217;s case that FGM is not carried out in his family and that neither of his sisters were mutilated as children. It is not known whether his sister&#8217;s child has been subjected to FGM.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">M was born in England to white English parents on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 1991; she is twenty-six at the time this judgment was written. Like many young people she has tried out different lifestyles and in her early twenties converted to Islam. M met F during a trip to Egypt in January 2013. She remained in Egypt for a few months before coming back to England. M went back to Egypt in January 2014 by which time she had converted to Islam. As with F there is limited evidence before the court in respect of her background and her family; but for the purpose of this judgment the maternal family background is less pertinent as the risk for X of FGM emanates from the paternal family. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There have never been any concerns about M&#8217;s ability to look after X well. M and X have been visited at home regularly by social workers and nothing has ever indicated other than that X is thriving in her mother&#8217;s care. At the outset of this case M had said that she wanted to travel to Egypt with X to stay for some time and that then she and F intended to move to Malta and live as a family there for a few years. M&#8217;s position now is that she intends to remain living in England with X but that she wants to visit Egypt with X on holiday for a period of no more than a few weeks. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">M and F met in Egypt in January 2013 when she was working in a hotel; F was working in another hotel and they met through mutual friends. Neither M nor F have given much by way of detail about their relationship, marriage or the time that they spent together in Egypt. The court is not aware of the kind of marriage contracted in May 2014 and whether M was required to convert to Islam to marry F. From what she told the police officer who went to see her on Monday 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2016 it would seem that M is unsure herself about whether the marriage was legal or not. The police officer records, in his (unchallenged) statement, that they had attended a government building to get married and then had a party. The court is aware that Egyptian men can and do enter into more than one marriage at the same time. It would seem that that M and F met in H where F works in the tourist industry, which is some distance from his family home. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At some point during their relationship, probably early on in 2013, F and M had a conversation about FGM which arose regarding her own physical appearance when F told M that he had believed she had undergone FGM. In his statement to the court F said that he had never assumed that M had undergone FGM. In her oral evidence M said that it concerned her that F had denied it and repeated that he had said to her that he thought she had; told the court <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;he is wrong to say he had never assumed [I had] FGM.&#8221;</span> Later in 2015 they had discussed FGM regarding children which was when F had said that FGM should be legalised and undertaken in hospitals in a safe environment. He said that his sisters had undergone FGM. They did not discuss why he believed this to be the case (in respect of his sisters) at the time but, during this case, the paternal family sought to deny that F&#8217;s sisters were subjected to FGM, flatly contradicting what F and told M. M said in her oral evidence that a few days prior to the Health Visitor&#8217;s home visit she and F had discussed FGM but she denied that F had said that his family were expecting X to undergo FGM (as the Health Visitor had said in her evidence). M said that her alarm had been caused by learning of the prevalence of FGM in Egypt and that she had found out more about it after speaking to her hairdresser who had been mutilated herself. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is clear from the evidence that M does not have a close relationship with the paternal family and, from her own oral evidence, that she is worried about being able to trust the paternal grandfather (PGF) in particular. The evidence of M and F and the paternal grandparents about the time M spent with them, which would have provided them with the opportunity to get to know each other, was conflicting, contradictory and confusing. M said that they spent several days together when they married, both before and after the wedding; the PGM said that they left straight after the wedding and did not stay long. In her oral evidence M said that she was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;very surprised&#8221;</span> that the paternal grandparents said that they had only met her twice; it was her evidence that they had met on four or, in the case of the PGF, five occasions. M told the court that their evidence about this had raised concerns for her as she was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;worried they were saying [what they thought] the court wanted to hear&#8230;&#8221;</span> and that this was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;why I was concerned as [they] may say other things&#8230;yes, it makes me worried about how much I can trust them.&#8221;</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The length of time M spent with the paternal family and whether they came to visit the couple where they were living in Egypt or not is not the primary issue here, as the court is concerned with X&#8217;s safety should she be taken there now or in the future. It is an undisputed fact that M cannot speak Egyptian Arabic and that neither of the paternal grandparents can speak English. M has accepted in her oral evidence that it would be difficult for her to protect X if the family were discussing FGM being carried out on her as she would not know what was being said; added to that is the PGF professed belief (which he told the court in his oral evidence) that it is neither necessary or desirable to tell women within the family the decisions that have been taken. He demonstrated this by taking his daughters to be medically examined without reference to the PGM who did not know that this had happened. This deceit clearly shook M who said as much in her oral evidence.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When X was conceived the parents were living in A in Egypt. M travelled back to the UK in January 2016; she found out that she was pregnant once back in England and had the baby here.  M has said that F was not able to accompany her because of his immigration status, although it is not clear what application was made, if any, for a visa to allow him to be with his wife when she gave birth.  M also told the police officer that F coming over to England was not possible because of &#8220;finances&#8221;. X was born on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> August 2016 in hospital in the South of England. M had intended to travel back to Egypt with the baby shortly after her birth but once the baby was home, during a follow up visit on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2016 by the Health Visitor (KA) concerns about FGM were raised by M. As referred to above, M later disputed what she was reported to have said about the paternal family expecting X to undergo FGM to the professionals who visited her at the time; these professionals were the Health Visitor, the social worker, Ms Oni, from whom I heard and whose evidence was challenged and the police officer, Mr Conder, whose evidence was not challenged.</p>

The section imposes a duty on professionals, including heath and care workers, teachers and social workers, to report to the police if, during the course of their work, they discover that an offence of FGM appears to have been carried out.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">According to the Health Visitor (KA), who referred the matter to the local authority, M had brought up the subject of FGM and said that X's father's family in Egypt are expecting X to undergo FGM during her stay in Egypt. M said that she told F that FGM was illegal in the UK and of the implications for her should it be carried out as he was unaware that it was illegal in the UK and had said that all the females in his family had undergone FGM. According to her evidence, F had not responded to M&#8217;s worries straight away but later did so had said that, X did not have to undergo FGM, then. The court understood for M&#8217;s evidence F and M were in regular electronic communication which took various forms and was not limited to speaking to each other by phone. M told KA that she and X were planning to go to Egypt and the flight tickets have been booked for 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2016. Following the referral X and her mother were visited at home on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2016 by a specialist FGM social worker Mary Oni and DC Adam Condor from the Child Abuse Investigation Team (CAIT). M confirmed that she had booked one way tickets for herself and X to travel to Egypt on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2016 and that she had planned to remain in the country for six months. According to Ms Oni M said that she was unsure of the position of the extended paternal family regarding X being subjected to FGM. M told them that F felt that FGM should be legalized and carried out in hospitals but has said that X would not be subjected to FGM if she travelled to Egypt. Ms Oni&#8217;s evidence was that M told her and the police officer that F had said to her that X would not be subjected to FGM if she travels to Egypt because of their understanding that M may be imprisoned in the UK as a result. </p>

M had said that F had gone against his own family to marry her and that the PGM had not spoken to him for five months because of what he&#8217;d done. M was confident that she could protect X and said she would never leave her alone within the family; if necessary she would telephone the Embassy and the police and lock herself in a room with X. She said that had considered telling the family that FGM had already taken place. The police officer&#8217;s statement records M as becoming visibly upset at the possibility of X not having contact with F and the family in Egypt. He said, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I asked [M] if she would find it easier telling [F] that it is the professionals have stopped her coming and she said &#8216;Yes&#8217;&#8221;.</span> The officer&#8217;s statement concluded both he and Ms Oni had concerns for X&#8217;s safety in Egypt and that she would be at a significant risk of being subjected to FGM even though her mother was against it; this assessment was based on the facts that FGM was &#8220;severely prevalent&#8221; and that F and his family were supportive of the procedure and believe that it should be legalised.

The FCO at Post might be able to take hold of M and X's passports when they arrive in Egypt and return these to them on the day they are due to fly back, which would be advisable if there is a risk that F or the paternal family may take the child's passport.</p>

Ms Abulkomsan prepared two reports for the court but did not give evidence at the hearing. Her report set out that the general prevalence of FGM carried out on infants and girls in Egypt was 92%. Most mutilation (over 75%) takes place when the girls are between 9 and 12 years old, presumably around puberty. About 14% of the mutilation takes place under the age of 7 years. English [sic] court orders are not enforceable in Egypt as English law is not applicable in Egypt; it follows that there is no procedure under which English court orders can be recognised in Egypt; there is no equivalent of a FGMPO in Egyptian law; I shall return to this later in the judgment.</p>

To that end the court ordered a copy of her passport to be made available to her for identification when she made applications for work or to enrol on any courses. </p>

F and his parents gave evidence from Egypt by poor and barely adequate video links. Despite the shortcomings inherent in hearing evidence in this way, including the limitations on observing a witness through such a poor link, I was able to gain a sufficiently clear impression of their evidence and specifically their approach to FGM  to be able to assess it and was left unassured by what they had to say. They were largely dismissive of FGM being a problem in Egyptian society as a whole and in their family in particular. The PGF was particularly off-hand in his evidence, brushing aside any questions about the effects of FGM and denied that FGM continued to be a problem in Egypt in the face of the conclusion of the research collated by UNICEF and other NGOs, in conjunction with Egyptian governmental departments, which is that the practice is still prevalent in Egypt and that over 90% of the female population has undergone FGM. Moreover it was the evidence of the expert witness Nehad Abulkomsan, which remained unchallenged, that although there has been some decline in FGM over the past few years there still remains a very high prevalence of its practice. </p>

As his wife (the PGM) had herself been subject to FGM this must have been a deliberate lie for he did not subsequently claim that he did not know that his wife had been mutilated. Both F and his father said that men did not discuss FGM and that it had not been discussed in their family and that FGM was a matter for women. They both insisted in their oral evidence that FGM was not practised in their family. As the unchallenged expert evidence before this court is that FGM is still practised widely, it would follow that the paternal family have taken an unusual and unorthodox stance within their community; yet there is no evidence before the court that this is the case; this is a contradiction inherent at the heart of their evidence, which fatally undermines what they say. It is clear that there has been no discussion of this decision within the family, so much so that it is not known (and there is no evidence before this court) whether another granddaughter, their own daughter&#8217;s child (and X&#8217;s cousin) has undergone or is to undergo mutilation. </p>

The document submitted is an unnotarized letter consisting of one sentence <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;We confirm that the following medical tests on the following people [there follows two names] under the supervision of Dr A, attending doctor in the family clinic of S medical centre, we confirm that there was no female genital mutilation performed on the above-named person [sic] as proven by the medical test.&#8221;</span> The letter is apparently undated.

In the light of what F told M of his belief that his sisters and all females in the family had been subjected to FGM and its prevalence in Egyptian society it remains more likely than not, on the evidence before the court, and the absence of any reliable independent evidence to the contrary, that F&#8217;s sisters have undergone FGM.</p>

In the face of that monolithic response it was not possible, for example, to assess their views on FGM, or to elicit from either or both of them whether the risk of mutilation to X was low at present because she was still very young and that it is likely it would become more unacceptable to their wider family or  within their community and social milieu as she neared puberty for her to remain untouched. The question of pressure to conform and to carry out FGM to avoid social stigmatization was not touched upon, nor did F or the PGF explain the reasons why their family, alone among the vast majority of the population have rejected this practice.</p>

While it is true that the paternal family took the trouble to travelled to attend the meeting it is a fact that it was not through any effort of theirs that the meeting was arranged. Those professionals who took part produced a very short (less than two sides of paper) report which did not amount to evidence that the family&#8217;s claim of unorthodox stance against FGM was credible, as what they said was not challenged or investigated in any way. The document was of very limited value to the court and I cannot and do not place any reliance on it other than as evidence of the paternal family&#8217;s apparent willingness to engage with professionals in Egypt; provided it is arranged for them.</p>

His reason for why FGM had taken place and been part of the cultural norm within the patriarchal society which he came from, was as he told the court, that FGM was considered necessary to restrain the sexual appetites of women within in Egyptian society and to curtail any likelihood of promiscuity on their part. He made mention of prostitution. This is consistent with what he had previously told M, when he had said that FGM should be legalised and performed in hospitals. I accept M&#8217;s evidence and find that he is what he had said to her. Not only is that a conspicuous contradiction of any claim that he and his family are against the practice of FGM, it is in keeping with what is evidently his intrinsic belief that FGM is necessary to exert some social control over women&#8217;s sexuality. </p>

There was nothing in his evidence to suggest that he, or his father found the practice offensive or repugnant which, as I have said, is evinced in the explanation for FGM he gave the court namely that it curtailed the sexual desire of women and reduced the likelihood of their promiscuity. Moreover, despite being pressed, repeatedly, for to give some example or some explanation of his understanding of the psychological and other effects of FGM he was singularly unable to give any examples of what the deleterious effects of FGM on a woman would be and was equally unable to demonstrate any insight or empathy for the victims of FGM.</p>

F has not been consistent in his evidence and has lied to the local authority. He admitted in his oral evidence that he had been under the impression that M had had FGM herself but categorically denied it in his statement and in speaking to Ms Oni. I am left with no alternative but to find that F&#8217;s evidence was changed to suit his story and to what he felt best served his case. I do not share M&#8217;s belief that F would not allow any harm to come to X as it is more likely that he would do as he has done throughout, which is to do what best suits his own wishes. Thus, given his belief that there are good reasons for FGM, should he feel under pressure when X gets older for her to follow in the prevailing cultural practice as his daughter and be subjected to FGM there is nothing in his evidence to reassure the court that he would put her interests before what he perceives to be his own. I was left in little doubt that F really sees little wrong with FGM at all.</p>

It is inconceivable, and I do not accept, that this man comes from a family that has taken a decision to eradicate the practice of FGM. No explanation has been given as to how this decision was reached without any discussion; indeed, the evidence is that F thought that it was continuing as he believed his sisters had been subjected to mutilation themselves. </p>

At the end of her oral evidence she told me that she had not been reassured by the evidence of the paternal grandparents; particularly that of the PGF. M pointed to two areas of his evidence that were most concerning to her, when cross-examined by counsel for F. They were the PGF&#8217;s denial of the prevalence of FGM in Egypt and him taking his daughters to the doctor <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;behind his wife&#8217;s back.&#8221;</span> There were significant incidences where M&#8217;s evidence differed from F&#8217;s, some of which I have set out above, and included her evidence about the delay in his response to her initial query about X being subjected to FGM. M was concerned, she said, when he did not respond straight away, it was the next day before he said, &#8220;we will not do it then.&#8221; In his statement, the implication is that he answered saying no-one is talking about such a matter. There is a qualitative and crucial difference in the word used by F in each account; M&#8217;s recollection of his words implies that FGM was being or, at least, would have been considered; F&#8217;s that there was no consideration of FGM being practiced at all. I prefer M&#8217;s evidence, as it is consistent with what she had said in her written and oral evidence and with F&#8217;s worryingly insouciant attitude towards FGM generally.</p>

It is one of the highest rates of the practice of FGM of any country in the world. The highest risk to girls in Egypt is between the age of 9 and 12 years. The expert told the court that F could prevent X from leaving Egypt, and, although X&#8217;s parents could enter into a formal notarized agreement to allow M to leave, there is no mechanism for enforcing such an agreement. F can unilaterally renege on the agreement without sanction. Any undertaking given by F would be similarly unenforceable. There is no recognition of the orders of this court nor is the any mechanism for the enforcement of any judgment or order of this court. X and M would in fact be subject to the will of F as the child&#8217;s father, as any undertaking given by him is based on his good-will alone and is unenforceable, it offers little or nothing by way of reassurance, when viewed objectively. </p>

To support his case, he said that his sisters have visited a doctor and there is medical proof that they have not been the victims of FGM. As observed above, this is simply not the case. The &#8220;evidence&#8221; consists of no more than a letter and does not set out any detail of the examination or what was seen; it is not notarised and cannot and does not form reliable independent evidence that no FGM has taken place. Moreover, the daughter of one of F&#8217;s sisters, X&#8217;s cousin and contemporary, was not examined so there is no evidence about whether or not she has been subjected to FGM before the court. There is no explanation as to why there is no evidence about this child before me; it would have provided some assurance that children of X&#8217;s generation were not being mutilated. The explanation given by M is that this child is seen as a child of her father&#8217;s family, that he knows nothing about this case and would not have permitted her examination is a likely explanation in what is indubitably a patriarchal society and, while I accept what M says, it provides little by way of support to either F&#8217;s case or her own.</p>

The evidence before the court is that M had told the social worker that it would be inappropriate for a male family member to discuss FGM and that it was not a matter that men dealt with, but it was the PGF who then took his daughters to be examined without the knowledge, and behind the back of, their own mother. In addition, there was the deliberate decision to keep the medical examination secret by the PGF and F since, as he said, that it might cause an issue with his brother-in-law. This raises a further doubt over how much the court can rely on their assertion that FGM does not take place within their family as a whole. Furthermore, is fails to demonstrate any support for the paternal family&#8217;s claim that they have rejected FGM and do not practice it or that they would or could withstand the expectation from the wider family and society to carry out FGM on female children. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the context of the expert evidence it is more than a little surprising that F&#8217;s family has sought to say that FGM is an outdated and outmoded practice in Egypt, particularly when there has not even been any discussion within the family. F was reported as saying both to M and to the local authority that FGM is <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;part of the culture&#8221;</span>; which is, given the prevalence in Egyptian society of FGM, a more probable and likely reflection of his views. It is the evidence in this case that X would remain at very substantial risk of FGM should she travel to Egypt with her mother, who would be vulnerable and isolated, unable to understand what was being said or discussed around her and largely, if not wholly, unequipped to prevent FGM taking place if the family decided that it should. Moreover, there is no legal mechanism to put in place enforceable protective measures; or even to ensure the X would be free to return to the United Kingdom with her mother if F decided that she should remain in Egypt.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In deciding whether to make a FGMPO, under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/31" uk:canonical="2003 c. 31" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FGMA 2003</ref> Schedule 2 Part 1 paragraph 2 (2) I have had regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the need to secure the health, safety and well-being of the girl to be protected. The purpose of making an order is to protect a girl against the commission of a female genital mutilation offence. Under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/31/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s4</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/31" uk:canonical="2003 c. 31" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> an offence includes an offence outside the United Kingdom; this court has assessed that in all the circumstances of this case X is at a substantial risk of such an offence being committed outside the UK, namely in Egypt. This risk will rise with age (the highest risk being to girls between the ages of 9 and 12) and any order will have to remain in place throughout her childhood and through puberty to provide her with protection. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is not intended that X should not be able to see her father or members of the paternal family and the court would encourage F and his family to visit X here in England. X&#8217;s parents have agreed that X would live in the UK with her mother but had intended that she visit F and his family in Egypt as this is not going to be possible F can demonstrate his commitment to his daughter by travelling to the UK to see her; to assist him in making appropriate arrangements the court orders will be permitted to be disclosed to the relevant government departments, consulates and Embassies. It is accepted both by X&#8217;s guardian on her behalf in her recommendations and by this court that this judgment will curtail X&#8217;s visits to her father as the trips will have to be one way only, but the risk to X is so great and the consequences of FGM for her are so fundamental a breach of her rights that the balance must come down in favour of an order protecting her from mutilation.  </p>
