	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am concerned with J, a 7 year old boy.  His parents F (Father) aged 40 years and M (Mother) aged 34 years, were in a relationship together which began in 2007.  The parties separated, as best I have been able to establish, within 12 months of J&#8217;s birth.  Following the parties separation, which was acrimonious, the parents were nonetheless able to make some arrangements for J to have contact with F.  He lived with M.</p>

	  <num>2.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The contact arrangements broke down in 2013.  F made an application for a Child Arrangement Order, with the objective of restoring his contact to his son.  This has been consistently opposed by M on three fronts: firstly, she contends F abuses alcohol and cannot be entrusted with the care of their child; secondly, she asserts that F had been violent towards her; thirdly, she claims F is temperamentally and in principle averse to allowing his son &#8216;to present as a girl&#8217; and resistant to recognising his &#8216;gender variance&#8217; as she has described it.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During the course of the private law proceedings, Her Honour Judge Penna authorised a wide ranging investigation. The Local Authority prepared a section 7 report and later conducted a section 37 investigation.  J was made a party to the proceedings pursuant to rule 16.2 &amp; 16.4 Family Proceedings Rules and thus represented by his Guardian. A very experienced clinical psychologist was instructed to undertake an assessment of the child and of his relationship with both parents.  As I have read through the papers it is striking that as the litigation progressed J came to be referred to predominantly by the feminine pronoun &#8216;she&#8217;. I pause here to emphasise that J was, at this stage, between four and six years of age.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_4">
	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Judge Penna had also conducted a &#8216;fact finding hearing&#8217; to determine the mother&#8217;s allegations of domestic violence.  In a succinct judgment, dated 16 April 2014, the judge was only able to identify one coherent allegation. Characteristically, for these proceedings, it had not been possible to identify the date of the actual incident.  Both parents agreed that it occurred in February. F contended it was February 2013, M asserted it was February 2012. The judge found F&#8217;s recollection of the date to be accurate and supported by independent police evidence.  Ultimately, the judge concluded that there had been an altercation which involved F leaning into M&#8217;s car through an open driver&#8217;s window.  She found that M repelled him.  J was in the car and it was agreed the car &#8216;wobbled&#8217; during the course of the incident.  Importantly, the judge went on to find &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">I do not interpret the incident as one-sided</span>.  <span style="font-style:italic">It is my view that the father behaved badly.  It is my view that the mother also behaved badly&#8217;</span>.  She went on to find that J &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">must have felt frightened and upset&#8217;</span>. There were no other findings. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_5">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It requires to be emphasised that the evidence failed to establish that the father presented a risk of violence to the mother, J or indeed any other person.  The findings were not appealed.  I would add that during the course of the investigations before me the Judge&#8217;s findings have been reinforced by my own assessment of the dynamic of the parent&#8217;s relationship as I have observed them in the witness box; the respective psychological assessments; the F&#8217;s present stable and secure relationship; F&#8217;s lack of any history of violence at 40 years age.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In that same judgment, Judge Penna also considered the recommendation of the Cafcass officer that was before her.  The report had concluded that there should be no contact between J and F and that the proceedings should be brought to a close.  In respect of this recommendation the Judge observed:  <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">&#8216;I am unable to agree that this recommendation addresses J&#8217;s welfare needs which include a need to have a rounded sense of his identity as he grows older&#8217;. </span><span style="font-style:italic">(my emphasis).</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In addition to the above, what is perhaps most striking about the information that was being drawn to this Local Authority&#8217;s attention is that it came from such a wide variety of sources.  It seems to me, in particular, that concerns from a school i.e. the professionals who see the child most, should always be afforded very significant weight.  The following passages reveal that the staff at school A were reading the situation carefully and, for the reasons which I will address later in this judgment, were plainly alert both to J&#8217;s presentation and to the Mother&#8217;s confrontational and inappropriate behaviour.   I am bound to say that had their concerns been given the weight that they plainly should have, it is difficult to resist the conclusion that J could have been spared a great deal of emotional harm:</p>

During August and October 2014 the Department also received information from the police in relation to incidents that had occurred in the community where [M] felt that [J] was a victim of hate crime. A referral was also received from the appointed guardian Claire Quinn in November 2014, who raised concerns around the number of professionals raising concerns in relation to [J]&#8217;s presentation and that there had been a multi agency meeting held where Claire was not represented and the guardian was not invited.

In particular it contained the alarming assertion, which as it transpired was entirely untrue, that J had been &#8216;diagnosed as transgender&#8217;.  It perhaps requires to be re-emphasised that J was at this stage 4 years of age.</p>

It is also noted that despite several referrals from school and health informing of concerns they did not put any early intervention strategies in place such as a MCAF in order to further explore their concerns with [M] and to identify potential information/support services. On a number of occasions the professionals involved have not met [J] and/or [M] and were encouraged to discuss concerns with [M] directly and set up lower level meetings with her in attendance in the first instance. In the event, a meeting was arranged by services which [M] was not invited to. During the last assessment period the Local Authority were ordered by the court to file a Section 37 report in respect of [J].&#8221;</span></p>

Each was signalling real anxiety in respect of this child&#8217;s welfare.  Whilst it is, I suppose, conceivable that these referrals were considered individually, it is impossible to draw any inference other than that they were never evaluated collectively.  When they were drawn to the attention of Lucy Davidson, the senior social worker, who now has conduct of this case, she said in her evidence <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;is it is difficult to justify some of the decision-making that took place&#8217;</span>.  That was a measured and careful response. She was not pressed further.  However it does not, in my judgement, go far enough.  This local authority has consistently failed to take appropriate intervention where there were strong grounds for believing that a child was at risk of serious emotional harm.  I propose to invite the Director of Children&#8217;s Services to undertake a thorough review of the social work response to this case.  Professional deficiencies to this extent cannot go unchecked, if confidence in this Local Authority&#8217;s safeguarding structures is to be maintained.  </p>

Once again, I make no apology for repeating the fact that J was still only 4 years of age.  The conclusions of the report speak of J by use of the feminine pronoun.  There was no independent or supportive evidence that J identified as a girl at all, indeed there was a body of material that suggested the contrary.  The cry for investigation went unheeded:</p>

It is evident that some agencies do not have a full understanding of gender non conforming children and have therefore contacted Children&#8217;s Service, sometimes when they have not met [J]. This clearly frustrates [M] and leaves her feeling that she is unsupported, and has caused her to feel stressed and anxious. Therefore [M] mistrusts professionals which is often interpreted as that she is unwilling to engage with services. &#8221;</span></p>

Ms Sambrooks accepted the professional consensus and also refers to J as &#8216;she&#8217; in her report.  There seems to me to be much learning and common sense in her analysis, concerning the difficulties faced by children who are uncomfortable with the gender into which they have been born.  It is entirely counterintuitive to suspect that a boy who is consistently presenting as a girl may not truly wish to do so and may have been forced or induced into performing such a role by his mother.  I am not surprised that Ms Sambrooks was not immediately alert to such a situation.  She was appointed to undertake a discrete piece of work, she did not have the full opportunity, whilst the case remained in the County Court, to survey the wider canvas of concern.  It is however significant that, for the first time in the sorry history of this case, she identified F&#8217;s positives and the important contribution he had to make to J&#8217;s life.</p>

Thus, though M complained that she felt under constant assessment Ms Sambrooks plainly felt that M had rather &#8216;avoided assessment&#8217;.  It was also noted that M, though initially positive to the psychological assessment, was entirely unprepared to engage in the second interview that had been contemplated.  Ms Sambrooks also postulated that M either had difficulties recalling the reality of a situation or <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">&#8216;that she was prone to exaggerate and distort information&#8217;</span>.  It was further recorded that Ms Sambrooks had concerns about the way M <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;offers information&#8217;&#8230; &#8216;particularly on transgender issues&#8217;</span>.  It has to be said that, at this stage, Ms Sambrooks considered that the impact of these concerns was most likely to have alienated professionals to the mother&#8217;s genuine concerns.

Importantly they can offer support locally to [J] and [M] and other professionals if resourced.  They will always take advice from a more specialist clinic and I am concerned that [M] did not follow the advice of the Tavistock Centre in this respect and indeed disengaged from Health Visiting and that J does not currently have a GP.  I am confused by her comment that she did not wish for [J] to be labelled (Sect 37 par 6.18) as [J] is very clearly labelled by her to those that she comes into contact with.&#8221;</span></p>

There was a request that the child&#8217;s solicitor be replaced due to her &#8216;knowledge deficits&#8217;, the fact that she &#8216;does not understand J&#8217;s condition&#8217; and generic criticisms of her general competence.   </p>

Even more alarmingly J himself had entirely disappeared from view.  He had not been permitted proper access to his Guardian, he was not attending school, his home address and living arrangements were unknown.  In addition, as I have highlighted above, Ms Sambrooks&#8217; report raised concerns that M might &#8220;be prone to exaggerate and to distort information&#8221;.  There was certainly ample evidence of that.  Ms Sambrooks&#8217; had also commented upon <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;M&#8217;s need to be in control and indeed choose the professionals with whom she interacts</span>&#8221;.  Again, the history of M&#8217;s non-compliance or partial compliance with professionals provides compelling support for this view.</p>

As I have said, there is no evidence of any such diagnosis. The mother denies having made such an assertion.  However, the important point is that the concern was there and required proper exploration.  More generally as to M&#8217;s capacity to meet J&#8217;s needs, Ms Sambrooks&#8217; also drew attention to the fact that there had in the past been reports of J &#8220;looking dirty&#8221; in her mother&#8217;s care.  This signalled to Ms. Sambrooks that the mother might have been experiencing mental health difficulties at various stages.  Indeed, the mother is recorded as having told Ms Sambrooks that she had in the past suffered mental health problems.   </p>

M has traduced F and belittled him throughout the course of this litigation, at times, quite literally, snorting with derision.  In particular M has presented F as insensitive to the whole issue of gender dysphoria.  In fact Ms Sambrooks found him to be <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;very comfortable with diversity&#8217;</span>.   F&#8217;s elder son, who I have been told is zany and funny was noted <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;to have clearly been allowed to develop his own interests, beliefs and presentation&#8217;</span>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the hearing on the 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2015, M told me that J &#8216;was living in stealth&#8217; by which was meant, she explained, that he was living life entirely as a girl.  He dressed, at all times, like a girl and, it transpired, had been registered at a new General Practitioner&#8217;s as a girl.  M told me that she had been advised to take this course by the Tavistock Centre, which is recognised as a specialist service for advice concerning gender dysphoria.  Though I was by no means certain, I very much doubted that the Tavistock would have given this advice in respect of such a very young child.  On a merely practical level it struck me as an arrangement that was fraught with potential for real harm to J if his true gender was inadvertently discovered.  I was concerned not only that J might be profoundly upset by his exposure but I was also troubled as to how this would impact upon his friendships and key relationships.  It was for these reasons that I added to the Draft Order of the 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November my own requirement that the Tavistock Records be filed and served upon the parties.  That particular Order is recorded as having been &#8216;of the Court&#8217;s own motion&#8217;.</p>

Once again the professionals bent to her will and the Order was not complied with.  Shortly before a Directions Hearing on the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February J&#8217;s solicitor drew the non-compliance to my attention.  I pause to note that F has Parental Responsibility for the child and his authority would have been sufficient.  On the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February the records were still not available and so I was driven to take the unusual step of ordering that the case would remain listed until the records were produced.   It was also plain that J&#8217;s welfare required an Interim Care Order, both because he was at risk of significant emotional harm and, given M&#8217;s manipulative behaviour, parental responsibility required to be shared with the Local Authority.</p>

They did not support M&#8217;s contention that they had advised the &#8216;stealth&#8217; arrangements.  Indeed, the records were sparse and only served further to confirm that M&#8217;s cooperation was partial and on her own terms.  Following a contested hearing, I found myself in agreement with J&#8217;s Guardian that the risk of leaving J in M&#8217;s care was unacceptable.  I was also satisfied, both from my own assessment of F in the witness box and from the assessment of Ms Sambrooks, that he could provide a safe haven for J so that his needs could properly be evaluated.  F had not seen his son for two years, nor had he, contrary to the Court&#8217;s orders, been provided with any good quality photographs.  He was entirely unsure of what J&#8217;s true feelings were about his gender.  There was no sustained independent observation of J interacting with others.  F faced a very considerable parenting challenge.   What was perfectly clear however and requires emphasis is that M was determined that J should live entirely as a girl.  At only five years of age that did not strike me as offering J choice or even the opportunity to express any ambivalence or confusion.  I was also entirely satisfied that whatever choices J made and however he presented, he would be loved and cared for and his choices respected in F&#8217;s care.</p>

However what struck me forcibly, both then and indeed at this final hearing, was that M spoke of J only in the somewhat opaque and convoluted argot of social work and psychology.  She offered an impressive, intense and highly articulate evaluation of the problems faced by children with gender dysphoria but she conveyed no sense of J&#8217;s personality, temperament or enthusiasms, notwithstanding frequently being encouraged to do so.  Repeatedly she struck me as a professional witness giving evidence about somebody else&#8217;s child.  </p>

M&#8217;s case on this point has not always been either consistent or coherent, but my overwhelming impression is that she believes herself to be fighting for J&#8217;s right to express himself as a girl.  She has told me how J &#8216;expressed disdain for his penis&#8217;.  I think it accurately summarises her position to say that she perceived it to be her responsibility in the face of widespread public, professional and indeed judicial ignorance to promote J&#8217;s choice of gender.</p>

He makes this clear whether or not his father is around and would not seem to be influenced by him. [J] chooses to present as a boy within school and in terms of his dress and would seem to be more comfortable with his male genitalia as time goes on. I remain of the view that it is very unusual for a parent to be able to influence a child to the extent [M] would appear to have been able to do but that would seem to be the case given [J]&#8217;s very rapid change of presentation once offered a choice. I cannot guess at [M]&#8217;s motivation or belief system in this respect but she is clearly a powerful figure. During the preparation of my report and the Court proceedings [M] clearly demonstrated her need to be in control and the extent to which she would thwart or misinterpret directions to serve her own ends.</span></p>

She accepts that she viewed the prospect of contact between [J] and his father as exposing [J] to a risk of harm. This is a view which she now accepts is wrong. Following the decision made by Hayden J &#8230; she has had time to reflect. She has also had the opportunity to reflect on the evidence in the case with the assistance of objective legal advice. Furthermore she has been able to reflect on the contents of the reports and in particular the reports of Mrs Sambrooks and Ms Van Empel. [M] has been shocked to the core by the decision of Hayden J to transfer residence of [J] to his father. She accepts that her initial reactions were disbelief, anger and a sense of injustice and unfairness; but above all a deep fear and anxiety of the impact upon [J] of moving in such circumstances. The decision has however made her re-examine her own actions and the positions she has taken in recent years. Bearing in mind that she has developed her views and beliefs over a number of years and that she admits to having become deeply entrenched in her position this has been a difficult and at times painful process. This process of re-examining her position has been made more difficult at times because for a lengthy period [M]&#8217;s position has been supported, shaped and reinforced by a series of experienced professionals. Prior to the appointment of Ms Van Empel the consistent recommendations of Cafcass were that there should be no direct contact. Ms Van Empel and Mrs Sambrooks have recommended with cogent reasoning a contrary direction. [M] has considered the views of both Mrs Sambrooks and Ms Van Empel on the issue of contact. Accepting, as she does, the descriptions of [F]&#8217;s home and family circumstances as they are now and the relationships he has with his ex partner [T], his son [K] and his partner [P], [M] readily acknowledges that [J] will benefit enormously from frequent generous contact with his father enabling him to become a full member of the paternal family.</span></p>

[M] herself was bullied at school and she was also in a conflictual relationship with the school, one in which she may have been both bully and felt bullied. Similarly, she said that [J] was afraid of going to the GP practice and would scream there but surgery staff had never seen this. Again, this was at a time that [M] was in conflict with the surgery. She believes [J] preferred "just mummy and me" and she apparently ended a relationship in order to focus on [J] though it was not clear to me why the relationship was in conflict with her role as mother.</span></p>

The fused nature of the relationship and [M]'s belief that [J] wants to be a girl is likely to push [J] in the direction of a female gender identity. [M] cannot see that [J] may be consciously or unconsciously trying to please her by assuming a female gender identity now that [M] has formed the view that this is [J]'s preference.&#8221;</span></p>

The word she used, which I will not repeat, would not be tolerated these days on the football terraces.  From a nurse who has specialised in mental health issues it is particularly alarming.  It was selected to hurt and goad F.  I noticed that when the point was raised in cross examination F found it particularly upsetting.  F, in the past, worked as a disc jockey in various night clubs.  He obviously had an interest in music.  I have read that M refused to return his decks to him following the separation, though they were quite obviously F&#8217;s most prized possession.

Indeed very few, myself included, have escaped the sting of her wrath. I have however come to realise, with the benefit of Dr Hellin&#8217;s report, that when M is behaving in this abusive and bombastic manner she is in fact at her most frightened and distressed.  That is not to say that such behaviour should be tolerated, merely that it is helpful to understand it in this way.  My chief concern is that, when witnessed by J, this behaviour provides a very negative model for him and may have damaging impact on his own behaviour.  </p>

This reflects her underlying anxiety. She is actually very frightened and upset. She tries to sooth herself by taking control of situations but her interpersonal style is counter-productive. She does not negotiate well. She finds it difficult to compromise and situations become inflamed rather than de-escalated. In situations of interpersonal conflict, she protects herself from loss of confidence or face by unambiguously perceiving herself as correct which means that from her perspective, the other party is wrong. To acknowledge her flaws, even to herself, feels crushing and devastates her self-esteem so she avoids this possibility by locating responsibility and blame elsewhere. When she is unable to achieve the outcome that she wants, she resorts to formal processes and/or higher authorities: complaint procedures, The Protection of Human Rights in Public Law, the European Court of Human Rights, Stonewall and so on.&#8221;</span></p>

The reality, of course, is that M is not in a position to challenge or gainsay how J is presently behaving.   It has not been suggested that any of the accounts given by F, his partner (P) or the school are factually inaccurate.  M addresses this evidence, which in my judgment is compelling, by suggesting that J has adopted a male persona because he believes that to do so will help secure his return to his mother.  When explaining to J why he was going to live with his father, M told him &#8216;the Judge does not like little boys being little girls&#8217;.

I will consider the contact separately below but I record here that I accept F&#8217;s evidence that it can cause J distress.  On one occasion, where contact was particularly damaging to J he wet the bed for two nights afterwards.  As it happened F had arranged a camping trip following contact.  Mr Baker suggested that it might have been the unfamiliarity of life under canvass that had caused the bedwetting.  With typical diffidence, F agreed that might be a plausible explanation.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">With respect to Mr Baker it is not always easy to pin M&#8217;s case down.  In her evidence it was clear that she plainly believes that F tries to condition J into behaving like a boy.  J now lives in the bedroom, sometimes also occupied by his half sibling who visits at weekend.  As I understand M&#8217;s thinking, she believes the presence of &#8216;boys toys&#8217; in the bedroom subtly insinuates to J the need to behave like a boy.  All this, which has at best tenuous coherence, requires the detailed and cogent evidence of J&#8217;s behaviour to be entirely discounted.  J is a &#8216;curious&#8217; child, eager for new experiences.  He more than stands his own ground with his new brother.  He is frequently boisterous.  I have the strong impression that all of this has rather taken F by surprise.  F himself is of a far more gentle disposition not instinctively attracted to football or Power Rangers.  It is impossible not to conclude that there is in J something of his mother&#8217;s forceful personality.  F, though the Guardian has told me that he has grown in confidence, is an essentially passive personality.  Dr Hellin&#8217;s assessment of him entirely accords with my own impression of him having now seen him regularly at Court and having heard him give evidence on two occasions: </p>

Judge Penna found that he had been aggressive in February 2013 when he leaned into the car and in the context of aggression by [M] too. Other than this, there is no sign that he is inherently prone to aggression or violence, physical or oral except under exceptional duress, when he has felt abused and controlled for long periods of time and has eventually lashed out verbally.

F&#8217;s simple and instinctive position is that he loves his son unconditionally and will continue to do so however he turns out.  F has, in his quiet, self-effacing manner shown remarkable resilience in extremely trying circumstances.  He works with increasing confidence with the agencies who have let him and his son down so badly and he does so without bitterness or rancour.  Throughout the entirety of the private law proceedings F&#8217;s character was traduced, he was excised from his child&#8217;s life, his concerns were not listened to by the professionals involved in the case.  Many fathers in such circumstances would have walked away.  He did not, he stood by his son throughout the seemingly endless proceedings and was ultimately able to rescue him.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I agree with that approach. I consider that M has caused significant emotional harm to J in her active determination that he should be a girl.  I find that she has overborne his will and deprived him of his fundamental right to exercise his autonomy in its most basic way.  Whether J chooses to present as a girl or not, ought to be his choice.  This is not a case about gender dysphoria, rather it is about a mother who has developed a belief structure which she has imposed upon her child.  I accept the evidence of Dr Hellin that M has become &#8216;enmeshed&#8217; with J, in that she is unable to distinguish his feelings from her own.  As such she is ill-equipped to meet J&#8217;s emotional needs.  M told me in her evidence that if J were not returned to her care, as she correctly anticipated might happen, he ought to be removed from his father and placed with an independent foster carer where, she reasoned, he would be free from any pressure to be a boy.  This proposal, which was genuinely advanced, illustrates the chasm that has developed between J&#8217;s needs and M&#8217;s capacity to meet them. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My experience in the Family Division leaves me with little doubt that some children, as young as 4, 5, 6 years of age may identify strongly with their opposite gender.  Such children can experience rejection and abuse arising from ignorance both on a personal and institutional level.  Though none of the parties referred me to it, I have read the House of Commons Select Committee report &#8216;<span style="font-weight:bold">Transgender Equality</span>&#8217;,<span style="font-weight:bold"/>dated 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2016, which investigates the challenges in securing sensitive NHS care and accessing affirming educational environments for transgender adults and children.  It is important that such children are listened to and their views afforded respect but, to my mind, they are ill served by premature labelling.  What they require, as F has so capably demonstrated, is the opportunity to develop their identity in which ever way it evolves.  J was not only deprived of that space and opportunity by his mother, he was pressed into a gender identification that had far more to do with his mother&#8217;s needs and little, if anything, to do with his own.</p>

See: <a class="Hyperlink" href="http://www.familylawweek.co.uk/site.aspx?i=ed143260" style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;color:initial">Re A (Application for Care and Placement Orders: Local Authority Failings); sub nom Darlington Borough Council v M, F, GM and GF</a><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2015/11" uk:canonical="[2015] EWFC 11" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWFC 11</ref>;</span><span style="font-weight:bold">&#160;<ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2016] 1 FLR 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] 1 FLR 1</ref></span>.  Though the Local Authority submit that it is clear that the threshold for intervention is met, they consider that on their evaluation of the s1(2) criteria, &#8216;the welfare checklist&#8217;, J&#8217;s needs can be best be met by a Child Arrangement Order in favour of the father, supported by a twelve month Supervision Order to the Local Authority.  The reasoning underpinning this is that F has made such significant progress and his judgement has been so instinctively reliable that the parenting support that the Local Authority can offer is no longer necessary.  Ms Davidson, who has made a powerful and effective contribution to this case, analyses the welfare imperatives in the context of the available legal framework:</p>

A Full Care Order could be requested. This would enable the Local Authority to continue to share Parental Responsibility for [J] and thus to stipulate where [J] would live. This would allow the Local Authority to remain significantly involved in the care that [J] receives and take any necessary steps to ensure [J]&#8217;s needs were met. For a Care Order to be proportionate, it would need to be demonstrated that it was necessary for the Local Authority to share Parental Responsibility to safeguard [J] from significant harm. In these circumstances the social work assessment has not demonstrated any areas where [F] cannot make decisions in [J]&#8217;s best interests; he is insightful of [J]&#8217;s needs and is willing to take the advice of specialist services and the Local Authority in doing so. A Care Order would therefore not provide [J] with any additional safeguard. The &#8216;No Order&#8217; principle has been considered through the formulation of this care plan and it appears that a Care Order would provide unnecessary intervention into [J]&#8217;s life.&#8221;</span></p>

A Child Arrangement Order, specifying residence with [F] would achieve this. This would allow [J] to be cared for by his father without the stigma of being a Looked After Child with ongoing statutory intervention. The area in which potential harm to [J] has been identified relates to [M]&#8217;s parenting and emotional enmeshment with [J]. By being cared for by [F], some elements of risk are alleviated however, the impact of the emotional harm and risk are likely to be ongoing to some degree. The Local Authority therefore proposes a Supervision Order be made for one year to allow the Local Authority to continue to &#8216;advise and befriend&#8217; [J] and his family.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst I have been greatly impressed by Ms Davidson&#8217;s social work skills in this case, I reject her analysis as to the appropriate legal framework to be applied.  It is, in my view, self evident that the challenges that lie ahead for J are significant.  It seems to me that he faces two serious risks.  Firstly, he may lose direct contact with his mother altogether.  She has been the centre of his world for most of his life.  He worries about her.  Were she to break free from her rigid and ultimately false belief structure she would have a huge amount to offer as a parent.  I believe J would grieve the loss of his mother bitterly.  Secondly, if contact is not monitored very carefully, with reference to this judgment and to the history of this case, it has the potential to corrode J&#8217;s core identity.  Furthermore, experience shows us that adolescence can often be a time when earlier psychological harm begins to take its toll.  I consider that this father should be given the maximum support available, buttressed by imposing upon the Local Authority, the statutory duties of a Care Order.  In addition the permissive flexibility of an order pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/34/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.34 (4)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> strikes me as particularly suited to the circumstance of this case.</p>

The Local Authority is mindful that there are many positives within the contact between [M] and [J], that [J] appears to enjoy contact sessions and that [J]&#8217;s verbally expressed wish is to live with his mother. [J] clearly closely identifies with his mother, worries about her and that she forms a big part of [J]&#8217;s understanding of his identity. However, as set out in Section 5, there are several concerns regarding the impact of contact on [J]. These primarily relate to the amount of influence that [M] holds over [J] and the amount to which, her views regarding [J] and [F], limit [J]&#8217;s ability to develop his own identity and relationship with [F].</span></p>

It need not be, it can be understated, sensitive and light touch where the child is concerned.  I am very pleased that the Local Authority has agreed that Ms Davidson may continue to be assigned to this case.  I am confident that she can implement the Care Order as I intend it should be.  </p>
