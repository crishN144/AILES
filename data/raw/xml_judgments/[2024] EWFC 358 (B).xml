Within the Form E of the respondent, that was stated as being correct by the respondent when giving his evidence in chief, it is stated but this sum was a loan and that a loan agreement was drawn up. Indeed it is contended that some 23 repayments have been made at &#8364;1000 per calendar month. It was asserted by the respondent that the reason for the loan agreement was that ARC needed a loan agreement in case the Spanish tax authorities requested any information which would give rise to gift tax, which is levied at varying rates but would in any event give rise to a tax liability of not less than 30%.</span></p>

At this point I interjected as ARC was not a party to these proceedings and that he was not able to answer the allegations being put by his father that he was potentially defrauding either the tax authorities in Spain or His Majesty's Revenue and Customs in the UK. The respondent subsequently stated this money was a loan however if his financial position improved and he was able to regift the sums paid back to him then he would do so.</span></p>

Consequently the respondent has valued it using we buy any car in July 2023 only eight months after his Form E at only little over &#163;500.

He also sought to persuade me that No. 3 was overvalued and that his incredibly generous pensions should be ring fenced as non matrimonial assets, and that the applicant still had time to pay into her state pension. The respondent again asked me to take into account his first wife's potential entitlement to some of his pension certainly until 2002. As a final throwaway comment, the respondent pointed out that there was a difficulty with the Spanish property, as the property being built by ARC relies on the Spanish property for its electricity supply, and that there are various issues with the drainage as described in his oral evidence, that he would feel morally obliged to disclose to any purchaser.</span></p>

The photographs provided by the applicant commencing at [371] and running to [387] show a long and detailed photographic history that flies in the face of the assertion made by the respondent that he was at best some form of passing acquaintance who occasionally stayed. In coming to this finding I've given consideration to the Kimber factors in that this evidence plainly shows habitual living together, and sharing of daily life albeit there may have been periods when the respondent was not there. The mingling of finances are clearly demonstrated, not only by the comments I have made previously regarding No. 11 and the purchase of the Spanish property, but clearly and unequivocally in the solicitors and bank correspondence found at [352 - 353]. The slightly more visceral points regarding an ongoing sexual relationship within the Kimber factors is borne out by the very existence of ARD, born 1994, and ARC, born 1996. These two children were born within three years of when the applicant states the relationship began properly. The respondent&#8217;s contention that the relationship was anything less than full familial living at this point, not only does not stand up to scrutiny, but is in my finding a fallacy, and a wilfully dishonest one at that, and seeks to paint his children in a less than flattering light.</span></p>

This revised offer was that No. 3 was to be retained by the applicant, No. 11 was to be sold, and the Spanish property retained by the respondent, on the basis that he is living there presently and it is inextricably linked to the property being built by the son ARC next door. This would leave a balancing payment to be paid from the respondent to the applicant to equalise capital in sum of &#163;7845. In the absence of any agreement overnight between the parties as to what they will do, I find that this is a reasonable and achievable outcome, and largely addresses the issues raised by the respondent that he would find it difficult to pay a large lump sum as previously indicated, of &#163;38,915 if the Spanish property were to be sold, and the respondent retained No. 11.</span></p>

I heard evidence from the respondent in which he sought to portray the applicant as a scrounger, someone who lived their life on benefits gaming the system and someone who had been caught out and was now having to pay back their fraudulently gotten gains. He deliberately portrayed her as unemployed knowing full well that, at various points, and even today, she is in employment. He went further to portray a person with something of a &#8216;revolving door&#8217; of partners, indeed he made reference to wearing some of her ex-husband&#8217;s clothes on the first day of this hearing. When challenged he acted with prickly indignation when his integrity was called into question.  Even in his closing submissions, he tried to rekindle the relationship, stating that he simply thought it was very sad that it had come to this and that he wished to remain married to the applicant.</span></p>

The term is unambiguous and needs no embellishment. Understanding the scope and ambit of the behaviour however, requires a recognition that coercion will usually involve a pattern of acts encompassing, for example, assault, intimidation, humiliation and threats. &#8216;Controlling Behaviour&#8217; really involves a range of acts designed to render an individual subordinate and to corrode their sense of personal autonomy. Key to both behaviours is an appreciation of a pattern or a series of acts the impact of which must be assessed cumulatively and rarely in isolation.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8221;</span></p>
