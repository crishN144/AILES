	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">This is an application regarding the proposed withdrawal of clinically assisted nutrition and hydration in respect of Mrs Jillian Rushton, who is now 85 years of age. Since sustaining a traumatic head injury in December 2015, Mrs Rushton has suffered from a prolonged period of disorder of consciousness. Insofar as a label is relevant, the consensus of medical opinion, in respect of which there is no dissent at all, is that she is in a persistent vegetative state (PVS). In their recent guidance, <span style="font-weight:bold">&#8216;Clinicallyassisted nutrition and hydration (CANH) and adults who lack the capacity to consent&#8217;</span>, the Royal College of Physicians and the British Medical Association have noted that the importance of obtaining a precise and definitive diagnosis has reduced. It is recognised by the Courts and clinicians that drawing a firm distinction between vegetative state and minimally conscious state is frequently both artificial and unnecessary. In practice, when assessing best interests, information about the patient&#8217;s current condition and prognosis for functional recovery and the level of confidence with which these can be evaluated is invariably of greater importance than a precise diagnosis.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Mrs Jillian Rushton was formerly a nurse. I have heard that she was fortunate enough to have had an extremely happy and long marriage. I have noticed as I have listened to her family that is it almost impossible for them to mention her, even now 14 years after the death of her husband, without mentioning him too, almost in the same sentence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Dr Donald Rushton, a former pathologist died from prostate cancer. I have heard from his son that when he received his diagnosis, he and his wife discussed how they would spend their remaining days together. They determined that the emphasis should be on the quality of his life rather than on its duration. Dr Rushton declined chemotherapy with little, if any, hesitation. He described it to his family as like putting <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Vim in his veins&#8221;</span>.  He was very clear that the pain and discomfort of the process did not justify any prolongation of life.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">That was a brave decision, but its significance to my mind is that it was a joint one. Having heard evidence on these issues in other cases, I have noted that those suffering from terminal illnesses sometimes feel the need to undertake chemotherapy for their partners and families. This couple plainly had frank and open discussions, rooted in a life time of being able to speak openly and honestly with each other. They came to their decision jointly and neither ever regretted it. It must have been a very difficult decision for Mrs Rushton to take; it also says a great deal about her attitude towards and her acceptance of death.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">By all accounts, Mrs Rushton was something of a &#8216;star&#8217; in her youth; certainly, Dr Rushton thought so. Indeed, he continued to think so long after her youth had gone. I was told how on one occasion he remarked to his grandchild that his grandmother was the most attractive girl he had ever seen. There is, I am told, a photograph (in this family) of Dr and Mrs Rushton going out to dinner, he smart in black tie and she elegant in a polka dot dress, looking in the family&#8217;s eyes like the actress, Audrey Hepburn.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Mrs Rushton was full of life. She enjoyed bird watching, she enjoyed classical music, she was a member of a sewing group and joined in many activities that were associated with her local community and church. She strikes me as one of life&#8217;s organisers. Indeed, I am told that she managed the catering at one of her children&#8217;s weddings, for 120 guests.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">When her husband died she struggled on as best she could, keeping as busy as possible. Although there were times, at family gatherings surrounded by her sons and grandchildren, when the sunshine came back into her life, the reality appears to have been as her son, Hugh, told me so eloquently, that after her husband&#8217;s death, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the sweetness went out of her life</span>.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Her health began to decline and in August 2014 she was admitted to hospital with pneumonia. She had, by all accounts, enjoyed good health hitherto but after that episode her strength began to fail her and her overall well-being deteriorated.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Her son, Tim Rushton, gradually assumed the role of her carer. It must be said that he is devoted to her. He was, he tells me, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;the baby of the four brothers&#8221;.</span> I suspect, from what I have heard, that Mrs Rushton gave to him care and love of a slightly different kind to that of the older brothers. They are all fit, healthy, competent in life, but they see, as do I, a certain vulnerability in Tim. His brother Hugh, who I can see he respects very much, describes him as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">obsessive compulsive</span>&#8221; and certainly I have noticed that there is something rather concrete in his thinking. Though he could not do enough for his mother and has been solicitous to her every need, he is plainly burdened with a sense of his own inadequacy, perceiving himself (entirely wrongly) as not having done enough for her or of not having cared sufficiently.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">When Mrs Rushton was discharged from hospital she was conspicuously frail and it became obvious to her sons that there was, in addition to a physical frailty, a gradual decline in her general cognitive functioning. She was, I am told, frequently agitated, often weepy and distressed. Her personality was different and she became uncharacteristically quick to anger. She had some insight into her own deterioration; the papers are littered with references to her communicating that she &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">did not want to wake up in the mornings&#8221;</span> and how much she missed her husband, Donald.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">On the 21 December 2015, Mrs Rushton fell and suffered a major trauma to her head. It was so significant that she was not expected to survive and as Ms Dolan QC, who today appears on behalf of NHS Cumbria CCG, has told me, she was placed on a palliative care plan. However, Mrs Rushton had a good physical constitution and, of course, the doctors are not always right. On that admission in 2015, a naso - gastric tube was inserted to feed her. It was done instinctively by conscientious medical staff, whose every instinct would have been to promote her welfare. When her condition improved the NG tube was replaced by a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) which was inserted at the end of January 2016, in part in order to facilitate her care back at home with her son.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">An important feature in the background of this case requires to be highlighted. It has been the subject of scrutiny and anxious thought. On 24th July 2014, approximately a year before she sustained her brain injury, Mrs Rushton signed an Advance Decision, in which she indicated her refusal of treatment in certain circumstances (see below). The <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> gives statutory recognition to and governs the applicability of advance decisions to refuse what are referred to as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">specified medical treatments</span>.&#8221; Within these provisions, which build upon the common law, there are set out a number of conditions which require to be met in order for the decision to be valid and applicable.

In particular, chapter 9, whilst emphasising there is no set form, indicates that it is helpful to include specific information. Firstly, and obviously, the full details of the maker of the document need to be included. Secondly, and this in my view is of paramount importance, the name and address of the general practitioner should be identified and further, it should be specified whether they are to be sent a copy of the document. Thirdly, the document should indicate that it is to be used if the maker loses mental capacity. Fourthly, a clear statement of the treatment to be refused and the circumstances in which this is to be refused should be set out.  </p>

It is plain, or at very least it appears, that the document was not available at the hospital. There is, in fact, no reason why it should have been. However, the existence of the document and the identity of the GP came to light. A telephone call was made to the GP at 10.25am of the morning of 26th Jan 2016. In response to a message, the GP contacted the ward. He told them he had checked the systems and that he knew Mrs Rushton and her family. The record of the call reads, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the only ADR</span> (Advance Directive) <span style="font-style:italic">in place is in regards to do not resuscitate</span>.&#8221; The GP is reported as having said that he had no knowledge of any other document. There was only one document in existence and, I must infer, that at some point in relaying its contents, it has been incorrectly interpreted. I have not been asked to investigate where responsibility lies for this and I do not intend to do so. Having heard from Mrs Rushton&#8217;s family I have not the slightest doubt that she intended that her directive would have applied to the insertion of the PEG. The family is not critical of the hospital or the General Practitioner. They have approached this case and their mother&#8217;s circumstances phlegmatically and have, throughout, kept her needs and their conviction as to her wishes, at the centre of the process.  </p>

Manifestly, these are documents of the utmost importance; the statute and the codes provide essential safeguards. They are intending to strike a balance between giving proper respect and recognition to the autonomy of a competent adult and identifying the risk that a person might find himself locked into an advance refusal which he or she might wish to resile from but can no longer do so. The balance is pivoted on the emphasis, in the case of life-sustaining treatment, given to compliance with the form specified by statute and codes. The Court has highlighted the profound consequences of noncompliance with the requirements: <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">W v M and S and A NHS Primary Care Trust [2012] COPLR 222; Re D 2012 COPLR 493. </span></p>

I am confident the profession does but I regret to say that I do not think sufficient care and scrutiny took place here. The lesson is an obvious one and needs no amplification. Where advanced decisions have been drawn up and placed with GP records there is an onerous burden on the GP to ensure, wherever possible, that they are made available to clinicians in hospital. By this I mean a copy of the decision should be made available and placed within the hospital records with the objective that the document should follow the patient. It need hardly be said that it will rarely, if ever, be sufficient to summarise an advance decision in a telephone conversation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">As identified in the chronology above, Professor Wade, a professor in neurorehabilitation, was instructed. He gave evidence before me today. In response to Ms Dolan&#8217;s questions he indicated that he was resistant to identifying Mrs Rushton&#8217;s condition as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">a persistent vegetative state</span>&#8221; because he concluded that what was truly required was a holistic evaluation of her best interests, in the context of her wishes and feelings, in which her level of consciousness played a part. That approach, very much chimes with the guidance issued only a few days ago by the Royal College of Physicians and the BMA: <span style="font-weight:bold">&#8220;Clinically-assisted nutrition and hydration (CANH) and adults who lack the capacity to consent&#8221;</span>. At <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 5</ref> of that guidance, consideration is given to decisions concerning CANH in previously healthy patients now in a vegetative state or a minimally conscious state, following a sudden onset of brain injury. I am conscious that the phrase &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">vegetative state</span>&#8221; is distressing to family members, but while it remains a medical term I am constrained to use it. The Guidance is, in my view, an extremely helpful piece of work which reflects the breadth of experience, both in the core group of representatives of the British Medical Association, Royal College of Physicians and General Medical Council as well as the multi-disciplinary advice that was drawn upon. I take the opportunity in this judgment to highlight the following: </p>

Assessing levels of awareness &#8211; and in particular the prospect of it increasing &#8211; however, is not a simple task and there is no single clinical sign or laboratory test of awareness. Its presence must be deduced from a range of behaviours which indicate that an individual can perceive self and surroundings, frame intentions and interact with others. These observations need to be repeated over a period of time, with specialist analysis of the results. It is essential, therefore, that these patients have a thorough, expert assessment according to the RCP guidelines to provide a detailed evaluation of their level of awareness of themselves or their environment and to record any trajectory towards future recovery or deterioration. </span></p>

This may involve risks, for example of pain or seizures, which can be distressing for those close to the patient. It is crucial that doctors clearly explain the steps they are taking, why they are taking them and what to expect during that time. If withdrawal or reduction of medication is likely to have significant consequences for the patient, the doctor will need to weigh up the balance of benefits and harms between optimal assessment conditions and adequate symptom-control. This will include an assessment of how important a clear diagnosis of permanent VS versus MCS would be for the patient in terms of the best interests assessment. </span></p>

In practice, when assessing &#8216;best interests&#8217; and analysing the information relating to the patient&#8217;s current condition and prognosis for cognitive recovery, the level of certainty to which these can be assessed is often more important than an actual diagnosis. Many patients would want CANH continued until there is a clear sense of the level of recovery that can be achieved. In these patients the prognosis is important as it allows those concerned to make best interest decisions. </p>

He considered that she was most probably beyond pain and beyond awareness. Although her son, Tim Rushton, considered her to be responsive, Professor Wade was certain that her movements were merely reflexive. However, he stated with what I consider to be great sensitivity to the family, that even with patients in this level of unconsciousness, there is a response to mood and environment, to darker and lighter rooms and to music.

They, each of them, in their different ways, made it clear to me that she would not have regarded her present situation as tolerable.  Whilst I have no doubt that she would understand the commitment of her son, Tim and his profound resistance to letting her go, I have equally no doubt that she would want to be let go and I have no hesitation in concluding that it is my responsibility to respect this.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">I have read various statements from a variety of people concerning Mrs Rushton&#8217;s life, as to what her wishes would have been in these circumstances. I must say, I have heard sufficient from Mr Tim Rushton and his brother, Hugh, to be clear, that Mrs Rushton would have hoped that her wishes in her advance decision would have applied to her present situation. I cannot easily contemplate circumstances in which the views of an adult with this degree of disorder of consciousness could be communicated more volubly or unambiguously. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">I must go further and evaluate the care plan which in this case is particularly difficult. The reality is that for the past 12 months, Mr Tim Rushton has cared for his mother almost exclusively. I do not think that he is any way motivated to shut out the family or indeed the medical professionals whose visits have been reduced to a bare minimum. I note, however, that Dr Goldsmith in his most recent report, noted Mrs Rushton&#8217;s deterioration and I do not doubt that this was evident to Mr Tim Rushton. I strongly suspect he was scared of losing his Mum and so battened down the hatches as best he could to try and prevent it. This is certainly the view within the family.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">There is a rigid, inflexible regime of care at the moment. It must be said, that is obvious that Mrs Rushton has been very well cared for. Ms Paterson, on behalf of the OS, submits that the present circumstances do not promote or sufficiently protect either Mrs Rushton&#8217;s autonomy or her dignity. Dignity at the end of life is elusive both conceptually and practically. For Mrs Rushton&#8217;s life to conclude with dignity, she needs what all of us would need in that situation, peace, care, proper medical attention and the presence around her of those she has loved. I have concluded that though she would have wished to die at home, true respect of her dignity can only be achieved in a hospice and under a regime which, as her son Hugh says, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;allows her some space and privacy&#8221;. </span>Tellingly, in my judgment, insightfully, Mr Hugh Rushton went on to say that his mother needed to be in a place where she was no longer &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">prodded and poked</span>&#8221; by those undoubtedly well intentioned to care for her, but rather she needed a place <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;to rest&#8221;.</span> I entirely agree and consider that the care plan contemplates precisely this. Accordingly, I endorse it. </p>

I delayed its publication to protect Mrs Rushton&#8217;s privacy at the end of her life. I have today perfected the judgment (on the principles of <span style="font-weight:bold">Piglowska v Piglowski <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/1999/27" uk:canonical="[1999] UKHL 27" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] UKHL 27</ref></span>) and am now placing it in the public domain. As always, in these cases, the hearing took place in open court.
