The children are JA who is 13 having been born on 25 February 1990, and JE who is 11 born on 1 April 1992.  The claim is resisted by the Defendant mother, 39 year old Mrs Vivian C.

I have found this a very difficult decision, but I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that it is and that A should also be returned.  His welfare is not paramount, but it is undoubtedly relevant to the exercise of this discretion.  It is not usually advisable to separate siblings who are close in age and obviously allied with one another.  Whether A sees it as a punishment or a reward, singling him out for different treatment from his sister and from what is asked of other children in this situation, does not seem an appropriate response to the problems his is presenting.  I conclude, therefore, that both children should be returned.&#8221;</span></p>

There is also JE&#8217;s change of view though not expressed so strongly.  I have to attribute part of those changes to the time with their mother.  She has been an influence on this.  They are objections likely to reduce somewhat on any return to Germany.  These are factors which affect both the weight given to their objections, and the exercise of discretion.</span></p>
