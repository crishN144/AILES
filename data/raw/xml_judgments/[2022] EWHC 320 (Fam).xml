They are both remanded in custody.

Following objections, the judge concluded on 21</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">st</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> January that he had no jurisdiction to make an order in respect of G as she was not a witness, and it was not thought she would play any role in the criminal proceedings. In those circumstances the judge considered that the matter would be best considered by the family court, and the local authority made an application to me. I heard the case briefly on Monday 24</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> January, and listed it for fuller submissions four days later. This is my judgment following that hearing. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in"><span style="font-size:14pt">As a primary position, the local authority seeks an order which would prohibit the reporting of the defendants&#8217; names or the identity of the deceased child in any criminal proceedings. In the event of that submission being unsuccessful, the local authority invites the court at least to prohibit the identification of the deceased, or her relationship to her sibling. On their behalf, Mr. Goodwin QC advances five grounds in support of the application. First it is submitted that it would be contrary to G&#8217;s interests to be identified in the community as a child whose parents are subject to murder charges. Second it is submitted there is a long term risk of identification given her distinctive name. Third if an adoptive care plan is pursued, the risks associated with publicity may deter prospective adopters from putting themselves forward. Fourth, life story work may be compromised if she is able to read press coverage about her sibling&#8217;s death in an uncontrolled manner, and fifth as she is one of very few twins in the area she lives in who has experienced the death of a sibling, this enhances the risk of identification.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in"><span style="font-size:14pt">In his oral submissions, Mr Goodwin focussed on the long term harm that would be suffered by G if her parents and deceased sibling are named by the media. She is too young now to be aware of any publicity, but as she grows older she is likely to have access to the internet, and if she is able to put her surname or the name of her sibling into a search engine, stories will appear about the case which could be emotionally harmful. If she is placed outside the family she will of course have life story work, but this could be impeded or disrupted by access to information in an uncontrolled way. Mr. Goodwin accepted that G would, at some stage, be likely to access media reports even if the reporting is anonymous (as she will have to be made aware of the background history) but that this could be better controlled during her minority if she was not able to search for information or to come across it accidentally if the names of her family are not reported. </span></p>

Adopters can be very wary of taking on a child who has suffered serious emotional trauma.</span></p>

There is a strong imperative to permit full, contemporaneous reporting of the criminal proceedings.

The same applies to the case of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes. Mr. Farmer further submitted that it was to the benefit of all children that the public are aware that the deaths of children are taken extremely seriously, and that such will be fully investigated and any perpetrators brought to justice. </span></p>

Nonetheless, it is one of a number of similar cases which come before the criminal (and family) courts every year. G is still a very young child, and thankfully immediate publicity surrounding the trial itself is not likely to have a direct impact upon her for the time being. Her surname is not particularly distinctive or unusual. Further she is in the care of the local authority and with foster parents rather than members of the family. The area is a culturally diverse one, and she does not stand out in the community. Her current placement is not intended to be permanent. I will be making a decision about her long term future within the next few months. </span></p>

It is not a question of if but when she reads reported details of the trial online, whether or not the names are in the public domain. I can see that there is a danger of her coming across material more easily (and therefore when she is younger) if she puts her family name (or that of her sibling) into a search engine, but it will be necessary for anyone who is caring for her to be alert to the use of the internet when she is of a tender age. The life story work that will be carried out with G (whatever her future placement) will have to prepare her for the time when she is able to look for published material by herself and it will have to be adapted to take account of this. </span></p>

This is an eventuality, however for many if not most prospective adopters or foster parents who put themselves forward to care for children. Many, if not most, of these children have suffered trauma and abuse. </span></p>

In </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:14pt">A v M</span><span style="font-size:14pt">, the defendant was charged with cruelty, having arranged for the insemination of her eldest adopted daughter when she was 16 with a view to bringing up the resultant child as her own. The other members of the family were girls aged 17 and 7, and the eldest daughter&#8217;s infant child. The judge found that there was a substantial risk of identification if the mother&#8217;s name was reported, given the community that the family were living in. The girls had a distinctive appearance in an area which was not ethnically diverse. The details of the case involved extremely intimate matters for the eldest girl, and the judge had expert evidence about her fragile emotional state. He also considered the position of all the other children and came to the conclusion that the probable consequences for the younger family members would be at best harmful and at worst disastrous. </span></p>

The name of a child who has allegedly been killed is an important part of any report in the media, as are the names of the defendants. Without any of those names, I agree with Mr. Bunting that the trial would become &#8216;disembodied&#8217;. An order prohibiting the identification of any of them would have a profound effect upon open justice in what is a significant trial and create a precedent for other cases like it. I do not think the situation can be compared to that if, for example, E had been the subject of an attempted murder and had lived.
