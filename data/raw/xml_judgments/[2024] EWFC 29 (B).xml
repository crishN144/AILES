By the time of the final hearing, however, there was professional agreement that Shaun was meeting Emma and Maisie&#8217;s needs to a satisfactory standard and could continue to do so provided that a robust plan of support was in place. </p>

She gave birth to Thomas in 2020 when she was still just 14 years old. Initially, she said that Thomas&#8217;s father was a boy at school. The local authority accepted this account, although the school said that they were not aware of a relationship. Support was put in place and Emma and Thomas continued to live with Shaun. Thomas was brought up alongside Maisie, who was believed at that stage to be his aunt. </p>

A parenting assessment was carried out and day to day support from the Family Nurse Partnership was put in place. However Emma struggled to provide a good enough standard of care and in December 2021 Thomas was placed on a child protection plan under the category of neglect. The local authority documentation records significant weight loss, failures by Emma to arrange appropriate medical treatment for Thomas, and a lack of emotional warmth in her interactions with him. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">It is not completely clear from the evidence when suspicions began to arise about Thomas&#8217;s paternity. In 2019 Janene had expressed concerns about the close nature of Shaun&#8217;s relationship with Emma, but I do not think at that stage that there was any real suggestion of sexual abuse. However in August 2021 a member of the wider family made a report to the local authority that Shaun and Emma had been seen naked in bed together. Emma was referred to a sexual abuse support service but denied that any sexual contact had taken place, and the police undertook an investigation but this concluded with a decision to take no further action. As part of the Public Law Outline pre-proceedings process, initiated in March 2022, both Emma and Shaun were asked to submit to DNA testing, but refused. </p>

An interim care order for Maisie was made at the same hearing and she was removed into foster care. She has remained in foster carer throughout these proceedings, in a separate placement from Thomas, although the children have had contact with each other arranged by their foster carers. </p>

Later in the proceedings, further enquiries established that it was possible that paternity could be determined through testing of both children and members of their wider family, including Janene, Becky and Robert. These persons consented to give samples and the testing was carried out by DNA Legal in December 2023. That testing established &#8211; to a probability of 99.9999% - that Shaun is Thomas&#8217;s biological father. The evidence of DNA Legal is not challenged. </p>

This evidence is unchallenged.

The MATTS assessment carried out in August 2023 records that her foster carer and school were reporting frequent tantrums, stealing (various items including medication belonging to another foster child), and the use of fabrication and fantasy as a coping mechanism. Since then it seems that there was some improvement in Maisie&#8217;s presentation but in recent months this has deteriorated again. That may have something to do with the ongoing uncertainty caused by these proceedings.

Maisie is nearly six, and is a child whose behaviour suggests that she would struggle to make a successful transition to a new placement with carers who are presently strangers to her. She will inevitably experience distress and probably resentment when she fully understands that she cannot return to her father. Those feelings will, in my judgment, be exacerbated if she is told that she has to move from her current placement. Maisie is already struggling with her own sense of self-worth. She is likely to experience a placement move as a rejection, and that will put any new adoptive placement under very significant strain. There is a real risk, in my judgment, that prospective adopters will simply not be able to manage her. All placement breakdowns are traumatic, but the breakdown of an adoptive placement is usually more so because of the huge investment that the child is encouraged to make in the placement from the outset. </p>

There is no obligation on foster carers to continue fostering indefinitely and they need only give 28 days&#8217; notice of an intention to cease doing so. A secondary disadvantage of long-term foster care is the ongoing statutory role of the local authority, which mandates regular social work visits, ongoing monitoring of the child&#8217;s health and education, and local authority involvement in some even quite minor decisions about things like school trips and sleepovers. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">On a fairly fine balance, I consider that the better outcome for Maisie is a placement in long-term foster care. The compelling features in the balancing exercise for Maisie are her age, and her high level of need. There is too much of a risk for Maisie that the local authority will not find an adoptive placement, or that if they do she will be unable to form successful relationships with her new carers. Either of those outcomes would be a huge blow for Maisie and would compound the feelings of rejection and worthlessness that she has already had to cope with. In that context, the disadvantages of a placement in long-term foster care are less significant. </p>

The paternity issue which might put off strangers is clearly not an obstacle for them, probably because they have had him living with them since he was quite young and the relationship is founded on the love they have for him, and he for them. </p>

For Thomas, the ongoing involvement of the local authority is less of a concern, and in fact a high level of involvement is likely to be necessary. His foster carers have recognised this and identified the ongoing need for support as the main factor which is preventing them, for the time being at least, from putting themselves forward as prospective adopters. </p>

For the reasons I have given, these relationships have the potential to cause him at least as much harm as good. He enjoys the time he spends with Emma but, through no fault of hers, her ongoing relationship with Shaun and the fact that she too denies that any sexual abuse has taken place means that her contact with Thomas in future will need to be very carefully monitored and boundaried. </p>

However this too will need to be carefully monitored because the evidence, including that of Ms Slaughter, indicates that they have a long way to go before they can provide Thomas with a safe, truthful and positive understanding of his background and the family relationships. I say this not to cause hurt, and I fully understand that the task facing them is one which most families would struggle with. But I am concerned about the way their case was put in closing submissions and it is important, in my view, that they are not given false hope. </p>

However it needs to be understood that from my perspective, at this hearing, the decision to refuse the application for a placement order has been driven by the quality of Thomas&#8217;s current placement, and his need to remain there, rather than (as is more usually the case) the relationships he has with his birth family members. It would be premature to go further than that at this stage, other than to make it clear that the fact that I have refused the local authority&#8217;s application for a placement order at this stage must not be misinterpreted as a barrier to any future adoption application by Thomas&#8217;s current carers. </p>

I consider this to be true only to a very limited extent. It is unlikely that Shaun would have the opportunity to perpetrate physical harm during the course of supervised contact. The opportunities for grooming behaviour, however, would be significant even in supervised contact, and would exist in some form if any means of communication between Shaun and either child is permitted. Grooming is, by its nature, subtle and difficult to spot. I am very mindful that throughout the previous care proceedings Shaun was at the very least grooming, if not sexually assaulting, Emma, and this was missed by all professionals who observed and assessed the family. </p>

The children must be supported to understand that what Shaun has done is deeply harmful and that it cannot be endorsed or tolerated. The need for that very clear message to be delivered is reinforced by the evidence in the Lucy Faithful assessments of the loose sexual boundaries within the family, and the passive way in which the adult family members have responded to the knowledge of Shaun&#8217;s abuse of Emma. </p>

I agree. Maisie may well in those circumstances wonder why the decision was taken that she should have ongoing contact with a father who had harmed her older sister, and she herself indirectly, in such a profound and significant way. Ongoing contact in any form would be likely, in my view, to dilute and undermine the very clear message which Maisie must receive that her father&#8217;s behaviours have been entirely unacceptable: a message that the widespread blurring of sexual boundaries within the family makes it crucial that Maisie should receive and understand. </p>
