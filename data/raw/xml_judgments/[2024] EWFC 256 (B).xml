The level of shouting was said to be very concerning. It was also said that there were loud sexual noises coming from the flat and that there was the smell of weed. The children were made subject to child in need plans. Referrals were subsequently received from the school that the mother had either been seen or heard screaming and using derogatory language towards S1 when out in the community. </span></p>

The cause of the burn was thought to be consistent with his explanation of playing with his mother&#8217;s hair straighteners when she had finished with them but they were still hot. The mother said the bruising had been caused by S2. The doctors said that was possible but unusual. The children were made subject to child protection plans. </span></p>

The mother originally said this was caused by S2 slipping down the stairs and bashing into a cabinet on the wall but the child protection medical concluded they had been caused by rough and tumble play between the siblings. In her final statement the mother admits that two bruises on the middle of S2&#8217;s lower back and bruise on her lower right arm were caused by her, the mother, during rough and tumble play. It is unclear whether this admission relates to the bruises sustained in March 2023. </span></p>

The mother was observed hitting S2 in the face twice, and I have watched the CCTV footage of that incident. The library staff were sufficiently concerned that they called the police and the children were placed under police protection. They went to stay with their uncle, PP. The mother accepted a caution for assault in relation to this incident, but that did not prevent her from going to stay with the children and their uncle. She and the children transitioned back home over the next month. </span></p>

There were also concerns that the children  were witnessing sexual behaviour, including sexual intercourse between the mother, and JR at that time. In July 2023 the Local Authority sourced alternative accommodation from the mother away from JR because they felt there was a threat of serious injury or even the death of the mother at his hands. The move did not take place at that time because the offer was subsequently withdrawn.  The same month the Local Authority commenced the PLO. </span></p>

She says she initially told the hospital she was there when the injury happened, but when they pressed for details because the injury did not match the explanation, she had to admit she was not there when it happened. She says in her statement that she regrets lying, and also that she admitted to social service she had lied.  In oral evidence the mother disputed her own account in the statement, saying that she did not lie to the hospital but they merely misunderstood her.  That does not explain why she would say twice in her statement that she had lied and it appears that the mother must either have been untruthful in her account in her statement or in her account to the court. </span></p>

The hospital concluded that they could not say how the injuries were sustained but said they were caused by substantial force and they were &#8220;extremely concerned about non-accidental injury&#8221;.  The mother and her brother PP were both arrested for grievous bodily harm against S2 and the children were placed again into police protection.  The mother was bailed to have no unsupervised contact with the children. The children were both placed in foster care and at the start of August 2023 the court made interim care orders to support the placements. The first foster carer quickly felt unable to cope with the children and gave notice. The children had to move, and they moved into the placement where they are now. They have, therefore, been with the same foster carers for over a year, and are now settled and stable, with contact offered regularly to the mother. </span></p>

Dr Nicola Cleghorn undertook a paediatric assessment of S2 and concluded that it was likely that some of the bruising was inflicted. Dr Rizwan Saleem conducted a psychiatric assessment of the mother and diagnosed her with complex PTSD arising from her own childhood traumas and said that that that was a significant factor in her parenting difficulties.  A parenting assessment of the mother was carried out by Rebecca Slater, an ISW. She did not recommend the return of the children to the mother. </span></p>

They have pleaded their threshold in relation to the bruising now in terms of neglect and failure to supervise. It has not, therefore, been necessary to conduct a separate fact-finding hearing. I have conducted this week a 5-day hearing to resolve the outstanding disputes in relation to threshold, and to make the welfare decisions for S1 and S2. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The mother attended each day of the hearing. Much of the evidence was difficult for her to hear, but she remained reasonably calm until the end of her own evidence. She did appear to be struggling at times, and I gave her permission to go in and out as she wanted to.  Even so, she was not able to remain calm during the Guardian&#8217;s evidence on day three, nor during the submissions of Counsel for the Local Authority on day four.  I remind myself that she has a diagnosis of complex PTSD and that certain matters appear to be triggering for her. Certainly on both of those occasions she was not able to control her outbursts which were prolonged, shouted at what was clearly the top volume she could manage, and which included violent hitting of a table and the issuing of threats to the Guardian and personal abuse to counsel for the Local Authority.  On the second occasion I had to call security. The mother had left the court room by the time they came, and I asked them to sit outside with her. She did not ask to come back in, but I made it clear that I would not let her back in for two reasons. The first was that it was not possible to conduct a court hearing with her uncontrolled shouting. Nobody else could make themselves heard whilst the outbursts were happening. And the second is that I considered it unfair and potentially abusive to allow the mother to sit and listen to matters which so clearly triggered profound trauma in her and caused such acute distress.  Much of what she shouted was about her own time in the care system and what it had done to her. The process of the hearing appeared to me to be re-traumatising for her, and it was very obviously not good for her. I make no criticism of her for not being able to control her behaviour, but it is relevant to the welfare issues and so I record it.  I record also that she remained represented throughout and her counsel took no issue with the way in which I dealt with the situation.   I am now handing down a written judgment in advance of any hearing in court, so that the mother does not have to sit and listen to a judgment being read out. She can read it if she wishes, or if that is too triggering, her counsel can summarise it for her. I hope, by this means, to alleviate the mother&#8217;s distress as much as possible. </span></p>

The allegation is that on the third of May 2023, while visiting Lewisham library, in addition to shouting and swearing at the children, the mother threatened S1 and S2  with physical violence.  She threatened &#8220;If you don&#8217;t shut up or be quiet you&#8217;ll get your face smashed&#8221; and &#8220;If you don&#8217;t sit down I&#8217;m going to smash your face in&#8221; and &#8220;If you&#8217;re going to continue to behave this way, you&#8217;re going to get sorted out&#8221;.  The mother accepts that she shouted at the children that day, but denies threatening to smash the children in the face. I have viewed the CCTV of the incident. There is no sound and it is not possible to lip read what anyone is saying. I have not seen the police evidence about this nor any direct record taken from the witness.

I accept that it may have been the mother&#8217;s fingers rather than her hand, but the mother&#8217;s description of it as a flick with no force behind it minimises the incident. It is clear from the footage that the blow really hurt S2. She clutches her face and holds it for some considerable time. There are no histrionics from her or indications that she is attention-seeking, but she appears to be crying, and she is obviously hurt. She clutches her face for quite some time before following her mother out in a subdued way. It was no mere flick of the finger that caused such pain. I find that the mother has not really accepted this incident as it truly happened, but has instead minimised it.

The mother at that stage said that she engaged with rough play with S2 and also that S1 had hit her with a toy. She later said that some of the bruises occurred when S2 fell down the stairs.  The child protection medical said &#8220;These injuries have been sustained because of ongoing rough and tumble play between the siblings. This is indicative of neglect as there is a lack of adult supervision when children are rough-and-tumble playing and inflicting injuries to each other.&#8221;  In this regard the allegation is very similar to the previous allegation. It boils down to an allegation that </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:12pt">the mother either caused the bruises to S2&#8217;s back in March 2023 by overly-rough play, or failed to protect her from falling down the stairs or from bruises from overly-rough play with her brother</span><span style="font-size:12pt">.

As late as 12 September 2024 when she signed her final statement she appeared still to be disputing that their sexualised behaviour was learnt at home, suggesting that they may have got it from television, Tik Tok, Facebook or elsewhere. However in her oral evidence the mother admitted that </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:12pt">both children had witnessed sexual activity between her and JR on at least one occasion and perhaps more.

The evidence for this comes from multiple sources. Dr Bowen-Wright records that in her meeting with the children they started using sexualised language almost immediately, using phrases such as &#8220;ouch, that hurts, oh baby, that&#8217;s nice baby&#8221;, saying that was what mummy says when her partner sticks his willy in mummy&#8217;s mooey.  They also acted out sexual moves, saying things such &#8220;JR sticks his dick into mummy&#8217;s pussy&#8221;. They said they had seen that, and when they did their mother had said &#8220;go to your room, put some music on&#8221;.  There is more in the same vein.

She could not bring herself to repeat the language. She and her husband lead a church, and she worried about the language the children would use when they went to church, particularly in Sunday school, and said that they had to keep a close eye on S1 and S2 for fear of what they may expose the other children to, and concern from other parents at the church. She said that once S1 had said to S2 &#8220;I am playing with my willy, you can touch your pussy&#8221;. Often such comments were followed by a lot of giggling and screaming. </span></p>

In contrast she told Ms Slater (ISW) that she did smoke cannabis daily but rarely smoked when she had the children, and that she used cocaine as a &#8220;one off&#8221; on a night out after the children were removed from her care.  Prior to this, in November 2022, the mother told the health visitor that she smoked cannabis and was a social drinker. In February 2023, the mother told the social worker undertaking s47 enquiries that she did not smoke cannabis daily.

They attempted to climb on the table, jumped on furniture and required frequent prompts to calm down and listen.  She said they seemed ambivalent, but also compelled to share their experiences.

For example, she noted that there were times when the mother became angry, and said that when the mother looked irritated, S1 became very placatory. She said that indicated a pattern, suggesting that he had had to placate the mother, and perhaps protect S2. She said they were unusual behaviours. It was her view that the children were likely to have been frightened over a long period of time by their mother&#8217;s behaviours.  Because of these features of the children&#8217;s experience it was her view that they now had a need for reparative care.  The Guardian in oral evidence agreed and said that was key. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">Before considering the mother&#8217;s ability to meet the children&#8217;s needs it is necessary to understand a little of the mother&#8217;s background. By her own account, her mother left the family home when she (the mother in this case) was two, and she was then brought up by her father. She says her father physically abused her, including kicking her down the stairs, headbutting her and not giving her anything to eat. She said she sometimes resorted to stealing food because she was so hungry. She would attend school in dirty clothing and with bruises, and as a result she was badly bullied both in primary and in secondary school. When she was 12, her father&#8217;s friend allegedly sexually assaulted her. When she told her father he accused her of lying. She packed her bags and ran away to her mother&#8217;s home.  She lived there for a while, but her mother could not cope with her and sent her into foster care. At 14 she was in a secure unit for adolescents. By that stage she was self-harming and regularly running away.  At 16 she was placed in an after-services children&#8217;s home. She became involved with someone who had schizophrenia and who &#8220;messed with her head&#8221;. During that time she says she was partying, drinking and raving.  At 17 she was placed in a YMCA hostel. She says she was given no advice about claiming benefits and after five months was evicted for non-payment of rent. She became homeless and ended up on the streets. Her father was living in a homeless shelter at the time and he let her stay with him for a while.  She managed to get herself a job and was able to have a home and an income, and it was at this time that she met the father of S1 and S2. He seemed a &#8220;nice guy&#8221; and for a while she was doing well. However, as will be obvious from the threshold findings I have made she went on to suffer domestic abuse at the hands of the children&#8217;s father, and possibly also at the hands of her next partner JR, though I have not made findings about that.  It is against this background that she has been diagnosed, perhaps unsurprisingly, with complex-PTSD. She is not to blame for her complex-PTSD, nor is she to blame for the way it makes her behave.  She has had a traumatic and damaging childhood, and she deserves the sympathy of the court and the professionals who work with her. Life is not fair, and it has certainly not been fair to her.</span></p>

Dr Bowen-Wright said it was clear from the reports of the children&#8217;s carers and the contact logs that the children have been significantly affected by their experiences of care while living with their mother, including exposure to violent and sexual behaviour. She said the contact logs also provided evidence of the mother&#8217;s limited capacity to cope with and remain sensitive to the children&#8217;s emotional and behavioural needs even during time-limited supervised contact. I have set out one such contact report above. Dr Bowen-Wright did not think the mother would be able to meet the children&#8217;s needs at present. She  considered that the mother would need to have made significant progress in her own healing journey to be in a position to meet the children&#8217;s needs, and she doubted the mother&#8217;s ability to provide the necessary reparative parenting whilst working through her own emotional and mental health difficulties. She did not think that the work the mother needed to do would be done within the children&#8217;s timescales. </span></p>

Her tirade against counsel for the Local Authority left that professional somewhat shaken and security had to be called. As the Guardian says, one must imagine what that would be like for the children.  It appeared to me that this was a trauma response on the part of the mother, but whatever it was, it was something she could not control.  Looking at the profile of the mother at present, it is abundantly clear that she does not match the profile of the type of carer these children now need, namely a carer who is mentally robust and with the emotional and mental capacity to deal with their challenging, chaotic, energetic, boisterous and often transgressive behaviour.  I come to the view that on this ground alone, the mother is not able to meet the children&#8217;s needs at present, and that is before I have even considered her ongoing drug use and whether she is able to avoid domestically abusive relationships.  </span></p>

She retained concerns about the mother&#8217;s insight and capacity for change.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">I agree that those are concerns. With one significant exception the mother did not show good insight into the issues in this case. She made concessions when they were about abuse from other people but made very few concessions as to her own role in the children&#8217;s difficulties. The significant exception was this: that when she was asked whether the children were well-cared for by their current carers she said &#8220;Yes, I know they are. I can see it in how they speak and present themselves. The social worker sent me a video of them on S1&#8217;s birthday. They are happy&#8221;. When she was asked whether they were doing better now than they were before (i.e. when they were in her care) she answered &#8220;yes&#8221;.  It can not have been easy for her to give those answers, but to my mind they show two things. They show that she loves her children; that is why she can see it when they are happy, even when she is in emotional pain herself. And it shows the beginning of true insight, that the children are at present better without her.  I give her enormous credit for that, and it provides hope for the future.  In the meantime, her overall levels of insight appear to me to be low, and that is not surprising given that the necessary therapy for her own trauma has not properly commenced. So again, she is not to blame, but her lack of insight does make it all the more unlikely that she will understand what needs to change, and be able to change it within the children&#8217;s timescales.  Those timescales are very short. The evidence is that their need for stability is urgent. It is now. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">As for parenting work, she has already completed some, and I give her credit for that. She has done her best to do what was needed to get the children back. She has tried hard. However I agree with the ISW Rebecca Slater that parenting work can not be successful until progress has been made through therapy.  The issues which prevent return currently are primarily emotional regulation issues, and they will not be addressed in parenting classes. Any advances that are made in parenting classes will be undermined by continuing emotional dysregulation.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">And so I come to the view that therapy and parenting work will not change things quickly enough to enable the children to return to their mother at this stage. I have also considered whether there is any support package that could be put in place to allow them to return, bearing in mind the mother&#8217;s proposal that there be a care order or a supervision order. It was the Guardian&#8217;s evidence that there was &#8220;not in the slightest&#8221; any such package that could protect the children in her care.    That seems to me to be right, given the nature of the risk is of harm arising from random outbursts. Support workers could not be there 24 hours a day to protect the children from them, and even if they were, the experience in the court shows that the presence of other adults does not prevent the dysregulation from mounting, bursting out and obliterating everything else. The presence of other adults would not protect the children from this. Nor have I seen any evidence that it is possible to predict when a trigger will come, and when the mother will become angry and frightening.  It could happen at any time, and so there is no programme of support which could reduce the risk by, for example, taking the children into respite care at certain time.   I sadly come to the conclusion that there is nothing that can be put in place at this stage to make the children&#8217;s placement with their mother safe. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">There are of course positives about placement with the mother. The children love her, S1 at least says he wants to go home, they would be in a placement which met their cultural and identity needs, and I have in mind that the best person to bring up a child is the natural parent provided the child&#8217;s moral or physical health is not in danger.  Moral health is perhaps now an outmoded concept, but in this case, it seems to me that the children&#8217;s emotional and physical health would be in danger. In my view the risks of this placement far outweigh the advantages. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">I have considered whether adoption might be a realistic option.  There are obvious advantages. It brings permanency and stability, it allows the children to be claimed by a new family and to have a sense of belonging to that family, it removes the requirement for statutory intervention in the form of LAC medicals, social work visits and the Local Authority having to consent to things like school trips and sleepovers.  There would, presumably, be some degree of ethnic and cultural matching.  However in this case there are significant drawbacks to adoption. There are all the usual worries, such as the fact that the children may question their own identities as they get older, particularly in their teenage years, and being an adopted person can be unsettling for a young person. But in this case there are further difficulties. Firstly, the children are 5 and 6 with a clear sense of their family and love for their mother. It would be very hard for them to transfer their sense of identity to another family &#8211; indeed it may not be possible. Then there is the issue of the children&#8217;s sexualised and otherwise challenging behaviour. With such a profile, they would be very difficult to place. And then there is the risk of placement breakdown. I remind myself that the first foster carer simply could not cope with the behaviour of these children and that placement broke down. I refer back to Dr Bowen-Wright saying she felt exhausted after an hour and a half with them, and how difficult it would be to be with them all the time. It will clearly take an exceptional carer to achieve that. An adoptive placement might never be found for these children, and even if it were, their behaviour and the challenges they present imply a significant risk of placement breakdown. In oral evidence the social worker told me this had been seriously considered by the IRO and others in a succession of meetings. In the end, no professional thought that adoption was right for these children.  In my view, the disadvantages do outweigh the advantages, and I can see why the professionals opted for long term foster care.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">Turning then to that option,  the advantages are that the children are already beginning to settle and thrive in their current foster placement.  S2 has said it is where she would like to remain and so it accords with her wishes and feelings. Their current foster carers have said they are committed to looking after these children until they are 18, and they have already weathered the storm of the first year, beginning when the children were perhaps at their most profoundly unsettled and difficult to manage. They have got through that, and are now seeing results with both children engaging better at school and being more settled generally.  If the children remain in long term foster care they will be safe, and they will receive the attuned care they need. The current carers did not at the start have experience of dealing with children who had experienced trauma, but they do now. They are being supported by Dr Peart, a psychologist, to help them tailor their responses to the children&#8217;s behaviours, and Dr Peart has told the Guardian that they have been engaging well. There is, then, a certain stability and security in this current placement which might be very hard to replicate elsewhere.  The current carers, as church leaders, appear to have the widespread family and friends support network which Dr Bowen-Wright and others thought was essential in order to give them respite, help and emotional support. They appear to have the robust mental health and emotional stability to be able to cope with the behaviour of these children.  A further advantage of long term foster care is that these carers have been approved, and the children could stay with them. They would not have to undergo a further move.   Finally long term foster care will give them the opportunity to have contact with their mother regularly, to maintain that relationship and, if the mother does the necessary therapy and starts to get better, there is no reason why that could not be increased in the future.  As the social worker said in her oral evidence, there could even be opportunities in the future for the mother to have the children back in her care. Although there is much to do before that could be considered, long term foster care leaves the door open to family reunification in the longer term.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">There are of course disadvantages to long term foster care. These children are still young, and will face 12 or 13 years in the care system if I make Care Orders.  During all that time they would be subject to LAC medicals and reviews, they would have a social worker visiting them which children, especially teenagers, find embarrassing and irritating. There is the social stigma of being a child in care. There is the possibility that the current placement, strong and stable though it is at present, could break down. If that happened the children would find themselves in a system which does not promise stability. There are many examples of children going from placement to placement and if that happened to these children, it would be significantly to their detriment.  The current placement is not ethnically matched. The children are white, their carers are black, so it is immediately obvious to observers that the children are not the biological children of the family. That could give rise to intrusive questions, and increases the risk of social stigma.  Staying in foster care is not what S1 wants. It does not accord with his wishes and feelings. </span></p>

There are no family members who are willing to have the children, the father in particular wanting no part of raising his children.  I do not have an explanation for that, and it is sad, but it is the fact. There is no indication that residential care should be considered in this case, or that it would be beneficial to the children. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">It is immediately obvious to me that there is only one option which will keep the children safe and that is long term foster care. There is therefore no choice as to the form of the orders I must make, and I therefore make orders for both children to be placed in the care of the Local Authority. I do so in the knowledge that there is a risk that the current carers will not feel able to keep the children in the long term. Whilst the impact of that, if it came to pass, would be severe, the chances of it coming to pass are in my assessment relatively low. I asked specific questions of the social worker about that, and was reassured that these carers really are committed, and to them it is part of their Christian faith to look after these children.    I also make this order in the light of my view that it is, in the end, the only realistic option. I have set out all the advantages and disadvantages of placement with the mother, but when I weigh them in the balance, it is clear she can not at present keep the children emotionally or possibly physically safe, and she is not currently a realistic option. Long Term Foster Care is therefore the only realistic option left. In those circumstances, I am grateful that the children are in such a positive placement, and appear to have found the exceptional carers who can provide them with what they need.  I am satisfied that the orders I am making are necessary and proportionate to the risk to these children. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The care plan is for the children to have contact with their mother six times per year. In oral evidence the social worker said this could be increased to take into account the children&#8217;s birthdays and the mother&#8217;s birthday. The mother would wish the contact to be far more frequent, asking for twice per week.  In considering this I must look at the contact record. Much of the contact has been warm and affectionate, and there is love and a clear bond between the mother and the children. It is important for the children that that is nurtured by the contact arrangements. However I have already set out an example of a contact which was not positive for the children, and other contact notes also record the mother raising her voice and being angry.  In addition, there are very many contacts recently which the mother has missed. Contact has been scheduled twice per week. Since April, even allowing for contacts which the foster carer cancelled or in relation to which there was confusion about an appointment, the mother cancelled about half of all contacts. It appears that she would let the contact centre know in the morning of the contact so the children were not brought to contact and left wondering what was happening. Nevertheless, that is a high level of missed contacts. </span></p>

She said she was emotional about not being with her children, and she would sometimes be crying. Staff told her not to cry in front of the children. She said she was forced to hold back tears in front of the children and not say certain things. It affected her mental health.  She said it was horrible that she had to say goodbye to them at the end of contact. She said that from the end of this week (the week of this hearing) she would probably never see them again so she questioned what the point was of going to contact.  She asked what sort of a relationship she would have if contact was four times a year. She said the Local Authority were breaking her with this sort of contact plan. She said she had done all she could in terms of parenting courses and counselling to get the children back but she was knocked back every time. &#8220;I&#8217;m so mentally broken&#8221;, she said. She said she used to be a happy mummy, playing and getting on a bouncy castle with them. That is how they think of her. She said that she could not see herself going to contact and letting the children see her so mentally broken. She wanted them to remember her as a happy mummy.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">All of this I understand. I do not blame the mother for not going to contact when she felt like that, although it might perhaps have been better to discuss it with the social worker and develop a more realistic contact schedule. Nevertheless, I must ask myself what the mother&#8217;s mental state is likely to be at contact now that I have made Care Orders.  I know she is expecting the orders to be made, but that will not make it any easier for her to cope with them. She is likely to be, if anything, even more &#8220;mentally broken&#8221; (to use her phrase) as she comes to terms with the loss.  It can not be right, in those circumstances, to put both her and the children through a twice weekly or even weekly torment of holding back tears and what in all likelihood would be repeated cancellations.  With this in mind, I consider the Local Authority&#8217;s proposal for six times per year is about right. As ever, it is only a starting point. Reviews will be essential. As the mother works through her issues, it is to be hoped that contact will be able to be increased. As I have already said, an eventual return of the children to their mother is not ruled out, although I do not want to give false hope about that. It would require all the therapy Dr Saleem recommended, and for that therapy to bear fruit in terms of the mother demonstrating consistently controlled emotions.  In order to give everyone the best chance of contact increasing, it is important to keep it at a level which allows the children to settle and feel secure, and which allows the mother time away from thinking about contact in order for her to think about her own needs. Six times a year seems about right for that. I do not have a strong view as to whether birthdays should be added: that could perhaps be the subject of a review after the first few contacts. </span></p>
