Unnecessary satellite litigation in such cases is a great evil.  Proper regard for the requirements of BIIR and a proper adherence to the essential philosophy underlying it, requires an appropriately summary process.  Too ready a willingness on the part of the court to go into the full merits of the case can only be destructive of the system enshrined in BIIR and lead to the protracted and costly battles over jurisdiction which it is the very purpose of BIIR to avoid. Submissions should be measured in hours and not days.  </span></p>

However, she attracted the attention of the relevant social work department there, so that when S was born on 11 September 2017 in RoI, the CFA commenced proceedings under the Child Care Act 1991 removing S into foster care. On 8 January 2018, the District Court granted an application for the transfer of jurisdiction from RoI to E&amp;W, a decision that was upheld in the Circuit Court by HH Judge Donnabhain on appeal on 6 February.  </span></p>

Thereafter Mr Justice Francis, having heard the parents&#8217; representations, made a final order on 12 April accepting jurisdiction. Subsequently, LA issued an application pursuant to part IV <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> that was transferred to the Family Court sitting in the area where the orders were made for S&#8217;s sister, but not before Francis J made an interim care order approving the plan for S to remain in the care of her foster carers in RoI pending final determination. Furthermore, Francis J declared that &#8220;the transfer of jurisdiction to this court under Article 15 is emphatically conclusive and this court now exercises jurisdiction as if by Art 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 2201/2003&#8221;.  </span></p>

The focus of the inquiry is different, but it is wrong to call it &#8220;attenuated&#8221;.  The factors relevant to deciding the question will vary according to the circumstances.  It is impossible to be definitive.  But there is no reason at all to exclude the impact upon the child&#8217;s welfare, in the short or the longer term, of the transfer itself.  What will be its immediate consequences?  What impact will it have on the choices available to the court deciding upon the eventual outcome?  This is not the same as deciding what outcome will be in the child&#8217;s best interests.  It is deciding whether it is in the child&#8217;s best interests for the court currently seised of the case to retain it or whether it is in the child&#8217;s best interests for the case to be transferred to the requested court. </span></p>

The parents&#8217; participation can fairly easily be achieved, even if they choose not to come to the country (as I have urged them to consider doing).  And questions of recognition and cooperation between two Member States (who so regularly deal with each other in cases such as this) are unlikely to cause more than the most transient of difficulty. </p>

If she is ultimately to remain in the care of FC1 and FC2, this factor will perhaps affect her rather less.  However, it is her parents&#8217; primary contention that she can and should return to their joint care.  If this can safely and appropriately happen, it should do so without further </p>

Within the currently constituted English care proceedings, all of the evidence and assessments are ready, the legal teams are assembled and court time is available in order to allow for a fair process by which final conclusions are achieved within a short period.  This strongly points towards its not being in S&#8217;s best interests to forego the certainty of this process in favour of the uncertainty of another. </p>
