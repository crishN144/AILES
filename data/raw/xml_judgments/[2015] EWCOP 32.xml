In Consultation Paper No 129 we suggested that this power to revoke should be linked to the question of whether the attorney was acting in the donor&#8217;s best interests. Respondents supported this proposal, with some seeking reassurance that the court should not be able to override a patient&#8217;s advance decisions about healthcare by revoking the appointment of an attorney. We have already recommended that an attorney under [an LPA] should be under a duty to act in the donor&#8217;s best interests. It is therefore logical to use this terminology, rather than that of &#8220;unsuitability&#8221;, in relation to the court&#8217;s power to displace an attorney. Express provision should also be made for revocation by the court where an attorney&#8217;s acts contravene the terms of the authority granted by the donor. We recommend that the court may, on behalf of a donor without capacity to do so, either direct that a purported [LPA] should not be registered or revoke [an LPA] where the donee or intended donee has behaved, is behaving or proposes to behave in a way that (1) contravenes or would contravene the authority granted in the [LPA] or (2) is not or would not be in the donor&#8217;s best interests.&#8221;</span></p>
