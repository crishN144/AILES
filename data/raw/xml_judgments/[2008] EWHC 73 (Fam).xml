Her father and the mother (M), the respondent to the appeal, were never married. F lives with his wife and their two much older children.

The parents expended about &#163;89,500 in costs to that point, and since then some &#163;38,000 in response to F's pursuit of these appeals. The total costs irrevocably lost to their joint economies would have met C's grown and growing needs for many years. </p>

The provisions of that order were for F to pay a lump sum of &#163;25,000 for C's benefit, that payment to be in full and final settlement of all claims for lump sum and property adjustment orders which M might make against F on C's behalf; and for F to make periodical payments to M for C at the rate of &#163;7,200 per annum 'until such time as she shall attain the age of 17 years or shall cease secondary education whichever shall be the later or further order'. The order included an index-linking provision to take effect annually commencing from 1st April 2001. The order also recited F's undertaking to the court 'to pay or cause to be paid ... periodical payments of an amount equivalent to the school fees (but not the extras on the school bill unless mutually agreed in writing in advance) &#8230;'. None ever were.</p>

	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">In the summer of 2003 F through his solicitors point-blank refused to enter into discussions for a maintenance increase initiated by M's then solicitors, and refused to produce his 2002 tax returns. So, as long ago as 4th November 2003, M issued an application for an increase in C's maintenance. F's application to reduce periodical payments was not issued until September 2004, after a number of intervening directions orders, and indeed after M's application had twice been listed for final hearing but then necessarily adjourned. The substantive hearing (involving consideration of over 1,000 pages of documentation and two days of oral evidence and submissions in February 2005) resulted in a written judgment handed down by DJ Green on 21st March 2005. In the course of its 17 closely-typed pages she reviewed the evidence and the parties' contentions and submissions, made findings of fact and gave reasons for her conclusions. She decided to dismiss both applications, and adjourned for hearing before her any application either parent might make in relation to costs. The index-linking provision had not (or not fully) been complied with, so that there were arrears of &#163;620 which she directed F to pay at the rate &#163;50 per month, in addition to continuing maintenance at the rate of &#163;600 per month in accordance with the original order. M has not sought to challenge the dismissal of her application.</p>

	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">Mystifyingly, no court order was then or ever has been drawn or perfected to reflect those decisions. The terms of such an order would have been simple enough. More to the point, however, neither party filed any appeal at that stage, nor indeed intimated to the other any intention to pursue an appeal. Instead, nearly two months later on 13th May 2005, F lodged an application for M to pay his costs arising out of the cross-applications. On the 9th January 2006 M issued her own application for costs. DJ Green at some stage in the intervening period had unfortunately become unwell and remained so for a substantial period. Eventually the costs applications came before DJ Million on 26th June 2006. By agreement, he swept up all existing interlocutory costs orders and ordered F to pay M a balance of &#163;17,250 (to include the costs of the costs application before him). F was to pay that sum by 24th July 2006. </p>

	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">At that hearing F's counsel made an oral application to extend if necessary his time for appealing against DJ Green's dismissal of his variation application. DJ Million dismissed that application at that stage without expressing any clear or concluded view whether time had indeed expired: indeed the question was raised without prior notice on behalf of F and could not be fully argued. </p>

	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">Finally on 7th July 2006 F filed and thereafter served Notice of Appeal to set aside both decisions, and for permission (if required) to appeal out of time against DJ Green's disposal of his variation application. His appeal was of course in time so far as it related to the 26th June 2006 hearing before District Judge Million. On 11th October 2006 Sumner J directed that the question whether the appeal in relation to events before DJ Green was out of time and required leave should be dealt with as a preliminary issue. He listed the appeal for two days of which he envisaged that the first was to be used for submissions, and the second for preparation and delivery of judgment. This luxury was not however to materialise, through no fault of the parties or their advocates, Mr Richard Todd for F and Mr Christopher Pocock (who was not instructed for the substantive hearing before DJ Green) for M. Their submissions occupied the whole of the time allocated. But they had only received the 80-page transcript of the entire hearing before DJ Million at the end of the previous week, so that the skeleton arguments were inevitably prepared and delivered last-minute. </p>

	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">I heard the appeal against this order on its merits, and will deal with that first. I also heard argument as to whether the time for F to bring this appeal had expired by July 2006, and whether (if so) time should be extended. I have reached a conclusion on those two questions and will give my reasons, but in the event they are of academic interest in view of the conclusion I have reached that the substantive appeal fails. I will then address the issues raised on F's appeal against the costs order made by DJ Million in June 2006.</p>

	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">DJ Green held that M's estimate of &#163;15,200 p.a. for C's own outgoings (excluding basic school fees) was a not unreasonable figure, and one that was little challenged by Mr Todd in cross-examination. She concluded that the amount payable by F under the 2001 order/agreement of &#163;13,368 p.a. (including indexation to that date and school fees but no extras) was 'not far from half' the total of &#163;25,840 which she calculated as C's reasonable needs in 2005 by adding the school fees (then &#163;5,640 annually) and a 'not unreasonable carer's allowance' of &#163;5,000 p.a. I note in passing that this proportion is less rather than more than 50 per cent if, as seems logical, the carer's allowance should in principle be paid in full (if affordable) by the non-resident parent. </p>

	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">Before the district judge F contended that his maintenance liabilities should be decreased by more than half to a figure of about &#163;3,750 p.a., broadly what might be appropriate as the Child Support Agency assessment for a parent earning &#163;31,200 p.a. Moreover he asked to be released from his liability to pay the basic school fees, an objective he openly persisted in up to the hearing before me, when it was abandoned.</p>

	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">The 2001 consent order had been agreed against the background that in a Form E filed on 14th March 2001 (five days before the consent order was made) he put his prospective partnership income for the trading year to 31st May 2001 at &#163;50,000, whereas when it came to his 2002 tax return covering that same period his own profits from that source were shown as &#163;190,985. His equal partner is his wife, who would have made the same profit. Admittedly, and as DJ Green noted, the partnership accounts for the succeeding years 2002-2004 show losses allocated to F's share totalling some &#163;312,000. The same accounts show his drawings as &#163;153,431 to the end of the first period, &#163;124,896 in the second, and &#163;278,246 in the third: a total of some &#163;556,000. His wife's drawings for the same three years totalled &#163;480,775. It seems that these drawings were used in part to purchase a property from the partnership itself, now owned and occupied by F and his family, and that the funds to do so derived from such of the &#163;4.4 million proceeds of sale of their previous house as were not at that stage used to repay borrowings. The sale of F's previous home and the purchase of his existing one from the partnership took place in November 2003. But that is not how he appears to have described his use of the drawings, at least in his affidavit evidence, and at least for the period ending May 2003. In his July 2004 Answers to Questionnaire H stated, specifically in relation to the &#163;496,000 partnership drawings made by him and his wife in the first two of these years, that 'the drawings are used for living expenses and to service debt'.</p>

	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">I believe that the essence of DJ Green's decision may be found in a number of passages from page 11 onwards of her judgment, from which I will quote extensively:</p>
	    </intro>
	    <subparagraph>
	      <content>
		<p class="ind" style="margin-left:1in">F though has been less than clear about his financial position and I am not surprised that M has been misled into thinking and suspecting that he is earning and/or has access to very substantial funds. This is not just because of his great reluctance to disclose necessary paperwork but also because of the way in which he has been shown to spend substantially in spite of pleading poverty. The way F presents to the outside world would lead anyone to believe that he is a man of substantial means. He and his family live between two homes each worth in excess of &#163;1 million. He and his wife drive top-of-the-range/market cars. His two older children go to private schools. He is a member of a world-renowned golf club. He is a member of the gym. He takes several nice holidays a year. He eats in top-class restaurants. He food shops at Harrods and he buys clothes from Armani. Had he been up front and clear with his financial disclosure from the very beginning M would have been able to see a fuller and clearer picture much earlier. He does not present like a man pegged at income of &#163;31,200 per annum as suggested in his affidavit. His golf club membership alone costs about &#163;2,750 per annum. The gym membership costs about &#163;1,100 per annum. In six months between July and December 2004 F has spent approximately &#163;3,500 on clothes and &#163;7,500 on flights and/or holidays. </p>

	    </subparagraph>
	    <subparagraph>
	      <content>
		<p class="ind" style="margin-left:1in">F suggested that his own outgoings are &#163;7,700 per month but then conceded in cross-examination that many of the figures included in the Schedule had to be halved to take account of his wife's income. F's disclosure of business accounts revealed that in 2004 he drew from the business approximately &#163;278,000 and his wife drew approximately &#163;262,000. Those sums are not income but drawings but they have enabled F to live a very good lifestyle indeed leading M to believe that he had substantial resources at his disposal enabling him therefore to pay much more than he has been paying. </p>

	    </subparagraph>
	    <subparagraph>
	      <content>
		<p class="ind" style="margin-left:1in">On closer inspection one finds that what on the surface looks like a very comfortable lifestyle indeed is actually not quite so because of heavy borrowing. </p>

	    <subparagraph>
	      <content>
		<p class="ind" style="margin-left:1in">For example, the &#163;1.1 million house F and his family live in in Windsor is subject to a mortgage of some &#163;825,000 so that the post-sale equity value of that property is only about &#163;240,000 of which F owns half, therefore &#163;120,000. That property is currently on the market for sale at &#163;1.15 million. It is the only property equity that F has. The other substantial house in which F and his family reside during the week in London is actually not F's property. It was purchased in 1993 and belongs to a trust that F had set up in 1989 years before he even met M and in order to benefit only his older children. That trust has lent approximately &#163;650,000 to F's business in connection with a property venture in Barbados to which I will return later. The loan has not yet been repaid by the business to the trust. To raise the money lent by the trust to the business the London property was mortgaged. It does remain the case that F, his wife and his older children live in the trust property rent-free during the week. They live in the Windsor property at the weekend. The older children go to school in London and so this arrangement suits F and his family very well. Accordingly, as I have said, his position on the surface looks very good but both properties are substantially mortgaged and the trust property does not belong to F in any event. If F and his family did not live in the London property it could be rented out and produce income for the trust. </p>

		<p class="ind" style="margin-left:1in">F also has substantial credit card debts, over &#163;80,000 of them, and he has a bank overdraft that more than wipes out any accounts in credit. He has few other assets, about &#163;1,000 of shares and &#163;4,000 of stocks. </p>

		<p class="ind" style="margin-left:1in">On the other hand whilst apparently so strapped for income and/or other resources F has assisted his sister by loaning her &#163;10,400 over a period of 10 months in 2004 which he says she is now paying back in dribs and drabs. Also he has shown to the court and the outside world generally that he obviously has great confidence in his business and income potential for the future because during the period of these business losses he has continued to live a very nice lifestyle indeed such as I have already described.</p>

Certainly, on any view, F contributed very significantly to the delay in the case being heard by the piecemeal fashion in which he provided disclosure, often delayed and some of it only shortly before the relevant hearings. If the district judge was in error in making quite so positive an assertion about F's responsibility for the aborted hearings, that did not in my view infect her assessment of the case overall on the evidence by then before her. </p>

First, I am of the view that the appropriate starting point for a child maintenance award should almost invariably be the figure thrown up by the new child support rules. The Government's express policy in making awards of child maintenance susceptible to abrogation and replacement by a maintenance calculation by the CSA (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48/section/4/10" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 4(10)</ref>(aa) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48" uk:canonical="1991 c. 48" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Support Act 1991</ref>) was that child maintenance orders should be negotiated: </p>

Quite apart from the obvious acrimony that this would engender, a calculation in a different amount to the figure originally negotiated or awarded may cast doubt on the fairness of the original ancillary relief settlement between the parties, leading to further litigation. These spectres should be avoided at all costs. </p>

His order (converted from Australian dollars at the then prevailing exchange rate) was for a total of &#163;29,600 plus the whole of the children's school fees and extras and the whole of their travel costs in connection with contact. I have no doubt that broad regard is frequently paid by courts to child support rates, and that they can be a useful rule of thumb in many routine cases where courts are allowed to fix child maintenance. This was never a routine case, nor had notional CSA assessments played much part (I venture to guess) in the negotiations which led to the 2001 order.</p>

The point has no substance. As stated, she found that F (and his wife) were maintaining their lifestyle from their capital and borrowings, and from capital and income used by them held by a trust for their children. There is no reason in principle why maintenance, which cannot be paid out of income, should not be paid at all (or only at a much reduced rate) for one child when the payer continues to maintain a high rate of expenditure on himself and his family. Maintenance paid from accumulated or borrowed money (both resources of a capital nature) is maintenance in the form of income in the hands of the mother for C, and not a lump sum or other capital resource. </p>

The individual points relied upon do not seem to me to affect the central issue in the case, the extent of F's ability to maintain his daughter towards what the district judge found to be a reasonable level for her needs. That M may have understated her profit on some one-off property transaction with a third party partner with whom she was in continuing dispute over the extent of the profit seems not to me to be of direct relevance to that issue. That M had apparently understated some state benefits, which she was likely in whole, or in part to be obliged to repay was regrettable, but fell into the same band of relevance. So does the fact that she had not disclosed any (if indeed there were any) Premium Bond wins which (as Mr Todd fairly conceded) could vary between nothing and &#163;1,000 per month (but I suspect at or nearer the bottom of the bracket rather than reliably towards the top). Complaint has also been made that at the time of the original order she had failed to clarify her position about redundancy money she at that stage expected to receive but (as the district judge accepted) in the event did not. She had understated the amount she owed on successive mortgages of her home. Apparently she did not answer some questions posed in the course of her evidence to DJ Green, and was recalled to supplement or to correct the first round of that evidence. </p>

I therefore, without seeking to condone deficiencies in M's presentation and evidence, do not see how they could or should impact on F's argument that the maintenance burden on him should be reduced, which is of course the objective of his appeal against the refusal of his application for such a reduction. </p>

As I have said, Mr Todd raised the question, apparently out of the blue, on appeal towards the end of the costs hearing before DJ Million, and sought by way of oral application to persuade him to extend the time for appeal if indeed that was required. The point was not fully argued, Mr Pocock making it clear that he had not anticipated such an application. The district judge considered whether or not he should extend time and initially said that he would not deal with the matter. Nevertheless (and without reaching a conclusion on the initial question whether time had indeed began to run from the date of DJ Green's judgment) he purported to hold (and his written order records) that 'on F's oral application to extend if necessary the time in which to appeal the dismissal of his variation application dated 13th February 2004, that application is dismissed'. However, rule 4.22(3)(c) provides that the power to permit 'such other [than 14 days] time as that court or judge made direct' is specifically given to 'the court to which, or judge to whom, the appeal is to be brought.' Furthermore, the application was procedurally inept as it should have been made on notice, and at least preferably (if not indeed necessarily) supported by affidavit. So I do not regard DJ Million's refusal of leave in these circumstances as effective, and consider the question afresh.</p>

He held (at paragraph 18 of his judgment) that: </p>

		<p class="ind" style="margin-left:1in">Even if the case at that stage [4th October 2004] had been dealt with by the dismissal of each party's application to vary the financial order, there would, as it seems to me, be a strong case for M to have her costs, or at least much of her costs up until that date because it had taken her that long and that effort to obtain the necessary information to decide whether or not pursuing a variation was justified.... At that point F has conducted litigation both by pursuing his own application and resisting M's application in a way which has necessitated costs on M's side. </p>

	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">No-one of course can know what views DJ Berry may have expressed during the course of the financial dispute resolution hearing. But it is clear that in the week preceding that hearing a substantial quantity of documents had been disclosed by F. DJ Green in her judgment subsequently referred to conclusions she drew from his credit card statements, and so it is worth mentioning, by way of example of F's unsatisfactory disclosure record, that when on 20th July 2004 Answers were produced on his behalf to a questionnaire dated 5th March 2004 requesting, amongst other things, credit card statements for a three-month period, his response was to decline production, apparently upon the basis that 'his only sources of income are as set out in his tax returns and the manner in which he spends his income will not assist the determination of this application.' He was then ordered to produce credit card statements but when he first did so he supplied only monthly summaries in relation to 10 credit and store cards but without any transaction details. This defect was not remedied until a week before the hearing before District Judge Berry when full statements (including those relating to an eleventh account) were supplied. There is therefore ample justification for the conclusion that until that point, at earliest, there were significant defects in F's disclosure. DJ Million cannot be criticised for taking the view that until then M was at a disadvantage in any negotiations for settlement. </p>

He took that as 'a reasonable point at which both parties should review or ought to have reviewed their financial position in relation to the applications, the chances of success or failure and the cost consequences of pursuing their claims and at that date, or fairly shortly afterwards, to consider the result of any remarks and discussions that there were during the FDR style hearing.' He took the view that M should recover the costs of the application until 28 days after 4th October 2004, to give a reasonable period to consider the position. It was those costs for that period which he fixed at &#163;15,000, subject to the set-off for costs awarded against M during that period.</p>

As DJ Million said at the outset of his main judgment 'the question became one primarily of affordability' of M's budget. He had appreciated, as DJ Green had found, that the obligation was upon F to demonstrate clearly and from the outset that the aura of wealth within which he lived was based upon declining capital and increasing debt so that (on his case) he was a man on or approaching his uppers. </p>

First requested in August 2002, the tax return was supplied only on 12 February 2004, 2 days after F's first Calderbank letter (referred to below) and only 4 working days before the first of the abortive 'final' hearings.</p>

I take the same view as I have already expressed: that if indeed this was an error or over-simplification on the part of DJ Green which misled DJ Million, then it is an error which does not in any way detract from the effect of the other findings made by DJ Green which are recited above. The fact is that there was material upon which DJ Million was entitled to conclude that at least until the October 2004 hearing F's stated position remained subject to legitimate scrutiny in order to investigate whether his account of his dire circumstances was basically accurate notwithstanding his continuing affluent lifestyle. </p>

I will deal with that decision after looking at the basis upon which Mr Todd argued F's case against the cost orders. He did so on three principal grounds. They were that M's application for an increase had failed; that she had rejected his proposals in Calderbank letters that each should withdraw their variation application with no order as to costs; and that M was guilty of serious litigation misconduct which should be reflected in costs orders against her. </p>

The point is, as I have already stated, that an increase would have been appropriate, if affordable by F, on the basis of the increased expense attributable to the C's upbringing. In my view DJ Million was right to reject any suggestion that as M had failed in her application he should start from the position that an appropriate costs order would be to leave each to bear their own, again for the already stated reason that F's dilatory and unsatisfactory disclosure added very considerably to the cost on both sides and prolonged the investigation before the watershed selected by DJ Million could be reached. </p>

The first two were written on 10th February 2004 and 20th July 2004. Each proposed that the cross-applications should both be dismissed with no order as to costs. F had not by either of those dates, on DJ Green's findings, made sufficient and sufficiently clear disclosure to enable M and her then advisers properly to evaluate them. I have already described the circumstances at the time of the first letter. As for the July letter, it was written on the same day that F delivered, four and a half months after the Request, deficient Answers to questionnaire. </p>

The reality is that both thereafter continued to pursue their applications with unrestrained vigour. Neither was prepared to desist unless the other did. Logically, as was canvassed in argument and reflected in paragraphs 22 and 23 of DJ Million's judgment, each might fairly have obtained a costs order against the other arising from the failure of that other's application. That would have produced the broad result (on DJ Million's view of the matter) that neither would have been much better off from the exercise.</p>

	    <subparagraph>
	      <content>
		<p class="ind" style="margin-left:1in">As it seems to me, I cannot ignore the fact that M's application was ultimately not successful. Nor can I ignore the fact that F 's application was pursued in reality, in other words in open litigation, and was also not successful. It seems to me that what that means for costs in the light of the comments of [DJ Green] is that both parties during the final hearing were unsatisfactory and criticism can come from them. Just as F can be criticised for his failings on the financial side of presenting a case by way of his living standards and spending money which did not really represent his true position and misleading the mother, so the mother was not truthful entirely or frank in her disclosure, it seems even in respect of answers that she gave during that final hearing. If parties conduct litigation in that way they have only got themselves to blame if the costs of it are significantly higher than they would otherwise have been. </p>

Neither were successful at that point or each was equally successful and unsuccessful. Both parties were pursuing their respective claims for an increase and decrease. That led, no doubt so far as F's application was concerned, to cross-examining M to a greater extent than would otherwise have been the case if it was not his real case; and M's application for an increase, even in the light of the disclosure that she had, obviously meant that the hearing of that application was longer that it would otherwise have been. So I see no difficulty and, indeed, it seems consistent with the result, that the costs of the final hearing itself should not attract any costs order other than that there be no order for costs for that part.</p>

A good deal of costs between that period from the beginning of November to the beginning of February would have been the parties gearing up for final hearing and would be progressively intimately connected with that final hearing. In those circumstances my general approach to the final hearing would, I consider, fairly apply to that period also, which is that there should be no order for costs from the beginning of November or thereabouts until the end of the final hearing and the judgment in March.</p>

	    <subparagraph>
	      <content>
		<p class="ind" style="margin-left:1in">What I do is I take into account for that period in view of the conduct of the litigation up until that time that the offer in September, which on the findings was consistent with the outcome in February, does not raise such a strong presumption in relation to costs as is contended for by F. I take into account that applications under Schedule 1 are for the benefit of the child and in my judgment it would cause relative hardship on M's side to make her responsible for the costs between the beginning of November and the final hearing when during that period, notwithstanding the Calderbank offer, F was also pursuing his own case as I have already indicated that he did, including pursuing it fully during the final hearing for a reduction. Clearly on the passage that I have already referred to of DJ Green in which she referred to F's application as being unfair and abhorrent there is, or could be said to be, criticism of the pursuit of that case even in the light of the disclosure that there was. If F had abandoned his own application for a variation downwards in October or early November he would, as it seems to me, be potentially in a stronger position in relation to the costs thereafter than he is now. In any event, the effect of making M responsible for the costs during that period in the light of all the circumstances, including F's own pursuit of his application to reduce, would be to create hardship in her household when, on the district judge's findings, she is receiving less help than would otherwise be justified. </p>

On a financial application legitimately brought and pursued (as is indicated by DJ Green's judgment) which is for the benefit of the parties' child, I cannot see how in the exercise of the discretion as to costs hardship would be an improper consideration. If Mr Todd's complaint is really against the district judge's use of the adjective 'relative' hardship, I understand DJ Million to mean that the effect of a costs order in F's favour for this period would have relatively greater effect upon M's economy than making no order would have upon F's. That is a conclusion which appears to me to be reasonable, and one which was fully justified in the circumstances of the parties as found by DJ Green. </p>
