	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A and B met in 2017 and decided to have a child together, even though they were not in an intimate relationship. They both shared a wish to co-parent. The initial plan was for the child to be carried by A, following IVF treatment using both their gametes. Two rounds of IVF treatment proved that not to be possible and they went to the US in 2019, selected an egg donor and embryos were created using B&#8217;s gametes and the donor eggs. Eight embryos were created and it was agreed that one would be transferred to A. The letter to the clinic in the US dated 27 July 2019 from B makes clear the embryos are under B&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;legal care&#8217;</span> and it gives his consent to the transfer of one of the embryos to A with them being parents to any resulting child, making it clear the remaining embryos remain outside the scope of the letter. The letter makes clear B sought legal advice. B sent a draft of this letter to A before it was sent to the clinic. In her written evidence A states she did not have legal advice at that time, although does refer to legal advice when the parties were engaged with a clinic in this jurisdiction at an earlier stage.</p>

The embryo transfer to A was successful and she gave birth to X, who is now 3 years. A and B are X&#8217;s parents. X lives between their respective households, each 14 days spending 5 days with B and 9 days with A.</p>

By April 2021 the parties&#8217; communication had completely broken down, B wrote to A accepting that they would have no further children together. He wrote  <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;I am also heartbroken that the opportunities we may have had to talk about having a second child together have been lost. It was more than a hope of mine that we could work out our issues through talking and maybe see if that was possible. I understand by the way you reacted when I mentioned the subject that you have ruled out having a second child with me and I have come to accept this.&#8217;</span> According to B it was after that he began the process of conceiving a second child as a sole parent. </p>

[A] made it clear to me that she did not want to and on 15 April 2021 I wrote to [A] and said that I was very sad but I accepted this. She never replied. Since then, I have given serious consideration about having another child, and especially the impact on [A] of having a sibling. After much thought, I decided some time ago that I would like to try to do so. If and when this hope becomes a likelihood, I will of course let [A] know, and we will need to discuss and agree in due course what we say to [A] about any future sibling&#8230;&#8217;</span></p>

Whilst acknowledging that, she makes the following points. First, A had written to B in August 2020 acknowledging that the embryos were his and that he planned to have a second child with someone else. The letter set out her position if she and B were to have a second child together. Second, the parties continued their discussions and in January 2021 it appears those discussions came to an end. B wrote to A on 15 April 2021 stating <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;I understand from the way you reacted when I mentioned the subject that you have ruled out having a second child with me and I have come to accept this&#8217;.</span> Third, when the ISW discussed the forthcoming child with A she focussed on the need to seek expert advice as to how to explain the arrival of the new baby to X. Fourth, on 1 February 2023 A wrote via her solicitors noting that A and B had been able to discuss the expected arrival of X&#8217;s baby brother and refers to B being the new baby&#8217;s only parent.</p>

Whilst A&#8217;s focus more recently has been playing a role as a parent in Y&#8217;s life it is clear from the chronology, she submits, that B did not enter into the surrogacy arrangement jointly with Mr and Mrs G and A. A does not have a genetic link to Y. Whilst it is recognised A and B were not in an intimate relationship she submits it is difficult to see how they could be held to be in an enduring family relationship when they are not living as partners, did not enter into the surrogacy together and their link as a family is a child born as a result of their previous relationship. Ms Stanley submits that to include the circumstances in this case within the definition would impact on the ability for family lives to change and develop on separation and second families to be formed. It would instead leave the prospect of a substantial role for previous partners to play in subsequent second families on the basis of a sibling relationship alone and provide the potential for individuals to be classed as parents in relation to children who they did not have any role in the decision to embark on a further pregnancy or surrogacy arrangement.</p>

A maintains her application for shared care, which Mr Stanley submits seeks to circumnavigate any decision relating to the parental order application. Ms Stanley submits A&#8217;s connection with Y are all connected through X&#8217;s role as Y&#8217;s brother other than conception. She submits the distinction between X and Y&#8217;s conceptions is that X was carried by A and X&#8217;s embryo implantation was in the knowledge that A would be X&#8217;s mother. This supports what Ms Stanley submits is the significance in the statutory regime that the relevant point for considering parenthood is the time of the embryo transfer, not when the embryo was created, as A seeks to do. As regards any risks of the application disrupting the child&#8217;s life to an extent that he would be harmed by it, Ms Stanley considers that is present in this case due to the delay in determining any issues if leave was given, the impact on the relationship between A and B as X&#8217;s parents and the Children&#8217;s Guardian&#8217;s view of the impact of the proceedings to date on B, who is responsible for caring for such a young child. Ms Stanley submits the prospects of success of a shared care arrangement is remote and the need for a child arrangement order for A to spend time with Y is questioned in circumstances where X and Y already spend time together. Ms Stanley submits these issues are best considered through mediation and/or family therapy.</p>

Following A becoming aware of  Y&#8217;s conception in August 2022 A acted in a way, when she had the benefit of legal advice, that she did not consider herself to be y&#8217;s parent, including in February 2023 when, with the benefit of legal advice, she recognised that B was Y&#8217;s sole parent. In his submissions, Mr Harrison asserts the Article 8 position as follows, A and B <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;jointly chose to create a family together and elected to become co-parenting partners for life. That will remain the reality for the rest of the parties&#8217; lives and the decision reached in that regard, prior to the creation of both [X] and [Y&#8217;s] embryos, cannot be erased so as to mean that they are not engaged in an enduring family relationship&#8217;. </span> As Ms Fottrell submits, even taking A&#8217;s case at its highest, it is insufficient evidence of <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;genuine personal ties&#8217;</span> with Y in circumstances where as long ago as August 2020 A recognised B could use the embryos to conceive another child, alone or with a partner, and since being made aware of T&#8217;s conception in August 2022 until 13 March 2023 at no stage asserted she had the status of parent in relation to Y.</p>

I agree with Ms Segal that from Y&#8217;s perspective and his identity needs there should be clarity now of the very considerable hurdles A faces in proceeding with her parental order application, irrespective of the issue of consent. The welfare issues she outlined, as summarised in paragraph 69 above, are both powerful and compelling.</p>

Whilst A does in that statement acknowledge the range of powers the court has in relation to child arrangement orders she maintains her primary position regarding the order she seeks, setting it out in some detail, as summarised by Ms Segal in paragraph 15 of her Addendum Position Statement, underpinning A&#8217;s wish to be treated as a mother for Y, to be one of Y&#8217;s parents, as she is for X, and allow her to make decisions regarding Y&#8217;s upbringing with B. A&#8217;s connection with Y is through being a parent with B to Y&#8217;s sibling, X. Her direct connection with Y is that the embryos were created at a time when A and B were planning to be co-parents, which they were in relation to X but A was not part of the arrangements regarding Y&#8217;s conception in the arrangement between B and Mr and Mrs G that resulted in Y&#8217;s birth. If A is given leave it will inevitably mean there is further delay which, in my judgment, does carry with it the risk of harm indirectly to Y in circumstances where there is evidence from the Children&#8217;s Guardian of the impact on B as Y&#8217;s full time carer, of the continuing litigation regarding Y. Against that it could be said that any delay would be manageable due to the known timeframe in the X proceedings which, if leave was given, the application regarding Y could be part of and B is already a party in those proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having stood back, viewed the wide canvas and considered A&#8217;s application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/10/9" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s10(9)</ref> I have reached the conclusion that leave should not be given. In reality A seeks to maintain her position to be treated as Y&#8217;s mother for the reasons she sets out her statement in support. There is limited, if any, recognition by her of the different circumstances and consequences of the conception of X and Y. It is, in my judgment, a wholly unrealistic application that fails to have any regard for the reality of the position, any recognition of the difference in the circumstances of conception between the two children and their different legal status as between A and B. There is no issue that A is X&#8217;s parent and that X is a full genetic sibling to A. Bearing in mind the circumstances of the litigation to date, there is a real risk that if leave is given, even if it sought to limit the issues, there will be disruption to Y&#8217;s life through the continued pressure and impact on B as Y&#8217;s main carer as outlined by the Children&#8217;s Guardian, in circumstances where there remains, despite the position being made clear on behalf of B since 23 March 2023, Mr and Mrs G in their Position Statements and the Children&#8217;s Guardian in their Position Statement, little or no understanding by A of the different legal structures that exist for each X and Y.</p>
