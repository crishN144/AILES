This property and its successors were very largely, if not entirely, purchased and refurbished with the assistance of loans from the wife&#8217;s family trusts.  The loans were interest free and when the properties were sold, the proceeds were, in general, used to discharge loans that had been made for their purchase and refurbishment and the cycle was repeated.  K Road was bought by the trust for just over &#163;1.25 million and was the family home from 2000 until 2007.  It was a comfortable London terraced property. </p>

As a result, K Road was rented out until it was sold in 2012 for &#163;3.1 million.   </p>

The purchase was once again funded by trust monies.  The parties continued living at O Cottage while their new home was given a substantial renovation.  It went massively over budget to the extent that the trustees, who were funding the works, became seriously anxious and both threatened to stop providing further funds and insisted that the terms of the loan included a term that it was repayable on demand. </p>

That offer was for &#163;7.5 million.  Even with that offer, the wife had, by November 2019, changed her mind and decided that the property should not be sold.

The A Trust has assets to the value of around &#163;1.9 million, but that includes a loan secured on the matrimonial home of rather over &#163;1.2 million and &#163;220,000 loaned to the wife personally, so that its cash assets are now only something in excess of &#163;400,000.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I think Ms Clarke is right when she says that a step down in expenditure should be anticipated when the husband retires, not just because he will be retiring, but because the children will then be aged between 28 and 37 and their need for financial support from him ought to be a great deal less. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I have alighted on the figure of &#163;70,000 per annum after retirement.  That is the equivalent of a net income from all sources gross of about &#163;110,000 a year.  The husband&#8217;s net income will approximate to the wife&#8217;s income from the DV Trust and although she will probably receive additional sums on top, there is that element of comparability. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Those figures fed into a Capitalise programme produce a required capital sum of &#163;1.238 million from which it is agreed I should deduct the husband&#8217;s pension fund of &#163;320,000.  I deduct also the capital in his business at a discounted figure of &#163;118,000 net, that is ignoring the DLA, which rounding up means that there is an additional income need of &#163;800,000.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Thus, there will be a total award of &#163;2.85 million.  I have taken the view that it would not be right to work on the assumption that the husband will or should trade down in his housing, although that, of course, is his option, but it would be an expensive way of bolstering retirement income. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I have played around with these figures and in particular wondered whether I have cut the husband&#8217;s housing fund too fine or whether I have been overgenerous with his income fund, but I have decided that this award strikes the right balance. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I treat the husband&#8217;s pension fund as cash, as the parties have invited me to do.  He will end up with a total figure of &#163;3.27 million out of the &#163;4.55 million of the parties&#8217; personal assets after repayment of the joint and the wife&#8217;s trust loans.  That is something over 70 per cent, and if the trust loans are ignored, it still comes to over 60 per cent.  Those figures, of course, include the wife&#8217;s non-matrimonial jewellery.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I recognise that percentages are of relatively little value in a case of this nature, but I have done the cross-check as a further way of satisfying myself that there is no unfairness.  I am satisfied that it is an award the wife can afford.  If the trustees will not help her out over and above &#163;2.2 million, then she will have to make her own decisions as to what she sells. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Other matters of these parties&#8217; division of and separation of their assets are agreed.  The husband will transfer H House to the wife, and she will indemnify the husband against any liability under the loans made by the trust to him and she will transfer to the husband her small shareholding which she has in his business.  There will be a clean break between the parties and there will be no maintenance order in respect of the children, the parties having agreed that they will share the extras on the school bill.   </p>
