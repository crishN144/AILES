The court was informed at a hearing on 20 October 2020 that the basis of her claim was that &#8220;she and the children are in danger from the father, and the father has threatened to remove the children from her care&#8221;. Although the documents from the asylum application have not been disclosed by M, and therefore are not before me, that brief description suggests that M has relied on similar facts and matters for her Article 13(b) defence as in her asylum claim. The children were dependent persons for the purpose of the claim; they did not make separate, free-standing claims.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">F is 51 years old; M is 33. They are both Kazakhstanis, but of Chechen ethnicity. F is a construction manager by occupation. They were married in an Islamic ceremony on 6 June 2012, which is not recognised as a legal civil marriage in Kazakhstan. Under Islamic law, F was entitled to, and did, marry two other women in Islamic ceremonies.  He has two other children, a 24-year-old son by a woman who was not his wife, and a 14-year-old son by one of his wives. M and F lived in Kazakhstan together, where the children were born. There is a dispute between them, which I do not have to resolve, as to precisely how much time they spent living together. What is agreed is that their relationship continued until mid-2018 (approximately 6 years after marriage) when they separated shortly after G&#8217;s birth. Thereafter, the children lived with M as their primary carer although E was with F for 2 months until August 2018 in disputed circumstances. The parties disagree as to how much time the children spent with F after separation; he says he saw them 3-4 times per month, whereas M says it was no more than 6 occasions in total between mid-2018 and September 2019 as well as a fleeting meeting on 19 December 2019, the last time F saw the children.   </p>

There is a particular risk that an expansive application of article 13b, which focuses on the situation of the child, could lead to this result.

It is for them to produce evidence to substantiate one of the exceptions. There is nothing to indicate that the standard of proof is other than the ordinary balance of probabilities. But in evaluating the evidence the court will of course be mindful of the limitations involved in the summary nature of the Hague Convention process. It will rarely be appropriate to hear oral evidence of the allegations made under article 13b and so neither those allegations nor their rebuttal are usually tested in cross-examination. </span></p>

It is not enough, as it is in other contexts such as asylum, that the risk be "real". It must have reached such a level of seriousness as to be characterised as "grave". Although "grave" characterises the risk rather than the harm, there is in ordinary language a link between the two. Thus a relatively low risk of death or really serious injury might properly be qualified as "grave" while a higher level of risk might be required for other less serious forms of harm. 34. Third, the words "physical or psychological harm" are not qualified. However, they do gain colour from the alternative "or otherwise" placed "in an intolerable situation" (emphasis supplied). As was said in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt">Re D</span><span style="font-size:10pt">, at para 52, "'Intolerable' is a strong word, but when applied to a child must mean 'a situation which this particular child in these particular circumstances should not be expected to tolerate'". Those words were carefully considered and can be applied just as sensibly to physical or psychological harm as to any other situation. Every child has to put up with a certain amount of rough and tumble, discomfort and distress. It is part of growing up. But there are some things which it is not reasonable to expect a child to tolerate. Among these, of course, are physical or psychological abuse or neglect of the child herself. Among these also, we now understand, can be exposure to the harmful effects of seeing and hearing the physical or psychological abuse of her own parent. Mr Turner accepts that, if there is such a risk, the source of it is irrelevant: e.g., where a mother's subjective perception of events leads to a mental illness which could have intolerable consequences for the child. </span></p>

As has often been pointed out, this is not necessarily the same as being returned to the person, institution or other body who has requested her return, although of course it may be so if that person has the right so to demand. More importantly, the situation which the child will face on return depends crucially on the protective measures which can be put in place to secure that the child will not be called upon to face an intolerable situation when she gets home.  </span></p>

Mr Turner submits that there is a sensible and pragmatic solution. Where allegations of domestic abuse are made, the court should first ask whether, if they are true, there would be a grave risk that the child would be exposed to physical or psychological harm or otherwise placed in an intolerable situation. If so, the court must then ask how the child can be protected against the risk. The appropriate protective measures and their efficacy will obviously vary from case to case and from country to country. This is where arrangements for international co-operation between liaison judges are so helpful. Without such protective measures, the court may have no option but to do the best it can to resolve the disputed issues.&#8221; </span></p>

It matters not whether the mother's anxieties will be reasonable or unreasonable. The extent to which there will, objectively, be good cause for the mother to be anxious on return will nevertheless be relevant to the court's assessment of the mother's mental state if the child is returned.&#8221; </span></p>

"Intolerable" is a strong word, but when applied to a child must mean "a situation which this particular child in these particular circumstances should not be expected to tolerate". It is, as article 13(b) makes clear, the return to the requesting state, rather than the enforced removal from the requested state, which must have this effect. Thus the English courts have sought to avoid placing the child in an intolerable situation by extracting undertakings from the applicant as to the conditions in which the child will live when he returns and by relying on the courts of the requesting State to protect him once he is there. In many cases this will be sufficient. But once again, the fact that this will usually be sufficient to avoid the risk does not mean that it will invariably be so. In Hague Convention cases within the European Union, article 11.4 of the Brussels II Revised Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003) expressly provides that a court cannot refuse to return a child on the basis of Article 13(b) "if it is established that adequate arrangements have been made to secure the protection of the child after his or her return". Thus it has to be shown that those arrangements will be effective to secure the protection of the child. With the best will in the world, this will not always be the case. No one intended that an instrument decided to secure the protection of children from the harmful effects of international child abduction should itself be turned into an instrument of harm&#8221;. </span></p>

The expression 'protective measures' is a broad concept and is not confined to specific measures such as the father proposed in this case. It can include, as I have said, any 'measure' which might address the risk being advanced by the respondent, including 'relying on the courts of the requesting state'. Accordingly, the general right to seek the assistance of the court or other State authorities might in some cases be sufficient to persuade a court that there was not a grave risk within Art 13(b). </span></p>

They are brief because this is not the occasion for a detailed analysis of the issues. [43] First, in respect of Ms Cooper's submissions about the efficacy of undertakings given to the English court, it is clear that, in deciding what weight can be placed on them, the court has to take into account the extent to which they are likely to be effective. This applies both in terms of compliance and in terms of consequences, including remedies, in the absence of compliance. The issue is their effectiveness which is not confined to their enforceability: see, for example, H v K and Others (Abduction: Undertakings) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2017/1141" uk:canonical="[2017] EWHC 1141 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWHC 1141 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2018] 1 FLR 700" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] 1 FLR 700</ref>, at para [61]. In saying this, because I acknowledge the concerns that have been expressed about the court's perhaps giving insufficient weight to the point made by Ms Cooper and the need for caution when relying on undertakings, I make clear that I am not saying that enforceability is not an issue, only that it forms one element of the court's assessment. </span></p>

European Regulation 606/2013 on the Mutual Recognition of Protection Measures in Civil Matters sets up a mechanism allowing for direct recognition of protection orders issued as a civil law measure between member states, thus a civil law protection order such as a non-molestation order or undertaking issued in one member state, can be invoked directly in another member state without the need for a declaration of enforceability but simply by producing a copy of the protection measure, an Article 5 certificate and where necessary a transliteration or translation.  </span></p>

It is nevertheless commonplace in non-EU Member State cases for the term &#8220;protective measures&#8221; to be used, and for the court to consider the practical arrangements on return as part of its enquiry into the Article 13(b) defence. Ordinarily, such measures are offered by way of undertaking. If the applicant for a return order can put in place such measures as will ensure the protection of a child, the grave risk of harm to a child defence is self-evidently much reduced.  But it does not follow that such protective measures are a pre-requisite to the failure of the Article 13(b) defence. Were that the case, no return orders would ever be made to a jurisdiction where undertakings made in the course of Hague Convention proceedings are not enforceable in the state of origin.  </p>

He said that she would &#8220;consider her position carefully&#8221;. She believes that the children would be removed from her care although this is somewhat circular in that I would expect her, as a devoted mother, to return with the children to ensure that does not take place.

M in particular may benefit from a greater sense of security and her concerns (which in my judgment are largely unfounded) about the children being removed from her care will be alleviated.

M has told E that she does not want to return to Kazakhstan which inevitably, in my view, must affect E&#8217;s views about the country.  Ms Demery reported that E has said she would not want to return even if M goes with her, although when I explored this with her, Ms Demery acknowledged that this may be a function of being &#8220;enmeshed with her mother&#8221;; if M says she does not want to return, then E&#8217;s views follow. </p>

They have lived in Kazakhstan all their lives, in E&#8217;s case she went to school there, they have extended family on both sides in Kazakhstan, they were settled there in the care of their mother and they had, at the time of removal, no identifiable links with this country. </p>
