	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These proceedings are brought under the Hague Convention by the Plaintiff father who is an Australian national resident in New South Wales.  He seeks an order against his former wife for the return to Australia of their two children of the marriage, A born on 14 December 1996 (now aged 9) and R born on 1 September 2000, (now aged 5).  The mother brought the children to England on 1 August 2005 on holiday with the consent of the father in order to visit the mother&#8217;s parents.  Instead of returning to Australia on 28 August 2005 as arranged, the mother has since remained in the United Kingdom with the children.  There is no issue that for the purposes of Article 3 of the Hague Convention the mother&#8217;s retention of the children in the United Kingdom was wrongful and that the father is entitled to an order for their return to Australia under Article 12 of the Convention subject to the mother establishing a defence under Article 13(b), on the basis that the children will be exposed to the grave risk of physical or psychological harm or otherwise placed in an intolerable situation and that /or A objects to being returned to Australia having obtained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of his views.  </p>

It is asserted in her statement of defence that:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The background is as follows.  The parties were married in Cumbria in England on 27 June 1992.  They first met in 1989 when the father was aged 28 and the mother 24.  She was in Australia working at the time. She moved in with the father and they remained together in Australia until the father was made redundant from his job and went with the mother to take up a job in Kuala Lumpur.  There followed  a brief spell working in Seoul, Korea before they moved together to the United Kingdom in 1991 and started to live in London after spending a week with the mother&#8217;s parents in Cumbria.  Despite the fact that, according to the mother, the father began to drink heavily, used drugs from time to time, and was on one occasion violent towards her, they married on 27 June 1992.  They remained in the United Kingdom, but it was not long before the relationship began to deteriorate.  The husband drank regularly to excess while finding difficulty in keeping employment and, according to the wife, was selfish and dominant in his habits.  The wife worked throughout the pregnancy with A and the husband made no effort to help around the home, continued to drink to excess, would often come home drunk and was a regular user of cannabis.  Having started his own business in the mid-1990s, he spent heavily on drinking and &#163;80.00 a week on cannabis.  For some time the parties had contemplated going back to Australia, the husband having been homesick for sometime.  At the end of 1998 they returned there, the husband having convinced the wife that his problems were due to the fact that he was homesick and things would be different in Australia.</p>

The wife got a job but, after the birth of R, she was no longer working and started to feel isolated. The husband&#8217;s drinking habit and use of cannabis continued.  He was on occasion violent.</p>

The wife moved to live in Wollongong, some 60 miles from Sydney on 12 January 2002.  However, successful access and contact arrangements continued. The father would drive over each alternate Friday and pick up the children to spend the weekend in Sydney.  The father consented to the mother&#8217;s request in 2002 to take the children to England for 6 weeks over the Christmas period.  She has visited her parents in the United Kingdom since with the husband&#8217;s consent and she received occasional visits from members of her family.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In September 2003, the wife applied to the Family Court of Australia in Sydney for parenting and property orders.  She applied for permission to relocate to the United Kingdom with the children on the basis that the father would remain in Australia, having face to face contact with the children for two block periods each year and at other times as circumstances permitted.  As the judge, Justice Chisholm put it, the only practicable alternative was that the mother remained living in Australia with the children, they continuing to have regular contact with the father on alternate weekends and half school days.  The issue of the husband&#8217;s drinking was explored at length, a significant issue being the extent to which his drinking should be taken into account in relation to parenting matters as well as the assessment of his contributions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to the first, at Para 79, the judge identified that one of the most substantial arguments on behalf of the mother if she were not allowed to relocate was that she would continue to suffer significant depression and related problems which would compromise her parenting.  By contrast, if she were able to relocate, these problems would be greatly eased or disappear. Against this, the husband argued that a relocation would disrupt the children&#8217;s contact with him, which would be disadvantageous for them.  The judge described these issues as &#8220;at the heart of the case&#8221;.  The judge had before him the report of a Ms Muul, as to whose qualifications I am ignorant but who, having administered psychological tests, had diagnosed the mother as suffering from &#8220;adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood&#8221;.  He also had evidence from the wife&#8217;s general practitioner Dr Joliffe who recorded fluctuations in the wife&#8217;s condition.  In July 2002 she was described as depressed and having difficulty coping with the separation from her husband, worried that the access periods for the children were too long for them, crying a lot, not sleeping and feeling anxious.  In October she was feeling better, but in November she presented again with anxiety and palpitations.  In December 2002 her anxiety was worse and she had panic attacks at night when she had had difficulties with her husband.  She had been prescribed valium.  In January 2003 she again felt very depressed. However, the report had concluded:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The judge also heard evidence from a counsellor on the impact on the mother of being prevented from relocating.  The counsellor said that she saw in the mother signs of resilience and ability to cope and thought that she was in a reasonable psychological state.  She said that the mother had good positive strengths and had indicated that if she were refused permission to relocate she had said that she would &#8220;get on with her life&#8221;. In these circumstances, and concentrating upon the welfare of the children, Chisholm J said that the evidence did not indicate that the lack of additional support from her family in England would be a disabling factor for the mother.  He said:</p>

I agree with the submissions of Mr Maurice [for the father] to the effect that the evidence to this point indicates that the pressure that the wife has been under has not had an adverse impact on the children.</p>

However it is necessary in this difficult case to balance this importance factor against a number of countervailing considerations.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Moving on to consider these, Justice Chisholm  considered<span style="font-weight:bold"/>the impact of relocation on the children, and  of the much reduced contact they would have with the father if relocation  took place, was the centre piece of the husband&#8217;s case.  He rejected any suggestion that this was a case where the father sought to prevent the mother from relocating because of some desire to control her life or for some other unworthy objective (Para 114).  He was satisfied that the father&#8217;s  genuine concerns were that A would miss &#8220;his dad, his grandpa, his school friends, his friends from Hornsby and his soccer as he would have to change schools again&#8221;, and that  separation would have an adverse on the close relationship which he believed he had with R. The judge found considerable evidence supporting the proposition that the children would greatly miss their father if the relocation were to take place, giving examples.  He accepted the counsellor&#8217;s view that:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;That there is a high risk of negative impact on the children&#8217;s relationship with their father if they were to relocate in England.  This is a particular concern for R as a two-year-old at a crucial stage for developing and maintaining attachments.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">(See Paras 116, 121, 122).  While recognising the mother&#8217;s &#8220;fine record as a parent and especially... that she has been primary the one to make the decisions about the children&#8221;, and that the evidence showed that &#8220;she had acted responsibly for the children in other areas&#8221;, the judge indicated that the decision must be based upon his judgement as to &#8220;what is best for the children, difficult though this is&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dealing with the question of drinking at Paras 132 &#8211; 145 of his judgment, Chisholm J referred to the husband&#8217;s evidence as having minimised his drinking habits, while at the same time admitting that during the relationship he had drunk &#8220;fairly heavily at home&#8221; in response to the pressure of a failing relationship with his wife. He had also stated that since separation he had not abused alcohol but drinks &#8220;at an appropriate social level&#8221;.  The judge found that the husband had indeed engaged in a heavy pattern of drinking and stated:</p>

It is true I think, that in his letter of 29 April he gave the impression that he was going to give up drinking altogether.  However, he has not shown the desire or ability to achieve that objective.</p>

However, apart from the fact that this problem does not seem to have happened, the father consents to orders to the effect that he should not drink while the children are with him or a reasonable time before hand.

The fact that the children are so young is an essential part of this conclusion.  I have no doubt that older children would be better able to maintain a relationship with a parent who lives in another country, through visits, electronic communications, and the like.  But for the reasons I have indicated, for these very young children, who have a close and loving relationship with their father, I have come to the conclusion that the relocation will not be in their best interests.</p>

This, in particular, causes her to have fears for the welfare of the children when in his care because of his temper, his driving and his heavy sleeping at night, which last means that he does not get up to attend to their needs when necessary.  She describes increasing reluctance on the part of the children to having extended contact with the father and their complaints that he does little to amuse or entertain them so that they become bored away from their home and friends.  She has spoken to the father about this and he simply says that he has his own method of doing things that which will not change.  She describes the children as often apprehensive before their weekend trips and as being unsettled for two or three days on their return.  At the same time, the father is constantly critical of her parenting and is threatening in his manner.  She finds herself continually anxious when the children are with the father, to the extent that it affects any ability to relax and spend enjoyable time by herself.</p>

A did not appear to the reporter to be in fear of his father, although he recalled one incident of violence.  He voiced no objections to returning to school in Australia and his only criticism of Australia as a place to live was the excessive heat in the summer midday sun.  He was plainly sympathetic and loyal to his mother.  He was also angry with his father for reasons he was reluctant to articulate. However they did not emerge in a manner sufficient to amount to an objection to returning to Australia for the purposes of Article 13.  While I consider that, upon the description of the Cafcass reporter, A is a child who has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of his views, those views are an insufficient basis on which to invoke the discretion of the court to withhold an order for return of the children.</p>

She felt trapped by her situation in Australia, concerned that her husband continued to have the power to intimidate and frighten her, which he exercised, and that she was unable to protect the children from what she saw as his aggressive and damaging behaviour. In England her inability to sleep well, her appetite, concentration and memory were all restored and she was neither depressed nor anxious as she had felt before she left.  She was able to &#8220;put away&#8221; the worries from Australia during the period of her holiday, but that her anxiety and distress as the date for her return approached, she expressed increased anxiety and distress, exacerbated by the fact that on 18 August 2005 she found that the husband had failed to pay her child support, which she took to be deliberate and designed to upset her.  When she sought to delay her return because A had developed a tooth abscess, angry and frightening conversations with the husband ensued, which made her resolve not to return at all.  Since then, despite the worry of the proceedings, she had felt calmer happier and more at ease with herself and ceased to feel &#8220;stressed or frightened&#8221;.  She felt safe and secure within her parents&#8217; home with easy access for herself and the children.

She sometimes finds him to be aggressive, threatening or critical at such times.  She worries that he is unable to safely care for the children and believes that he is drinking while he is responsible for them.  She believes that he is having an adverse effect on their psychological wellbeing and behaviour.  The contact with [the husband] at times reminds her of when she was living with him and she feels controlled, bullied and fearful of him.  She feels that she at times implies that he wants to take the children away from her by applying for full custody if he had a permanent partner.  She feels that he routinely implies that he may prevent her visits to her family in England unless she behaves in a particular way.  Overall [she] continues to feel that she is bullied and intimidated by [the husband] and believes that he continually seeks to dominate and control her life, undermine her confidence, and dictate how she behaves.&#8221;</p>

The type of symptoms she has experienced include marked anxiety, increased levels of arousal, some difficulty in concentrating, hypervigilence, fatigue, decreased interest and pleasure in life, low self-esteem, lack of confidence, indecisiveness and intrusive distressing negative thoughts.  [Her] ability to function has, to an extent, been maintained throughout.  She has managed to work consistently, attend to household and financial tasks and take part in various activities.  However, her level of subjective distress was often very high; she often avoided socialising and only maintained her day to day function often with extreme effort.&#8221;</p>

I think that there were times [when her] symptoms were more consistent and severe and would have generated a categorical diagnoses such as a major depressive disorder.  Her mood disturbance was worse after the birth of her children, particularly R.  Her mood disturbance has also been generally more consistent and severe since she moved to Australia.  Worryingly, it is probably in the last six months prior to her arrival in England that [she] began to feel that life was pointless and suicidal ideas, albeit with no attached plans or intent. </p>

It would need to be clearly explained to [the mother] how long she needs to take the medication for and she would need to see someone to enable to advise and manage the process to ensure that she has a proper trial of treatment.  In terms of psychological treatment it would be best if she received treatment form a clinical psychologist.

In addition it would be essential for [the mother] that there was someone to consult in relation to her concerns about the children.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, Chisholm J. was impressed by the resilience of the mother.  While, that resilience lasted in the sense that, until the mother came to England, she retaining the ability to parent the children despite her unhappiness, it proved too fragile for her to be able to face return to Australia.  It is now clear on the evidence of Dr. Rifkin that it will break down completely if she has to return. Mr Noble submits, that the breakdown will place the children in an intolerable situation, in that they will have a mother unable properly to take care of them.  Either they will continue in her care with a serious decline in the general happiness and welfare of the household, or they will be faced with the Hobson&#8217;s choice of being in the care of the father, who is in no position to look after them himself.  Mr Noble submits that it must be wrong to propel the wife up to, or over, the edge of nervous breakdown by ordering her return, in a situation where she is the primary carer of the children who are reliant upon her for a happy  and ordered life.  In this respect he relies upon the authority of <span style="font-style:italic">Re G</span> (<span style="font-style:italic">Abduction:  psychological harm</span>) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 1 FLR 64" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 1 FLR 64</ref>, a case in which, at the time of examination with a view to her return, the mother was found to have a moderately severe reactive depression which doctors were satisfied would, if she were forced to return to Texas with the children, be likely to become a state of psychosis to the extent of making her unable to look after the children.  </p>

Third, Chisholm J made his findings on the basis of the report of Dr Joliffe that the mother&#8217;s prognosis for the future was good, whereas plainly her condition had deteriorated rather than improved since.  He made clear his views that on the evidence before him the wife was sufficiently resilient to be able to cope with the difficulties she would experience, that has not proved so, as the report of Dr Rifkin makes clear.</p>

These are essentially matters for the Australian courts to consider in the light of the changed circumstances since the hearing before Chisholm J.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have anxiously considered the rival submissions.  It is plain from the report of Dr Rifkin that there must be fears over the mother&#8217;s state of health if I order return.  However, I reluctantly remind myself that this can be a harsh jurisdiction.  As pointed out by Hale LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">TB v JB (Abduction: Grave Risk of Harm)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 2 FLR 515" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 2 FLR 515</ref>,  the Hague Convention was originally drafted to deal with case where the abductor was not the child&#8217;s primary carer, but the other parent who snatched the child away from her. Now, all too frequently the abductor is the primary carer, the parent left behind acting to protect his rights of access.  Because the threshold for an Article 13 defence is not to be decided on the basis of straightforward welfare considerations, but according to the higher standard of serious risk of harm, an order for return to the home country may well prove harsh in a situation where, although the child needs contact with the other parent, his or her need for a secure and happy home  with the primary carer is even more important.  Thus the order for return may well prove temporary in a case where the court in the &#8220;home&#8221; jurisdiction subsequently decides that  ordinary welfare considerations now militate in favour of removal.  That may well prove to be the position in this case if Dr Rifkin&#8217;s concerns prove correct.  However, in the absence of the court being satisfied that the Article 13 threshold has been breached, it is no part of this court&#8217;s task , and indeed it would be improper, to usurp the function of the &#8220;home&#8221; court by way of short cut.</p>

The proper solution in this case is for the court to order return so that the Australian court can reconsider the position on the application of the mother.  It seems to me, that the highest it can properly be put on the evidence before me is that there are indeed risks that the mother will be come depressed on her return to Australia.  However, I am not satisfied as to a grave risk that she will do so the extent of losing her parenting ability.  Upon the evidence before me, there is a strong welfare case for the wife to be permitted to return with the children to England.  Her continued good health and her own welfare as primary carer of the children, with the loving support available from her own family, presents a plain contrast to her unhappy and relatively isolated life in Australia, with less promising job prospects in a situation where money is tight.  It is plain, as acknowledged by the husband, that she is the appropriate primary carer.  A appears to have a plain preference for living with his mother, siding with her over the tensions which arise with his father.  Again, the happiness of the mother is of considerable importance in the life of R, although I have little information directed to her position.</p>
