	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On 26 January 2015 St Helens Council issued care proceedings in respect of three children, K, born on 19 April 2005 and now aged 10, A , born on 4 October 2006 and now aged 8 and S , born on 25 September 2009 and now aged 5.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">As the case has evolved so has the nature of the orders which the court is asked to make.  As at the commencement of this final hearing I am invited by the local authority, with the support of the father and of the Children&#8217;s Guardian to make special guardianship orders in respect of each child in favour of the maternal grandparents.  I am in addition asked to make supervision orders in respect of each child in favour of St Helens Council for a period of 12 months.  Finally, I am invited to make orders conferring on the father parental responsibility in respect of A and S.</p>

The children&#8217;s father is P A.  The maternal grandparents, B M and P M are also party to these proceedings.  The children&#8217;s interests in this case are represented by their Children&#8217;s Guardian, Mr Paul Sambrooks.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The mother has not attended this hearing, although she has been represented by counsel throughout.  At the commencement of the hearing I heard submissions on the issue of whether or not I should proceed with the final hearing in the Mother&#8217;s absence.  This issue was of some moment as, whilst the mother in large part concedes the facts on which the local authority relies to establish the threshold in this case, on her most recent instructions the mother disputes an allegation that she inflicted bruises and a bite mark on A which allegation the local authority seeks to prove and seeks the return of the children to her full time care.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I decided to proceed with the final hearing in the mother&#8217;s absence and gave a short judgment summarising my reasons for doing so.  It is appropriate for me to reiterate and further elucidate my reasons at this stage.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The mother last attended court on 31 March 2015.  She last attended contact with the children, for approximately 20 minutes, on 20 April 2015.  By common consensus between the legal representatives, the mother left court on 31 March 2015 before it was known that this final hearing would be commencing on 8 June 2015.  Since 31 March 2015 the social worker has only managed to speak to the mother once and the mother has not kept appointments with her solicitors.  </p>

	  <num style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.25in">7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Whilst correspondence detailing the dates of the final hearing had been sent by the mother&#8217;s solicitor to the maternal grandparents&#8217; home, the mother had not attended there.  Indeed, the mother is not welcome at her parents&#8217; home and the maternal grandfather had requested that the mother&#8217;s solicitors cease sending correspondence to that address.  There was therefore a significant question mark over whether the mother had received reasonable notice of the final hearing.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.25in">8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">When this matter was raised by the court the maternal grandmother informed the court through her counsel that she had met the mother in town a little over two weeks ago and had handed to the mother the letters detailed above.  I directed that the maternal grandmother be sworn and she gave evidence to the effect that she had met her daughter, handed over the letters to her and explained that they related to these proceedings.  The maternal grandmother does not recall specifically telling the mother that the final hearing would be commencing on 8 June.  The maternal grandmother further related that another family member had encountered the mother on a separate occasion in a public house and that when this hearing became the topic of conversation the mother had stated to that family member that she would not be attending this hearing.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The letter given by the maternal grandmother to the mother dated 2 April 2015 made clear (in bold type) that the Issues Resolution Hearing in this matter was listed on 27 May 2015 at the Liverpool Family Court.  The letter further made clear that the final hearing in this case was listed to commence on 8 June 2015, again in the Liverpool Family Court.  Finally, the letter made clear that the court had directed the mother to provide the name and contact details of a witness relevant to the issue of whether the mother had caused injury to A.  The letter to the mother dated 23 April 2015, which the maternal grandmother also gave to the mother, reiterated the matters outlined above and confirmed that the mother&#8217;s instructions to her counsel at the hearing on 31 March 2015 had been that she did not cause the injuries to A.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The mother did not attend the IRH on 27 May 2015.  The order made on that date contains a warning that failure to attend the final hearing may not result in an adjournment and that the court intended to make final orders, which may include adverse findings.  The court directed that the mother&#8217;s solicitors instruct an enquiry agent to locate her and personally serve her with the order of 27 May 2015 and made an order was made that the DWP disclose the last known address of the mother.   The enquiry agents were unable to locate the mother.  The DWP were only able to provide a post code and a flat number, which information did not allow a specific property within that post code to be identified.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Having regard to the matters outlined above, and in particular the evidence I heard on oath from the maternal grandmother, I am satisfied that the mother has received reasonable notice of the final hearing.  I am also satisfied that the mother has had reasonable notice of the fact that the court intended to determine at this final hearing whether she is responsible for the injuries sustained by A.  </p>

Whilst I am satisfied that the mother is on notice of the allegations made against her, proceeding with this hearing in her absence deprives her of the opportunity to give her oral evidence in respect of the same and to instruct her counsel in light of the oral evidence of others.

In circumstances where no application was made at the case management stage for the children to give evidence and be cross-examined, the mother has not been denied by the court proceeding in her absence the opportunity to see the primary witnesses against her give evidence and give instructions as to cross examination of such oral evidence.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Third, whilst she was engaging in these proceedings the mother filed a statement setting out in clear terms her case in respect of the children and in respect of the injuries sustained by A.  Save for K&#8217;s conversation with the Children&#8217;s Guardian on 1 June 2015, this statement was prepared at a time when the mother was fully on notice of the accounts given by the children on which the local authority rely to make good its allegations in respect of A.   The mother&#8217;s case in respect of the injuries sustained by A as set out in her statement amounts to a bare denial of the allegations without further explanation.  She does not appear to dispute that the conversations relied on by the local authority took place or the accuracy of the accounts of the same.  Indeed, she could not do so as she was not present during those conversations. In the circumstances any oral evidence from the mother on the issue of the causation of the injuries would necessarily have been limited to a denial that that which the children have said is the truth together with any explanation for why this is the case (although none is contained in her statement).  The mother does not appear to dispute the medical evidence in this case.</p>

In this case the impact on the children of not proceeding would be particularly acute.  Whilst the children have been admirably cared for by the father and his partner during the currency of these proceedings, by reason of their particular situation this cannot continue beyond the end of this week.  The impact on the children of adjourning this hearing to provide the mother with a further opportunity to attend would accordingly have extended beyond the impact of further delay, to which delay I must pay careful regard, to the need to secure a further temporary placement in the interim.  Plainly, this would have been antithetic to the children&#8217;s best interests.  Within this context I have also had regard to the importance of A knowing, if possible, who inflicted injury upon him.</p>

He had a significant pattern of bruising to his left ear, which Dr Chahal considered was consistent with a grabbing injury.  A had a line of three bruises on his left thigh and a bruise to his right thigh.  He had two bruises on his right forearm.  One of the bruise marks on A&#8217;s right forearm was considered by Dr Chahal to be consistent with a bite mark.  Dr Chahal noted a number of further bruises on other areas of A&#8217;s body, including his spine, his shins and several scratches. Dr Chahal observed that A was unkempt, with dirty clothing, a dirty neck and dirty toenails and feet.  Dr Chahal concluded that three of the areas of injury, namely the bite mark, the bruising to the ear and the bruising to the thigh were consistent with non-accidental injuries.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Dr Martin, a forensic odontologist, has prepared an expert report considering the nature and provenance of the bruising that Dr Chahal considered to be a bite mark.  In a report dated 8 December 2014 Dr Martin accepts that the photos from which he was asked to work were far from ideal.  Nonetheless, Dr Martin concludes that the marks on A&#8217;s arm fall into the category of &#8216;definite human bite&#8217; in the classification adopted by forensic odontologists.  Dr Martin further concludes that the bite mark was caused by an &#8216;adult&#8217;. For these purposes an &#8216;adult&#8217; is a person over the age of 12 years, that being the age at which a child&#8217;s adult anterior teeth are normally fully erupted and in occlusion.

The court has to look at the broad canvass of the evidence in order to determine whether it is able to make the findings sought on the balance of probabilities.</p>

Within this context I note that, when giving a history to Dr Chahal, whilst the mother was clear that she had pointed out the bruise to A&#8217;s ear to the maternal grandmother she made no mention to Dr Chahal of telling the maternal grandmother of bruising to A&#8217;s arm, whether in the form of a bite mark or otherwise or of bruising to his thighs.</p>

She was visibly upset at the prospect of A being deliberately harmed and plainly cares deeply for him.

The children ardently wish to live with their maternal grandparents and each has an extremely positive bond with those adults.  A placement with the maternal grandparents would allow the children to grow up in their extended family and to have easy and regular contact with their father and his partner Ms J and their children.  Securing such a placement with the making of special guardianship orders would allow the court to confer the kind of security of placement that is plainly conducive to children&#8217;s best interests.

As identified in the evidence before me and set out in the report of the Children&#8217;s Guardian there are a series of risk factors present.  These risk factors comprise the maternal grandfather&#8217;s recent excessive alcohol consumption and concerns over the maternal grandparents transparency in relation to this issue, the maternal grandfather&#8217;s extensive criminal record, the maternal grandparents ability to work openly with professionals and, finally, an incident of domestic violence between them in July 2014.  As I have noted, it would be highly detrimental to place the children in an environment in which there was an unacceptable risk of the unfortunate elements of their upbringing to date being repeated.</p>

The common consensus of each of the professionals is that this episode of increased alcohol intake has not prejudiced his ability to care for the children.  The maternal grandfather has never been seen intoxicated whilst with the children, including contact.  The maternal grandmother reported the recent incident of domestic violence to the police and the maternal grandfather has acknowledged his responsibility and accepted the need to access support for anger management.  The maternal grandfather has been able to demonstrate that he can engage with the court process and I am confident he will engage with the support he has sourced.  The maternal grandparents agree that a 12 month supervision order should be made in favour of the local authority to support and monitor the progress of the children and to further progress the amelioration of the risk factors I have set out.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The other realistic option for placement in this case is long term foster care.  Such a placement would have the advantage of insulating the children from the risk factors I have identified in respect of a placement with the maternal grandparents.  However, a placement in long term foster care would also have manifest disadvantages to these children including, but not limited to, their growing up outside their natural family, the real possibility of the closely bonded siblings being separated, the insecure nature of foster care and the continued intervention of the local authority pursuant to the statutory looked after process and the disruption associated with that.</p>

It would in my judgment be entirely disproportionate to reject such a placement based on the risk factors identified, particularly in circumstances where those risk factors can be addressed in the manner I have described.  The Children&#8217;s Guardian is strongly of the view that the maternal grandparents are &#8220;hugely committed&#8221; to the children and have a strong sense of the importance of family.  Having heard the maternal grandparents in the witness box I share this view.  I accordingly grant special guardianship orders in favour of the maternal grandparents, together with 12 month supervision orders in favour of the local authority in respect of each child.</p>
