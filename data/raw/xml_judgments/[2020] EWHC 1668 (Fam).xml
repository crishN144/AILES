She appeals that refusal, complaining both about the way that the case was conducted and its outcome. M was granted permission to appeal the order by Williams J on 3 April 2020.  The matter was listed before The President on 5 June 2020 and the hearing started but had to be abandoned when the technology failed.  It was accordingly re-listed before me on 12 June 2020. </p>

Since August 2015 they have been engaged in litigation about her.  The litigation has extended also into financial proceedings pursuant to the provisions of schedule 1 <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. </p>

M reported the allegations to Children&#8217;s Services and the Police.  She told F that she would suspend all contact and he applied for a child arrangements order for her either to live with him or in the alternative spend additional time with him.  In May 2019 M removed the child to Iran without consent and in breach of her undertaking to the court.  An order was made for the child&#8217;s return.   </p>

The payment was to cover the pre-hearing review listed for 3 July 2019 and a fact-finding hearing that was listed to take place commencing on 15 July 2019.  M and the child did return at the end of June and at the pre-hearing review on 3 July the cheque for &#163;35,000 was duly handed over.   </p>

True it was that she was not facing allegations of sexual misbehaviour, but F had sought a &#8220;live with&#8221; order, the papers were voluminous, and English is her third language.  She had had various solicitors before but for whatever reason had left them.   </p>

She says that they applied for an adjournment on her behalf saying that they had not had enough time to prepare and when that adjournment was refused she chose to dispense with their services.  It is not necessary to enquire into this any further.  It is accepted that her legal fees incurred exceeded the &#163;35,000 allowance, which is not surprising bearing in mind that it was fixed with the instruction of a direct access counsel in mind and instead was used for both solicitors and counsel.   </p>

Sometimes that advice need not be slavishly followed and combined hearings can take place, particularly if a preliminary hearing, but to combine a hotly contested child arrangements hearing with a LSPO application should be avoided.  How, I ask rhetorically, can the parties be expected to negotiate constructively over child arrangements in a high temperature case such as this under the cloud of what was known to be an opposed LSPO application?  Which is to be dealt with first?  If it is LSPO, then it may be that counsel and solicitors will say that they will not stay for the substantive hearing if their application is refused as to do so would simply be to increase the costs exposure.  If dealt with subsequently, then of course they run into the argument that no order need be made so as to provide M with representation at the hearing, as that part of the hearing will have concluded. </p>

I am of the view that I should not. Why not? The father has already given the mother a fighting fund in line with the assessment of a previous judge, HHJ Cox, who thought that the shape of the case at that time required that a fund of &#163;35,000 be given to the mother. That occurred. The mother then, for reasons which entirely escape me, decided to dispense with the services of her legal team on the day of the hearing. I was told, surprisingly, that all the money had been spent by that firm. Consequently, all of the father&#8217;s money was entirely wasted as the mother represented herself. </p>

He was not able to say how much was spent on each part of the case, but it is obvious that the substantial bulk must have been spent on the family proceedings.  So far as M&#8217;s costs were concerned, F had paid &#163;35,000 prior to the July hearing.  I do not know what she paid prior to that but it must have been far less than F had spent. </p>

In Rubin, Mostyn J was not considering legal costs funding in ongoing proceedings; he was dealing with truly 'historic' costs which had arisen in two separate sets of proceedings (i.e. divorce and child abduction), which had, importantly, concluded.  The financial proceedings had been stayed (proceedings were now ongoing in California), and the mother and children had returned to California, pursuant to orders made by Hogg J under the Hague Convention 1980.  There was, as Mostyn J observed, no further litigation in this country, and no litigation in prospect.   I consider that Mostyn J was right to reject a legal costs funding application as a vehicle to recoup the costs of either or both of these concluded claims.  But that type of application is distinguishable from the type of situation here, where the legal costs funding claim arises in relation to costs reasonably and legitimately incurred within ongoing proceedings prior to the determination of the legal costs funding application.  I draw support for this distinction by the following: </p>

The outstanding costs liability was then c.&#163;40,000, incurred since the discharge of the wife's legal aid certificate (which had only occurred when an order for maintenance pending suit had been made by the husband to the wife in that case); counsel for the husband in that case, as Mr. Chamberlayne in this, had argued that solicitors should be willing to wait for their costs and run the risk of not recovering them, as many other solicitors in their position have had to do.  Holman J rejected that argument, observing that "we live in times of high overheads and a close eye on cash flow. There is a real risk that if wives (for it is usually wives) cannot obtain some funding as they go along, solicitors simply will not be willing to act for them at all"; that is the obvious risk here too; </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.5in">I would just make this further point.  I would not regard it as necessary for an applicant to demonstrate that his or her solicitor has actually 'downed tools' or will do so before he or she could legitimately make an application for a legal costs funding order where 'historic' costs have been incurred.  Such an approach could be problematic.  I agree with the essence of Mostyn J's approach &#8211; namely that a clear case would need to be shown that the solicitors are reaching the end of their tolerance &#8211; but the approach described in [16] of Rubin ought not to be applied too strictly, otherwise it would work materially to the disadvantage of the honourable solicitor who is prepared to soldier on (perhaps somewhat against their better commercial judgment) for the good of the client or the case. </p>

However, this must be broken down.  It seems to me that approximately two-thirds of the cost relate to the September hearing and only onethird to the July hearing.  The sum referable to the September hearing shall not be payable until 14 August 2020, that is one month before the hearing date, and if it becomes apparent that that hearing will not take the form or length currently anticipated then there will be liberty to the parties&#8217; to apply, at short notice in respect of that hearing.  If a hearing cannot be obtained in the CFC, I will myself conduct a short hearing in the second half of August. </p>
