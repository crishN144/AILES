Where the agency considers that it is likely to be in the child&#8217;s interests to be given this opportunity, it should encourage the parents to consider the matter from the point of view of the child. Generally, the courts have been reluctant to override a parent&#8217;s determination for the extended family not to be informed but as with fathers without parental responsibility, agencies should avoid giving parents any undertaking that the birth or the proposed adoption will be kept secret.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In exercising that broad discretion, I would suggest that the following be borne in mind.  There will be cases (if, for instance, there is a history of domestic or family abuse) where it would be unsafe to the child or the parent for the wider family to be involved in the life of the child, or even made aware of the existence of the child.  There will be cases where cultural or religious considerations may materially impact on the issue of disclosure.  There will be further cases where the mental health or well-being of the parent or parents may be imperilled if disclosure were to be ordered, and this may weigh heavy in the evaluation.  But in exercising judgment &#8211; whether that be by the local authority, adoption agency or court &#8211; I am clear that the wider family should not simply be ignored on the say-so of a parent.  Generally, the ability and/or willingness of the wider family to provide the child with a secure environment in which to grow (<span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(4)</ref>(f)(ii) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref></span>) should be carefully scrutinised, and the <span style="font-style:italic">option itself</span> should be &#8220;fully explored&#8221; (see [28]).  The approach taken by Sumner J in the <span style="font-style:italic">Birmingham </span>case more than a decade ago, to the effect that &#8220;cogent and compelling&#8221; grounds should exist before the court could endorse an arrangement for the despatch of public law proceedings while the wider family remained ignorant of the existence of the child (see [29] above), remains, in my judgment, sound.  This approach is in keeping with the key principles of the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref></span> and the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref></span> that children are generally best looked after within their own family, save where that outcome is not consistent with their welfare, and that a care order on a plan for adoption is appropriate only where no other course is possible in the child&#8217;s interests (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (A child)</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re B-S</span>). </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">I am not insensitive to the fact that the father feels some embarrassment and shame about his lifestyle (see [10] above), and/or the fear of possible rejection or ostracism from his family should they know about his life, and his children; I recognise that he is entitled to respect for his right to privacy.  But I cannot allow his discomfort or embarrassment or the risk of rejection to dominate this decision; all that I know about his family, as a strong unit, indicates the improbability of rejection.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">As I have indicated above ([48]), in the final analysis, any court or statutory agency faced with this dilemma must place the child&#8217;s best interests at the centre of its decision making.   It must be the life-long best interests of H which determine the decision.  In this case, I am influenced by the fact that it is possible that, contrary to his expectations, the father&#8217;s family may actually be able to offer the mother and father support in caring for H.  It is also possible that, contrary to his expectations, the father&#8217;s family may be in a position to offer H a home themselves.  That the father belongs to a &#8216;strong&#8217; family unit (described in [10] above) offers some hope that they may indeed have something positive to offer H, and if they are not able to offer H a home, it is that same strength of family bond which should equip them well to support the father and each other if H&#8217;s future is to be secured through adoption. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">I am satisfied that if H were to be adopted, he would benefit from knowing, as he grows into adulthood, that his parents sought to care for him, even if they are adjudged unable to do so.  He would further benefit from knowing that his wider birth family &#8211; his grandparents &#8211; were aware of his existence, and were given the opportunity to claim him and care for him, even if in the event they are unable to do so.   While there is a risk that he may feel abandoned or let down by a family unable or unwilling to claim him, I am of the view that it is better for H if he is adopted that he knows they were aware of his situation and considered it than they lived in ignorance of him.  In my judgment the worst outcome for H is that he would learn, many years down the line, that his father was too awkward or ashamed or embarrassed to reveal his existence to his family, and that the court &#8211; without cogent or compelling reason &#8211; condoned arrangements to keep his birth a secret from those who would have had an interest in him and might actually have claimed him.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">By notifying the wider family of H&#8217;s existence now they will have the chance to contribute to life story work for H, even if they cannot care for him.  This will enable those who raise H through adoption (if that is his fate) to help him to make sense of his life&#8217;s journey. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">A subsidiary but not unimportant factor weighing in my evaluation is that the maternal family are aware of H&#8217;s existence.  While there is no evidence before me that the maternal and paternal family have contact with each other, there is a risk that for as long as information about H&#8217;s existence exists within the wider family and community, that information would leak across to the paternal family in any event.  Were this to happen, it would be likely to cause greater shock and distress to the wider paternal family, with potentially much graver implications for the relationship between the father and his parents, than if this news were imparted now in a managed and I hope sensitive way.  </p>

In those cases, the local authority, adoption agency and the court seek to maintain the co-operation of the parent in making consensual arrangements for the child (a key feature of the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Z County Council v R</span> (Holman J)) which is greatly to the child&#8217;s advantage.   </p>
