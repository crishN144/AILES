She agreed to be bound by those promises until 2 March 2017.

I gave her a warning against self-incrimination and reminded her that she did not have to give evidence to me, it was her right to say nothing and to put the Local&#160;Authority to proof of their case, but she decided that she wanted to give evidence to me and she has done so.  In her evidence today, she has told me that she does not remember signing the undertaking at court on 12 December 2016.  She was not well, and she did not understand what the undertaking means.  She has a problem with her thyroid gland and was not taking her tablets and all she wanted to do was go home.  She conceded that she had the comfort of being represented by a barrister at the hearing.  She denies that she has done anything wrong and she maintains her position that it is the Local&#160;Authority who has acted in the wrong and not her.  It is her evidence that the lives of the children subject to the care proceedings and their older brother and two sisters as well as her own life have been destroyed by the actions of Medway Council over a number of years and that she will never be quiet about this. </span></p>

It is submitted that for Ms Root to say that she was unwell and did not understand the undertaking is not something that the court should accept in view of the contents of the postings that she subsequently made and in particular the one the day after she gave the undertaking namely on 13 December 2016.  The Local&#160;Authority accepts that the mother did write to the court before the March hearing making reference to the fact that she was unwell at the December hearing but they say if that was true, she would have mentioned that at an earlier stage in the postings that she made and would not have left it until March before she made that complaint.</span></p>

She reiterated that she had a problem with her health and not taken her medication.  Her position is that she is not guilty of contempt of court and is not guilty of anything and she says that she is not going to say that she regrets anything or that she has changed her mind because she has not.  She has been fighting this matter for seven and a half years and is not going to stop now and submits that the court cannot gag her for the rest of her life. </span></p>

I remind myself of the burden and the standard of proof.  The burden of proof is on the Local&#160;Authority to prove the breaches and the standard of proof is the criminal standard, that they must make me sure that these breaches have been proved.  In other words, they must prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. </span></p>

I find that there is no dispute that an undertaking was given to the court by Ms&#160;Root on 12 December 2016 in the terms that I have read out.  There is no dispute that a reporting restriction order was made on the same date.  Ms Root does not dispute that the Facebook entries made on 13 December, 22 December and 20 February 2017 were made by her and Ms Root accepts that she did not take the Facebook entries down as promised in the undertaking to the court. </span></p>

I find that I am sure that Ms Root did understand the nature and effect of the undertaking at the time that she gave it to the court on 12 December.  Not only was she represented by counsel but I well remember that I explained to her that I had a separate duty to explain the nature and effect of the undertaking to make sure that she understood it before she signed it.  I explained to her what she was promising to the court to do and I explained to her that an undertaking had the same effect as a court order and I explained to her the consequences if it was to be alleged on a future date that she had breached the terms of the undertaking.  I explained that the matter could be brought back to court and that the court could hear evidence and if the court found that she was in breach of the undertaking, she would then be in contempt of court.</span></p>

As I have said, she was represented by a barrister at that hearing.  She was able to give her barrister instructions during the course of the hearing and there was no indication that she was unwell at the time. </span></p>

In my judgment, the reality of the situation is that she changed her mind very soon after the hearing and she decided that she was not going to comply with the terms of the undertaking.  It is quite clear that in the post that she sent on 13 December, she was saying, &#8216;In essence, I am being blackmailed&#8217;, and, &#8216;The Judge in essence tried to illegally force me into admitting liability&#8217;.  As the Judge, I did no such thing and I explained that no findings had been made by the court at that stage but that an undertaking was an appropriate way in dealing with the position until we could come back to court on 2 March.</span></p>
