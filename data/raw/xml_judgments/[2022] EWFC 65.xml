	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">I am very familiar with this case having dealt with all hearings to date. I had the benefit of the court bundle, detailed Skeleton arguments on both sides with a helpful bundle of authorities. It is a high conflict contact dispute. The central issue concerns the arrangements for spending time with the children by their father: how often? Should they include overnight stays? Should the father be supervised or supported by a third party or parties and, if so, whom? PD12J is engaged as the mother asserts the father has been responsible for coercive and controlling behaviour as well as emotionally abusive behaviour towards her and the children. Significantly, there is no issue about a &#8220;lives with&#8221; order. The father conceded this should be made in favour of the mother and I made such an order by consent on 22 December 2021. The hearing on 27 June 2022 is listed as a rolled up fact finding and welfare hearing although the latter may not be achieved. Mr Verdan described the case as having unusual facts, for example, the extent of the security in the home: in my view it does not and shares many similarities with private law cases coming before the court with great, some may say, too great, regularity. The only unusual factor is the scale of the father&#8217;s wealth.  </span></p>

He expressed concern about aspects of the presentation of the children, especially R, and recommended that a consultant clinical psychologist should be appointed </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;to understand the dynamics at play across both households.&#8221; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">He considered the hearing in June may not be effective as a final hearing. The mother was very critical of the methodology and conclusions of Mr Power, in particular his approach to the PD12J issues which she considered he significantly underplayed. On 4 April 2022 I made an interim order accepting some of his recommendations. I considered the appointment of a psychologist, if it should happen at all, was premature in advance of a factual basis on which the expert should report. Ms Mills QC, the father&#8217;s then counsel, was critical of my approach to </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;picking and choosing&#8221; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">which recommendations of Mr Power I should accept and an application for permission to appeal is currently before the High Court.</span></p>

The father suggests that the mother is preoccupied with knowing what is going on in the home at all times and spends many hours reviewing the footage. He also says she has used it as an evidence gathering device to support her case as to the father&#8217;s behaviour towards her, the children and the family nannies. He says, and this is not denied, she also recorded Mr Power, without his consent. His skeleton argument for this hearing asserts she has adduced or otherwise exhibited recordings of 15 incidents, 13 clips from the Google Nest footage in the family home and 2 downloaded from her phone, one of which is a covert recording of the father. At a hearing on 15 September 2021, in the face of strong opposition from the father, I admitted a number of short video clips which did demonstrate the sort of abusive behaviour the mother complained of. They were of the type frequently presented to the court, extending over no more than a few minutes in total.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> Although I subsequently made directions for the mother to produce the footage from 15 minutes before and after the incidents she relied upon, I understand that footage no longer exists.</span></p>

It is not possible to ask the employed nannies because it would potentially compromise their employment. Ex nannies, being ex nannies, could be said to have an axe to grind. Nevertheless a former nanny observed that the surveillance worked both ways. Thus I think it might be useful to exploit the wall to wall surveillance systems and take a sample of footage from when the children are returned from spending time with their father, over the following 48 hours. For example the children were returned on Sunday March 12th at 19.00 so let&#8217;s see the footage of how they are parented/cared for (nothing else) until Tuesday 14th evening, when they return from school and were put to bed. This could provide an evidence base for how the maternal house functions in terms of the delivery of parenting and child care but must be retrospective.&#8221;</span></p>

The mother&#8217;s genuine anxiety about the children spending time with the father needs to be understood via the fact finding element of the combined hearing and the assessment of Dr Williams, if agreed. Future arrangements will need to be filtered through PD12J but in my assessment my interim proposals are risk sensible, gradualist and evidence based.&#8221;</span></p>

This was less strongly pressed in Ms Fottrell&#8217;s oral submissions. They assert this is centrally a dispute about the time, and manner in which, the father should spend time with the children. The issue of where the children should live as their primary home was settled by the consent order of 22 December 2021. The inference is therefore that the mother is able to provide satisfactory day to day care of the children. Mr Verdan submits that the mother&#8217;s parenting is relevant to the children&#8217;s relationship with their father, for example, the extent to which they are picking up any anxiety or hostility within the mother&#8217;s household. Their behaviour as observed by Mr Power in contact raises questions as to how they are parented by the mother, as well as the father.</span></p>

Mr Verdan submits that the invasion of her privacy is mitigated by the two stage approach he suggests, that the material is viewed in stage 1 only by the digital forensic expert responsible for editing the material and Mr Power, who will report upon what, if anything, is relevant to welfare issues in the material. Only then should a decision be taken as to whether it should be disseminated more widely to the parties and the court.

Disclosure to a single person represents a breach of the mother&#8217;s Article 8 rights. She invites the court to consider the effect on any person if their private moments in their own home were exposed in this way. She asks rhetorically if this application were allowed, would any party with sophisticated security equipment as here be at risk of facing an application that their privacy would be invaded in this way? Further, she submits that it is difficult to conceive that either party, if he/she disagrees with the conclusions that Mr Power draws from the material, will not want to view it and want the court to view it. </span></p>

Mr Verdan rightly points out that there is no independent evidence of a deterioration of her mental health. I suspect had she adduced such evidence, it would have been said it relied solely on her self-report. Nevertheless, I have no doubt this application would have caused the mother significant distress adding to the pre-existing stress of these proceedings and the financial remedy proceedings but I can go no further than that. </span></p>

Any evidence, to be admissible, must be relevant. Contested trials last long enough as it is without spending time on evidence which is irrelevant and cannot affect the outcome. Relevance must, and can only, be judged by reference to the issue which the court (whether judge or jury) is called upon to decide. As Lord Simon of Glaisdale observed in Director of Public Prosecutions v Kilbourne <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1973] AC 729" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1973">[1973] AC 729</ref>, 756, &#8220;Evidence is relevant if it is logically probative or disprobative of some matter which requires proof &#8230; relevant (ie logically probative or disprobative) evidence is evidence which makes the matter which requires proof more or less probable.&#8221; &#8230; </span></p>

For the party seeking admission, the argument will always be that justice requires the evidence to be admitted; if it is excluded, a wrong result may be reached. In some cases, as in the present, the argument will be fortified by reference to wider considerations: the public interest in exposing official misfeasance and protecting the integrity of the criminal trial process; vindication of reputation; the public righting of public wrongs. These are important considerations to which weight must be given. But even without them, the importance of doing justice in the particular case is a factor the judge will always respect. The strength of the argument for admitting the evidence will always depend primarily on the judge&#8217;s assessment of the potential significance of the evidence, assuming it to be true, in the context of the case as a whole. </span></p>

First, it is likely to be said that admission of the evidence will distort the trial and distract the attention of the decisionmaker by focusing attention on issues collateral to the issue to be decided. This&#8230; is often a potent argument, particularly where trial is by jury. Secondly, and again particularly when the trial is by jury, it will be necessary to weigh the potential probative value of the evidence against its potential for causing unfair prejudice: unless the former is judged to outweigh the latter by a considerable margin, the evidence is likely to be excluded. Thirdly, stress will be laid on the burden which admission would lay on the resisting party: the burden in time, cost and personnel resources, very considerable in a case such as this, of giving disclosure; the lengthening of the trial, with the increased cost and stress inevitably involved; the potential prejudice to witnesses called upon to recall matters long closed, or thought to be closed; the loss of documentation; the fading of recollections. &#8230; In deciding whether evidence in a given case should be admitted the judge&#8217;s overriding purpose will be to promote the ends of justice. But the judge must always bear in mind that justice requires not only that the right answer be given but also that it be achieved by a trial process which is fair to all parties.&#8221; </span></p>

There are two questions that the judge must address in a case where there is a dispute about the admission of evidence of this kind. Firstly, is the evidence relevant, as potentially making the matter requiring proof more or less probable? If so, it will be admissible. Secondly, is it in the interests of justice for the evidence to be admitted? This calls for a balancing of factors of the kind that Lord Bingham identifies at paras 5 and 6 of O&#8217;Brien.&#8221;</span></p>

The digital expert has significantly reduced down the time needed and the cost incurred in a recent email which the mother&#8217;s team takes issue with. I note that the current assessment nevertheless speaks of 52 hours of review with 8 hours of administration and 16 hours of reporting, a total of 76 hours at a cost of &#163;19,000 plus VAT.

It is, as Ms Fottrell put it, &#8220;a big deal.&#8221; There is a qualitative and quantitative difference between the disclosure permitted on the mother&#8217;s application and that which is contemplated by this application which goes to the root of an individual&#8217;s right to respect for his/her family life. Further, the balancing exercise must be carried out separately for each such application. I am satisfied that it is virtually inevitable that there will be wider dissemination than Mr Verdan posits in his two stage argument in such a high intensity dispute. I do not find the absence of such disclosure would impact on the father&#8217;s Article 6 rights. In my judgment, Mr Power will be able to carry on his investigations in the conventional way and is able to produce a meaningful report on the material available.
