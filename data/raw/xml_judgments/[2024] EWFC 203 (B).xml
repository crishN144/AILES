Her mother is IP, represented by Teertha Gupta KC. Her father is SA, represented at this hearing by Georgina Rushworth of Counsel.  Both parents have successful professional careers.  The father has a shared care arrangement in relation to his two older children, by agreement with their mother. The parties had a relatively brief relationship. They never married, but the father does have parental responsibility. The relationship ended when C was 4 months old. Initially the father had contact with C twice per week for an hour with the mother supervising  However arrangements broke down when the mother came across diary entries written by the father in erotic terms recounting a sexual relationship he had with his older sister as a child. In response to contact breaking down, the father made his application to the court on 5 August 2022 for a child arrangements order, seeking shared care of C.  </span></p>

She also alleged that the father engaged in non-consensual sex with her whilst she was recovering from a C-section and whilst C was asleep next to her, and made a separate allegation that the father had stared at C&#8217;s private parts. The s7 reported dated 5 April 2024 recommended that a fact-finding hearing be held. The court determined that a fact-finding hearing was necessary in relation to those allegations and in the interim directed that the father have three hours of contact with C per week, professionally supervised in the community.  A risk assessment of the father was directed to be prepared by the Consultant and Forensic Psychologist Dr Dowd. </span></p>

He noted that the father had been the victim of sexual abuse as a child and had never received any therapeutic support in relation to that. He said the father may well benefit from that now. He found that the father did not have Compulsive Sexual Behavioural Disorder and said that he could not suggest that the father presented as offering a direct sexual risk to his daughter. There could be indirect risks to her in terms of stability caused by his sexual behaviours with others causing instability in his own life. </span></p>

His opinion is that the father does not pose a direct sexual risk to C, but that view is vigorously challenged by the mother. It seems to me that I must begin by considering whether I accept Dr Dowd&#8217;s evidence, or whether in my view the father's challenges to his report have merit.</span></p>

He explained that the term &#8220;sexual addiction&#8221; is not a clinical term, and that the nearest diagnosis would be a diagnosis of compulsive sexual behavioural disorder. He had felt able to come to a view about that without putting the mother&#8217;s allegations to the father. </span></p>

There had been no fact-finding at that stage and the factual matrix was not clear and it would have been difficult for Dr Dowd to know what he could fairly put to the father. I am not clear how challenging the father in that way  would have assisted him in the clinical process of assessing the father psychologically. It seems to me that the process of challenging the father with the mother&#8217;s account is one more suited to the court room than the consulting room.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-style:normal;font-family:'Times New Roman'">On the second point, Dr Dowd was asked why he had not put to the father the fact that there were inconsistencies between what the father said in his diary entries and what the father had told Dr Dowd. As an example, the father told Dr Dowd that the sexual abuse had happened around four times whereas the father&#8217;s diary entries said it had happened very often. Dr Dowd was not persuaded that this was an inconsistency if it was properly understood what the diaries represented. In listening to the cross-examination it seemed to me that there was a great disparity between the way in which the mother through her counsel viewed the diary entries and the way in which Dr Dowd viewed them. The line of questioning taken on behalf of the mother was based on a view of the diary entries as historical documents to be read closely and with an assumption that they should be accurate, with any inaccuracy being a weakness. From Dr Dowd&#8217;s perspective, the diary entries were something much more nebulous. At the front of his mind was the fact that he was dealing with a victim of child sexual abuse. To Dr Dowd, the diaries were the self-reflection of an adult trying to think back to events when he was sexually abused by an older sibling. Dr Dowd said he struggled to understand how it was possible to question accuracy and timings on the basis of such a document. He said that from the diaries he would not be able to say how often the sexual abuse took place. He agreed with the mother&#8217;s counsel that there was one diary entry which suggested that the father had been rather older than he claimed when the sexual abuse took place. When it was put on behalf of the mother that this was an inconsistency which should cause doubt about the father&#8217;s honesty, Dr Dowd said it would make no difference to him in his assessment of the father because the father had written it as part of a self-therapeutic process which was not uncommon. He said that diary entries such as these would inevitably include information which does not necessarily reflect reality, and that these diaries showed a high level of self-reflection and that the father was being unrealistically negative about himself. He described this as all being part of the therapeutic process.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-style:normal;font-family:'Times New Roman'">It is not in issue that the father was sexually abused by his sister when a child. She was eight years older than him. The father has said that she might have been 13 and he five. In oral evidence he was less sure but said it happened when he was at primary school. The relevant diary entries were made between 7 January 2020 and 17 March 2022. They set out in explicit terms sexual activity, including sexual intercourse, which took place between him and his sister on a number of occasions, sometimes including his brother as well. He writes about it with some relish, saying that they were some of the best sexual experiences he has ever had, and that writing it make him want her again.  The diaries do not only deal with his childhood sexual experiences. They also deal with his sexual fantasies about the father&#8217;s ex-partner B who is the mother of his two older children, as well fantasies about a colleague and an old friend. He refers to them as &#8220;girls&#8221; but I accept they are adults. The father writes about his lust being overpowering and making him weak. He says B is like a drug and he can&#8217;t stop thinking about sex with her. There is all this and much more in the diaries.  It is Dr Dowd&#8217;s view that there is nothing in the diaries nor in his interview with the father which places the father outside normal heterosexual thought and activity, and he found no evidence of paraphilia. He accepted that the father&#8217;s sexual interest featured impulsivity and sensation-seeking, for example in his admitted wish to explore threesomes, but said that was not illegal, not paraphilic and was not behaviour that would feature in the diagnostic criteria for sexually compulsive behaviour disorder.</span></p>

Dr Dowd was very open about the fact that it was so based, and noted that the diary entries themselves were a form of self-reporting.  He had not seen the father&#8217;s medical notes. The father&#8217;s case to the court, which I have no reason to disbelieve, is that extensive efforts were made to obtain them but his records prior to 2023 have been lost due to his moving GP surgery.  Be that as it may, it meant that Dr Dowd did not have that source of information to help him triangulate his views.  However Dr Dowd said he had read the whole bundle of over 500 pages and had all the information which was available, including the mother&#8217;s allegations. He said his opinion was based on the evidence the father was providing. His view was that the father had not sought to conceal his sexual behaviour and was willing, for example to answer questions about pornography and masturbation.  Dr Dowd had taken into account what he called &#8220;social desirability&#8221; by which he meant the possibility that the father would wish to manipulate facts and information in order to produce a good impression. However he had not had the impression that the father was trying to present himself falsely as to his sexual history. </span></p>

However I do not consider the lack of them invalidates Dr Dowd&#8217;s report. He had not only the father&#8217;s self-report but also the evidence of the narrative of the case as shown in the actions taken by the parties as set out in the various statements. That is important triangulating information. So also is the clinical interview.  The clinical interview is a crucial part of the assessment process and consists of more than mere self-reporting. An experienced clinician is used to gathering evidence not only from answers but from the way in which answers are given. Finally I note that all clinical assessments involve an element of self-reporting and this case was perhaps not so unusual in that regard. Although self-reporting was a significant part of what Dr Dowd had to rely on, it was not his only source of information. I am satisfied that he had enough information from other sources to allow him to come to the views he did on a solid basis.</span></p>

I found the father to be open in his answers, and my impression was that he was being honest. He is still trying to make sense of all that has happened to him.  I was struck by an exchange during cross examination where he was asked whether there would be likely to be further &#8220;disclosures&#8221;, which I took to mean incidents of sexual activity as a child, which would come to light if he underwent therapy. The question was designed so that if the father said &#8220;no&#8221; it would seem as if he was closed off to the idea of therapy having any realistic effect, and if he said &#8220;yes&#8221; it would look bad for him because there would be yet more sexual activity to be discovered.  The father did not hesitate but instantly replied &#8220;I&#8217;d hope so&#8221;.  What is striking is how that very short, instinctive answer fits so completely with Dr Dowd&#8217;s angle on the case, namely that the father is a man coming to terms with his abuse as a child, trying to make sense of it, and who knows that this memories are incomplete and need further work. I found nothing in my own observations of the father to contradict the view taken of him by Dr Dowd, and much to support it. Taking all that into account, I come to the view that I accept Dr Dowd&#8217;s opinion as to the level of risk posed by the father.  I accept that he does not pose a direct sexual risk to C, but that he poses an indirect risk to her because of his lifestyle choices, namely having multiple partners, sometimes overlapping, which can lead to disruption and instability in the living arrangements for a child. </span></p>

The mother was not yet pregnant with C. Both parties agree that this incident began as an incident of playful, enjoyable mutual tickling. The mother&#8217;s evidence is that in the midst of this, taking her by surprise, the father suddenly sat down on her chest and held her arms by her wrists so she could not get up or move. At that point she stopped laughing as she felt the air leave her lungs and she was in pain. She began to panic, gasping for breath and desperately trying to get him off her, but she could not. After struggling for what felt like a long time, she said she started to feel a lot of tension in her face and neck. She says she was wriggling frantically underneath the father and she was sure that he saw her desperation. He did not stop, but continued to hold her down. She says her eyes were wide open and there were tears streaming down her face. She thought she was going to suffocate. He suddenly released her and got up. She tried to speak to him about it and he told her she had brought it on herself. Later, when she tried to discuss it again he ridiculed her eventually becoming angry.</span></p>

Clearly an incident did take place. Clearly it went too far. The father admits that he saw the mother become distressed but says he got off immediately. The mother agrees that he got off her, but says it took a bit longer. The difference between the two accounts may only have been a second or two. I am troubled by the fact that in the mother&#8217;s account there is no motive for the father suddenly to assault her in the middle of a tickling session which, to him, might have looked promisingly as if it might lead to sex, as he said it often had done in the past. It makes no sense for him to interrupt that with a sudden assault out of nowhere. In my view it is more likely that that he was slightly slow to notice the mother&#8217;s distress and she perceived that as an assault. If he was slow to react her distress, that would have been a horrible experience for her. However, her continuation of the relationship, including becoming pregnant, suggests that on one level she knew it was not intentional and perhaps therefore did not have quite the character which she ascribes to the incident. </span><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman'">I find that in January 2021 the parties engaged in a tickling game which got out of hand.

The supervisor records the mother as being confrontational, raising her voice and ranting. She says she felt embarrassed and intimidated.  Using that as evidence of the mother&#8217;s temper, the father says that both of them were arguing on the date of this incident, and that the argument resolved by them going into separate rooms.

In August 2021 the mother was about six months&#8217; pregnant.  On 8 August 2021 the father wrote in his diary that he could not stop thinking about sex, and sex with B. He talks about falling asleep thinking about sex with her and having &#8220;wild fantasies&#8221; about her. It is in this diary entry he says &#8220;she&#8217;s like a drug&#8221;.  Mother&#8217;s counsel suggests that this shows the father was feeling sexually frustrated at that time, and further that because he did not start his affair with her until early 2022, the frustration which was being written about in August 2021 was at a high level by December 2021. That might be right: or it might not be. The fantasies about B written in August 2021 might represent the father&#8217;s  normal sexual state, irrespective of whether he was having sex with the mother or not. It is not the mother&#8217;s case that there was no consensual sex between her and the father between August and December. It may be that the father was able to relieve any sexual frustration he may have had in the course of his normal sexual relationship with the mother. I am not able to say whether that is so. What I am able to say is that this diary entry, on its own, is insufficient to persuade me that by December 2021 the father was necessarily seething with frustrated sexual desire. </span></p>

It says &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel like I will last much longer&#8221;. He does not say what he means by that, but goes on to talk about feeling like a failure because he will never have a relationship like that of his parents.  He says &#8220;I feel sad thinking  that I&#8217;ll not be there to help my boys or daughter, if I go. Guilt is also heavy as my daughter might not know her father&#8221;. This entry is relied on by the mother as part of a picture of what she says is growing sexual frustration, but in my view there is nothing in this diary entry to link it to sex.  The natural meaning appears to be that the father is very low and even thinking about no longer living.  That could be caused by lack of sex, but it could be caused by other things &#8211; by arguing with the mother for example and not having the kind of relationship his parents have. Indeed later in the same entry the father links his low feeling to dyslexia, Aspergers and pectus excavatum (an abnormal development in the breast bone).  Those seem to be the issues at the root of this diary entry. I am not able to say that this diary entry adds to any picture there might be of growing sexual frustration. The mother relies on no further evidence in support of her case that the father was sexually frustrated in December 2021. I can not find that the evidence she has relied on is enough to persuade me that it is more likely than not that the father was particularly sexually frustrated at that time. </span></p>

It is hard to see why they were felt to be relevant to contact but rape and strangulation were not.  It is even harder to see why the issue of staring at Cs&#8217; private parts would have been left out as that appears to be a current concern about a direct sexual risk to C.  I find the mother&#8217;s explanation for the omissions to be somewhat short of the mark. An alternative explanation is that the omitted matters were left out of the letter because the mother had not told her lawyers about them at that stage. On balance, that seems to me more likely given the gravity of the allegations and the importance of including them in the letter if they had been known about.  That of course does not mean that the allegations are not true, but it raises the possibility that the allegations may have been made up later. It also goes to the issue of credibility, as the mother has said that she did tell her lawyers at the time, and I have found that to be unlikely. </span></p>

However it does cast doubt on the way she characterises the relationship. Her characterisation, taking her evidence as a whole, is one in which the father was frightening, unpredictable and abusive and in which she was nothing other than the recipient of that abuse.  I do not accept that was the dynamic of the relationship. The text messages show that she sometimes made him sleep on the sofa. That is not in dispute.  She did, then, have some power in the relationship. Her power can also be seen in her summoning him to run her a bath, and after they had split up, in March 2022, her sending him to the shops to bring her wine, bin bags, orange juice and rocket. She felt able to supervise his contact and was able to insist on that when the parties first separated. And she has displayed aggressive, angry confrontational behaviour to a third party which she has denied.  </span></p>

I accept that it could very well have happened the way the mother said. But in this case there is an absence of a pattern of physical violence from the father, there is an absence of any photographs of bruising or cuts, there is an absence of the mother having told her friend about it and there is no evidence, in my view, of an imbalance in the dynamic between the parties which would make such behaviour on the part of the father likely. I can not rule out that the incident occurred as the mother alleges. But taking the evidence as a whole, I can not find that there is enough evidence to substantiate the allegation, and I therefore </span><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman'">make no finding. </span></p>

The father vehemently denies the allegation. On behalf of the mother a thorough line of questioning was put to Dr Dowd about the father&#8217;s diary entries referring to an interest in &#8220;girls&#8221;.  Dr Dowd said there was no evidence the father&#8217;s interest in girls was paedophilic (or indeed paraphilic), and that was borne out by the father being able to say who the three named &#8220;girls were&#8221;. All are adult women. Likewise a robust line of questioning was put to the father about the way in which his early sexual experiences had been of looking at his sister&#8217;s vagina when she was a child. The implication appeared to be that because the first vagina he had seen was a child&#8217;s, and that had been one from which he received sexual pleasure, that he would be likely to have a sexual interest in female children.  The father simply denied it. I note that Dr Dowd was well aware of the mother&#8217;s allegation of staring, and was aware of the father&#8217;s earlier experience. He still concluded that the father posed no sexual risk to C. I did not hear anything in the cross examination of either witness which caused me to doubt Dr Dowd&#8217;s assessment. </span></p>

The implication appeared to be that there was an unknown risk. With respect, I do not agree with that analysis which appears to contain within it a confusion between &#8220;undiagnosed&#8221; and &#8220;unassessed&#8221;. The father has been assessed, and has been found to have no diagnosis. That is not the same thing as being &#8220;undiagnosed&#8221;. I do not accept that he is undiagnosed.  As to his being untreated, whilst it is true that he has not yet had the therapy which Dr Dowd considers he requires, Dr Dowd was clear that the purpose of any such therapy was to help the father himself and to alleviate any </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">indirect</span><span style="font-style:normal;font-family:'Times New Roman'"> risk to C. It was not needed to reduce direct sexual risk to C, since that was not a feature of the case.  That being so, the fact of him being &#8220;untreated&#8221; is not relevant to my consideration of this allegation, which is an allegation about him being a direct sexual risk.</span></p>

None of the submissions or cross examination on this topic caused me to change my view. The fact that the mother did not mention this allegation in her solicitor&#8217;s letter of 22 August 2022 or in her conversation with the Cafcass officer casts further doubt on the allegation.

I find that </span><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman'">the father poses no direct sexual risk to C, but his sexual behaviours create an indirect risk to her. An example of an indirect risk would be his having had a relationship with his ex-partner which contributed to the breakdown of his relationship with C&#8217;s mother, with consequences for C. As a further example of an indirect risk (but not making any finding that it applies in this case) if the father (or any father) were to engage in the use of sex workers that could have an indirect impact on the child in terms of the family&#8217;s financial resources being used for that, and in terms of the implications for a child if their father&#8217;s activities are disclosed in a public forum. I give these examples to make it clear that an indirect risk is not a risk of the child being exposed to pornography or witnessing sexual activity by her father. Those would be direct risks, and I have made it clear they do not apply in this case. </span></p>

It is clear that there has been bad behaviour within this relationship. I have already said I do not accept the mother&#8217;s characterisation of the relationship as a whole, and I have found that she has had some power and control in the relationship.  I prefer the father&#8217;s characterisation that this was a relationship which featured arguments.  I do not doubt that the mother often found these distressing and that she told her friend about them, albeit sometimes in exaggerated form. I do not doubt that she considers herself a victim. But I remind myself of the definition of domestic abuse and the case law quoted at the start of this judgment.  I have not made any findings which amount to physical, sexual, emotional, psychological, economic or other abuse. I have made no findings as to violent or threatening behaviour or controlling coercive behaviour.  I have considered both the individual allegations in the schedule but also the overall characterisation of the relationship, in other words the parties&#8217; narratives. Within the arguments which the parties had there may have been bad behaviour on one or both sides, but I remind myself that not all directive, assertive, stubborn or selfish behaviour, will be &#8216;abuse&#8217; in the context of proceedings.  Although this has been an unhappy relationship, and one which caused both parties distress, </span><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman'">I do not find that it has been an abusive relationship. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-style:normal;font-family:'Times New Roman'">This has been an unusual case. The diaries, and the father&#8217;s willingness to take ownership of them and to discuss them, has set it apart from the ordinary run.  Having considered the overarching issues of the case I find that I can understand why the mother was horrified at what she read in the diaries. However it is my view that much of the difficulty in this case has been caused by various people taking what I consider to be the wrong view of those diaries.  I note, for example, the description of them in the mother&#8217;s solicitor&#8217;s letter which characterises the contents as &#8220;inappropriate sexual behaviour including a sexual relationship with your sister&#8221;. In my opinion this is the wrong description. The correct description would have been &#8220;the sexual abuse of the father as a child&#8221;.  I cannot help but think that if it had been a little girl who had been abused by her older brother it is likely that that is the description (substituting &#8220;mother&#8221; for &#8220;father&#8221;) that would have been used. I am concerned that there is a double standard here. As it was, the view taken, namely that the father had engaged in inappropriate sexual behaviour with his sister, has led into a cul-de-sac of anxiety and blame. We must now come out of that cul-de-sac and accept the father for what he is: an abused child who poses no direct sexual risk to his daughter.</span></p>

In light of the outcome of this fact-finding hearing, and in light of the overwhelmingly positive contact reports,  it is my view that that needs to be urgently increased, and that it can now become unsupervised. I would be grateful if the parties would have discussions on that basis and try to reach an agreed way forward before the next hearing. </span></p>

If that cannot be achieved, the parties are asked to consider the terms of a direction for a s7 report. I hope that will not be necessary. S7 reports are currently taking 23 weeks, and it will not be in the interests of C to have her parents continue this litigation into 2025 when they should now be focussed on her, and not on court proceedings. </span></p>
