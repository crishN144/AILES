	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">On 28 September 2018 His Honour Judge North made an order in the Norwich family court which provided for a child, MFS, (born in September 2010) to live with his father MS. This represented a change in the child&#8217;s living arrangements; previously he lived with the mother. The move was implemented that night. The order also provided for time that the child was to spend with the mother; that time was to be professionally supervised in the first instance. His mother, PP, seeks permission to appeal against that order. I hope the parties will forgive me if I refer to them in this judgment as the mother, the father, and the child. Before HHJ North the mother was represented by leading counsel, the father appeared in person, and the child was represented by counsel instructed by his Guardian Siobhan Duffy.  </p>

The mother seeks that the order be set aside. The appellant&#8217;s notice was filed some 5 weeks out of time. In between the final hearing and the lodging of the appellant&#8217;s notice she had parted company with the solicitors and counsel who represented her at the final hearing and had instructed new solicitors and leading counsel.   </p>

For reasons which at the moment are unclear to me, that order is said not to have reached the parties until early January 2019. The order provided for the hearing to be listed in consultation with counsels&#8217; clerks and a hearing date of the 17 &#8211; 18 March 2019 was chosen. The Appeals Office records show the order being sent out on that date and the delay being caused by counsels&#8217; clerks not fixing the matter until 22 January 2019. </p>

	    <intro>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The effect of the delay in progressing the appeal means that the order has been implemented and the child has been living with his father, stepmother, half-brother and stepsiblings for a little under 6 months. That being so, even if the appeal were successful the order that might have been made on appeal would have been far from straightforward. The issue that might have been remitted to the family court might have been fundamentally different to that which was determined by HHJ North. Unless the appeal court not only set aside the family court order but also directed that in the interim the child was to return to live with his mother (with a probable change in school linked to that), in considering any remitted case the court would perhaps have been considering not whether the child should move from his primary carer </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">On 11 March 2019, the appellant lodged an application for permission to rely on fresh evidence. At the outset of the hearing Mr Feehan QC submitted that the recent statement of the appellant mother dealt with her perspective of recent events relating to contact. The statement had been submitted in particular because in the father&#8217;s response to the appeal he had included material which gave his account of how the child had settled into his care and how contact had been working. This was also accompanied by a letter from the child&#8217;s new school, which was positive about how he had settled and his relationships at school and at home. Mr Feehan QC submitted that the statement might also illustrate that some of the judge&#8217;s conclusions might be wrong. However given that an appeal is no place to determine contested issues of fact relating to contact he sensibly indicated that he would be content that I read it simply to ensure that the mother was reassured that I had both sides of the story. I have thus read her statement for that purpose. Included within that statement was a letter which the child appears to have written to his mother and which was amongst some material given to her on 11 November. It asks that I give his mum one more chance and that he should be allowed to go back to his old school. He says he misses his mummy and friends and says his mummy does everything for him. He says he wants to see his mummy and that he misses her. The contents of the statement generally in terms of what the child says and what the mother says broadly represent a continuation of the sorts of behaviours demonstrated in the evidence prior to the final hearing. The mother also produces a letter from Dr Ahmed, the neurologist. It seems he has not had access to the reports of Dr Willemsen or Dr Blincow but he expresses the view that the type of illness he had diagnosed could not be imposed on a child. In the absence of access to the other reports this does not represent any real change from the position before HHJ North. </p>

This was no doubt the reason why Knowles J listed the application in the way that she did. </p>

The report identified a positive but undeveloped attachment with the father. It identified a possible insecure attachment of an anxious/ambivalent nature in respect of the child and the mother. He concluded that the child/father relationship was sufficiently positive to enable the child to make a direct transition to the father albeit he noted there would be distress. He noted that the mother had identified the need to make changes but noted that evidence of change was largely missing from her statement.

Dr Blincow was instructed and provided a report on 28 June 2018. He concluded that the child was probably suffering from an emotional disorder of childhood linked to anxiety and stress rather than OCD or Tourette&#8217;s. He considered the stress arose from the parental situation i.e. the conflict that he has been subject to and to having imbibed a very negative view of his father as well as his stepmother. He could not rule out that he had learnt the OCD/Tourette&#8217;s conditions and being encouraged to elaborate and continue them. He considered that the doctors who had made the diagnosis needed to see the full picture. He identified that a change of residence would alleviate stress if the court concluded that the mother had encouraged the child to form an unnecessary and unrealistically negative view of the father. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The section 37 report was prepared by Ms Leahy. At paragraph 3 she sets out the nature of the enquiry that she undertook. It is clearly a very wide-ranging one drawing upon information from a very wide range of sources.  It is of note that as long ago as September 2012 the mother did not want the father to have unsupervised contact with the child away from her home. The mother made further contact in December 2012 after the father had been granted contact with the child to be supervised by his family. The mother wanted social services to supervise the visit. In early 2013 the mother made allegations to Cafcass which appeared to be different in substance and seriousness to those she had reported to social services. The history set out by Ms Leahy he is drawn from the documentary records. A very clear picture emerges of the involvement of the police and social services relating largely to the mother&#8217;s concerns about the father. No action was taken by social services; they plainly do not consider that the mothers concerns were made out. Contact between social services and the family continued down the years. In June 2016 they became involved because the child&#8217;s school has expressed concern that the mother was preventing contact with his father. In March 2017 they were contacted by the child&#8217;s then school who reported a </p>

The social worker conducted a number of meetings with the child. He could say nothing nice about his father and shared a range of complaints about his father and his father&#8217;s partner. The social worker noted a positive relationship between the child and his mother and that the mother was encouraging the child in respect of contact. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The contact notes which are referred to in this report show that at the first session the child appeared to be relaxed,  confident and happy in his father&#8217;s company. He was described as chatting smiling and laughing with the father. The mother said that after the child came out of contact he was upset. Since then none of the sessions went ahead. Mr Feehan  submitted that the records showed that the mother had been encouraging of contact. Whilst it is true that some of them do show that they also record the mother behaving in a way which was bound to be discouraging of contact; see for instance 3 September 2017. The references in the section 37 report to the psychological assessment by Dr Willemsen are limited. Whilst of course one cannot gauge the impact of that report merely by reference to how frequently it appears or how much of the report it takes up there is no sense from the report of that dominating the evaluation. The evaluation is clearly a broad-based one which draws together a wide range of evidential sources which is set out over some 33 pages. The professional judgment which is set out over the last 10 odd pages weaves together material from earlier section 7 report, from the child, from the parents, from the psychological assessment, from the school from the treating doctors. The social worker identifies evidence entirely independent of Dr Willemsen&#8217;s report which suggests that the mother has undermined his contact with his father. She recognises the possibility that he has taken on his mother&#8217;s negative feelings. She relies on research in relation to children who have been alienated from one parent and based on her own observations concludes that the child displays indications of alienation. Ultimately she concludes at paragraph 9.1, where she draws the sources of evidence together which lead to her conclusion that the child has been exposed to pure alienation by his mother. The phrase derives from a paper by Kay Woodall. She concludes that the child&#8217;s behaviour and his views are consistent with those of an alienated child. This is entirely independent of Dr Willemsen.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In the Guardian&#8217;s initial report when she was a Cafcass reporting officer in August 2017 she identified that the child was very negative about his father but was unable to give context to what he said. She noted that the school had reported that the child was unsettled following contact and that his behaviour and well-being had deteriorated. She noted that from the contact reports the first visit had gone well and that the child had been comfortable and relaxed. The feedback from the contact centre suggested that the mother was being obstructive over arranging visits [#41]. She observed that the child&#8217;s anxiety was likely to relate to being very confused and unclear about where his loyalties should lie in regard to his parents. She noted that the contact records showed the child was comfortable with his father but that at the second session he said he didn&#8217;t want to see his father and he was negative about him to the Guardian. At paragraph 50 of her report she identified her concern that the child had been influenced to feel negativity towards his father. She wondered whether the school&#8217;s observation was due to his experiences with his father or him feeling disloyal to his mother on his return. It was on this basis that she recommended that Essex County Council be invited to undertake a section 37 report and that the court  appoint a Guardian for the child. It is thus clear that long before Dr Willemsen came on the </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In her second report from March 2018 she identified concerns about the mother&#8217;s capacity to promote contact. This was based on her own discussions with the mother about her proposals for contact. She also noted that the behaviour of the child in contact was indicative of an alienated child who was comfortable and relaxed when with his parent but may become rejecting of that parent within the proximity of the more favoured parent. She also observed the mother not encouraging contact but rather telling the child that she would get into trouble if he did not go to contact. The Guardian did not observe the child to be fearful of his father in contrast to the mother&#8217;s case. When speaking to the child he was entirely positive about his mother and grandparents, and negative about his father. He was unable to give context or reasons for his views of his father and the Guardian thought that his expressed views were disproportionate to any of the reasons the child had previously given. She identified that her observations were similar to those noted by the local authority social worker and that he idealises one parent and devalues the other. Ms Duffy sets out a very short summary of Dr Willemsen&#8217;s report. She also refers to the section 37 report. There is no greater reliance on Dr Willemsen&#8217;s report than there is on the section 37 report.  In her discussions with the mother and based on her written evidence the Guardian concluded that the mother had not taken any accountability or shown any insight into the concerns raised both by Dr Willemsen and the section 37 report.  She refers back to the 2013 Cafcass report when the author stated that from his enquiries the mother has demonstrated that she is not able to promote ongoing contact between MFS and Mr S. Mr Feehan submitted that having to rely on a 2013 piece of evidence illustrated the weakness of the Guardian&#8217;s analysis. On the contrary it suggests that the author of that report had identified an issue which had not ameliorated over the ensuing 5 years. The earlier report also identified that in 2013 when he was only 3 years old the child had been led into saying his father had hit him at the weekend and a video clip from 2013 demonstrated the maternal grandfather saying negative things to the child about his father. The Guardian expressed concern that the mother was asserting that the child had OCD and Tourette&#8217;s when there was no medical basis for this and was relaying inaccurate information about the father. The Guardian herself identified the potential unreliability of the diagnoses obtained by the mother given that observations of the child&#8217;s behaviour were not observed either by the Guardian, the social worker, the school or Dr Willemsen. In reaching her conclusion that supported a transfer of residence the Guardian relied on a host of matters. There is no sense that Dr Willemsen&#8217;s evidence was given undue weight. In fact it appeared to coincide with much that the Guardian had herself observed for much that the social worker had observed. </p>

He also noted that contact had been taking place between the father and the child&#8217;s since the adjourned first final hearing and he considered that the observations he had made then might have had some effect but ultimately and despite Dr Blincow&#8217;s report the mother still sought a reduction in contact to remove overnights.

He submitted that in the circumstances of a case such as this, where radical changes in the living arrangements for a child were being made, that time was of the very essence. He submitted that an application for a stay ought to have been immediately made to the trial judge and if refused to the appeal judge. Failing that the lodging of an appellant&#8217;s notice within a shorter timeframe than the 21 days should have been done to enable the court to consider whether the order ought to be stayed (or reversed) pending the full hearing of the appeal. He submitted that it was simply unacceptable for the mother to await the availability of her chosen leading counsel when others would no doubt have been available. As a result of the mother&#8217;s dilatoriness, the child has now settled into a new status quo having changed home and school. </p>

It means that the child has completed the move to his father and has begun to settle into his new existence. That has now been for 6 months. Given the child had moved on the day the decision was taken the need for expedition was particularly acute. The consequences of the late appeal have had a direct impact on the child&#8217;s welfare in that it is now effectively not possible to recreate the previous arrangements without causing further upset to the child. In cases where a transfer of primary care is the outcome and an appeal is proposed the ideal would be for an application for permission and a stay to be applied for prior to the implementation of the transfer; even if this means an urgent application to the appeal court. </p>

It appeared clear from the minutes of the experts meeting that OCD was identified as principally a mental health issue and thus within the expertise of a psychiatrist but that Tourette&#8217;s syndrome was a neurodevelopmental issue which was within the competence of a psychologist. Inevitably in respect of a number of conditions the boundary between psychology and psychiatry may not be entirely clear and there are many cases where either a psychologist or a psychiatrist might validly opine on a matter. Clearly there are others where the issue would fall squarely and exclusively within the expertise of a psychiatrist or a psychologist. I do not accept that any offering of an opinion by Dr Willemsen in his first report as to the child's presentation was outwith his expertise.  He observed that there was no evidence of  OCD or Tourette's disorder. His conclusion that the child's allegations against the father and paternal family were caused by the negativity of the mother was a causal link that he was entitled to make on the basis of his assessment of the parents and the child. He was specifically asked to comment on the ability of the parents to support and promote the relationship with the other and if they cannot do so what is the impact upon the child. In order to answer this question Dr Willemsen was well within his remit in expressing the views he did. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">No one could argue with the general proposition which Mr Feehan asserts. However of course within any case there will be a range of facts and a range of disputes over them. Whilst it is of course not for an expert to determine a core fact (i.e. whether the father had hit the child) this does not prevent an expert basing his assessment on the penumbra of facts which accompany such cases. Thus Dr Willemsen was perfectly entitled to take into account all of the material which shed light upon the mother's attitude to the child's relationship with his father. Whether this was contained within Cafcass reports, the fathers or mothers written statements, his interviews with them, his direct experience of booking appointments with them, videos he was shown, his observations of the mother and child, his observations of the child and the father these were all matters he was entitled to take into account. In the same way as a penumbra may surround a judgment so a penumbra will surround an experts report. It would be impossible (particularly with limits now imposed upon the length of experts reports) for them to make reference to every particular piece of information or evidence that they have relied upon. Of course, if their analysis and conclusions are plainly inconsistent with the weight of the evidence that may call into question the reliability of their conclusion. In this case Dr Willemsen's conclusions are consistent with the </p>
	  </intro>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">weight of all of the other evidence in the case. Had he concluded that the evidence demonstrated that the mother was supportive of the child's relationship with the father that would have called into question his judgment. Mr Feehan submitted that Dr Willemsen had taken against the mother and his criticism of the mother in relation to missed appointments was an example of this when she had valid reasons for missing them. I do not accept this. He was able to judge whether the mother&#8217;s explanations for not bringing the child to appointments were valid or not. The fact that there is a symmetry with other examples down the years of the mother giving excuses for failed contacts tends to support the validity of his interpretation rather than to undermine it.  </p>

That does not mean that the expert has to <span style="font-weight:bold">refer</span> to all material facts in giving his opinion. Again it would simply be impossible for him so to do within the confines of a user-friendly and page limit compliant report. Mr Feehan&#8217;s principal complaint is that Dr Willemsen did not refer to the material which shows that the mother was supportive of the child's relationship with the father and encouraged him to go to contact. With the greatest respect to Mr Feehan those references which he took me to were so limited in number but also in substance against the very considerable body of other material which illustrated the mother's obstructiveness or lack of support for contact down the years that they could not possibly have made any difference to Dr Willemsen&#8217;s conclusions. It is selfevident that he did not set out all of the material which pointed towards the mother&#8217;s obstructiveness but rather made some discrete selections to illustrate the point. The material from the section 37 report compellingly illustrates the mother's negative attitude towards the father over the period 2013 to 2017. The judgment of HHJ Murfitt concluded in respect of one occasion that an enforcement order would not be appropriate for technical reasons although she found the underlying facts were established which demonstrated the mother being obstructive; one she found both were to blame, and one she found the mother had a reasonable excuse and another she found to the criminal standard that the mother failed to comply and had no reasonable excuse. The notes from the supervised contact sessions did record the mother encouraging the child to have contact but also showed the mother putting the child off going to contact.  </p>

Mr Feehan submitted that it was clear from this letter that the mother had been advised by the local authority to suspend contact and yet this had been held against her. Whilst it is clear that the letter referred to the obligation on the mother to protect the child and the need to suspend contact if that was necessary, of course the local authority are advising based on the mother&#8217;s and the school&#8217;s report. Insofar as one can say that when a local authority tell a parent that if they consider their child is at risk of harm they should take steps to protect them it could be said that the mother had acted on the advice of the local authority. However they of course did not know what the situation on the ground was. If the mother was behaving in such a way as to generate anxiety in the child and the child was thus demonstrating anxiety upon his return from contact both the school and social workers would act accordingly and advise accordingly. However it would be on the basis of a false premise. Ultimately HHJ North concluded that what the child had said about his </p>

This was based primarily on his conclusion that the father was a credible witness and observations of their relationship. Thus it was the mother's anxiety and her negativity which generated the anxiety and complaints from the child. She thus bears ultimate responsibility for creating a situation which enabled her to suspend contact. </p>

True it was that 3 months later after the father had issued an application the mother offered supervised contact. The offering of supervised contact in June 2017 in substitution for alternate weekend and half the holidays was hardly a fulsome demonstration of her supporting contact. The evidence from many other sources pointed entirely the opposite direction. The mother&#8217;s interviews with Dr Willemsen illustrated her negativity. Ultimately her evidence to the court was that she wanted to reduce contact from overnights and given the judge&#8217;s finding on her credibility (based on her acceptance that she would say anything to keep her child) it is unsustainable to assert that the failure by Dr Willemsen to explicitly refer to a small number of evidential points which could be deployed to argue that the mother was supportive of contact, in any way undermines the general tendency of the evidence or the reliability of his conclusions.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The other point relied upon by Mr Feehan in particular was that in his conclusions Dr Willemsen emphasised the mother&#8217;s negativity about the father but not the father&#8217;s negativity about the mother. Mr Feehan QC is right in noting that the father did say many negative things about the mother to Dr Willemsen. However critically there was no evidence that the father had been negative about the mother to the child. In fact supervised contact sessions suggested that the father was positive about the mother. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">Mr Feehan&#8217;s submission that the mother&#8217;s account to Dr Willemsen of the father was not negative in the same way simply does not bear analysis. Her meeting with Dr Willemsen was dominated by the issue of the father having OCD or Tourette&#8217;s, his unpredictability, his aggressiveness, the risk he posed to the child, the risk his partner posed, his intrusive thoughts, his sick thoughts. Given what the child had said to various professionals and the disconnect between his relationship with his father when it was observed and his reported complaints it was hardly an unsupportable leap for Dr Willemsen to find a causal connection. Thus the mother&#8217;s negativity about the father was being transmitted to the child and thus became of central importance in a way that the father&#8217;s negativity about the mother did not. The difference is therefore explicable and in no way undermines the reliability or objectivity of his report. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Feehan QC in particular identifies paragraph 70 of Dr Willemsen's report as being devastating. He says<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;the negativity is portrayed by the mother and her father through his comments at MFS's school, are in my view, the reason for MFS's allegations against his father and the paternal family. The mother makes every effort to ensure that MFS must suppress his loving feelings for his father so that MFS only loves her. The evidence of this split, of separating his loving and hateful feelings between his parents, is clear on page E22 of the court bundle where MFS places or negative feelings with his father and all positive feelings with his mother.&#8217;</span> This is a reference to what is now D25 of my bundle. This is the Guardian&#8217;s report (which self-evidently predates Dr Willemsen&#8217;s report and thus cannot be susceptible to infection) and refers to how the child completed some worksheets with Ms Duffy which does illustrate the splitting referred to by Dr Willemsen. There are many other examples within the bundle of the mother expressing negative thoughts about the father or indeed the grandfather being videoed saying to the child that his father is a horrible man. Dr Blincow concluded that the child was not suffering from Tourette's or OCD as diagnosed by the neurologist and child psychiatrist the mother had taken him to but rather was affected by an emotional disorder of childhood. This is attributed to the parental situation. This was not as characterised by Mr Feehan merely the parental conflict but rather was specifically identified at paragraph 4.2.4 &#8216;...<span style="font-style:italic">as the conflict that he has been subject to amidst having imbibed a very negative view of his father as well as his stepmother</span>.&#8217; Mr Feehan's suggestion that there was no evidence of the mother's distress being projected onto the child (as referred to in paragraph 76 of Dr Willemsen's report) was also a conclusion he was entitled to reach. There is much evidence of the mother&#8217;s inability to contain her negative feelings and there are examples of her distress being evident to others; in particular the Cafcass safeguarding officer. It is clear from the Cafcass safeguarding letter that the mother was distressed on the telephone and terminated the call. It is inconceivable that the Cafcass officer could have mistaken extreme distress for a bad line. Dr Willemsen plainly was not only relying on this. He specifically refers in his report to her demonstrating such behaviour in the course of the interview. It seems to me this opinion is plainly within his expertise and is plainly derived from material from which that conclusion could be drawn. The fact that Dr Blincow also considered that the child did not have Tourette&#8217;s or OCD but rather that in particular in the mothers company he demonstrated symptoms of them and the mother reported them in ways not noted by the school, the father or other experts and professionals all were capable of coalescing into the conclusion that Dr Willemsen reached. </p>

Given what the mother said to him and which was repeated to others including the Guardian and the court it was quite clear that the mother had not changed her attitude to the father. She having said to Dr Willemsen that she needed to change, several months later it was clear she had been unable to achieve any change, as was apparent </p>

The Guardian had identified a concern about influence by August 2017. This concern gained further traction both from Dr Willemsen but also from the section 37 report and the evidence contained therein but also from Dr Blincow&#8217;s report, and the mother&#8217;s interaction with the Guardian. Again there is simply no detectable basis for the contention that the guardians analysis was corrupted by Dr Willemsen&#8217;s evidence. HHJ North considered the criticisms made by the mother&#8217;s counsel of the Guardian and rejected them. There is no basis for challenging that conclusion. </p>

Secondly, while it may well be in the best interests of children to change their living arrangements if one of their parents is frustrating their relationship with the other parent who is able to offer them a good and loving home, this is unlikely to be in their best interests while that relationship is in fact being maintained in accordance with the court order.&#8217; </span></p>

On further exploration Mr Feehan acknowledged that the judgment was adverse to a limited degree. He submitted that the reason contact had been suspended by the mother in March 2017 was as a result of the local authority recommending that it be suspended and that when the father brought the matter to court the mother immediately offered supervised contact. He submitted that thereafter the records of supervised contact demonstrated that the mother had been encouraging to the child about having contact with his father and that difficulties with the child engaging in contact could not be laid at her door. </p>

HHJ North recognised that since March 2018 a degree of stability of contact had been achieved. However he was perfectly entitled to reach the view that this was within the context of ongoing court proceedings. The view of all concerned was that once the spotlight shifted away from the mother as a result of the termination of court proceedings the problems were likely to re-emerge given the absence of any change in attitude by the mother. In her statement of 6 February 2018, the mother acknowledged that there needed to be a fundamental change in her perception in respect of [the child's] father in order for the child to feel that he is permitted to have a relationship with his father. HHJ North's conclusions about the mother's evidence make quite clear that the mother had made little if any progress in changing her perception of the father. </p>

A decision to leave the child with his mother would have been a most unusual outcome on that evidence and would have called for a very clear explanation support. Thus the decision was not wrong from an appellate perspective. Rather it was right. In proportionality terms this was a decision which I conclude falls within either category (i) or perhaps (ii) in Re B terms. In other words it was either the only possible view or a view which I consider was right. The change of primary carer was plainly the decision that was in this child&#8217;s best interests and it was plainly a proportionate rather than a disproportionate order on the evidence. </p>
