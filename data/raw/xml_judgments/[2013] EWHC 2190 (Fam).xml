	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This judgment addresses the important issue of the circumstances in which representatives of the media should be excluded from attending family proceedings. Reporting of the proceedings is restricted, but I am authorising publication of this judgment including the names of the children. However, reporting of any further detail of the circumstances of the children and of the arrangements for their care remains prohibited. The issue arises in the course of care proceedings which I am conducting in the Family Division. For the purposes of this judgment it is unnecessary to recite the facts of the proceedings in any detail beyond a broad outline, much of which is, in any event, already widely known. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2012, five members of the Al-Hilli family from Surrey &#8211; Saad Al-Hilli, his wife, their two daughters, Zainab, then aged seven, and Zeena, then aged four, and Mrs Al-Hilli&#8217;s mother &#8211; were travelling in their car on holiday in Annecy in France when they were attacked by a gunman. The three adults in the car, and a passing cyclist, were shot dead. The older child, Zainab, was assaulted and badly injured. The younger child, Zeena, escaped without physical harm, apparently by hiding behind her mother&#8217;s skirts. The case attracted, and continues to attract, world-wide media attention. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The tragic death of their parents made Zainab and Zeena orphans, with no person having legal parental responsibility for them. Initially, it was not possible for the children to be placed in the care of members of the extended family because one line of the police investigation concerned the possible involvement of family members in the murders. As a result, Surrey County Council started care proceedings in respect of the two girls. Zeena was returned to the United Kingdom on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September and placed with foster carers. Zainab recovered sufficiently from her physical injuries to be discharged from hospital and be placed with her sister. Both girls remain in foster care with the support of a care plan devised by the local authority.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In view of the seriousness of the case, the proceedings were transferred to the High Court and have been reserved to me. The principal issue arising in the proceedings is whether the children should be placed with two members of the extended family, who have been joined to the proceedings and are represented by leading and junior counsel. A substantive hearing is listed to take place shortly at which the court will consider various matters concerning the proposed placement, including the level of any risk to the girls. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The investigation into the killings by the police and the French prosecution authorities is ongoing. The Surrey Constabulary have been heavily involved in the investigation, in particular those aspects concerning the Al-Hilli family life in England. One line of enquiry being pursued by the investigators has been the possible involvement of a brother of Saad called Zaid Al-Hilli. It is alleged that there had been a disagreement between Saad and Zaid over an inheritance from their father. Zaid Al-Hilli has recently been assigned the status of &#8216;suspect&#8217; and arrested, interviewed and released on bail.</p>

Any person contributing to such proceedings is subject to professional secrecy under the conditions and subject to the penalties set out by articles 226-13 and 226-14 of the Criminal Code. However, in order to prevent the dissemination of incomplete or inaccurate information or to quell a disturbance to the public peace, the district prosecutor may, on his own motion or at the request of the investigating court or parties, publicise objective matters related to the procedure that convey no judgment as to whether or not the charges brought are well founded.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the event, the French prosecutor in this case has published a considerable amount of information about the investigation, and the case generally, including his understanding that the children are to be returned to the family from social care, although in fact no decision on that issue has yet been taken by this court. In addition to the information provided by the prosecutor, the case has attracted a large amount of publicity, particularly in France and in the UK. Amongst the journalists who have taken a particular interest in the case is Mr. David James Smith, a freelance journalist who writes for the Sunday Times.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, I have made a succession of reporting restriction orders, prohibiting the publication of a wide range of information concerning the girls in circumstances where such publication will be likely to lead to their identification. These orders, which remain in force, are largely drafted in what may be called the conventional terms and substantially follow the form of order set out in the CAFCASS Practice Note of 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2005. Unusually, however, the first such orders were made without notice to the media. As is made clear in the Family Procedure Rules 2010 Practice Direction 12 I (formerly the President&#8217;s Direction of 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2005) such an order should not be made without notice save where there are compelling reasons why the media should not be notified. In this case, I was satisfied that such compelling reasons existed. Subsequently, the reporting restriction orders (one covering each child) have been renewed (in an amended form) at hearings of which the media has had notice but has chosen not to contest. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, by an order dated 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2012, this court joined the Chief Constable of Surrey as a respondent to the care proceedings. It is, of course, extremely unusual for a court conducting family proceedings to take such a step. The reasons for that decision are set out in a separate judgment delivered on that date which will, I anticipate, be released for publication in due course.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2013, when Mr David James Smith attended an interim hearing, the Chief Constable applied orally and without notice for an order excluding the press from attending that and subsequent hearings. Having given Mr Smith the opportunity to make representations (which he accepted) and to take legal advice (which at that stage he declined), I made an order that the press should not be permitted to attend the rest of that hearing. At my request, however, and without prejudice to the right of Mr Smith or any other representative of the press to make representations to the court in respect of attendance at any future hearing, the local authority agreed to give advance notice to Mr Smith of the date of any future timetabled hearings and whether or not his attendance at each such hearing was opposed by any party. Mr Smith was duly notified of the next hearing on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June. He did not attend but informed the court via email that he would wish to be informed of future hearings and indicated that he might attend with counsel at the next hearing. The next directions hearing was fixed for 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July, when I was sitting on circuit. Prior to that hearing, as set out above, on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June Zaid Al-Hilli was arrested and interviewed and subsequently released on bail. </p>

I understand that Surrey Police responded the following day, setting out in brief outline the basis of their application, indicating that they would rely on Article 2 and Article 8 ECHR and the need to maintain &#8220;judicial secrecy in France, pursuant to the provisions of the French penal code.&#8221; The police did not, however, provide any formal evidence in support of their proposed application. </span>On 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July, the day before the next hearing, solicitors for TNL informed the court via email that they had instructed counsel to attend the hearing the following day with Mr Smith. Later that day, a comprehensive skeleton argument was submitted by counsel for TNL, Mr. Jonathan Scherbel-Ball, &#8220;in response to an anticipated application of Surrey Police to exclude, pursuant to FPR rule 27.11(3), accredited members of the press from a hearing in these proceedings scheduled for 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July&#8221;.</p>

I therefore adjourned the matter until the following week, when I was able to make time for a hearing covering all issues. At that hearing, attended by Mr Smith, and another journalist from the Press Association, I dealt first (in the absence of the press and their legal representatives) with the issues concerning directions in the proceedings, and then considered the application by Surrey Police for an order excluding the press from further hearings and in particular the forthcoming substantive hearing. At the conclusion of that hearing, I reserved judgment on the latter issue until today.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is widely accepted that the current rules concerning the reporting of proceedings in the family courts of this country are unsatisfactory and in need of reform. An attempt was made by Parliament shortly before the last election, resulting in Part 2 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/26" uk:canonical="2010 c. 26" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children, Schools and Families Act 2010</ref>. These provisions were the subject of very considerable criticism and the current government has indicated that it is not planning to bring them into effect. The topic of reform in this field remains, however, high on the agenda of policy makers and of the President of the Family Division, as indicated in his comments published as &#8220;View from the President&#8217;s Chambers: The Process of Reform&#8221; [2013] Fam Law 548, in which he observed (at page 549): </p>

The application of this principle of open justice has two aspects: as respects proceedings in the court itself it requires that they should be helped in open court to which the press and public are admitted and that, in criminal cases at any rate, all evidence communicated to the court is communicated publicly. As respects the publication to a wider public of fair and accurate reports of proceedings that have taken place in court the principle requires that nothing should be done to discourage this.</p>

Thus the position has been created that, whereas the media are now enabled to exercise a role of "watchdog" on the part of the public at large and to observe family justice at work for the purpose of informed comment upon its workings and the behaviour of its judges, they are unable to report in their newspapers or programmes the identity of the parties or the details of the evidence which are likely to catch the eye and engage the interest of the average reader or viewer.&#8221;</p>

It <span style="color:#000000">is for a person who wishes to exclude the media to satisfy the court of the necessity of the exclusion pursuant to one of the limited statutory criteria set out at in FPR r.27.11(3); it is not for the media to justify their attendance (see Munby J in </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">Spencer v Spencer</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"/><span style="color:#000000">at paragraph 30, and Potter P in </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">Re Child X</span><span style="color:#000000"> at paragraph 57.)

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, although the rights of the media do not extend to a right to report (save where so permitted by the court), it must not be thought that they are any less important. As noted above, in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">AG v Leveller Magazine</span>, supra, Lord Diplock identified the twin pillars of the principle of open justice as being, first, the need where possible to hold proceedings in open court to which the press and public are admitted and, secondly, the ability of the press to communicate those proceedings to the wider public. I accept the submission made by Mr. Scherbel-Ball on behalf of TNL that open justice has two components &#8211; the right to attend as well as the right to report &#8211; and the fact that the second is subject to legal restriction does not undermine the importance of the first. On the contrary, it could be argued that what has been called the &#8220;watchdog&#8221; role of the press (acknowledged and endorsed by the courts on many occasions) is even more important where the right to report is restricted. As watchdog, the press scrutinises not merely the decisions reached by the courts but also the process by which they are reached. This point was lucidly expressed by Peter Jackson J sitting in the Court of Protection in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">Hillingdon LBC v Neary</span><span style="color:#000000"> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2011/413" uk:canonical="[2011] EWHC 413 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] EWHC 413 (Fam)</ref>; [2011] COP Rep 32 at paragraph 15(4):</span></p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in"><span style="color:#000000">&#8220;there is a genuine public interest in the work of this court being understood. Not only is this healthy in itself &#8211; the presence of the media in appropriate cases has a bracing effect on all public servants, where in the field of social services or the law &#8211; but it may also help to dispel misunderstandings. It is not in the interests of individual litigants, or of society at large, for a court that is by definition devoted to the protection of the welfare of disadvantaged people to be characterised&#8230;as &#8220;secretive&#8221;. It is part of our natural curiosity to want to know other people&#8217;s secrets, and using pejorative descriptions of this kind may stimulate interest. The opportunity, in appropriate cases, to follow a process that has welfare, not secrecy, at its heart can only help the media to produce balanced reporting, and not fall back on clich&#233;s.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fourthly, the fact that the issue at stake is the right to attend means that the court&#8217;s powers are much more flexible. The question of media attendance can be addressed at any point in the hearing. Its representatives may be permitted to attend some parts of the hearing but excluded from others, if one or other of the grounds in rule 27.11(3) is satisfied. This flexibility is reflected in the Practice Direction and in particular the terms of paragraphs 6.1 and 6.2. Generally speaking, it will be harder for a party to persuade a court that the media should be excluded from the whole of a substantive hearing as opposed to a specific part: see Potter P in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re Child X </span> at paragraph 57.

Article 2 has been interpreted by the European Court of Human Rights as covering not only a negative obligation not to take the life of another person but also imposes on the State a positive obligation to take certain steps to prevent loss of life at the hands of others. As a result, it is submitted by the Chief Constable that this Court &#8211; alongside the other public authorities involved in this litigation, namely the local authority, CAFCASS and the Surrey Police &#8211; is under a positive duty to take measures to protect Zainab and Zeena from an identified risk to their lives. </span></p>

It is common ground that the State&#8217;s obligation in this respect extends beyond its primary duty to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person backed up by law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and sanctioning of breaches of such provisions. It is thus accepted by those appearing before the Court that Article 2 of the Convention may also imply in certain well-defined circumstances a positive obligation on the authorities to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual whose life is at risk from the criminal acts of another individual. &#8230;. </p>

Accordingly, not every claimed risk to life can entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take operational measures to prevent that risk from materialising. Another relevant consideration is the need to ensure that the police exercise their powers to control and prevent crime in a manner which fully respects the due process and other guarantees which legitimately place restraints on the scope of their action to investigate crime and bring offenders to justice, including the guarantees contained in Articles 5 and 8 of the Convention. </p>

For the Court, and having regard to the nature of the right protected by Article 2, a right fundamental in the scheme of the Convention, it is sufficient for an applicant to show that the authorities did not do all that could be reasonably expected of them to avoid a real and immediate risk to life of which they have or ought to have knowledge.

That case concerned a public inquiry in Northern Ireland into the death of an individual, with terms of reference directed to the conduct of the police. An application for anonymity was made on behalf of police officers whom the inquiry proposed to call as witnesses, on the ground that they would be in fear for their lives due to terrorist attack if they were publicly identified. It was contended that to compel them to give evidence without anonymity would constitute a breach of article 2. The inquiry rejected the claims, and although a judge allowed an appeal and the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland dismissed an appeal from his decision, the House of Lords allowed a final appeal on behalf of the inquiry. Having cited paragraphs 115 and 116 of the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Osman</span>, Lord Carswell, with whom the rest of the constitution agreed, observed at paragraphs 20 &#8211; 21 that two matters had become clear in the subsequent case law. </p>

It is in my opinion clear that the criterion is and should be one that is not readily satisfied: in other words, the threshold is high &#8230;. In my opinion the standard is constant and not variable with the type of act in contemplation, and is not easily reached. Moreover, the requirement that the fear has to be real means that it must be objectively well-founded &#8230;.</p>

As the ECtHR stated in paragraph 116 of Osman, the applicant has to show that the authorities failed to do all that was reasonably to be expected of them to avoid the risk to life. The standard accordingly is based on reasonableness, which brings in consideration of the circumstances of the case, the ease or difficulty of taking precautions and the resources available.&#8221;</p>

It was claimed that, were the judgment of his unsuccessful claim for judicial review to be published without the protection of anonymity, he would again be at risk to his life or of serious injury.

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in">&#8220;Both the Secretary of State and the Court are for present purposes manifestations of the state. Both have obligations towards the claimant which derive from the claimant's Convention rights. The means by which those obligations are met, however, are very different. The Secretary of State is responsible for managing the risk, if any, to the life and well being of the claimant in custody, open or closed, and, if it should occur, on his release. He will need to assess the requirement for additional steps to be taken should disclosure of the claimant's details take place. The Court's obligation is to assess the impact of disclosure upon the ability of the Secretary of State effectively to manage any risk to the claimant's life and well being. It is, in our view, material to the question whether there is or would be a real and immediate risk to the safety of the claimant occasioned by disclosure that means are available to the Secretary of State to protect the claimant from the unwelcome consequences of disclosure. The media interveners are right, in our view, to concentrate their present submissions upon the protection available to the claimant in closed conditions and, if necessary, in a VPU environment, since those are the conditions in which the claimant will be held in the near future whether or not disclosure takes place. If the Secretary of State has the means at his disposal, by taking reasonable steps, to protect the claimant from the risks inherent in disclosure, that is a matter which the Court must consider when assessing its own obligation to take "necessary" steps.&#8221;</p>

It is accepted that no formal evidence has been filed by the police but asserted by Miss Barton and Mr. Cohen that there is no obligation to do so. At most, a party seeking to exclude the media should merely indicate in outline the basis for the application and in this case the solicitor for the police provided an outline in correspondence with TNL. In any event, the events of 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September are very well known. The children were the victims of an attack upon their family. Three members of their family were killed in that attack and Zainab suffered life-threatening injuries and would have died but for prompt and skilled medical intervention. Zeena successfully hid from the attacker. A French cyclist at the scene was also killed. It is reasonable to infer from those facts that the attacker intended to kill all those present. The girls were thus both intended victims and witnesses. The attacker is still at large. As a result, the children are in the protective care of the state. The Chief Constable contends that those facts create a real and immediate risk to the lives of the children and that article 2 is therefore engaged.</p>

The girls are themselves potentially beneficiaries of that estate. It is submitted on behalf of the Chief Constable that this reinforces the article 2 risk to the girls.

In this case, the police submit that there is a pre-existing real and immediate risk to the lives of the girls and consequently there is a positive duty on the court and the police under article 2 to take reasonable steps to mitigate the risk. The court is obliged to exclude the media because, it is submitted, the presence of the press at future hearings, and in particular substantive hearings where their future is under consideration, will increase the risk to the girls.

In particular, the international media interest in the case leads to an inevitable danger of details being published in a country beyond the reach of this Court. Miss Barton and Mr. Cohen point out that the scheme operated by the UK Press Card Authority, which has been approved by the Lord Chancellor as providing sufficient accreditation for the purposes of rule 27.11, extends to some, although not all, foreign journalists, so that there is a real risk that details of the case will be published outside the jurisdiction of the High Court.</p>

He submits that there is a strong public interest in the &#8220;bracing effect&#8221; of the press being present at any hearing to ensure that any questions of risk are not overstated or understated by the authorities and therefore that the purported risk does not have a prejudicial effect on the children&#8217;s welfare. He further argues that, in light of the high profile nature of this case and the interaction of two different jurisdictions&#8217; state authorities, there is a strong public interest in the press being able to observe and consider those interactions, to see not only whether the system functions properly and efficiently, but also to ensure that those interactions do not unfairly prejudice the welfare of the children. On a wider level, there is, he submits, a clear interest that the workings of the family courts should be transparent and open to press inspection so as to promote public confidence in the proper and fair working of the system, an issue about which TNL has established a longstanding, genuine and serious journalistic purpose.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is to my mind significant that none of the other parties support the police&#8217;s application to exclude the media. The local authority and the guardian appointed by CAFCASS are both neutral. As public authorities, they too are subject to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.6</ref> of the Human Rights Act and under a positive obligation to protect the article 2 and 8 rights of the children. That obligation would, in my judgment, extend to giving support to the police application if they had reasonable grounds for thinking that the presence of the media created or materially increased a risk of breach of those rights. The fact that they do not lend their support to the police does not, however, obviate the need for the court to reach its own conclusion on the matter since the court is under an independent duty as a public authority.</p>

In particular, they agree with the interpretation of the case law on article 2 put forward by Mr. Scherbel-Ball.

Having regard to the observations of Lord Carswell in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re Officer L</span> at paragraph 21 (quoted above) that the standard expected of a public authority is based on reasonableness and &#8220;involves consideration of the circumstances of the case, the ease or difficulty of taking precautions and the resources available&#8221;, the court should be slow to exclude the press given the assumption that they should be present, the importance of their watchdog role, in particular in this case, and the existence of sanctions in the event of a breach of the reporting restrictions. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the dreadful moments of the attack in Annecy, and in the period immediately afterwards, there was manifestly a real and immediate risk to the lives of the girls. Since then, the French authorities, the British police, the local authority, and this court have taken a series of measure, separately and together designed to reduce the risk. The girls are currently in the care of foster parents whose identity has not been published. They are living at a location which is unknown to the outside world. The arrangements for their education are also unknown, save to a limited number of professionals. The children are subject to an extensive and comprehensive protection regime devised and controlled by Surrey Police about which little if anything has been published, although an outline is known to this court. The court has imposed wide-ranging reporting restrictions in addition to the statutory limitations imposed by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.12</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65" uk:canonical="1960 (8 &amp; 9 Eliz. 2) c. 65" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Administration of Justice Act 1960</ref> and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/97/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.97(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.

I do not accept the submission made on behalf of the Chief Constable that the arrest of Zaid, and the emergence of the alleged inheritance dispute involving the grandfather&#8217;s estate from which the girls may be beneficiaries, increases the risk to the girls&#8217; lives. If (and I stress if) that was the motive for the shooting, it explains why they were the intended victims but does not add to the risk which arises from their having been intended victims.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">At the substantive hearing to take place shortly, the court will be asked to consider proposals for the future care of the girls, including proposals that they move to live with members of their extended family. The court will also be asked to consider questions of accommodation, education and therapy which will be contained in their future care plan, and also the future security measures that will be put in place to protect the girls. In the first place, evidence about those matters will be in writing, supplemented by oral evidence. As mentioned above, paragraph 2.3 of Practice Direction 27B provides that </span>&#8220;&#8230; the provisions of the rule do not entitle a media representative to receive or peruse court documents referred to in the course of evidence, submissions or judgment without the permission of the court &#8230;&#8221; The court will therefore be in a position to control the extent to which there is reference to documents in oral evidence and submissions. If I refuse the Chief Constable&#8217;s application today, it does not follow that the media will inevitably be permitted to sit through the entire hearing. On the contrary, the court and the parties retain the right, and indeed the duty, to keep the issue of their attendance under review at all points. Under rule 6.3, legal representatives and parties should ensure that witnesses are aware of the right of media representatives to attend and should notify the court at an early stage of the intention of any witness to request the exclusion of media representatives. The flexibility that characterises the Practice Direction means that the court is able to address problems, in the words of paragraph 6.2, &#8220;as they arise and by way of oral representations&#8221;. This flexibility helps to ensure that any interference with the right of the media to attend is kept to a minimum.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In addition, the court retains the power to determine which members of the press are allowed to attend. Those who are not &#8220;duly accredited&#8221; may only be permitted to attend under rule 27.11(2)(g), that is to say with the permission of the court. Those who are accredited may nevertheless be excluded if the court is satisfied that one or other of the grounds in rule 27.11(3) are satisfied. In this context, I can foresee circumstances in which the court may exclude foreign journalists who, although accredited, may escape the sanctions imposed by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65" uk:canonical="1960 (8 &amp; 9 Eliz. 2) c. 65" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Administration of Justice Act 1960</ref> and the <span style="font-style:italic">contra mundum</span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"/>reporting restrictions orders. In short, I consider that the court will retain the power to address any risk of &#8220;leakage&#8221; as and when it arises, and thereby limit any risk of prejudice either in these proceedings or to the French investigation or criminal process.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is, however, an important point that needs to be made in response to the Chief Constable&#8217;s submissions about the risk of leakage. I acknowledge the point made by Sir Mark Potter P in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re Child X</span> that the more media interest in a case, the greater the need for protection of the child and the greater the risk of leakage of information from the court. It is, however, a cardinal principle underpinning the provisions of rule 27.11, as approved not only by the President but also by Parliament, that the duly accredited representatives of news gathering and reporting organisations are to be trusted not to abuse their right to attend by publishing information unlawfully. Media representatives sit through other types of litigation that engage article 2, including some criminal proceedings, listening to information that they cannot publish. In my judgment, when evaluating the risk of leakage, the court is entitled to take into account the fact that Parliament has thought it appropriate to trust accredited representatives of the media to attend private family proceedings notwithstanding the fact that they cannot report what goes on.</p>

In addition, I accept the specific submission that in this case there is a particular public interest in the watchdog role, given the high public interest in the case, the interaction between the legal and investigatory systems of England and France, and the impact of that interaction on the girls and their welfare.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Drawing all these threads together, I conclude that there is no likelihood that the attendance of accredited representatives of the media at the substantive hearing will materially increase the risk to the girls&#8217; lives. The police have not demonstrated that there is a general risk of leakage and any specific risk that can be addressed as it arises. Accordingly, the court is not under a positive obligation under article 2 to take steps to reduce the risk by excluding the media from the outset of the hearing. The attendance of the media will not, in my judgment, substantially interfere with the article 8 rights of the girls or their carers or members of their extended family, nor, in my judgment, will it interfere with any article 6 rights either in these proceedings or elsewhere.</p>

I am not satisfied that excluding the press from the outset of the substantive hearing is either necessary in the interests of either child, or for the safety of any party, witness, or person connected with a party or witness, or that justice will be otherwise impeded or prejudiced by their attendance. </p>

The CAFCASS Practice Note of 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2005 is directed to applications for reporting restriction orders. It is to my mind clear from his judgment that the former President was only intending to import the provisions regarding service in section 4 of the CAFCASS note, as opposed to the other provisions such as those dealing with the application and evidence in support set out in section 3. As he observes at paragraph 87:</p>
