	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These have been complex public law proceedings of which this is the final judgment in respect of the welfare of the youngest of the subject children, F, who is now three and a half years old. The proceedings started as private law proceedings involving six children of varying ages of 3 inter-connected families. The Court handed down a fact-finding judgment in March 2022; multiple findings were made in respect of all the children and the s31 threshold of the Children Act (CA) 1989 crossed. Those findings included findings made against the parents (MX and FZ) of F, the subject child of this judgment. Final orders were made in respect of E (who is not related to MX, FZ or F) on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2022 and care orders in respect of her four older siblings on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2022. All those orders were made by consent.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These public law proceedings were issued by the Local Authority as it was already involved in the private law cases; the situation for the children had deteriorated to the extent that the four older siblings of F had to be accommodated by social services.  E remained with her mother, as did F because she was still an infant. MX had been living with FZ, who moved out to ensure that F was able to remain with her mother. To protect the children the identities of the children and their families have been remain anonymised.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I have said above, this judgment concerns only F, a little girl of now three and a half whose mother is MX and father FZ. It is essential that the judgment is considered in the context of the facts already found but I shall not rehearse all of my previous decisions here; in brief the background is that MX had previously lived with her husband FX and their four children. F was born following MX&#8217;s relationship with FZ which began shortly after FX had left the family home and moved in with the mother of E. The four children of MX and FX remained living with their mother but visited their father and would stay with him at the home of E and her mother. It was when they were there in July 2020 that the four children (F&#8217;s older half-siblings) complained of domestic abuse at their mother&#8217;s home perpetrated by FZ. They complained that FZ had also abused them.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This judgment, then, is to be read in conjunction with the fact-finding judgment of the Court [<span style="font-style:italic">Neutral Citation Number</span>: <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2022/12" uk:canonical="[2022] EWFC 12" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2022">[2022] EWFC 12</ref>], to which I shall return but, in brief, the relationship MX and FZ was found to be one by blighted by domestic abuse. Although there was physical abuse, it was not only that but also the coercive and controlling behaviour of FZ that extended to the children which crossed the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s31</ref><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> threshold. MX was herself found to be the victim of domestic abuse perpetrated by FZ and she was found to have failed to protect the children from the behaviour and abuse of FZ and to have neglected and abused them herself. MX made limited concessions at the end of the fact-finding hearing, but she has since effectively retracted some if not most of those concessions and in any case MX has consistently demonstrated little if any insight into the harmful effects of their upbringing on her older four children who are all the subjects of care orders. MX has always vociferously denied that FZ has been violent and she continues to deny the extent of his abuse both to herself and to her children.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When FZ moved out of what had been the home of MX and her five children in February 2021 it was only F, then an infant, who remained in her mother&#8217;s care; her older siblings were accommodated by the Local Authority. It was considered that it was in the best interests of the four older children (A, B, C &amp; D) to be placed outside the family; all five children, including F, were made the subjects of interim care orders. F remains subject to such an order with the Local Authority sharing parental responsibility. After the fact-finding judgement was handed down, both MX and FZ refused to accept the findings made and this remains their position in February 2023. At the time of the final hearing in January 2023, FZ was refusing to take up his contact with F, and had not done so since before Christmas in December 2022; he said that he found it too distressing.  The Local Authority&#8217;s care plan is supported by F&#8217;s guardian: it is that F should be placed within her father&#8217;s family with her paternal uncle and his partner in the West of England. There has been a thorough and positive assessment of this kinship placement. Thus I do not have to consider F being placed permanently outside her family (see under <span style="font-weight:bold">Law </span>below).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I must now make reference to matters that arose on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> February 2023, after the final welfare hearing in January 2023 and on the day the parties&#8217; counsel were to submit their final submissions. On 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> February it was brought to the attention of the social work team manager (MW) that an Assessor Practitioner from Local Primary Mental Health Support Services (CJ) had just spoken to FZ who was described as being in an emotional state;  he had made threats against social workers, FX (MX&#8217;s ex-husband) and his partner. MW made a statement dated 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> February 2023 which has been provided to the Court and to the parties in which it was reported that he had told CJ &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I am living here, but I shouldn&#8217;t be. I am not meant to, because I am classed as a danger to children. I do have supervised contact with [F]&#8221;</span>. CJ asked FZ to confirm this address that he said he was living at and he had given MX&#8217;s address. FZ confirmed this as F&#8217;s  address and said <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t be here, they wouldn&#8217;t re-house me during Covid, I had nowhere to go&#8221;.</span> CJ explained that she has a duty of care to report this to safeguarding to which FZ responded <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I am not living there now, can you just forget I said that&#8221;.</span> CJ reiterated that she had a duty of care to report it, to which he said <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I understand. My life has gone now honestly, they will take [F] from us straight away, there is no point now. I don&#8217;t see the point now in carrying on with this&#8221;. </span>CJ has since made a statement herself to this effect, it is dated the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2023 and has been filed and served.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On Friday 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> February, the matter went before the Designated Family Judge at the local Family Court. He approved the Local Authority&#8217;s interim care plan and F was removed from MX&#8217;s care and placed with her paternal aunt and uncle where she currently remains pending the final decision of the Court. The case came before me on Monday 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2023; I too approved the interim plan and F was left in the placement with her paternal aunt and uncle where, I was told, she had begun to settle. I considered it was not in her best interests to be subject to two precipitate moves in such quick succession and a possible third move when judgment is given. I have made it clear that the Court&#8217;s final decision will be decided on the evidence I heard in January 2023 and the previous fact-finding decisions of the Court as a whole and not on events which took place at the beginning of February. The decision in respect of F&#8217;s welfare and future placement cannot be decided on evidence which has not been challenged in court and in any case the events of 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> February 2023 would not even if proved constitute of themselves sufficient reason for the ultimate decision this Court must make.</p>

Of the six subject children final orders have been made in respect of all five older children; a final supervision order was made in respect of E who had always lived with and remains with her mother first, followed by final care orders made in respect of A, B, C and D in September 2022. These care orders were not opposed by FX and MX agreed that her older four children would remain in Local Authority care. The care orders were made on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2022. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the time of the September 2022 hearing MX and FZ were still in a relationship but assured me that they had not lived together in the former family home since FZ moved out in February 2022, which he had done to ensure F could remain with her mother. It is not in dispute that when FZ moved out it was not because he and MX felt there were any real reasons for him to do so but because they felt they were given no choice and that if FZ remained in the home F would inevitably be removed. In other words, it has been clear that for the past two years their motivation for living separately has had nothing to do with what they themselves wanted or understood to be necessary; quite the reverse. From what the Court is able to make out as it is not clear from his evidence, it is FZ&#8217;s case has been living on and off with a sister of MX and her husband AS. AS featured in the fact-finding judgment when it was found he had been overinvolved in the case and in the hostilities between the family of MX&#8217;s and FX.</p>

Dr White recommended that the &#8220;Resolutions&#8221; approach (where parents or caregivers do not accept the court&#8217;s findings but the subject children remain at home with professional intervention and support) could be considered for MX but not for FZ as he had not reach a stage where, in her opinion, any therapeutic intervention could be effective. In her view, FZ was not even at a point where he was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;pre-contemplative&#8221;,</span> to use the psychological term employed by Dr White, and she considered that findings in respect of FZ&#8217;s controlling and coercive behaviour did not indicate that he was a suitable subject for intervention. Dr White told me that in order to determine whether such intervention would be appropriate in this case at all there should be an assessment of MX carried out by someone experienced in and working with the &#8220;Resolutions&#8221; model. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In her evidence, Dr White had made it quite plain that her recommendation for further assessment was in respect of MX only as she considered that, while not pre-contemplative as such, MX was able to consider the effects of her behaviour and may be susceptible to Resolution-type intervention. Dr White suggested that an assessment of MX&#8217;s suitability for such intervention be carried out by Tracey Carboni. Unfortunately, as neither the Local Authority nor Dr White had approached Ms Carboni, there had been no initial consideration/assessment of MX&#8217;s suitability as a possible subject for a &#8216;Resolutions&#8217; intervention. There were misgivings on the part of the Local Authority, and it must be said the Court, that this kind of intervention would be either appropriate or suitable given that this was case where there were findings of domestic abuse between the parents and there were also other issues over and above that of domestic abuse as the harm suffered by the children extended beyond physical harm (typically the Resolutions approach is used when there are findings of inflicted injury which are not accepted by the parents or carers) to include significant emotional, educational and developmental harm; in short, in my fact-finding judgment I had identified a multiplicity of risk factors of likely significant harm to any child in the care of MX and FZ, which would, of course, include F.</p>

It was neither practicable nor possible for such an assessment to be carried out during the week of the hearing of the case so in fairness to F, who may be able to remain with her mother if the assessment was positive, the case was adjourned part-heard to allow Ms Carboni to assess MX as a suitable candidate for intervention and support based on Resolutions model.</p>

It is highly likely that the maternal family will continue to collude with MX&#8217;s false narrative as they did throughout these proceedings. This is bound to have long-term emotionally harmful effects for F, who will not only grow up believing that her siblings are liars who have lied about her mother and her father, but will also be taught to approach all those in authority with hostility and suspicion, affecting her ability to engage positively with wider society as she grows up. F is likely to suffer significant emotional harm, affecting her ability to make and maintain successful relationships both in her private and public life.</p>

Counsel for FZ and MX urge the Court to consider that the imposition of a protective order in the form of an injunction prohibiting FZ from attending at the home of MX and F would provide sufficient mitigation to render the making of a public law protective order unnecessary. For reasons I shall expand on I consider that this in itself proffers a disproportionate response to the risks that have been found in this case; these risks go far beyond that of FZ simply returning to the home of F and her mother. Counsel have also failed to address the issue of enforcement for there is no evidence to support any contention that MX would report FZ if he did so. The history is of damaging, harmful parenting by MX and serious and pernicious abuse by FZ. There has been significant psychological and developmental damage to MX&#8217;s other older children and evidence of it beginning with F already being told inaccurately about past events and being set up for a conflicted upbringing dominated by her mother and father&#8217;s hostility to those with whom they disagree.</p>

There is then a clear risk of the parents reunifying further down the road in my view, and this could be months or even years ahead given the fact that they have not undertaken any work to date. I agree therefore that their motivation is primarily externally located and the risk still unchanged. Furthermore coercive control does not simply &#8216;walk away,&#8217; and the function of denial in coercive control and most (not all) forms of domestic violence is linked to ongoing risk.

This means that not only was it an act of expediency (rather than one based on insight) but also that the likelihood of the separation being maintained was compromised from its outset.

In taking that stance there can be no charge of hypocrisy on her part, but that fact wholly undermines the submissions made on her behalf that the court should put protective orders in place and that if it were to those orders could be considered effective. Similarly, when FZ&#8217;s counsel pursues the imposition of protective orders or injunctions preventing his client from attending MX&#8217;s home to be imposed it is not based on concessions made by FZ, still less that he has gained insight into the risk he poses. Given that both MX and FZ continue to deny domestic abuse (and in FZ&#8217;s case all the harm he caused to the older children), it is difficult to see on what evidential basis they submit that orders could or should be made, let alone enforced. At no point has such a suggestion been made by Dr White, Ms Carboni or any other professional that the substantial deficiencies in parenting which led to the older children suffering significant harm and the concomitant likelihood of real harm to F could or should be resolved simply by the imposition of injunctions and protective orders. If the solution were that simple, they would certainly have suggested it.</p>

This can be safely inferred from her denial of past violence and abuse, and from her continuing defence of FZ and his conduct and from the fact that the limited concessions she had made in the past are now repudiated.  Furthermore, there has already been one occasion that is known about in June 2022 when FZ was found at night by police in the vicinity of MX&#8217;s home after there had been a dispute between MX and one of her neighbours. MX did not inform the Local Authority about this at the time; it only emerged months later through police disclosure.

A as the oldest has had the most manifestly damaging childhood because it was already evident at the fact-finding hearing that he had not only missed out on schooling, he had also suffered abusive treatment from a very young age because of what his parents had decided was his difficult behaviour. Not only did FX single him out at home, he also had little or no support at home from MX either with his schooling or the other developmental difficulties as a result of which A developed a language impairment. Dr P, the clinical and forensic psychologist who assessed him, highlighted A&#8217;s missed schooling and reported that his specific language impairment seems to have resolved but that A had a residual stammer.

B has a borderline learning disability which has not been assisted by missing the entirety of her first year at secondary school. Although this was accepted by MX during the fact-finding as I referred to above, in January 2023 MX once more made excuses and tried to blame others and Covid for this missed first year of secondary school.

MX was ambivalent at best in her parenting of A and B at a crucial point in their development as adolescents, during which she also repeatedly failed to protect both from the aggressive and abusive behaviour of FZ after he moved in, and allowed him to assume a premature paternal role which was antipathetic to their needs and demonstrated beyond question her determination to put her relationship with FZ before the needs of her children. Further, there is evidence from the Local Authority that A has recently been told by about issues which have arisen in F&#8217;s case either by his mother or members of the maternal family. Not only is this inappropriate and unfair to A, it is indicative of MX&#8217;s continued need to recruit others to her cause regardless of whether or not it is appropriate or, in A&#8217;s case, in her already damaged son&#8217;s best interests.

This is due to distorted thinking, impulsiveness, lack of empathy etc and this risk requires specific work</span>&#8221;. This cautionary view is one that cannot be overlooked as there is ample evidence of distorted thinking and a lack of empathy in this case on the part of both MX and FZ.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Local Authority and F&#8217;s representatives submit that there is no objective and/or independent evidence of separation and point to the fact that MX is in regular contact with FZ. It appears that they are in contact most days, and although MX denied it was every day, it was the social worker&#8217;s evidence that in October 2022 (when F had been unwell) MX had said she contacted FZ every day. At the time F was kept off nursery school but the school was not informed by MX about the reason for her absence. Nor did MX tell the social worker although F was at home under an interim care order meaning MX shared parental responsibility with the Local Authority. MX has had the benefit of experienced family public law lawyers throughout; it is inconceivable that MX did not know this and was unaware, as she claimed in evidence, that she had to keep the social worker informed about what was happening to F. MX said that she only told FZ as the social worker would fail to do so; this is clear evidence of her antipathy towards the Local Authority and of her inability to work with or engage with social services. Her own evidence about the reason she told FZ was simultaneously negated by the fact that the social worker could not fail to share information with FZ if she had not been given it in the first place.  This is but one example of when MX, in her determination to put the Local Authority in the wrong, undermines her own evidence and so puts her credibility in question. The same can be said of the evidence of FZ.</p>

The DWP have confirmed, in writing, that the department was not informed of any separation in respect of their benefit claim in a written response to the order of the Court. Even if it were likely that one of the officials that they spoke to in the CAB or in Mental Health services suggested that they continue making a false claim (as on their evidence they are not living together) I do not accept that every official they spoke to advised them to pursue a fraudulent claim.</p>

While I accept that it is likely FZ has not lived with MX full time since he moved out in February 2021 (when F was about eighteen months old), I do not accept that he has never visited or stayed overnight. When questioned about their separation MX intimated that as they had not lived together since then their relationship was effectively coming to an end by September 2022. There was absolutely no evidence of that at the September hearing. Indeed at that stage it was her case that they wished to care for F together; this is another contradiction in her evidence which undermines her credibility. While MX denied the possibility of them living together again, FZ was noticeably evasive about it and became agitated, refusing to answer questions put to him about moving back in with MX in the event that F is placed elsewhere.              </p>

FZ was very vague about where and with whom he had been living at other times; at times argumentative, FZ avoided or refused to answer questions about this and I found his evidence wholly unconvincing. He must know where and with whom he has stayed and slept even if he cannot remember the precise dates and time. From the information he has actually given the Court it is evident that FZ&#8217;s closest links in the area are with the maternal family, and with AS and MX&#8217;s sister in particular; he clearly remains caught up in their narrative of events and they in his.     </p>

It was recorded that he said he had shown his partner his injuries after he jumped off a bridge on the M4; and that a decision is to be made if his daughter stays with him or not; the note does not read if F stays with MX alone but specifies it is with FZ.</p>

FZ involved himself in an incident concerning MX and her neighbour. At the time even the neighbour knew that FZ was not supposed to be at the address because of child protection concerns.  FZ is adamant that he did not go to or enter MX&#8217;s home. MX says it was late in the evening and F would have been in bed and anyway she did not see FZ. While it is true to say that FZ was not prohibited from using the road as a thoroughfare he had no legitimate business there. If, as he claims, he had moved out and did not live with MX then whatever had happened between her and the neighbour was not his business. Even if he chauvinistically thought that it was, there cannot be even the slightest suggestion that his going there would have assisted MX or F; indeed being found there would have put F&#8217;s placement with MX in jeopardy which undoubtedly contributed to the fact that neither of them told social services about the incident, effectively lying by omission. Either he went there that evening to involve himself in a dispute concerning MX to control the situation or he was already there when the dispute arose. </p>

Despite her protestations during her oral evidence that FZ&#8217;s actions and his evidence and views have nothing to do with her, the fact is that there is little if anything to distinguish the case put by MX to that of FZ. It is noteworthy that it was counsel for FZ that most pressed assiduously for an injunction by way of mitigation of risk as this was despite FZ&#8217;s own evidence that he did not pose a risk and had no intention of returning to MX&#8217;s home. It was, if not disingenuous, misleading to urge on the Court injunctive relief as mitigation which would be capable of effectively removing the risks of harm already identified and the likelihood of harm to F in the future emanating from FZ. Injunctions do not provide protection <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span>;<span style="font-style:italic"/>to have forced the person to be protected would actively assist the authorities in enforcement by reporting any breach or attempted breach. I find that there is little or no evidence to support MX&#8217;s assertion that she would do so and that, taken as a whole, the evidence is that it is more likely than not that she would not. There was a total absence of any evidence that FZ would self-report; FZ did not give any evidence to that effect nor did he say in his evidence that he would consider a court order to be a deterrent. </p>

Although at the end of the fact finding hearing FZ had accepted that the harm suffered by F and the likelihood of harm suffered related to emotional harm and the impairment of her social, emotional and psychological development, he did not and does not accept that the definition of harm in relation to F should include physical harm. In his most recent evidence there was, if anything, a reversal of what he had accepted previously; nothing he said demonstrated any insight into the risk of harm that he might pose in respect of his daughter.</p>

Prior to being tested he had denied using drugs at all; after the test results and in his oral evidence, FZ sought to minimise and dismiss the results. His limited acceptance that he was only abusing drugs during the time for which the Court had test results was contrary to the evidence of members of his own family who described FZ&#8217;s amphetamine abuse as going back many years. Thus taken as a whole the evidence before this Court is that he is unlikely to come clean over any breach of a protective order so reducing any possible mitigation to the risk he poses that such an order might have provided. </p>

Be that as it may, FZ has refused to take up any contact with F at the contact centre since December 2022. Once again it was because of his own needs rather than F&#8217;s as he said that it was because he found it too distressing for himself and because he did not trust the contact centre workers not to share information he considered to be adverse to his interests. His decision is at once based on self-pity and a complete lack of consideration for F and what is in her best interests. It also undermines any assertion on his part that he would be willing to co-operate with that or any other contact centre or be any more accepting of supervised contact in the future. His self-centred and self-pitying approach to contact right at the time when a final decision is about to be made in respect of his daughter is redolent of his stark need to manipulate and his histrionic approach is evidence of his inability to empathise with his daughter and to put his own needs first as well as his  predisposition to blame others, particularly those in authority, for his behaviour and the situation in which he finds himself.</p>

MX insisted that F was confusing the past with the present and it was only her memory of FZ being there before he had moved out two years previously.  The Local Authority make the point in their final submissions that it is difficult to understand how F has any real memory of FZ in the household as she was just 18 months old when he left. I agree and I find it highly unlikely that she was confused or that it was an old memory. If FZ had left F&#8217;s home as he claims when she was still an infant and never returned, it would mean that she has spent the last two years without him being there, meaning that she had spent more of her life without his being there at all and there is little or no reason for any confusion. Secondly, her memories of seeing her father and being with him from those past two years would have been of spending time with him at a contact centre. Thirdly, it is most unlikely that a child would remember her parents sharing a bed at a time she was still only a baby. Finally, the questions that F was asked were open questions about what was happening now and in the present tense and F responded equally openly.</p>

The social worker and the guardian both gave evidence to the contrary; their evidence was corroborated by the contemporaneous note made by the guardian. Those notes confirmed FZ&#8217;s aggressive and agitated response to what F was reported to have said, his denial of what has been said by F and his accusations of some kind of collusion between the school and social services. FZ has never proffered any salient reason for childcare professionals and teachers to collude and invent evidence other than in general and histrionic terms; that the authorities conspire against him and that they are all are determined vilify him and to pick on him.</p>

I find it is simply not credible that any Local Authority would task a parent with such work especially after that parent had previously been found by a court to have little or no ability to deliver a child-centred and impartial narrative to her children in the past; it would be a negligent act for the Local Authority to have done so. Secondly, I prefer the evidence of the social worker and guardian in respect of what was said at the meeting; the guardian took a note at the time and gave oral evidence which was wholly consistent with that note. The guardian&#8217;s evidence was measured and child-centred; neither she nor the social worker had or have anything to gain by telling me what they said had happened. Thirdly, despite MX having accepted that she is not qualified or trained carry out this kind of work, she set about doing so and she failed to consult or inform the social worker of her intention to do so. On the balance of probabilities, I find this could only be because she wanted to control the narrative and what F was saying at school. It is most unlikely that F could have volunteered the information about where her father slept out of a confused memory more than two years&#8217; old when she is only 3 &#189;. </p>

I have seen the book setting out some two or three pages of &#8216;work&#8217; that MX did with F.

Moreover, regardless of the number of occasions FZ has stayed it is abundantly clear that in reality MX and FZ still present as a couple and that they remain emotionally and financially interdependent; I further find that their relationship will have been evident to F and that she sees <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Mammy and Daddy&#8221;</span> as being together. </p>

They were a couple in September 2022, have always remained a couple, and have always been emotionally and financially interdependent. MX and FZ have lied to the Local Authority and to the Court. &#8216;Separated&#8217; is a word that can have different meanings but to make it as clear as possible I find that MX and FZ may have stayed in separate addresses from time to time and that it is likely that FZ did sleep and/or stay including overnight with AS and his wife MS occasionally but that was more than likely to have been precautionary, to avoid being found at MX&#8217;s address, and not because they had &#8220;separated&#8221; as a couple.<span style="font-style:italic"/>On the balance of probabilities, I find that it is more likely than not that for the most part FZ has slept with MX in her bedroom and has been living with MX and F at MX&#8217;s address.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I have set out above from her own evidence and in the view of the consultant psychologist who assessed her, MX, despite her apparent acceptance in her written evidence of parts of the judgement, has in reality demonstrated a very limited acceptance and acknowledgement of findings. MX has only a superficial level of insight and is determined to hang on to her version of events as is evinced by her expressed view that she could only base her thinking on what she had directly experienced herself. MX has consistently maintained this position in her oral evidence and is unwilling or unable to accept anything different to her own &#8216;truth&#8217;. The position she has chosen is one which means she effectively accuses her own children of being liars; she does not or cannot listen to them, and is unwilling or unable to show any empathy with them as children who have been physically, emotionally and psychologically harmed, and have been separated from their family and siblings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In plain terms and so that there can be no doubt that this Court has considered the benefits and disadvantages and weighed them in the balance and in addition to the welfare analysis and discussion above I will set them out here in brief. Should F be returned to live with MX she would benefit from being raised by her biological mother and primary carer; but the evidence is she would not be living with MX alone for long, if at all. Having already been moved, if F were to be returned to her mother&#8217;s care, she would avoid the longer-term distress of having to permanently settle in her new placement and be brought up away from her parents. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As it is likely that returning to MX would mean returning to living with FX it greatly increases the likelihood of F suffering the same significant harm as her siblings, particularly in respect of domestic abuse. While living with MX, and in all likelihood FZ, may allow F to more readily maintain her relationship with her extended maternal family there are attendant risks with such contact and the move to her paternal uncle and aunt will allow greater contact with her extended paternal family.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In reality I am not considering a return to MX&#8217;s care but the care of MX and FZ who have been found to have caused significant harm to four children already. It also wholly negates any possible mitigation in the form of protective orders. Living with MX and FZ undoubtedly means that F would be at even greater risk of suffering the significant harm identified above. MX&#8217;s inability to accept the findings and risks posed by FZ is an established fact, while it is a fact that FZ poses a real risk to any child in his care. As it is more likely than not MX and FZ will remain in a relationship and continue to live together in future the Court cannot approve any placement with them given the risks they pose together. In addition, F will be brought up in a household where what the Local Authority correctly describes as the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;false narrative&#8221;</span> of MX and FZ is instilled in her about her siblings, these proceedings and the Local Authority, giving her a false and a skewed view of her own history and early life.  Based on all the available evidence outlined above and set out in the fact-finding judgment, there is no reasonable hope, expectation or likelihood that F would fare any better than her older siblings in the long term care of MX and FZ.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Should the Local Authority&#8217;s care plan be implemented F will remain in the care of her paternal uncle and aunt living with them and their children who are F&#8217;s cousins.  They have been positively assessed and are panel approved as carers for F.  F&#8217;s uncle and aunt have a positive background of caring for their own children; this placement will give F the opportunity to remain within her extended birth family in an environment where she will not be exposed to the risk of significant harm associated with her parents&#8217; abusive behaviour and repeated poor decision making in terms of child-care and their own relationships, both familial and in the wider social context. Of the two placements and on the evidence, this Court can more reasonably anticipate that F&#8217;s welfare needs would be consistently met and prioritised should she remain with her uncle and aunt and their children. This placement is more likely to provide F with the best chance of developing into a well-adjusted young person who is able and has been enabled to reach her full potential.  </p>

Sibling relationships are the closest and longest lasting of any family relationship in a person&#8217;s life and it is in the best interests of F that she can develop those relationships freely and without encumbrance.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There will be a geographical disadvantage as F will be further away from her siblings and that too will have an impact on her contact with MX and FZ as well as other members of the extended maternal family. There will be regular contact as set out in the care plan. The Local Authority will retain parental responsibility under a care order and include in their care plan arrangements for F&#8217;s contact with her parents and siblings. The Care Plan provides additional support and security for F in her placement as the Local Authority retain a greater obligation to ensure that contact takes place and that her carers are fully supported. The principle disadvantage to F is that she will not be brought up by her mother and will see less of her father but the risks and disadvantages of that placement are, I find, outweighed by F being brought up within her birth family in a much safer environment and the separation from her parents will be ameliorated by contact. </p>

This placement is proportionate and necessary to the needs of F.</p>

The Court is informed that bed and breakfast accommodation was arranged for FZ who did not take it up. In her statement DC has said that FZ told her that he is now living back at MX&#8217;s address, they are back together for now and wish to continue with their relationship but that they have been unable to do so whilst there has been an <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;ongoing Social Services and Court case&#8221;</span>. I am also told that FZ has said to RM (Team Leader in social services; her statement is referred to above) that he is staying with AS and his wife.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If there was to be separate contact for FZ and MX, that would be 34 sessions each year and F attending a contact session more than once each week. If MX and FZ are living together again and had contact with F together once a month that would also be too frequent particularly when considered alongside the proposed contact for F&#8217;s siblings which is due to take place 8 times each year; a total of 20 contact sessions annually it would mean that F had contact sessions to attend nearly every fortnight. Contact session once a month by parents who are likely to be hostile to the placement and will require supervision is not in the interests of F&#8217;s welfare; that is to say it is not congruent with her need to see her parents while ensuring her placement is not undermined.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have been told that FZ has already indicated he wants to make a complaint about contact; but this has not been confirmed. The frequency of contact is something that directly affects a child&#8217;s ability to settle and feel secure and unless a placement in unequivocally and positively supported by those having contact it is likely to be problematic and the Local Authority have to guard against the placement coming under too much strain or be overloaded with contact commitments. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is not to diminish the importance of such contact for F but the <span style="font-size:11pt">Local Authority&#8217;s care plan already sets out a </span>schedule for F to have over 16 visits a year with her siblings and family. Four with A, four with her other three siblings and four each with MX and FZ. That is more than once per month and is already more than most placements could easily sustain. If MX and FZ are to take up contact together that would reduce contact to once each month (12 times each year in total). That level of contact is a message to F which will &#8216;tell&#8217; her much more clearly where her permanent home is and is likely to be more consistent with her welfare needs, it will be less disruptive to her and will reduce any likely strain on her placement.    </p>
