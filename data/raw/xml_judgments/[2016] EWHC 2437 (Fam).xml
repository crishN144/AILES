This is something of which I am acutely conscious but for which there is, unhappily, no solution.  The case has correctly been described by one of the experts as &#8216;tragic&#8217; and as &#8216;very distressing&#8217;.  It requires, in the perhaps overused phrase, something of a judgement of Solomon.  </span></p>

She lives with a couple who have called themselves &#8220;Mr and Mrs X&#8221; (which I will continue to call them) who are the proposed adopters.  She has lived with them since 5</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt">th</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> December 2014, a period of some 17 months and is thriving with them.  Their application is for an adoption order which they earnestly hope to achieve at this hearing.  It is, however, opposed by A&#8217;s paternal grandparents who wish to care for A within her extended family.  They seek either a Special Guardianship order or a Child Arrangements order granting them residence.  I will explain shortly how this unhappy situation has arisen.  </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The parties before the court have been represented at this hearing as follows: the Council (&#8220;the local authority&#8221;) by Ms Randhawa; Mr and Mrs X by Mr Todd; Mrs G and Mr G (&#8220;the paternal grandparents&#8221; or &#8220;the grandparents&#8221;) by Ms Ward; and A&#8217;s children&#8217;s guardian, by Mr Ainsley.  I am grateful to them for the sensitive way in which they have conducted this matter.  I have read and re-read their written submissions; my notes of their oral submissions; the full court bundle of documents; my notes of the oral evidence and the authorities to which I have been referred.  I heard oral evidence from Pauline Fairbairn (independent social worker); Beth Miller (Special Guardianship reporter); the paternal grandmother; and the children&#8217;s guardian.  I have also reminded myself of the relevant provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> (&#8220;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>&#8221;).  The underlying question is whether it would better serve the interests of A&#8217;s welfare throughout her life to remain within the family of Mr and Mrs X and be adopted by them, or to be removed from them now and be united with her extended birth family?  At the present time, for reasons to which I will come, she knows only the family of Mr and Mrs X and has never met the paternal grandparents, nor any other member of the extended family of her birth.  Her natural parents I should add have never engaged in her life and play no part in these proceedings. </span></p>

However it is sensibly and pragmatically accepted all round that, since the grandparents have permission to apply for a Special Guardianship order or a Child Arrangements order, the court will have to decide which of the two &#8216;competing&#8217; families should bring A up; and therefore whether it would be &#8216;better&#8217; for her under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">S1(6)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> that the court should make an adoption order or not do so.  No technical point therefore arises on the proper constitution of these proceedings and the decision which falls to be made is simply (although it is not simple) a welfare based one.  </span></p>

In 1999 when L was 24 and had moved out of the paternal grandparents&#8217; home, there was an occasion when she, Z, aged 11 went to L&#8217;s accommodation and he sexually assaulted her.  On returning home she told her parents (the paternal grandparents) what had happened.  They promptly reported the matter to the Police and L was arrested but not, in the event, charged.  It is Z with whom S and L&#8217;s third child F has recently been placed following his birth in April 2016.  She, Z, and her husband hope to be able to bring him up as part of their family with their own two children.  </span></p>

I do not have the same amount of detail about their family as I do about the paternal grandparents&#8217; family (probably because of the information required for the Special Guardianship report).  In Mr and Mrs X&#8217;s statement, they mention grandparents who live close by and cousins for A ranging from 17 down to 3 &#8216;all of whom worship her and have had regular contact with her&#8217;.

The relevant Local Authority [not this Local Authority]made the usual enquiries to see if there were any extended family members who could care for him, since it must have appeared unlikely that L and S would be able to do so.  It was in this way that a social worker came to know of the existence of the paternal grandparents and arranged to meet or telephone them.  In the process of discussing E with them, she mentioned E&#8217;s older sister A.  This was the very first time that the paternal grandparents had ever heard of A&#8217;s existence.  They had not even known that S had been pregnant, since they were not in touch with their son L at that time.  They described themselves as devastated to learn that they had a granddaughter who was the subject of pending adoption proceedings.  They took legal advice and determined to try to have A live with them if that could be achieved.  </span></p>

She agreed with Mr Todd that A would suffer &#8216;a bereavement&#8217; which would have a significant effects &#8216;initially&#8217; (Mrs Fairbairn&#8217;s word).  She told Mr Todd that moving young children is an area in which she has experience, expressing the view again that A&#8217;s strong current attachments will make it more likely that she will attach again on moving on.  She emphasised her concern that, if adopted then when she grew older, A would suffer from knowing that she had been denied a childhood with her two siblings E and F.  She accepted that because of A&#8217;s sense of loss, she would or could regress &#8216;temporarily&#8217; (again, Mrs Fairbairn&#8217;s word).  Whilst acknowledging that the removal of children from foster care is different in kind from removal from proposed adopters (as here), she made the point that such children removed from foster care settled surprisingly quickly.  She did not think that the paternal grandparents would have difficulty dealing with such things as A&#8217;s crying, bedwetting, tantrums or not eating.  She added that </span><span style="font-size:11pt">&#8220;&#8230; it always amazes me how quickly children settle in and how resilient they are &#8230;&#8221;  (</span><span style="font-size:12pt">although she stressed that in so saying she was not seeking to detract from how difficult A would find the removal from Mr and Mrs X).  Asked by Mr Ainsley if A&#8217;s upset and unsettlement would last &#8216;for weeks, months or years&#8217;, Mrs Fairbairn answered with words to the effect: &#8220;&#8230; more months than years.&#8221;  She said:</span></p>

She did not think that there was a risk of a transfer of A going so badly wrong that it would need to be reconsidered.  It would in her opinion be &#8216;devastating&#8217; for A to realise later in her life that her siblings had been allowed to live in the birth family when she had been denied this.  </span></p>

Eight years of his professional career has been in fostering and adoption.  He has worked with Mr and Mrs X since July 2013, supporting them and the placement by way of regular visits since A was placed with them in December 2014.  He highlights their complete emotional investment in A from the outset and their unconditional love and acceptance of her.  Strong bonds have been formed between them and her.  She was moved to them (December 2014) from excellent foster carers and has been throughout an only child both in that foster placement and now with Mr and Mrs X.  He considers that A has gone &#8216;far beyond the levels of normal care and attachment experiences in a foster placement, to the significantly higher levels of care and attachment with reciprocal, emotional interactions with Mr and Mrs X&#8217;.  He says he regards the proposition that A&#8217;s attachments can be &#8216;transferred between carers&#8217; (as he puts it) as too simplistic &#8216;and not applicable to this case&#8217;.  He expresses very deep concern about the distress which would be caused to A at having to be handed over by Mr and Mrs X, which he considers would leave her (A) extremely anxious and traumatised.  She would in his opinion suffer &#8216;a severe and intense bereavement with the loss of her primary care givers&#8217;.  </span></p>

Typically it would be completed within seven days or less, lest the child should become confused and the emotional stress become too much for the carers.  There is no need to set out the various steps in such a transfer here, as they would depend in any event on how things went in practice.  Mr Richardson sees particular difficulty in the adopters being emotionally unable to give their &#8216;approval&#8217; to A moving, such emotional &#8216;approval&#8217; being a very important part of the process.  He recorded that Mr and Mrs X have said that they would do their best to assist in the transfer of A (if this were the court&#8217;s decision) but he did not know if they would have the emotional strength to do so.  </span></p>

He accepted from Ms Ward in cross-examination that the good care which A has received to date is positive as regards a possible move.  However he thought that a transfer would be &#8216;fraught with difficulties&#8217;, since A would see the anguish of Mr and Mrs X every day until she actually moved to the grandparents.

Nonetheless, she came to the conclusion in her report that the paternal grandparents could provide the necessary level of permanent care needed by A, where she could grow up with an awareness of her origins.

She recognised that Mr and Mrs X would be devastated if A had to move.  She stated that they had impressed on her their wish to do everything possible to help in such a move, although she thought that (understandably) they may not have the emotional resolve.  Thus she considered it would be possible and necessary to use Mr Richardson&#8217;s existing relationship with A, such that he would be the facilitator (my word not hers) in the transfer process.  She approved of the paternal families&#8217; proposal that E should stay with one of the paternal aunts in the initial stages and only be reintroduced into the grandparents&#8217; family home once A had become more settled.  </span></p>

She said she had been waiting before doing so to see whether leave would be granted to the paternal grandparents.

The last 17 months covers all of A&#8217;s sentient life.  Mr and Mrs X, together with their extended family, are the only family that she knows.  It is &#8216;not rocket science&#8217; to say that she will be very distressed indeed and to a greater or lesser extent traumatised by a move to another family whom she has never met.  It would be a move which she would not be able to understand.  All things being equal, no one would even begin to contemplate moving A from her present home.  Put at its most basic, the disadvantage of an adoption order in favour of Mr and Mrs X is that which is the advantage of a Special Guardianship order to the paternal grandparents: that a placement by way of adoption is not an upbringing within a child&#8217;s natural family.  </span></p>

She would be within the bosom of a close-knit family who, as I am satisfied, would commit to her wholeheartedly.  She would be within the culture into which she was born and she would have first hand knowledge of her heritage and origins.  If her birth parents wanted to make some form of contact with her, then that would be possible, subject to  the sensitive control of the grandparents and the aunts, with the potential benefit to A of knowing her birth parents (even with all their evident difficulties in life).  By such an upbringing, there would be no risks that later in life A would become resentful and say or think &#8216;why was I denied an upbringing with my family and my siblings when they were able to have such an upbringing which I could have had too?&#8217;  That, if it occurred, would clearly be detrimental to her welfare.  There is also the contrary possibility which I have to bear in mind too that A might become resentful of having been moved from Mr and Mrs X if she were not to be happy as time goes on in her natural family. </span></p>

There is the risk that Mr Richardson&#8217;s very real concerns would turn out to be proved by events.  If that were the case, real damage would be done to A with no benefit.  Also to be put in the scales on the deficit side, there is the grandmother&#8217;s somewhat limited mobility and history of anxiety and depression as discussed above.  Added to that, parenting two very young children at the ages of the grandparents (59 and 58) carries its own risks and obvious disadvantages.  If anything happened to either grandparent, it would clearly be very detrimental to A although I am satisfied that there would be complete and very satisfactory &#8216;cover&#8217; from the extended family.  The grandparents have brought up four children successfully (which is not to suggest that they failed L) and E is thriving with them.  That said, the increasing age of grandparents of these ages would inevitably coincide with the probable or possible challenges of the adolescent years of A and E.  </span></p>

It depends heavily on the dynamics of changing relationships and on fortuitous external events to which different individuals will react differently.  There are many unpredictable chances which influence all our lives.  Neither the short-term nor the long-term risks are quantifiable and I have not found the decision at all easy.  Indeed I have agonised over it.  It seems utterly counterintuitive to move a child who is so happy, settled, loved and well cared for.  However, in the last analysis, I have concluded that if the transition can be successfully made, then on the balance of probabilities, it would be in A&#8217;s best interests throughout her life to be united with her natural family.  I do not consider that the grandmother&#8217;s health and mobility deficits are such as to cause this not to be the case.  Like Mrs Fairbairn, I regard those health difficulties as &#8216;manageable&#8217;, more particularly with the support which the grandmother has.  I am fortified in this finding by the very recent addendum reports of Mrs Fairbairn and Ms Miller.  I consider there is a real risk of A being resentful later on, say when she moves into early adolescence, about having had a completely different upbringing from her siblings and having missed out on their company, when the natural family were (as I find) able and willing to bring her up.  Sibling relationships are generally recognised as being some of the longest lasting and (if things work out well) most valuable we may have in our lives.  </span></p>

Likewise, I accept that bringing up and caring for two very young children, one of whom will be distressed and confused for a period of time, will be extremely challenging.  Two children are greatly more demanding than one, but the preponderance of all the expert evidence, which I accept, is that these paternal grandparents are adequate to the task. </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.37in"><span style="font-size:12pt">That being so, the question comes down to the risks of making a transition to the grandparents.  Mr Richardson has prepared a supplementary statement dated 6</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt">th</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> May 2016 (after the hearing) as to how this would be done.  He reports that Mr X is willing to help facilitate the move, if he turns out to be emotionally able to do so, although Mrs X does not think that she could do so; nor do the extended family of Mr and Mrs X.  I will not set out Mr Richardson&#8217;s proposals and options for transition in detail as they are dependent on how things turn out.  I accept the genuine and conscientious anxieties of Mr Richardson about the risks of moving A.  On the other hand he is inevitably (and this is not a criticism) seeing it all from the point of view of one who has for over a year and a half supported Mr and Mrs X and the placement of A with them.  I have to set against Mr Richardson&#8217;s concerns, the unanimous view of the other experts, Mrs Fairbairn and the Children's Guardian, who between them have 60 years in social work and childcare, and Ms Miller based on her more limited remit.  As already set out, their opinions are that this move can be made and that, although it will inevitably cause distress, confusion and some regression, this should be and would probably be measurable in &#8216;months rather than years&#8217;, with A coming to adapt to life within her new family.  If that can be achieved, with the preponderance of the evidence which I accept being that it can be, then a move now would in my judgment be in the best interests of A&#8217;s welfare throughout her life.  Put at its lowest I am unable to conclude, having regard to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">S1(6)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, that the making of an adoption order would be better for A than not doing so.  </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.37in"><span style="font-size:12pt">I add for completeness that I have considered whether it would best serve A&#8217;s interests throughout her life if there were to be an adoption in favour of Mr and Mrs X (avoiding the risks involved in the separation of A from them and their family) with some form of contact to the paternal grandparents and the extended natural family.  This was scarcely touched on at the hearing and no one has applied for it, not proposed it.  Might it nevertheless be a sort of compromise outcome which would enable A to have the benefit of both families?  Put like that it may seem attractive; but I have concluded that it would be fraught with potential difficulty and could actually turn out to be disruptive.  Such contact could only be infrequent for fear of undermining the placement with Mr and Mrs X.  It would inevitably bring A into contact with her natural siblings, which could well bring feelings of resentment or jealousy that she was not being brought up with them.  In addition, it would depend upon the existence of and continuation over the years of good relationships between the adults.  At present this is entirely untested and unpredictable, as they have never even met.  Whilst I am not suggesting there is any evidence that the two families might not get on, there would be ample potential circumstances in which difficulties could arise which would be detrimental to A.  Trying to anticipate the future I would not therefore consider that an adoption order with contact would be likely to be in A&#8217;s best interests throughout her life, even if such an order were being sought.  </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.37in"><span style="font-size:12pt">My heart goes out to Mr and Mrs X.  It is hard to imagine how much they are suffering and will suffer.  They have done nothing wrong and have been beset by a cruel stroke of fate in that A&#8217;s extended family members have emerged so late in the process (also through no fault of their own) who wish to, and as I have found, can bring A up.  That said, my decision is ultimately clear, namely that there should be a Special Guardianship order in favour of the paternal grandparents.  I have a discretion to discharge the placement order which is what I would propose to do, subject to any submissions to the contrary.  The care order would revive and cover the situation for a speedy transfer of A to the paternal grandparents, with the invaluable help of Mr Richardson and Deirdre Ryan and, if he can somehow find the emotional strength, of Mr X.  Now that the decision has been made, I express the profound hope that all concerned (the X family in spite of their pain) will find the capacity within so to work with Mr Richardson as to make the transition happen with the least stress for A that can be achieved.</span></p>
