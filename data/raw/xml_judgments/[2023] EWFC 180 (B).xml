To assist my understanding I prepared my own chronology cross-referenced with the documents in the court bundle. I provided the parties with copies of that initial chronology prior to the hearing to allow for them to make any observations as to its&#8217; contents. I have updated that chronology as the hearing and evidence progressed. It contains a large amount of detail as to the background and evidence in this matter and I have included it in this judgment. It allows me to be brief when setting out the history of this matter which I hope adequately places the details contained within the chronology in context.</p>

She is also the mother of his third child, Y. Both children do not live in this jurisdiction, where DG himself lives. They feature in the background to this matter because there have been the equivalent of Family Court proceedings ongoing for some considerable time in that jurisdiction regarding those children. Eventually, the papers in those proceedings were disclosed within these proceedings and were relevant, a matter which I will return to later.</p>

KB and DG never lived together full time. Initially KB lived and worked in another jurisdiction but in November 2013 she moved to the England with EMP, where she remained living and working. Accordingly, the Family Court proceedings concerning EMP have taken place in England.</p>

Those proceedings concluded without any order and by agreement. It is now clear that to some degree an on/off relationship between KB and DG continued until at least late 2016 although as will become clear that amounted to occasions of sexual intercourse as opposed to an exclusive emotional commitment towards each other. KB continued to see EMP although this was usually for short periods and usually in the company of KB.</p>

There was an occasion in early 2017 when DG was visiting KB&#8217;s home when KB alleges that she went upstairs to have a shower whilst EMP and DG were downstairs. She asserts that DG was waiting for her when she got out of the shower and has sex against her will. DG asserts that there were occasions when they were having sex in 2017 even though they were not in a &#8216;relationship&#8217; and whilst he does not remember a specific incident he did not at any point have sex with KB without her consent.</p>

		  <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:10pt;color:#000000">&#8220;I note that KB refers again to the issue of domestically abusive behaviour and coercively controlling behaviour by DG. This was addressed in my case analysis of 02/07/2021 and I reflect on this below. Both parents allege controlling behaviour of the other and the evidence before the court in the form of text messages would, in my opinion indicate, that it is KB who seeks to control the contact. In relation to her assertion in paragraph 6 that DG has used the court processes to cause stress, it should be noted that it is KB who has prolonged the court processes through her failure to adhere to the Orders as made.&#8221;</span></p>
		  <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:10pt;color:#000000">&#8220;KB states that she has had no confidential opportunity to raise her concerns about the alleged domestic abuse. I would note that her statement has added further allegations which have never been raised during these proceedings I spoke to KB on the telephone at 7pm on 28 April 2021 and I had expressly requested a time when we could speak when EMP was not present offering daytime or evening appointments, after EMP was in bed. </span></p>
		  <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:10pt;color:#000000">KB suggested the above arrangement as one of two and this was agreed. My understanding during that conversation was that EMP was not present and I gave Ms KB every opportunity to describe the abuse, which she did and this was addressed at paragraph 5 in my report of 02/07/2021. Whilst I am unable to comment on the veracity of the allegations I state once again, that this should not have an impact on the arrangements for EMP spending time with his father.&#8221;</span></p>

The reporter is of the view that, in essence, contact between X and his father is too stressful for X and given his age and his ability to speak to X via social media, it would be better for there to be no order. In relation to Y, who has no relationship with her biological father, should have supervised contact as Y has no real understanding of her biological parentage.</span></p>

From an objective perspective even DG&#8217;s own description of some of the, as he called them &#8216;shenanigans&#8217;, he engaged in with both children were obviously, to my mind, pushing the boundaries of acceptable parenting. For example, I struggle with the suggestion that pulling a child&#8217;s leg hairs is a legitimate exercise in resilience building and I was bemused by DG&#8217;s apparent inability to reflect on the fact that it was an action which was likely to imbue in a child a sense of dislike (of his father) and injustice. DG showed no indication that he had seriously thought about how EMP might feel about him as a consequence.</p>

It is a point made to demonstrate that the incident cannot have been particularly serious in terms of any injury &#8211; which if I may say I think <span style="font-style:italic">misses the point</span> that in the context of previous complaints and observations about DG&#8217;s rough behaviour towards his children, it is the effect on EMP and the way he thinks about his father, not the fact that he was not significantly physically hurt. Additionally, DG is correct, EMP did not tell his mother that his father had caused the cut (whom, I have no doubt, would have immediately been alarmed and complained) but did tell his school. It can be readily inferred from the school records that EMP&#8217;s distress was unlikely to have been because of the physical injury but his confusion and upset that his father had acted in a manner which was so alien to him.</p>

As set out above, DG&#8217;s approach to parenting being so radically different to that practiced by his primary carer it is very likely that the part of the picture EMP has in his head of his father is negative. His father is someone who at times treats him in a way that EMP is likely to have found so alien and disconcerting that it is likely to have instilled in him a feeling of trepidation. It is notable that even when EMP was saying he wanted to see his father he wanted someone present with him.

Certainly, EMP had no rational reason to be scared that his father would kidnap him and fears about the police could also have been assuaged without much difficulty. I find it difficult to accept that an incident that occurred once when he was [a young child] of age needed to retain the significance it appears to have had 5 &#189; years later unless &#8216;kept alive&#8217; for him.

Any suggestion of a link between paying child maintenance or other financial contributions and any &#8216;right&#8217; to a relationship with a child has often been eschewed or indeed, simply ignored. Likewise, arguments that link the non-payment of adequate maintenance to some loss in any &#8216;right&#8217; to time spent with a child have been equally disregarded. The legal principle that issues relating to child contact and child support are entirely separate is longstanding (see e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">R v Halifax Justices ex parte Woolverton</span> (1981) 2 FLR 369: court should not order remission of arrears of child maintenance as a penalty for failure to allow access) and has been reaffirmed in various contexts (see e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (Parental Responsibility: Maintenance) </span>[1996] 1 FLR 867: failure to pay child support does not disqualify father from having parental responsibility order).</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">However, the advent of a greater understanding of the concept of coercive control in the context of disputes about the care of a child does, in my view, cast such considerations in a different light. Indeed, in this matter KB asserts that DG&#8217;s alleged failure to pay adequate child maintenance (and comply with the costs order made by the High Court following the appeal decision) are an aspect DG&#8217;s alleged attempts at coercion which is part of the wider picture of her assertions about his behaviour. An understanding of the role that finances potentially play in issues surrounding the upbringing of children, possible power imbalances and potential economic abuse that can ensue or be in some way exploited by the other parent is undoubtedly receiving greater acknowledgment &#8211; see for example <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-review-of-the-child-maintenance-service-cms-response-to-domestic-abuse" class="Hyperlink" style="font-style:italic">Independent review of the Child Maintenance Service (CMS) response to domestic abuse</a> by Dr Samantha Callan, leading to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/child-maintenance-service-to-clamp-down-on-domestic-abuse" class="Hyperlink">proposed changes</a> to the Child Maintenance Service.</p>

In this matter (as is often but not exclusively the case) it is the mother who had little choice but to take on the primary responsibility of those consequences. Such responsibility involves much joy and I have no doubt at all, having heard KB&#8217;s evidence, that KB has no regrets concerning EMP&#8217;s birth as she clearly loves her son unconditionally and without regret.  Neither is there evidence to suggest that the role was assumed unwillingly. Nevertheless, the advent of a child requires enormous sacrifices, changes and commitments that were borne primarily by KB, is being clear that it was never DG&#8217;s intention to care for EMP on a day-to-day basis by, for example, living with KB or assuming, after birth, a shared care arrangement.</p>

Whilst this was doubtless partly as a function of the fact that he believes that KB has acted unreasonably with respect to his relationship with EMP this is not a situation where it has ever been suggested that KB would spend any maintenance money &#8216;inappropriately&#8217; or ultimately for anything other than EMP&#8217;s benefit.</p>

There had clearly been a dispute between KB and DG in early 2018 because they could not reach agreement about the nature of DG&#8217;s time with EMP. KB accuses DG of &#8216;gaslighting&#8217; her by telling her that his solicitor had sent two letters (which turned out not to be true) about EMP to her. I am satisfied this was on the balance of probabilities a deliberate lie in order to try to impress upon KB his desire to see EMP in a way he found acceptable &#8211; i.e. not with KB present, something that appears to have been a consistent feature in 2016 and some of 2017 and for longer.</p>

I think it is also likely that DG did say to KB that she should get used to spending time on her own. DG&#8217;s working arrangements meant that he was working away during the week and it seems clear in retrospect that there was no real intention that he would change his life to enable the couple to live together. I think it very likely that he did say to KB that she should get used to being alone because that was factually correct.</p>

He denied excessive shouting but I am satisfied he would in all likelihood raise his voice to wake KB up. KB explained that this was at a time when she was caring for a very young EMP (effectively on her own most of the time) and of course she was tired. I came to the view that DG&#8217;s actions were probably thoughtless and about meeting his own desire to watch a film whereas some thought might have enabled him to appreciate from KB&#8217;s point of view why his demands that she stay awake were probably misguided. However, I am also quite sure that such disagreements could be seen on sofa&#8217;s up and down the country.</p>

Clearly the background to that point provides fertile issues for toxicity. Notwithstanding that these were two consenting adults, the objective picture at this time reveals what I consider to be a significant imbalance in the parents&#8217; relative positions. KB is caring for their child effectively as a single parent in circumstances where financial and emotional support from DG is largely contingent on him being happy with the arrangements for him spending time with EMP. DG is repeatedly told that in effect, their relationship whereby they only have sex but nothing else was not what KB wanted and he repeatedly ignores or minimises KB telling him that the nature of their relationship was having a detrimental affect on her wellbeing. Further, he pursues the continuation of sexual activity with little demonstration of empathy or concern for the effect of that pursuit has on KB.</p>

I agree with him, as he asserts in his written submissions that parents finding way to be intimate despite children being in the house &#8220;&#8230; is a fairly normal thing for parents of a young child to do and, while I have no recollection of the specific incident she described, her quoting me as saying &#8220;it&#8217;s ok, he&#8217;s downstairs with his kindle&#8221;, is entirely plausible and was just one way we could get away with having sex while he was awake.&#8221;</p>

If the incident occurred as KB alleges then it was during the day, they were about to go out and EMP was only downstairs (as opposed to in bed or otherwise engrossed) and sex was being initiated in the bedroom (as opposed to behind a potentially locked shower room door) in circumstances where EMP could walk into the bedroom at any time (as indeed, on KB&#8217;s account, DG had) KB could have made the comment and then consented to sex notwithstanding her misgivings.</p>

CG1 had recommended unsupervised contact (of a limited duration) and the order of December 2019 records that the recommendation is not agreed. In March 2020 the Lay Justices order contact to take place once every three weeks with mother&#8217;s presence to be removed after one more contact. Contact did, I understand it take place at the mother&#8217;s home (an issue to which I will return later) but never progressed ostensibly because of the Covid 19 pandemic. In July 2020 the Lay Justices ordered fortnightly direct contact for 3 hours in the community (unsupervised) and a review hearing. KB appealed this decision.</p>

That of course turned out to be incorrect, as the text messages clearly show. One interpretation of that denial is that KB was aware that they were continuing to have consensual sex proximate to the time she identified as the alleged rape which could make it look less likely that the event had occurred. Further, of course, it means that DG was telling me (and the police) the truth about the continuation of sexual relations post their original separation.</p>

In any moral sense DG did not, even by his own account, treat KB very well. It is clear from the text messages that she wished him to be a partner and a father to EMP. She wanted more from him than he was at almost any stage in the relationship giving her. As some of the text exchanges I have cited above (and there are others) show, potentially powerful emotions were at play in circumstances where DG was not supporting KB (or EMP) particularly convincingly, absent for periods of time, conducted an affair with the mother of his previous child, fathered another child, participates in a confusing and to some degree exploitative sexual relationship with KB and then issues court proceedings when (in her view) his relationship with EMP is not progressing in exactly the way he wishes. Whilst &#8216;revenge&#8217; may not be a primary motive, it is a possibility I have borne in mind.</p>

This case involves numerous incidents which objectively happened. There are very few factual disputes between the parties. What is so often in dispute is interpretation and motivation. I have already commented in this judgment on some issues where I remain satisfied that the <span style="font-style:italic">motivation and meaning</span> inferred by KB with respect to some of DG&#8217;s actions cannot objectively be considered accurate. The parents had sex and continued to do so after their &#8216;relationship&#8217; was over. There were times when they had sex after KB had a shower. DG confirms in his police interview that he had made a crude comment of the type alleged by KB but he says it was during a consensual act. I have little doubt the parties had engaged in sex when EMP was somewhere in the house. KB&#8217;s ambivalence to that continuing sexual relationship is plain from the text messages. Is this a situation where retrospective recall has imbued the event in KB&#8217;s mind with inaccurate recollections contributed to by regret, shame, and negative emotions?</p>

I am not particularly persuaded that it assists me beyond bearing in mind that it is evidence that I do not have in detail or context as opposed to being evidence that they never existed. KB tells the police that she cannot find the messages as &#8220;I have since changed phones and can&#8217;t retrieve the messages&#8221; [6600]. KB did provide the police with 4 phones and none of them cover 2017. Doubtless somewhere there is such a phone (there being no evidence of messages being deleted on <span style="font-style:italic">these</span> phones). Nevertheless, in his oral evidence DG told me that there may indeed be a text message mentioning consent but that would have been in a different context. I have concluded that in all probability there was some sort of an exchange in which consent was mentioned but in the absence of the original texts it is impossible for me to understand the context beyond noting that the issue was raised at some point.</p>

At the inception of my involvement in this matter the obvious point as to the timing of the allegation and opportunities to have related it earlier were uppermost in my mind, in particular in light of the fact that the &#8216;Dash&#8217; recording (15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2020 &#8211; see chronology) made by the police indicates that KB was asked a series of questions designed to elicit confirmation of previous abuse. However, I have also reminded myself that it is within my own direct professional experience that victims of genuine sexual assault may deny having been victims until able to reflect, internalise and confront what has happened to them, sometimes for complex but very human reasons. The key to any assessment is the context and wider evidence in circumstances where an act alleged to have taken place behind closed doors involving only two participants is nearly always going to be difficult to determine.</p>

However, I have also borne in mind that KB&#8217;s stance for the majority of the case with respect to contact was not to resist all forms of contact between EMP and his father. As can be seen from the chronology, her concern was in fact any move towards contact taking place in the absence of either herself or another adult. That motivation led to a situation whereby even after the alleged rape KB cast herself as the supervisor &#8211; going to Centre Parcs with DG and allowing DG to come to her home to see EMP at the start of these proceedings rather than permit unsupervised contact.</p>

A longer gap between consensual sex and non-consensual sex might be thought to be a demonstration of how much less likely it would be that the alleged victim would consent.

I considered carefully whilst listening to KBs evidence whether there were any indications that KB had in fact simply transposed other encounters to one incident and thereby fabricated an account by sticking close to the truth (thus allowing her to maintain consistency) but ultimately being dishonest about this specific incident. I remain convinced that what KB told me was what she believed had happened. She maintained a largely consistent account through several instances of re-telling without evidence of internal story-creep or deviation.</p>

As I have already observed most factual disputes related to interpretation rather than outright denial. He was undoubtedly anxious to impress upon me that his approach to life in general was jovial and humour laden. This extended at times to him reacting to situations in ways which might, by an objective observer, be considered crass or inappropriate. In the police interview his demeanour does not match the seriousness of the event and in court there were times when he laughed inappropriately. Of course I am conscious that both situations involve considerable stress and accordingly I do not consider this aspect of his character to carry great weight in my determination.</p>

DG described himself as probably not being &#8216;empathetic enough&#8217;.

Further, his evidence shows that the situation KB described &#8211; sex when he visits to see EMP, sex after KB has a shower, sex when EMP was in the house &#8211; had all happened on other occasions.</p>

The issue at hand is of course a very serious one with substantial potential consequences for either party.

I also know from my own experience that some would not. It is a difference of parenting opinion. However, as an individual incident the worst that can be said about it is that DG may not have known if EMP had seen funerals on television, or discussed them with friends or the like and that his primary carer may have wanted to deal with the issue of death in a different way. </p>

If he had taken it (which he did not) he would have been living in Cumbria closer to KB and his then employment. During this time KB asserts that DG was not in contact with her. She considered the enquiry an attempt by him to live closer to her to harass her, although he made no direct communication with her. No evidence was presented that established anything other than a posting on a website for accommodation and there was no evidence to suggest that DG knew that the advertiser was in fact KB&#8217;s childminder.
