It was arranged overnight. Giving evidence in German did nothing to improve the quality or reliability of her evidence. I noted that towards the end of her cross examination when she was being asked by Mr Twomey about her knowledge of ZB, SB and SA being raped by VB she became very animated.

She then said that PB was a year or a year and a half old when she arrived in Germany which given PB was born in September 2005, would mean she had arrived in Germany sometime in late 2006 or early 2007. The first reference to SB or PB in the German police documents or social services records is July 2010. In March 2010 C told the German authorities that there were just 4 children in the household &#8211; ZB, SA, JA and TB. She made no reference to SB or PB.

It makes for very sad reading. ZB explained that VB was BW&#8217;s father as a result of she and he having had sexual intercourse on one occasion. Rather than describing herself as a young victim who was repeatedly raped by VB, she described how she forced him to have sex with her. ZB alleged that she struck VB twice on the head which dazed him and she then caused him to penetrate her; at one point she suggested VB was so dazed he did not know what was happening. In the course of her evidence she admitted this account was wholly untrue. She gave that account in an attempt to defend VB; and</p>

She said that VB had made the suggestion that she was born in 1993 and produced the documents to that effect in an attempt to avoid a charge that he had had sexual intercourse with her when she was under 16 years of age. On this point I accept ZB&#8217;s evidence especially in light of my findings against VB. </p>
