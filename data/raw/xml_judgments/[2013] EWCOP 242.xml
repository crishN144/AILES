Over recent years, Mr and Mrs K have become increasingly concerned that as K becomes older their ability to control and supervise aspects of her life will be reduced (in some respects appropriately so), and consequently the risks of her engaging in both wanted and unwanted sexual activity increase.  Were K to become pregnant at any time in the future they believe this would have a seriously adverse effect upon her.   They have particular concerns about her college attendance when they have less ability to supervise K.</span></p>

The procedure was difficult and traumatic for K (and her mother); the effect of the hormonal implant was to change K&#8217;s temperament significantly over the following months; she became difficult to manage.  Accordingly, in a further (difficult) procedure some few months later, the implant was removed.</span></p>

These meetings involved staff from the Trust together with K&#8217;s parents; the second meeting also included representatives of the Local Authority.  The conclusion of the second meeting was that a non-therapeutic sterilisation was not in K&#8217;s best interests; it was proposed that given the difference of view between Dr. X and Dr. Y a further (third) gynaecological opinion would be sought from Dr Z.  At that time, it appears not to have been the intention of the Local Authority to direct the issue of sterilisation to the Court, or to sanction any specific treatment. </span></p>

Plainly risk management is better than invasive treatment, it is less restrictive.  Moreover, I am persuaded by Dr. Rowlands that there are less restrictive methods of achieving the purpose of contraception than sterilisation, and that in the event of a need for contraception, these ought to be attempted.  </span></p>
