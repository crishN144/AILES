The District Judge was exercising his discretion in the way he applied the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref>.  He can only have been "wrong" if the way in which he exercised his discretion was outside the band of reasonable decisions that he could have taken.

In his Form E, he calculated these assets as being worth to him &#163;45,833.  There has not been a valuation.  The position is unclear but the investments fall into two categories &#8211; investment properties on the one hand and personal flats occupied by the family on the other.  In the first category is a large block that consists of an empty soap factory on the ground floor with around 30 flats above.  The Husband says that the flats are occupied by protected tenants on very low rents.  He presents this building as more of a liability than an asset.  The second is a block that consists of a number of flats, of which six are available for the use of the various family members.  The Wife says that these flats are of high quality and that the Husband returns there around four times a year.  Indeed, the parties lived in one for around 18 months during the marriage and the District Judge seems to have accepted the Wife's evidence that this property was luxurious.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">One criticism of the District Judge's judgment is that it is said that he did not make findings as to the assets in the case.  It is correct that he did not produce an Asset Schedule but, by inference, it seems clear that he was accepting the Schedule provided by the Wife's counsel, Miss O'Driscoll but adding a further liability of &#163;15,000 to the Husband's debts to take account of a Lloyds loan taken out by the Husband in the run up to the hearing.  I have to say that it is not entirely clear to me how that loan has been utilised but it seems that the  Husband had other liabilities, such as income tax to HMRC that had not been included in his Form E.  I assume he had also incurred further debts in the run up to the hearing.  In any event, the District Judge made a clear finding that the debts had to be taken into account as the Husband had not incurred them "recklessly".  </span></p>

Any discount would be entirely arbitrary.  The simple fact of the matter is that these assets are owned by family members and arrangements have to be made to assist other members of the family who face hard times or are confronted by divorce proceedings.  I strongly suspect that the Husband will retain these assets and make good use of them when in Egypt.  This is a matter for him but the District Judge was entitled to take the properties as being worth the amount the Husband himself included in his Form E.   </span></p>

An important component of this situation is undoubtedly the fact that he has had to pay rent and that he has been making payments in relation to the former matrimonial home and children.  So far as the former is concerned, it may be that he could have obtained a slightly cheaper property than one costing &#163;820 per month but it will have been a substantial expense wherever he lived.

I equally accept that disparity in earning capacity can justify departure but again this has to be considered in the context of the needs of both parties not just the wife. In particular, there has to be consideration of how such a departure can be justified if there is also a substantive periodical payments order.

I could send the matter back for a rehearing before a District Judge or I can impose my own solution using the District Judge's findings of fact.  I am quite sure that I should not send the matter back for a rehearing.  The costs of the case are already out of all proportion to the assets involved.  The parties desperately require finality and I will have to do my best to achieve that now.   </span></p>

The Husband was left with &#163;80,928 of which &#163;45,833 is his share of the Egyptian properties.  After paying off his current debts, he would have &#163;35,095 in this jurisdiction.  Indeed, I consider his debts are bound to increase further between now and the sale of the property in two years' time.  Finally, the capital disparity might well be justified in terms of the income disparity between the spouses but, over and above the capital split, there is also a periodical payments order.  It cannot therefore be argued that the capital split was justified because there was a clean break.   </span></p>

The District Judge did not find that there were non-disclosed assets and his findings as to earning capacity amount, in reality, to the Husband putting certain personal expenses through his business accounts.  Indeed, the two examples he gives (motoring expenses and telephone) may be entirely legitimate business expenses (albeit containing a benefit not available to those who are employed).  </span></p>

The District Judge did not, however, find that he has accrued the debts recklessly.  It follows that the Husband has got into debt because he cannot afford the rent he is paying combined with the payments he is making on the mortgage and to the children.  </span></p>

This would be an increase of some &#163;300 per month on what he is paying at the moment.  He could, of course, stop the payments to the children even though his son is still in tertiary education and it is hoped his daughter will follow in due course.  Even if he did that, he would, in my view, still be in deficit and his debts would increase further.  Finally, I must remind myself that the Husband is aged 57 and not going to be able to work for ever, particularly given that it is not disputed that he does suffer from ill-health.</span></p>

I will therefore not interfere with that part of the order but it will be on a clean break basis on sale.  I entirely accept that, with resources of around &#163;150,000, the Wife will find it very difficult to buy anything other than a very small flat in the South East of England.  I also accept that, with resources of around &#163;35,000, after he has discharged his debts, the Husband will not be able to buy even that without a large mortgage.  </span></p>

Of course, each could do that if they so wish.  Equally, they could rent and use their capital to subsidise their income.  Alternatively, they may be able to purchase a modest home as postulated in the previous paragraph.  It will be for them to decide.  I am however satisfied that this is a suitable case for the departure from equality for the reasons given and that the departure, which I accept is significant, is fair.</span></p>
