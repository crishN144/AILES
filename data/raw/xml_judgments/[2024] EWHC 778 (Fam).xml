She turned then to the proposals of the parties.  Specifically, she addressed the mother&#8217;s argument that the settlement of property would in this case take place in stages: the payment of a lump sum, the provision of borrowed funds, then the settlement of the property.

In this regard, I regret that this experienced Judge misdirected herself when she said that &#8220;it did not seem right&#8221; to &#8220;order&#8221; a parent to borrow money &#8220;when whether or not anyone will lend money is not in that parent&#8217;s control&#8221; ([34]: see </span>&#167;52 above)<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">As I have illustrated above, &#8216;property&#8217; is broadly defined in both statute and caselaw.  It can be mere &#8216;property rights&#8217; (section 24 MCA 1973),  or the interest in property to which a mortgage can attach (see the MC(PM)A 1958).  It can include &#8216;proprietary rights&#8217; both legal and equitable (</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Prest</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">, at </span>&#167;<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">89 above) and/or beneficial interests (ibid.). Beneficial entitlement to property extends beyond the equity and, most pertinently here, includes occupation of the whole.  In this regard it is relevant to note the provisions of Family Law Act 1996, section 54 which specifically considers that the &#8216;estate or interest&#8217; of the person entitled to occupy exists irrespective of the mortgagee&#8217;s rights.  The expectation that the settlement is made &#8220;to the satisfaction of the court&#8221; introduces the court&#8217;s powers to give effect to its intention.  It seems to me that the Judge&#8217;s interpretation of the statutory language wrongly required entitlement to the relevant property to be absolute and unencumbered; this does not in my judgment accord with the statutory wording, or the authorities which have considered similar provisions.  Just as a settlement of property in the matrimonial context can be made even if it is mortgaged as per </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Mesher v Mesher</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> (see &#167;96 below), so can property in the Schedule 1 context in these circumstances.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn next to consider whether settlements of property under Schedule 1 CA 1989 can be made subject to mortgage.  Settlements under Schedule 1 are a form of property adjustment order, and in relation to children of unmarried parents the court is exercising a similar power to the parallel property adjustment power in matrimonial proceedings (see section 24 of the MCA 1973 set out at &#167;86 above).  A good example of a settlement in the matrimonial jurisdiction <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">is the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Mesher</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> order (</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Mesher v Mesher and Hall</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> [1980] 1 All ER 126); under such an order, property (often the family home) is settled on trust for one party&#8217;s occupation with the children until the happening of a certain trigger event.  It is clear from case law that </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Mesher</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> orders may settle property subject to mortgages, and MCA 1973 property adjustment orders are generally drafted to be &#8216;subject&#8217; to any mortgage borrowing.</span></p>

However, section 30 gives the court power when making a property adjustment order to direct that the matter be referred to one of the conveyancing counsel of the court for him to settle a proper instrument to be executed by all necessary parties.

But that is overwhelmingly the way in which Schedule 1 housing provision is interpreted and routinely carried into effect &#8211; that is to say, a sum of money is paid over from one party to the other (usually in one tranche) to purchase a property on trust terms; after the property is purchased &#8211; at the point when the payer is then &#8220;entitled&#8221; to the property &#8220;in possession or reversion&#8221; &#8211; it is settled on Schedule 1 terms.

I wish to make clear that I am not saying that the Arbitrator was wrong on the facts as they were presented to him, but I consider that his objective took the parties close to the limits of their likely resources.  The Arbitrator himself recognised that he was juggling debt and borrowing (see </span>&#167;<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">26 above); such cases are undoubtedly the hardest financial remedy cases.  But the extent of the proposed borrowing under the arbitral award was to be colossal by many standards, and would have required an extremely high level of financial servicing, which on the evidence before the Judge in June 2023 looked somewhat more uncertain.</span></p>

The father&#8217;s earlier agreement to fund mortgaged property for the mother and children could be considered as one of the general &#8220;circumstances&#8221; of the case, and possibly as a reflection of the father&#8217;s greater confidence in his likely available resources (Schedule 1 paragraph 4(1)), but in no more specific way than that.

She limited herself in this way quite deliberately and explicitly, and in so doing, she did not address in any particular detail the arguments of the mother on those points.  Notable among the mother&#8217;s arguments, which remained largely unaddressed, were (a) that information produced in the hearing before the Judge demonstrated that the father&#8217;s financial circumstances were in some respects rather better than the Arbitrator had understood; and (b) that the Arbitrator had made adverse findings (in the costs judgment) about the father&#8217;s litigation conduct and specifically his less than frank disclosure.  In the latter respect, it appears from the extract of the transcript which I have seen that during the hearing in June 2023 the Judge raised with Mr Glaser a significant question mark about at least one other alleged &#8220;deception&#8221; by the father of the Arbitrator, though no finding or conclusion was reached about this; it did not find its way into the judgment, and I have therefore ignored it.</span></p>
