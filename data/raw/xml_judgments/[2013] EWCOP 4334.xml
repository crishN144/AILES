All the parties before the court agree that it is in JK&#8217;s best interests to live in a nursing home but the one issue on which they cannot agree is the choice of home. MK and KK have always contended that the Home was not suitable for JK and they have over time put forward a number of alternative homes. The only alternative now available is the home now known as the &#8216;CNC Home&#8217;. The PCT have told me that if it is appropriate then the CNC Home can take JK and that no funding issues arise. JiK, MoK and EK have nothing bad to say about the CNC Home but they say that JK should remain at the Home because in particular they consider the Home to be a satisfactory home and that they consider that the risks to JK&#8217;s health and wellbeing if he were to be subjected to a move do not justify the move.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:TimesNewRoman;font-size:12pt">MK made an application to the court to be appointed Personal Welfare Deputy for JK and that is how these proceedings commenced. However, all parties accept that the one issue is residence and that it is to be determined by a court and this case has been case managed on the basis of resolution of this one issue since 4</span><span style="font-family:TimesNewRoman;font-size:8pt">th </span><span style="font-family:TimesNewRoman;font-size:12pt">March 2011 since which time JK has been a party with the Official Solicitor as his litigation friend. Expert evidence has been obtained by the Official Solicitor and is found within the reports of Dr Barker, consultant in old age psychiatry, and Miss Phair, an independent nurse expert witness in the specialist field of older people. I have had the advantage of being the judge throughout these proceedings and the continuity I think has proven to be invaluable in this case. I have read the significant documentation and witness statements in the two hearing files, which are now three hearing files, running over some 820 or more pages. Where witnesses have not been the subject of significant challenge and have not given oral evidence I have generally taken their written evidence as read. Over the course of three days I have heard from MK, KK, JiK, MoK and EK &#8211; who are on JiK&#8217;s side &#8211; from the PCT Mr Higgins, Dr Mennon, and for JK the expert evidence to which I have already referred. The PCT was prepared to call staff from the Home who have not filed statements to deal with the Home&#8217;s responses to the shortcomings alleged against it and the improvements made by the Home. I may possibly have allowed such evidence to be called if that were the right thing to do after applying the overriding objective that we see in Rule 3 of the Court of Protection Rules 2007. However, the Home is not itself a party. The court had already formed the view that the best way to consider the quality of the Home&#8217;s case was by way of expert reports as obtained by the Official Solicitor. It was appropriate to approach this part of the case on the basis of information obtained by and made available to the Official Solicitor rather than by the court carrying out a time-consuming investigation of its own. The quality of the Home&#8217;s care was only one of a number of features in this case, and it would not have been fair or just really in 2012 to expect the court to be bounced into taking such evidence orally given the amount of time there had been to prepare the case and given the way the case had been managed to date. The positions of the family members did not change at the conclusion of the case, so MK and KK want JK to move to the CNC Home; JiK, MoK and EK want JK to stay put at the Home. The position of the PCT is neutral as between the two care homes and the position of the Official Solicitor at the conclusion of the case was that JK should move to the CNC Home.</span></p>

I have been told that he continues to play the piano and he continues to enjoy listening to music including that which he composed himself. He is able to operate an iPod. There was a time in the history when JK became estranged from two of his siblings, namely, EK and MoK. It seemed that JK remained close to his sons but they became estranged from their sister JiK, who remained close to EK and MK. I did not and do not consider it helpful to anyone &#8211; and I include JK of course in that &#8211; to inquire any further into the cause or causes of the fallings-out. In about 2006 JK was diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia and Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease. At that time he was living in his home in London. JK required ever-increasing amounts of care. As I understand the evidence of the family it was mainly KK at this time who provided JK with most of the care and support that he needed, and that was not challenged in evidence. Unfortunately, JK deteriorated. In 2010 he developed a tendency to leave his home and be found wandering, lost, in London. There came a point when JK was admitted to Hospital and ready for discharge but not to his own home. As I said previously, it was always agreed that a nursing home was appropriate and in fact it would be an NHS nursing home under the continuing care provisions. Jill was content for JK to be discharged to the Home. At that time MK and KK did not consider the Home to be appropriate. I understand that the PCT came to the conclusion that whatever else it was not appropriate to keep JK in the hospital, he needed to be discharged somewhere and so the PCT told me he was discharged to the Home on 27</span><span style="font-family:TimesNewRoman;font-size:8pt">th </span><span style="font-family:TimesNewRoman;font-size:12pt">May 2010 as an interim measure.</span></p>

He was also troubled that JK&#8217;s iPod had gone missing. It was especially valuable to JK because it holds his music, and of course it is a valuable machine. They were concerned that the Home had not dealt with that issue properly. They were troubled by further observations that they made about the nursing home generally; for example, the way in which a particular resident was handled &#8211; they felt that the way that resident was handled amounted to abuse. This triggered off further investigations. The Care Quality Commission carried out a review of the Home. Their findings are dated in January 2011. They are in the bundle. They have three particular concerns found at C73 of the bundle:</span></p>

He requires 24-hour care including supervision and assistance with personal care, showering and toileting. His needs are likely to increase over time, at least with regard to deteriorating cognitive function and declining independence with activities of daily living. It is difficult to predict what will happen to his behavioural challenges, in particular his propensity to aggression. Eventually these will become less risky to himself and others. However, even though in this specialised environment his antipsychotic sedative medication has been withdrawn he is currently still receiving three psychotropic medications and at times still has aggressive outbursts that require skilled nursing to manage. In the near future therefore this is likely to continue to be a challenge for those caring for him.&#8217;</span></p>

Dr Mennon described him as a free spirit. JK is disturbed by others making a disturbance. He likes to play a working piano. Whilst I am sure that most adults would like the following matters, I have the clear impression that JK in particular would favour space, peace, opportunity to enjoy listening to and by playing the piano making music. JK requires physical assistance. It does seem to be the case on the evidence that if this assistance is provided by more than one person and the persons are female, aggression may be triggered which inevitably requires more assistance to be given in a sort of vicious circle. I do have the firm impression that that is not a home-specific problem; it is a problem that emanates from JK himself and requires skill and tact on the part of those caring for him.</span></p>

So, in summary, he requires a nursing home which can provide him with the best environment, amenities and care, affection, attention and stimulation reasonably attainable. So, the issues at the final hearing I think can be summarised as follows given what the parties all have to say. The ability of the Home to meet JK&#8217;s needs; the ability of the CNC Home to meet JK&#8217;s needs; the risks to JK of a move from the Home to the CNC Home; the motives, wishes and feelings of MK, KK and JiK in particular, and also MoK and EK.</span></p>

JK is bound to have some familiarity with the Home &#8211; layout, familiar faces &#8211; although I understand his ability to recall these matters is sadly fading. What about the accommodation? MK and KK have never been impressed with the accommodation. I do have the impression of a rather compact unit with limited room. Dr Barker found the place dark and claustrophobic. JK&#8217;s bedroom does not have a toilet of his own. There is a small garden which I am told is often locked and inaccessible. Part of the garden is gravelled and there is concern, echoed by Dr Mennon, that that is dangerous &#8211; something needs to be done, it needs to be changed. There is a piano but one key at times has not worked. So far as food and activities are concerned, there is no menu choice with respect to food; there are activities but they do not appear to be individual tailor-made activities, rather a schedule of activities for the inhabitants as a whole.</span></p>

Dr Barker described it as institutionalised. Miss Phair remains to date concerned that the care model of the Home is traditional. An example was given with respect to trousers. There was a time when JK was being visited. He was wearing trousers which were too large for him. He had no belt and had to hold his trousers up to move around. That does seem to strike me as being really rather undignified for JK and an example of not looking at things through the eyes of the inhabitants. Dr Barker fairly observed that quality of care at homes generally can be and frequently is cyclical, and that the Home perhaps having found its nadir is perhaps now on its way up.</span></p>

JiK said give the CNC Home that sort of scrutiny and shortcomings may come to light. She has been proven right, I think, in that respect. What has been displayed to all of us is that there is no such thing as a perfect nursing home or care home. I am quite confident that no one will find one. So far as familiarity is concerned, JK is not familiar with the CNC Home, has not been there, but I have the impression from the medical evidence that because of his condition if he moves there JK will soon develop as much familiarity with the CNC Home as he was able to develop with the Home. So far as the accommodation is concerned, it has been described as light and airy; the bedroom has an en suite toilet; there is accommodation in which relatives can stay if appropriate; there are gardens and a sensory room. I have the impression that there is far greater prospect of escape from other noisier residents and there is a fully working piano. So far as food and activities are concerned, there is a choice of menu. Of course the fact that there is a choice does not necessarily mean the food is any nicer, but perhaps more importantly activities are tailored to the residents, which I think is an important consideration. It also seems to have the advantage with respect to care in that physiotherapy is provided and indeed there is a dedicated physiotherapy room. Miss Phair and Dr Barker, very much acting as ears and eyes for the court and indeed for the parties, were both impressed by the person-centred approach at the CNC Home. Indeed no one I think sought to be critical of it in any way at all.</span></p>

The precise transition package if the move were to be considered to be in JK&#8217;s best interests would be assembled by collaboration between the professionals concerned or to be concerned with JK&#8217;s care, and the family, and I have no doubt that it would be appropriate for The PCT to take the lead. Plainly the task is of critical importance and there always needs to be a Plan B. I am told that to help with the transition one-to-one care might be needed initially and Dr Mennon told me that he considered it vital that a member of the take-over Community Mental Health Team should be involved.</span></p>

JiK, MoK and EK in their own ways have all made again a very fair point that if it was felt that there should be a Plan B to cater for the possibility that JK does not settle at the CNC Home that is itself a good reason for not experimenting with moving him in the first place. That is entirely understandable but I think it has to be looked at in the context of assessing the risk of a transition failing. There are no guarantees in this case but the evidence &#8211; the expert evidence &#8211; shows me that the risk of moving to the CNC Home should be assessed as small.</span></p>

This is really a matter between the three children of JK. I have already referred to the estrangements that have occurred in the family and I refused to hear oral evidence on the rifts. Each side of the family appears to blame the other for the existence of the rifts but the sad fact of the matter seems to me to be that neither side seems to have a lot of time or respect for the views of the other. One is certainly left with the impression of an element of power struggle in the family, and I need to consider whether or not that has tainted the opinion of any family member. MK and KK were insistent in their views from the very beginning that the Home was not right for JK. They did not want him to go there in the first place. At one time they did possess a laudable motive of trying to move JK to a home geographically closer to their own, which was particularly understandable given that there is only one set of grandchildren, as I understand, who are the children of KK. I am sure that there is much value to be had in ensuring that the grandchildren can see their grandfather. MK and KK were able to impress me because they both accepted that in time there was no care suitable for their father other than the CNC Home. They have shown a degree of flexibility.</span></p>

She, her aunt and uncle, have consistently said they regard the care given to JK at the Home to be of the highest standard, and I refer to their witness statements and closing submissions. It was not accepted that JK had suffered any injury, and as I say, either concerns raised by the experts Miss Phair or the CQC were either not accepted or downplayed.

I was concerned that Jill did not seem to me to reflect much upon her stance notwithstanding the evidence from Miss Phair, Dr Barker and Dr Mennon, all three of whom must be regarded as objective in this matter with no reason to want to favour one place or another. On questioning from counsel for the Official Solicitor she felt the only improvement required at the Home was turfing of the garden.

I cannot say quite the same for JiK. I am certain JiK is primarily motivated by a wish to do the right thing for her father. But I think her rigid refusal to countenance the possibility of an alternative to the Home or that the Home has failed her father in any way persuades me that there is an element of wanting to get her own way in this case. It is not all rosy. I must add dissatisfaction in the way in which MK and KK have treated their sister. It seems to me that there has been little attempt at meaningful collaboration and discussion from their side. I very much had the impression from Directions hearings through to this final hearing that the brothers regarded their sister as a junior partner and that they made their view known to JiK that she was a junior partner. I do not think that was appropriate. In the hearing and indeed in the closing submission much has been made about totting up number of visits on a sort of score card, which I do not think is appropriate. In my judgment in this case there should be no discrimination by the three children between the three children of JK; they should treat each other as equals should future decisions need to be made for JK.</span></p>

Whilst I do not consider there to be any hierarchy as such it is appropriate in my judgment to give significant weight to the independent expert evidence and I should only depart from that evidence if there is good reason to do so. Until given the option of the CNC Home Dr Barker was of the view that JK should remain at the Home. The report of Miss Phair and the emergence of the availability of the CNC Home are the matters which persuaded Dr Barker on balance to support a move to the CNC Home. Miss Phair firmly supports JK moving from the Home to the CNC Home. But that view arose only when the CNC Home became available as an option. The experts re-visited and confirmed their evidence when the safeguarding alerts arose in respect of the CNC Home and they were able to look at the alerts and look at whether or not any were made out and/or relevant.</span></p>

I have already compared the Home and the CNC Home in various ways and it is apparent that the CNC Home is superior in a number of respects. The physical environment- Dr Barker noted that this difference was &#8211; his word &#8211; pivotal. The ambience and person centred approach was better and more suited to JK&#8217;s needs. There have been the concerns at the Home but its improvement still seems to be a work in progress. The sustainability of improvement, especially when the spotlight of court proceedings is switched off, is unknown. Miss Phair, I think, was hoping for there to be rather more progress than there has been to date. The CNC Home is not perfect; nowhere is. It does seem however to have a good system of checks and balances and alerts. Its alerting system, as we have seen in recent evidence, seems to function well and rather better than that deployed at the Home, whose response to safeguarding alerts was criticised by Miss Phair as being negative and uninformed on the part of the staff. I remind myself that none of JK&#8217;s children has a criticism to make of the CNC Home.</span></p>

I am also obliged to consider Article 8 of the European Convention. I note that this dispute within the family could not have been resolved by any lesser method other than by this court intervening and making a Best Interests decision, therefore the court intervention is in my judgment proportionate and further to a legitimate aim of resolving a family dispute. The decision that I will make for JK is that it is in his best interests to move to the CNC Home on the basis that his placement at the Home will be retained for eight weeks so that he has somewhere to return should the move to the CNC Home fail. I do not propose to make any tailored orders with respect to how the transition plan is to be assembled. I will leave that to the PCT.</span></p>

This case began as an application by MK to be appointed Deputy in respect of JK&#8217;s personal welfare. That part of the application was not pursued by MK nor indeed any other member of the family. I have been invited by counsel for the Official Solicitor to provide a short judgment of the circumstances in which the court might be minded to appoint a Personal Welfare Deputy, the judgment being for the benefit of family members in this case should any of them think about applying for Deputyship in the future.</span></p>

The Code of Practice itself says at para. 8-38 that Deputies for personal welfare decisions will only be required in the most difficult cases where important and necessary actions cannot be carried out without the court&#8217;s authority or there is no other way of settling the matter in the best interests of the person who lacks capacity to make particular welfare decisions.

As I read <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> and the Code and the authorities, the place of Deputyship is to fill a legal vacuum when there are a number of non-contentious decisions to be made and as a matter of law someone needs to be given a legal status to make those decisions. When I say as a matter of law, it may be as a matter of essential practicality as well. Appointment of Deputies for the property and financial affairs of incapacitated persons is common because it is difficult to find otherwise a legal status to receive the income and pay the bills. However, whilst each case must always turn on its own facts I think it would be very rare for the court to consider it right to delegate its issue-resolving function to a Deputy on any significant issue of principle such as residence, type of care, treatment and such like. The role of resolving such issues must remain with the court of justice.</span></p>
