The burden of proof lies on the party asserting that a person does not have capacity, in this case NYCC. A person lacks capacity in relation to a matter if at the material time he is &#8220;unable to make a decision for himself in relation to the matter because of an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain&#8221; (section 2(1) MCA).

The conclusion of both assessments was that MAG lacks capacity in the relevant areas.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">On the joint instruction of the parties (with the exception of GC), a report was prepared by Dr Lisa Rippon, psychiatrist, dated 13 June 2012, also to address capacity.  She confirmed MAG&#8217;s diagnosis of severe learning disability and provided recommendations for his support plan and care package.  There is no dispute that MAG lacks capacity to conduct these proceedings and make the decisions in question and final declarations to that effect have already been made.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">MAG cannot stand independently and when he is at home in his ground-floor flat he mobilises by crawling and pulling himself along the floor and up on to chairs and his bed.  He uses a wheelchair outdoors and is secured when in it by the use of a Crelling (Houdini) harness which serves as a protection for him and others.  He is unable to use his wheelchair indoors because there is insufficient room to enable him to manoeuvre it.  He has 1:1 support at all times and 2:1 support in the community save for those times when an experienced and willing member of his care team takes him out in his wheelchair.  Since December 2011 he has received 35 hours of 2:1 support each week (increased from 28 hours).  At all other times he remains in his flat.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">MAG has lived at his current property at the Tenancy since 2006.  It is GC&#8217;s position that this was only ever intended to be a short term measure.  Although she has not attended court and given evidence she has filed a statement in which she makes this assertion.  This is disputed by NYCC.  MAG had been evicted from privately rented accommodation in 2003 due to damage caused to the property.  He then experienced a number of short term moves until he moved to a property known as SM in September 2005.  That was unsuitable for his long term occupation because of the stairs.  NYCC refers to the contact sheet at D254 which records that on 9 August 2006 GC contacted NYCC to request that MAG be moved.  There was then a meeting with the Housing Provider, the major housing provider for the area, on 29 August 2006 to discuss MAG&#8217;s needs.  On 25 September 2006 GC contacted NYCC to say that MAG had accepted a property through the Housing Provider.  It is NYCC&#8217;s position that GC had taken the lead in working with the Housing Provider in obtaining the property and that there is no reference to this being a temporary solution.  However it was NYCC and not GC which was responsible for addressing MAG&#8217;s housing needs and ensuring that any property chosen was suitable to meet those needs.  MAG lacked the capacity to make that decision for himself.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">MAG moved into the property at the Tenancy in October 2006.  The property is a one bedroomed ground floor flat which is too small to accommodate the use of a wheelchair.  MAG has a support team of 11 workers and up to 4 workers are involved in his care each day.  He is able to access the community on a daily basis but there is no outside space which he can use at the property.  It is NYCC&#8217;s position that the evidence of his carers confirms that MAG mobilises on his hands and knees whilst in the property and has shown no interest in using his wheelchair indoors.  It is said that he appears to associate use of the wheelchair with going out of the property.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The property has only one bedroom and there is no scope for sleeping night staff.  NYCC accepts that the use of sleeping night staff means that there would be less intrusion into MAG&#8217;s private life than using waking carers.  However, NYCC&#8217;s position is that the key social worker, FC, Ms B and the autism specialist, Ms T assessed MAG as needing waking night staff.  A less interventionist approach has been trialled but it is said that it was unsuccessful because it led to MAG becoming distressed.</p>

	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The fact that the property has no outside space means that when MAG is not taken out he is confined to his flat.  NYCC&#8217;s position is that whilst it accepts that the amenity of a garden would be desirable it should not be a factor in determining whether or not the deprivation of liberty in this case is necessary and proportionate.  The desirability of an outside space has to be balanced against the agreed need for MAG to remain in the town centre in a property where he can &#8216;people watch&#8217; from his window which is something he clearly gains enjoyment from.</p>

On that basis, NYCC seeks final declarations.</p>

She identified the way MAG&#8217;s mobilisation affects his perception of the world and how it affects staff perception of him which in turn affects the manner in which he is cared for.  She made a clear recommendation that a search for a new property is necessary and should continue.  In her latest report she records that the support for MAG is now less restrictive than that observed when she was first instructed.  She makes positive comments about the approach taken by the care providers.  She is clear that the one aspect which remains unresolved is MAG&#8217;s accommodation.</p>

The corridor leading from the bedroom to the lounge and kitchen is too narrow to move a wheelchair into those rooms.  He moves around the flat on his bottom and using his hands and knees.  This has resulted in him sustaining painful bursitis in both knees and he has calluses to his knees and ankles.  Ms Hutchinson advised that MAG&#8217;s current property does not meet his needs and that he should be able to live in a property which ensures he can live a life with dignity and comfort and which does not cause him physical or emotional harm.</p>

It seeks the authorisation of the court for MAG&#8217;s continued deprivation of liberty on the basis that it is justified as a result of his condition which renders the restrictions proportionate and necessary.  NYCC says that the issues raised by the expert, Christine Hutchinson, and the Official Solicitor relate to whether the outcome could be achieved in a less restrictive manner but that there are no less restrictive options available.  Where it has been possible to make adjustments to achieve a less restrictive outcome, such as time spent in the community, this has been done.</p>

The accommodation at the Tenancy and his care package which mean that he is not permitted to leave unaccompanied and is under continuous supervision and control, have the effect of depriving MAG of his liberty.  The outcome cannot be achieved in a less restrictive way and the restrictions in place are necessary and proportionate.  On that basis the deprivation of liberty should be authorised by the court.</p>

To refuse to authorise the deprivation of liberty, given that there is no alternative, would require clear evidence that the placement is breaching MAG&#8217;s Article 5 rights and requires something more than evidence simply of an imperfect placement.  It is submitted that when looking at the bigger picture, including MAG&#8217;s current staff and the wider community there is not the evidence to support the allegation advanced by the Official Solicitor that the current placement breaches MAG&#8217;s Article 5 rights. </p>

There is no outside space and the space within the property is limited such that he cannot use his wheelchair indoors should he wish to do so.  The fact that he has no alternative but to mobilise by dragging himself around on his hands and knees has led to Bursitis in both knees and calluses to his knees and ankles resulting from friction with the floor.  I note that when MAG was at the residential care home whilst his property was refurbished he mobilised within the care home using his wheelchair.  I am not satisfied that, if he had the option of using his wheelchair within his home, he would choose not to use it.  In his present accommodation he is deprived even of that option.</p>

This has been as a result of the recommendations made by Ms Hutchinson which the care provider have implemented.</p>

It is submitted on his behalf that liberty can be restricted by the physical environment in which care is delivered and that the narrow corridors, lack of outdoor space, lack of privacy and lack of a wheelchair (when his needed repair and no replacement was made available) amount to a disproportionate deprivation of liberty in this case.  The evidence relating to each of those issues is set out in the Official Solicitor&#8217;s Closing Submissions and I do not intend to repeat it here.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">It is also of concern that MAG did not have a care manager from 2008 to 2010.  Ms FC in her oral evidence said that without a care manager MAG&#8217;s file would only be picked up by a duty worker as the need arose because he was considered to have a settled package of care with no issues.  The reality was that there were issues in relation to his accommodation given the assessment of MAG&#8217;s needs by the occupational therapist in 2006 and the fact that his accommodation was not suitable to meet those needs.  In her witness statement dated 19 February 2015 Ms B said that, &#8216;&#8230; until December 2014 [MAG] was not a priority for re-housing with the Housing Provider which limited the possibilities with them&#8217;.  I accept the submission that it was only as a result of the pressure put on by the Official Solicitor that MAG&#8217;s housing status was reclassified from Bronze to Gold.  NYCC left the question of MAG&#8217;s housing to the Housing Provider and did not accept its responsibility until 2 August 2013, almost two years after these proceedings were commenced and considerably longer after the date of the occupational therapist&#8217;s assessment.  It would appear however that the Housing Provider were not in possession of all the relevant material.  I have seen the letter dated 19 July 2013 which says that they had not had the benefit of, &#8216;&#8230; the professional reports appertaining to [MAG&#8217;s] accommodation needs not any medical reports for consideration under the Allocations Policy&#8217;.</p>

I am urged by the Official Solicitor not to authorise this deprivation of liberty because it is unwarranted because the intensity of the measures and in particular those which result from the environmental features of the property are not justified and proportionate.  MAG has remained at the Tenancy for nine years and been subject to a deprivation of liberty there.  He has no choice but to mobilise on his hands and knees which has caused physical problems including Bursitis and a recurring fungal infection in his thigh.  He does not have access to suitable outdoor space and sleeping night support is not possible in the absence of a second bedroom.  The only private space he has is his own bedroom.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">I have considered the submissions of the parties and in this case I have the benefit of having seen MAG at the Tenancy.  As I have indicated already, I accept the submissions of the Official Solicitor in relation to the issues with the current accommodation and on that basis I consider that I cannot endorse a care regime which risks breaching MAG&#8217;s right to liberty.  This may be all that is available at present but I am not satisfied that NYCC has taken the steps necessary to ensure that there is no breach of its obligations.  I am aware of the steps which have been taken recently.  However, MAG&#8217;s needs were identified by the assessment in 2006.  It is clear that the Tenancy does not meet those needs and that should have been clear when the property was identified by GC in 2006.  In 2013 the Commissioners accepted a move would be in MAG&#8217;s best interests and would be less restrictive.  This is a question of MAG&#8217;s liberty and I do not accept that I can authorise the deprivation of that liberty on the basis that nothing else is available.  He has been in this unsatisfactory situation for a prolonged period.  NYCC has been extremely slow to accept its responsibilities in relation to rehousing him.  These proceedings started in 2011 and it was not until 2 August 2013 that it accepted it owed a duty in this respect.</p>
