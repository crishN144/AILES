	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case involves consideration of the removal of an infant child from the care of his mother into the care of the father in circumstances where the child&#8217;s mother has refused to engage with or cooperate with proceedings concerning the child&#8217;s welfare. It concerns issues of some public concern and debate. Accordingly, I indicated that an anonymised version of the judgment may be published at a later date. This is that anonymised version which I have decided to publish after the conclusion of the public law proceedings. To aide with readability and anonymisation I have changed the names of the participants and made less specific any identifying features of the factual background.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case concerns a&#160;boy by the name of Ben (not his real name) who was born in 2021.  He is a little over one year old. An application was issued by the Local Authority (Cumbria County Council) for public law (a care or supervision) orders on 1st&#160;November 2022.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ben&#8217;s mother is Amy (not her real name).  His father is James (not his real name).  Ben has a children&#8217;s&#160;guardian by the name of Deborah Turner.  The key social worker for Ben and the author of the Section 37 report undertaken prior to this application, is Ms&#160;Johnstone.  Today, I&#160;have before me the complete bundle in relation to non-molestation proceedings that were issued against James by Amy back in March of 2022.  I&#160;have the private law proceedings bundle in the proceedings relating to Ben issued by James for a child arrangements order in respect of Ben. I&#160;have a&#160;bundle in the proceedings prepared for me by the Local Authority in respect of their application.  In addition, there are other items of evidence that are not in those bundles that I will refer to in a&#160;moment.</p>

Mr&#160;Graham appears on behalf of Ben, instructed, of course, by his guardian, Ms&#160;Turner.  The person that is absent is Amy, Ben&#8217;s mother.  It seems to me that it is important that I&#160;set out in this judgment the steps that the court, not just myself, but courts previously have taken to try to engage Amy in the proceedings. I have given this judgement orally at the conclusion of the hearing as the effect of my decision will need to be implemented speedily.</p>

He made an application dated 18th&#160;February 2022 for a&#160;child arrangements order in respect of Ben. At that time he was not having any contact with his young son.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 11th&#160;March 2022, Amy made an application for a&#160;non-molestation order pursuant to the&#160;Family Law Act 1996, in respect of James. That is an order seeking to keep him away from her. In pursuit of that non-molestation order application, she made allegations about James's behaviour, including primarily an allegation of an incident of rape following an evening of drinking in which she accused James of spiking her drinks and thereafter having non-consensual sex with her. That was a&#160;matter that she complained to police about. The police took no further action, having seen various text messages and communications between Amy and James and apparently concluding that they appear to undermine Amy&#8217;s allegation because there were text messages that indicated that the event was consensual.  It was that incident and other less significant allegations that Amy made about the father both in pursuit of both her application for an injunction and also her assertion that Ben should not have any contact with his father.</p>

Both parties were represented and a&#160;non-molestation order was made on a &#8216;without prejudice&#8217; and interim basis. In other words, without any findings having been made. Provision was made for the parties to file a&#160;schedule and statements in support of their allegations or response to allegations, with a view to the factual disputes being determined at a later hearing.</p>

He was represented but unlike the hearing that had taken place on 1st&#160;April, Amy did not attend, remotely or in person. She was not represented.  The injunction was an unresolved situation and therefore the matter of contact was adjourned to be listed before District Judge Todd on 15th June, together with further consideration of the non-molestation application.</p>

It records that it is satisfied it has jurisdiction to deal with the dispute relating to Ben, included, but not limited to, making orders regarding his living and contact arrangements.   The Court recorded that it was satisfied that the mother had notice of that 15th June hearing and has chosen not to attend. It notes that there is a&#160;live application in respect of the issue of Ben's relationship with his father and sets out that the Court works on the basis that unless there is good reason not to, there is a&#160;presumption that both parents should be involved in Ben's life <span style="font-style:italic">if it is safe</span>.  There is a&#160;recording that Ben has not seen his father, and vice versa, since Ben was six weeks old.  The Court reminded the mother that all communications with the court must be transparent and the father's solicitor must be copied into any e-mails that are sent to the court and made it clear that the court will not enter into e-mail correspondence with the parties.

Despite the contents of the last order, the mother did not copy the solicitors and father into the e-mail.

The matter was listed on 10th&#160;August and directions were given again making it clear that there will be a&#160;hearing and that orders will be made in the absence of a&#160;party who fails to attend. On the face of the order the Court asked the Local Authority to consider whether it needed to apply for a&#160;supervision or a&#160;care order in relation to Ben.</p>

She reported, via a case note, that the social worker visited the mother's home within the last two weeks and Ben was present and was observed to be receiving good physical care. It was confirmed that the Local Authority would be undertaking a&#160;Section 37 report, as ordered, and the Section 37 report would be filed such that there will be a&#160;further hearing on 7th October before District Judge Todd.</p>

The order formulated by District Judge Todd recorded that a&#160;non-molestation order had been made on 1st&#160;April by the Lay Justices on Amy's application; James had denied the allegations but did not oppose the making of the interim order pending both parties being given the opportunity to file evidence; Amy did not attend the hearing on 5th&#160;May, having sent an e-mail to the court questioning the court's jurisdiction.  She failed to attend further hearings, again having sent&#160;similar e-mails, and that she had failed, in essence, to progress her allegations in relation to James.  Accordingly, District Judge Todd discharged the non-molestation order that had been in place against James up until that point.</p>

I&#160;recorded that whilst mother made serious allegations against the father, the police have considered the allegations and have pursued no further action and that the mother has not sought to prosecute the issues within the Children Act proceedings or, indeed, the injunction proceedings.  I&#160;warned the mother that if she fails to attend the hearing which I&#160;was then going to list on 24th&#160;October, details of which were set out, the Court will proceed on the basis that she is not making any allegations against the Applicant father regarding his behaviour that would have any potential negative effect upon the time he spends with his son.  It is recorded that the mother has made it clear to the court and the parties in a&#160;number of communications that her view was that there should be no relationship between Ben and his father.  I was of the view that the section 37 report did not engage fully with the issues in the case. I was satisfied that the interim threshold criteria were established pursuant to section 38 of the Children Act 1989. I made Ben subject to an interim care order, thereby, of course, granting the Local Authority shared parental responsibility for Ben. I&#160;recorded my expression of concern that there was an urgent need to establish direct supervised contact between Ben and his father and, in doing so, made orders that Ben would be made the subject of an interim care order pursuant to the Section 37 direction that I&#160;was again making.  I&#160;made a&#160;Section 34 order providing for contact to take place between Ben and his father, and I&#160;indicated that on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October, if that order had not been complied with, the Court would consider what further steps could be taken in relation to the situation.</p>

As such, the Court indicated that if the mother continues to fail to engage with the proceedings that the Court may dismiss the allegation of rape made by the mother.  This would mean the Court would proceed on the basis that the father did not pose any risk of harm to Ben and would likely direct the Local Authority to complete an expedited assessment of the father as a&#160;carer of Ben.  The Court acknowledges the serious nature of the allegations made by the mother and the importance of determining the allegations by some means.  The Court made it clear if the mother engages in the proceedings, that provision can be made for special measures, i.e. screens to be in place, and separate waiting rooms so she does not have to see the father.  </p>

I am frankly at a&#160;loss to know how else the Court, with its sometimes relatively blunt powers, could have sought to engage the mother in these proceedings, proceedings that she engaged in early on when she made an application for a&#160;non-molestation order, when she appeared to be willing to accept the court&#8217;s jurisdiction.  </p>

The guardian has attempted in vain, I am afraid to say, to see Ben and to have conversations with Amy.  Her attempts have been robust but rebuffed.  At the beginning of this process, Ms&#160;Johnstone was more successful and, indeed, her reports and oral evidence relate how she tried to persuade Amy of the sense of engaging in proceedings and the appropriateness of both accepting the jurisdiction of the Court and take an active part in determining what is best for the future of Ben. She also made it clear, not in a threatening sense but in the sense of giving appropriate advice, what the potential consequences could be if Amy failed to engage with court orders. Amy allowed Ms Johnstone three visits to complete the initial section 37 report but since then has not permitted further visits.</p>

Well, if the Court does nothing, all the evidence suggests that Ben will continue to be exposed to an entirely negative view of his father; he will have no relationship, and no prospect of a&#160;relationship, with his father or paternal family.  On the other hand, if Ben were to go and live with his father, then in the medium to long-term, I&#160;have no doubt whatsoever that James is willing and, indeed, certainly at the moment, with the support of the Local Authority, able to provide a&#160;positive view of Ben's mother and to cooperate with arrangements for contact between Ben and his mother.</p>

The father would have help from his mother, who Ben also does not currently know. I&#160;take into account how inherently potentially harmful that is, certainly in the short-term.

The first is a&#160;recovery order authorising a&#160;police officer to find and gain access to the child.  I&#160;anticipate that may well be a&#160;fraught and difficult situation but will have to be handled with considerable care and the police should be fully informed.  Secondly, given the unorthodox&#160;(a mild characterisation) views expressed by Amy, I&#160;believe James requires the protection of an exclusion order.</p>

The local authority (represented by Ms G Whiteley), the guardian on behalf of the child (represented by Ms C Booth) and the father (represented by Ms C Snape) supported the making of a supervision order. The mother (represented by Ms H Wheeler) was neutral on the issue of whether a supervision order was necessary and proportionate. I determined that it was the appropriate order in particular in light of the history of the matter and the risks that I determined remained extant concerning Ben&#8217;s future welfare.</p>
