The context of this application is a long-running and difficult dispute involving the two children of S and his former wife in which there have been a number of different applications to the court and in the course of which SP was appointed as the children's guardian. </span></p>

Of relevance are the following matters.  S is a registered sex offender and is subject to a sex offender prevention order until July 2017.  S is also the subject of a protection from harassment order following a conviction for harassment of the mother.  That order expires on 31</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">st</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> March 2017.

In March 2014 S tried to hang himself outside the family home.  The police attended the property and found him with a ligature around his neck.  On that occasion he was detained under the Mental Health Act section 136.  Despite the making of the protection from harassment order, allegations of harassment continued and on at least one occasion S was taken into custody following alleged breaches of the order.  As a result of these matters, S has had no direct contact with the children since March 2014.  </span></p>

I have not seen any response from the court or the police to this letter.  Further correspondence ensued between S and CAFCASS and subsequently S, dissatisfied with the way his complaints to CAFCASS had been treated by CAFCASS, made a complaint via his MP to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman ["PHSO"]. </span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.18in"><span style="font-size:14pt">"The welfare of [the children] is my paramount consideration when addressing their wishes for having contact with their father.  I must balance the children's wishes alongside the consideration being given to the potential and/or on-going risks direct contact could have upon their welfare and safety in promoting contact.  Without an expert assessment in addressing the unassessed risks, it remains my view that contact will not be in the children's best interests until this much-needed assessment can determine what risk management is needed in order to promote safe and appropriate contact for them.  I am concerned with S's behaviour towards this process, given it is his application for contact with the children.  I am gravely concerned by S's impeccably [by which I infer she meant "implacably"] hostile behaviour towards CAFCASS, the judiciary and the mother of his children.  It is my view that this is a genuine cause for concern about S's intentions and focus in this litigation process.</span></p>

It is also my professional view that S has not kept the children at the centre of his application to the court.  He has not been able to maintain a child-focused relationship with his children leaving them feeling let down by his lack of child-focused engagement.  It is my view that, without a psychological assessment completed in respect of S, he remains unassessed and a potential risk to the welfare and safety of his children in proceeding with direct or indirect contact at this stage.  </span></p>

I am concerned that the children feel that they are on a roller coaster at times when their father asks for the contact and then withdraws his application.  Both children continue to remain committed to the possibility of direct contact with their father.  They are extremely disappointed when their father then withdraws his application to the court.  S's emotional health continues to be of concern.  He behaves in an impulsive and accusatory way which has impacted on being able to work with him in a way that addresses the welfare issues of the children."</span></p>

I informed them that there have been long private law proceedings which have not found any resolution in a direct order for contact at this stage between S and the children.  I said that one child knew about the father's history.  He Googled it after his father left the family home.

I said that I had been concerned about S's emotional health and I had to balance this against the protection and welfare of the children.

C said that she also suggested that your wife was preventing you from securing access to your children.  Subsequently a DVD interview was undertaken.  During the investigation into these allegations, C had contact with a member of staff at CAFCASS.  A log entry was recorded of this contact on the relevant criminal investigation database.  The purpose of that contact was to attempt to establish the facts surrounding the on-going family proceedings to confirm the information you had provided to C.  C was concerned that your perspective may be skewed.  He, therefore, had an obligation to seek third party information to establish how much reliance could be placed on your account.  C believed this approach was appropriate.  During the contact with CAFCASS, C was informed that a psychiatric report was outstanding and that further contact with your children may be difficult without the court being able to make an informed risk assessment.  At the conclusion of the investigation, C submitted a report to his manager to review.  The review confirmed C's assessment that the available evidence did not pass the full code test, therefore, was not to a standard which would result in a charging decision being sought from the CPS."</span></p>

The only questions answered by SP during her conversation with C related to questions about S and that at no stage were child protection issues raised or discussed.

CAFCASS submits that C was investigating a complaint of abuse which included prevention of contact and that this was inevitably an issue of child protection given that there were children in the family.  They submit that the attendance note demonstrates that there was a child protection element to the conversation.  Given the responsibilities of the guardian to safeguard and promote the welfare of children, it was appropriate for SP to discuss her overview of the case with another professional who had been brought into the dispute by the applicant himself making a serious allegation of domestic abuse.  The sharing of information between professionals engaged in child protection is a fundamental principle of all enquiries following a serious case review.  It is submitted that SP did no more than alert the officer to her concerns.</span></p>

In view of my decision on the substantial issue in this case I do not think it necessary to consider this aspect of her submissions.  On the substance, Ms Barlow effectively adopted CAFCASS Legal's arguments whilst adding that, even if the court were not satisfied that this was a straightforward case of proper disclosure under Rule 12.73, the applicant could not prove anything approaching the requisite standard that it was a deliberate or intentional contempt of court.  Again it is unnecessary for me to consider that aspect of her submissions in view of the decision I have come to on the principal issue.  </span></p>

In my judgment, it went further than the disclosure of the general nature of the dispute and was in truth information of some details of the proceedings.  The key issue to my mind is whether SP acted in breach of the rules, i.e., whether her disclosure of information fell within what is permitted under Rule 12.73.  The phrase, "a professional acting in furtherance of the protection of children," must, in my judgment, be given a broad interpretation.  Had the words in the rule been to the effect of "in connection with an investigation into an allegation of child abuse," the disclosure permitted would have been much narrower but "in furtherance of child protection" plainly permits the disclosure of information by CAFCASS to a police officer in a conversation that arises in the course of investigation by the police including acts of domestic violence or abuse within the family.</span></p>

As she set out in her Rule 16.4 risk assessment quoted above, the guardian was concerned that S's behaviour, including his hostile behaviour towards the mother, was continuing to have an adverse effect on the children. &#160;The police's investigation into S's complaint concerning the mother's alleged abuse of him inevitably involved consideration of the historic issues between the parties and the impact on the children.  The scope of the police investigation clearly involved issues which impinged on the children's safety and welfare.  </span></p>

That is the context in which the Family Procedure Rules have to be interpreted and applied.  Too narrow an interpretation of the rules would, in my view, jeopardise the welfare of children.  It is axiomatic that the administration of justice and the protection of children requires disclosure of information between professionals to ensure that children are protected.  In this case the police were investigating allegations of abuse between adults in a family and as part of the investigation asked the CAFCASS officer for details of the background.  Part of the purpose of the conversation, in my view, was plainly the furtherance of child protection.  The dispute between the adults, the history of harassment by S leading to the restraining order and the further allegations by S against the mother plainly raised concerns of professionals about the risk of harm to the children.</span></p>

From what I have read, it seems plain that she has acted conscientiously and professionally with a proper focus of the welfare on the children caught up in this dispute.</span></p>
