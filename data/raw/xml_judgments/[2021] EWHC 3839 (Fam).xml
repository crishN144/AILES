They had not previously lived together or spent extended time together, other than relatively short periods of up to a week or so. They did not cohabit until 10 months after they were married in circumstances where X moved to a country he had not lived in before, had no established connections or support, at a time of restrictions caused by the global health pandemic and in the context where their surrogate was 7 months pregnant in another jurisdiction. This combination of challenging circumstances will have undoubtedly contributed to difficulties in the parties&#8217; relationship; the reality is they had limited resources within their relationship upon which to draw on when they encountered any difficulties.</p>

W accepted he was someone who placed great store on routine and order, this was not only in relation to Z but also in relation to the home and his possessions. X came from a different viewpoint, he did not have such attachment to possessions and accepted he challenged W about his viewpoint on such matters. It is also right to consider the language used by both parties which they accept maybe regarded as unusual in other contexts but in the community they were part of were commonly accepted terms. The issues I have to consider in this case is whilst it may be right there may be a context in which they are used; on occasion they may be as a term of endearment whereas in other situations they could be regarded as abusive or aggressive.</p>

The context appears to be that Z had been prescribed steroid cream for his eczema by his GP, X had concerns about using this cream on children under 12 months and wished to find out more about it. He thought they had agreed that it would not be used until he had done that. He found the cream in a cupboard and this caused an argument between W and X, when X demanded the police should be called, they should divorce and (according to W) threatened to kill W if he used it again. W further alleges X hit, punched and slapped his legs as part of this incident, which X denies, According to W this argument resulted in X squeezing the contents of the tube into the bin. W said Z still continued to show signs of eczema and the GP prescribed more steroid cream. X accepted in his oral evidence he over-reacted, there was an argument and he was not really going to call the police and it was a question of trust.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In early April 2021 X alleges that W threatened to revoke his visa and take Z away. It was in that context he sought the advice of the police. W says the evidence now demonstrates that X was taking his own steps, for example by contacting the police, and then when he left the home without giving a forwarding address W had no choice but to apply to the court.</p>

Finally, X denies any suggestion by W that he has sought to distance Z from him or W from his family. In his written and oral evidence he described how he felt guilty he had had the first two months with Z and when they came back here he encouraged W to spend time with Z.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On any view it is clear that the nature of the relationship the parties had was insufficiently secure to withstand the many pressure it had to endure, some of which were self-imposed (the decision to get married and have children before their relationship was really established and so soon after they had started living together) and others they had no control over (Covid pandemic and resulting restrictions). In reality they didn&#8217;t know each other very well, they had barely spent much time with each other and had had limited opportunity to establish their relationship on any kind of secure foundation and build emotional and other resources they could draw on. The difficulties in their relationship very soon surfaced and quickly their relationship became toxic with frequent arguments, repeated demands being made, particularly by X as demonstrated in the text exchanges. Most if not all of these arguments after November 2020 would have been in Z&#8217;s presence.</p>

He was demanding and unreasonable, could only view things from his perspective and quickly escalated matters out of all proportion which lead to many arguments between the parties. The exchanges relating to the bleach, the speaker and the evidence about the steroid cream are but three examples. In his oral evidence X at times accepted such behaviours and reactions were out of proportion, but it was difficult to gauge how deep that reflection really went. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst it is right W sought to diffuse tension by apologising or suggesting solutions to ever increasing demands I have to consider whether that masked what X describes was the reality of W&#8217;s behaviour when he lost control, in my judgment it doesn&#8217;t. However W must bear responsibility for the situation the parties had got themselves into. Both W and X were being driven by their own different needs, rather than a genuine wish to be together and have a family. Their decision to marry, for X to move here and have children lacked any real depth of understanding of the implications and long term consequences of such important decisions. According to W it was presented as a fait accompli by X during the trip to Italy although he had the choice whether to accept it. There was resistance to W&#8217;s request for more time and they were both involved in the surrogacy arrangement taking place.</p>

	  <num>106.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to the allegations made by W against X I find them all established to the required standard save for X smacking Z hard on the bottom in allegation 1, and physical assault in allegations 2 and 4. I do not find those parts of the allegations proved as there is no corroborative evidence of the physical assaults, W did not report the alleged assault on Z to anyone else and the alleged assaults on him are more likely to be as X described, as part of their argument rather than deliberate assaults. The language used and the way the parties expressed themselves is entirely consistent with the balance of the allegations made by W. In my judgment there were frequent arguments between the parties in the way summarised by W in the findings he seeks, often in the presence of Z and the language used in the context described was not as terms of endearment they were part of the fractured, volatile and increasingly toxic nature of the relationship between the parties. The arguments quickly escalated, as can be seen in the text exchanges and whilst X may have been the more vocal of the two it is more likely than not that W contributed or behaved in a way that would, as W described in his evidence, make X go nuclear. In the same way as W considered X exploited his insecurities it is more likely than not W would know that certain reactions, responses or behaviours by him would escalate the situation. X could at times become very demanding and would often take a position which did not stand up to scrutiny, such the incident with the plate or W spending too long washing Z or looking at Z for too long which quickly became a threat by him to shame W on social media. X also behaved irrationally and impulsively as was evidenced by his behaviour at the hospital in May 2021. Whilst making all due allowance for the difficult position the parties were in bearing in mind Z and X&#8217;s ill health I consider it more likely than not that X did say he would withdraw the allegations because he feared W was trying to take Z away from him and the discussions around the basis upon which X could return to the flat is not inconsistent with the way X has treated the allegations made by him against W and tie in with the findings I have made below. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to the allegations made by X against W, I do not find the allegations made in relation to the three incidents of physical abuse in August 2020 and the one in early March 2021 are established to the required standard. This is for a number of reasons. Whilst fully recognising how difficult it can be for those who allege domestic abuse to reveal the full extent of what has taken place, in this case X&#8217;s position does not stand up to scrutiny. On one view of his evidence he had serious fears for Z&#8217;s safety in W&#8217;s care as a result of these allegations; he said it kept him awake at night. However, he did not mention the incident to the doctor he sought advice from days after the first assault and accepted that prevented the doctor being able to treat him in the way X sought. X did not provide any details how he had informed his friends about these assaults at the time they took place, although he said he had told them. He makes no mention or reference to these assaults in the vocal and at times aggressive texts around the time of the alleged assaults. The texts display no apparent difficulty in X expressing himself in very forthright terms. He did not mention them to the police in early April or in his first two statements so the court was making welfare decisions ignorant of, on X&#8217;s case, these important welfare considerations. In the context of the texts messages it is accepted the references to choking in early August relates to the bleach incident and on 31 August I am satisfied having considered the evidence as a whole the reference to choking is in the context described by W, when he made a choking gesture in the context of their discussions when out for a walk in late August about X&#8217;s friend coming to stay. In addition, X said he was keen for W to come with him to Georgia in early September 2020 and when in Georgia did not consider any alternative options other than to return here. In addition X placed great stress on how he sought following the return from Georgia to encourage W to spend as much time as possible caring for Z. None of those actions are consistent with the account W now gives of the events in August of the alleged assaults and his fears for Z as a result. The same applies to the incident in late December I do not find that is established to the required standard, there is no corroboration and whilst X did refer to it in his first statement there is a lack of detail or other reference to it. As regards the allegation relating to mid February 2021 there was an argument that day which I have already found is likely to have taken place, it is more likely than not that Z would have been caught up in the argument and it is likely that W would have tried to forcibly remove Z from X as part of that incident. The allegation relating to early March 2021 I do not find established to the required standard, again there was a delay in raising it, it lacks detail or any corroboration. I accept the account given by W for sending the text with the song title as that is consistent with the parties&#8217; relationship at that time and do not consider it supports the allegation made by X of the alleged assault the previous day. Turning to the final allegation made by X that W threatened to take Z away from him and revoke his visa I do find this allegation established. This was in the context of the final stages of the breakdown of the relationship when there was uncertainty about where X and Z were going and W feared they were going to go abroad. This was around the same time as X was making threats to expose W on social media and accusing him of child abuse. X accepts he told W to remove the photos of Z from his phone.  This is but one example of X seeking to distance W from Z.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having looked at the evidence as a whole I consider due to the complexity of their relationship and the dynamics at play there was probably some coercive and controlling behaviour by both W and X in relation to each other. W failed to fully appreciate the impact on X of the move here and the effect on him of the delays in being able to secure his own independence through being able to open his own bank account and have financial independence, secure work and build up his own social and support networks. The effect of those delays meant X arguably became more reliant on W and felt isolated as a result. X for his part was demanding and uncompromising in his behaviour and attitude from the start with the frequent use of threats and demands to seek what he wanted. He exploited W&#8217;s sensitivities through his repeated abuse about their different position and attitudes in a way that undermined W. Having considered the evidence it was inevitable that the relationship between the parties would break down. </p>

X&#8217;s current accommodation runs out in early October, although evidence is awaited to confirm this position. The welfare hearing is in mid November. It is clear arrangements will need to be found to provide for X and Z&#8217;s accommodation. X seeks an order that will enable him and Z to live in the property currently occupied by W on the basis that it will provide some security and stability for Z until the court is in a position to make final welfare orders. W does not agree to that, he states he also has time with Z and that if he sought other accommodation it would be a further change for Z.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, whilst on the information the court has there may be strong arguments for X and Z returning to the property in London I have reached the conclusion on the information the court has, bearing in mind the background to this case in terms of the level of mistrust between the parties, such a course is not without its difficulties. I do not accept that X moving back there will provide additional security and stability for Z as he has since April only seen W there. On X&#8217;s proposals whilst Z would have the benefit of being in accommodation he is familiar with he would start to see W in different accommodation which would be another change for him, as well as being with X in accommodation he is used to seeing W in. In my judgment a solution needs to be found to either extend where X currently lives or, if that is not possible, for suitable alternative accommodation to be secured for X and Z for a period of at least 3 months, if not longer. This would cover the period when the court will be making a decision about the long term welfare needs of Z. Practical arrangements should be made for X&#8217;s possessions to go to that accommodation. The parties should seek to reach agreement on the location and financing of such accommodation. In his written submissions W outlines the financial assistance he can provide and if necessary that may need to be increased, as he has the more secure financial resources. The critical need from Z&#8217;s welfare perspective is for the parties to work together to agree practical arrangements that can be put in place sooner rather than later to ensure minimal disruption for Z.</p>

The way the parties have behaved in the past is very likely to have affected Z, he will have witnessed many difficult and vocal arguments between the parties as well as the uncertainty and instability through the changed arrangements relating to his care. </p>
