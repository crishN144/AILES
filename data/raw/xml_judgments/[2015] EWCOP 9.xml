The reason the sale took so long was because he has lived on his own since my mother died in 2001. My father was a very heavy smoker, and he was a serious compulsive hoarder. It was very hard to get the house maintained because he did not like people coming in. My father also really could not manage himself or the house on his own and in hindsight I think he should have gone into sheltered accommodation earlier. Thus the house fell into serious disrepair, was very dirty and most rooms were unenterable due to hoarding clutter. After that the house stood empty for many years and there was no money to renovate it.</span></p>

There was not even any water or heating. I dropped the price of the house more and more and eventually sold it, only to be told it was too cheap, and I could be in trouble for not securing the best deal for my father. So I did more work to it and sold it again.  </span></p>

I have never taken this money back because he needed it more than I do and I presumed would be returned to me in his will. On the subject of his will, I was asked to supply a copy of, to the best of my knowledge there doesn&#8217;t appear to be a proper one. I did find various hand written notes, but the only wills were for my grandparents. I did write and tell Brenda Bond. I also wrote and said that at the time I did not think he had a pension. My father worked mostly abroad as a diplomat, so did not pay tax in the UK, and I know he did not have a private pension. Since then, I have discovered a small pension with a company called JMR, which no longer exists, although I am now in touch with the company which took them over.</span></p>

Due to this, AW has always looked after my father&#8217;s immediate needs, such as pocket money, cigarettes and toiletries. I still don&#8217;t know why, but she suddenly stopped doing this &#8211; without telling me &#8211; and I was not aware that he had run out of pocket money. As soon as I was aware, I took &#163;200 of my money and bought him new toiletries and a whole new wardrobe of clothes. Like the last time he moved, I cleaned, decorated and fully furnished his new flat and financed it myself. I was hoping to finance some work by selling some items which my grandfather had left. This was until I discovered my father had given nearly everything of value to charity shops, including my grandfather&#8217;s antique gold Rolex!</span></p>

Unfortunately, six weeks later my envelope I sent to Brenda was returned by Royal Mail because it was damaged and the address was not legible. I did not even open it. I put the old pack with the damaged envelope into a new one and posted it again. I did this to prove it was Royal Mail&#8217;s fault and not me being tardy.

The donor is suffering from advanced Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. He is unable to respond meaningfully to any specific questions save sometimes to questions relating to specific day to day needs. When basic questions about his well-being were put, responses included the comments &#8220;You used to be so good&#8221; and &#8220;Things are climbing the walls&#8221;. There was no sign of any understanding when he was asked whether he knew who was managing his affairs. He was unable to discuss meaningfully or at all what an LPA was.&#8221;</p>

He was very confused and could not tell me about his son, either his name, whether he visited him, or whether he dealt with his finances.&#8221;</p>
