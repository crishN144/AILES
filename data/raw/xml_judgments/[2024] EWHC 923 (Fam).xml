The M was released from prison the day before the hearing and was apparently street homeless that night having not attended her probation appointment on time. Her counsel, Ms Thurlby, said she had taken very brief instructions and the M&#8217;s position was clear, but she did not feel able to participate in the hearing. Given the nature of the issues, and the urgency of the matter from A&#8217;s perspective, all parties agreed that it was appropriate for the hearing to continue. </p>

M applied to HMP Peterborough for a place in the Mother and Baby Unit but this was assessed as unsafe for A and the application was refused by the Prison Governor. In the period the proceedings have been ongoing the M has twice been in prison. She was released the day before the hearing on 3 April 2024. </p>

CFAB were concerned about putting the referral through further without a response because this could lead to Leicester City Council being charged a cancellation fee if the Swiss Local Authority continue not to reply or say they cannot complete the assessment. They also confirmed that it is not possible for an Independent Social Worker (&#8220;ISW&#8221;) to go to Switzerland and that the assessment has to be completed by the public services in Switzerland, whom are unfortunately not responding to the requests.  </p>

This will take 6-9 months, and it is not clear when it would commence because it is still not clear whether the matter would be treated as an emergency. A UK social worker cannot carry out the assessment. Although the Aunt is prepared to come to the UK for a short period, such a UK based assessment, even if it was adequate, which it would not be, would not meet the requirements of the Swiss authorities. The LA would not be able to complete anything akin to a proper assessment during this limited window. The Aunt would be able to meet with A but there would be no time for A to be able to form a relationship with, or any attachment to, the Aunt and for this to be assessed.  In addition, there would be no assessment of the Aunt&#8217;s home environment, local amenities, support network in Switzerland, the dynamic between the Aunt and her children in the household alongside the impact of any other demands upon the Aunt. Police and medical checks would also remain outstanding. </p>

Since the phrase was first coined some years ago, judges now routinely make reference to the &#8216;draconian&#8217; nature of permanent separation of parent and child and they frequently do so in the context of reference to &#8216;proportionality&#8217;. Such descriptions are, of course, appropriate and correct, but there is a danger that these phrases may inadvertently become little more than formulaic judicial window-dressing if they are not backed up with a substantive consideration of what lies behind them and the impact of that on the individual child&#8217;s welfare in the particular case before the court. If there was any doubt about the importance of avoiding that danger, such doubt has been firmly swept away by the very clear emphasis in Re B on the duty of the court actively to evaluate proportionality in every case.&#8221;</span></p>

British society is now multicultural. Assessing parents and family members may, quite frequently does, involve considering individuals based anywhere in the world. I do not believe that the obligation to explore the family option for a child is weakened in any way by geography, although it can provide real challenges to already overstretched resources. The viability of these options must, from the outset, be evaluated rigorously and reviewed regularly. The need for such assessments must be addressed at the very beginning of proceedings. Late identification of potential family carers abroad may bring two fundamental principles of the Children Act into conflict, namely the desirability, if possible, of a child being brought up in its extended family (where parents are for some reason unable to care for the child themselves) and the need to avoid delay in planning for a child's future. Neither principle should be regarded as having greater weight. The recent reforms to the family justice system have sought to emphasise why it was that the avoidance of delay was given statutory force by the Children Act and the real and lasting harm delay causes to children, particularly in public law care proceedings. There will, in my judgement, be occasions when the obstacles to assessment of family members abroad create such delays that to pursue the option will be inconsistent with the child's own timescales. These are taxing and exacting decisions but they require to be confronted with integrity and without sentimentality.&#8221;</span></p>

The extracts from the reports of both of these witnesses indicate that they determined their recommendation for A on just that basis. Mrs Fairbairn repeatedly described the child as having a &#8220;right&#8221; to be brought up by the natural family where there is a viable placement available. The Guardian advised that adoption is not in A&#8217;s best interests because the grandparents can provide her with a home. Putting the correct position in lay terms, the existence of a viable home with the grandparents should make that option &#8220;a runner&#8221; but should not automatically make it &#8220;a winner&#8221; in the absence of full consideration of any other factor that is relevant to her welfare; the error of the ISW and the Guardian appears to have been to hold that &#8220;if a family placement is a &#8216;runner&#8217;, then it has to be regarded as a &#8216;winner'&#8221;.</span></p>

The situation in public law proceedings, where the State, via a local authority, seeks to intervene in the life of a child by obtaining a care order and a placement for adoption order against the consent of a parent is entirely different [from private law proceedings], but also in this context there is no authority to the effect that there is a &#8216;presumption&#8217; in favour of a natural parent or family member. As in the private law context, at the stage when a court is considering what, if any, order to make the only principle is that set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1</ref> and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1</ref> requiring paramount consideration to be afforded to the welfare of the child throughout his lifetime.

She does not know of their existence. They have no relationship whatsoever. Their son, A&#8217;s father, has never had parental responsibility for A.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is a difficult decision to make because if I discharge the assessment of the Aunt, then there will be no potential for A to be placed with a family member. This may well mean that A is ultimately placed in a placement that is not just a non-family placement, but also one that is less culturally appropriate for him. It will be not easy to find a long term placement, whether adoptive or long term foster care, in a Somali family. As Ms Thurlby points out, the decision will have life long consequences for the child. Equally it will be necessary when he is older to explain to A why he was not brought up by his family, even though his Aunt wanted to care for him. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, it is inevitable that if the Aunt is to be assessed this will involve at least 9 months of further delay in this young child&#8217;s life. As Ms Watkins submits, it is likely that an Issues Resolution Hearing could not take place until at least January 2025 and it might well not be possible for A to move to the care of the Aunt, assuming she is ultimately positively assessed, for 12 months. This is a very long time in the life of a young child and would make his bonding process with a new family significantly more difficult. There are a large number of hurdles to be gone through, the outcome of which is at this stage unknown. Therefore there is a real possibility that a final decision could be delayed for many months whilst the Aunt is assessed, but he cannot ultimately be placed with the Aunt. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have reached the conclusion that it is not in the best interests of the child to continue the quest for the assessment of the Aunt, despite all the disbenefits that flow. It is in his best interests that this case proceeds as speedily as possible to the making of final orders so that a permanent placement can be found for A. </p>

However, in my view this does not change the position because the referral has already been received by the canton, and they have indicated the timescales which I have dealt with above. </p>
