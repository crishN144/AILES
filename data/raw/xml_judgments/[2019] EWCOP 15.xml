Not being considered by the Bar Council as &#8216;a legal service&#8217;, discharge of the functions of deputyship is apparently not subject to the Bar Council&#8217;s full regulatory force. However, the risk of property and affairs deputyship lies chiefly in misappropriation of funds.

The failure to comply with the direction is itself not a matter of insignificance. I infer from the failure to confirm otherwise, that Ms. Sood accepts that professional insurance is an &#8216;overhead&#8217; cost, rather than an expense of deputyship. If payable from MBR&#8217;s funds, these costs would be a significant extra burden; as an overhead, it will clearly impact on the net professional fees of deputyship. Given that this would appear to be the only matter in which Ms. Sood presently seeks deputyship appointment, it may be that the anticipated size of the overhead makes the prospect of appointment less attractive. </p>

Given that NKR accepts that both of the available candidates for appointment can offer the cultural understanding and language which she identifies as important, and both have already met the family, in my judgment the current deputy&#8217;s concerns weigh more heavily in the balance than NKR&#8217;s preference for one candidate over the other.   </p>
