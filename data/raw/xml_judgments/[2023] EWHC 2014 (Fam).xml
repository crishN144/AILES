	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.61in;margin-right:0.12in">The first is the lack of constructive engagement between the parties in these proceedings to assist the court to determine these issues. Part 1 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 places an obligation on the parties to help the court further the overriding objective to deal with cases expeditiously and fairly. There has been limited, if any, evidence of that in this case. A recent example illustrates the point. A very clear direction was made for the parties to file a composite schedule of the chattels in advance of the hearing. That was not done until the first morning of the hearing and then only after considerable intervention by the court.</p>

The culture of conflict rather than solution in these proceedings has been thoroughly unhelpful. It has resulted in the court having to intervene in situations where a solution was obvious or readily achievable, without needing recourse to the court. It is of note that it was only at the direction of the court was a total costs picture given, with both parties then expressing their concern and shock about their high level.</p>

At that stage the wife was not aware of that relationship, only becoming aware of it via the children in November 2020, the day before the husband made a without notice application to prevent the children from returning to Country A. When he came to the UK the husband rented a property for LM in London and then in March 2021 purchased a London property on &#8216;X Street&#8217; for &#163;5.77m and LM moved there with him.

There are two, inter-related, duties of the court before making an order under Part III. The first is to consider whether England and Wales is the appropriate venue for the application: section 16(1). The second is to consider whether an order should be made under section 17 having regard to the matters in section 18. There are two reasons why the duties are inter-related. First, neither section 16(2) nor section 18(2) and (3) refers to an exhaustive list of matters to be taken into account. Section 16(1) directs the court to have regard to "all the circumstances of the case" and section 16(2) refers the court to certain matters "in particular." Second, some of the matters to be considered under section 16 may be relevant under section 18, and vice versa. An obvious example would be that section 16(2)(e) refers the court to the financial provision which has been made by the foreign court. Plainly that would be relevant under section 18. So also the direction in section 18(6) to the court, in considering the financial resources of a party,</span></p>

There is no condition of exceptionality for the purposes of section 16, but it will not usually be a case for an order under Part III where the wife had a right to apply for financial relief under the foreign law, and an award was made in the foreign country. In such cases mere disparity between that award and what would be awarded on an English divorce will certainly be insufficient to trigger the application of Part III. Nor is hardship or injustice (much less serious injustice) a condition of the exercise of the jurisdiction, but if either factor is present, it may make it appropriate, in the light of all the circumstances, for an order to be made, and may affect the nature of the provision ordered. Of course, the court will not lightly characterise foreign law, or the order of a foreign court, as unjust.</span></p>

The following general principles should be applied. First, primary consideration must be given to the welfare of any children of the marriage. This can cut both ways as the children may be being supported by the foreign spouse. Second, it will never be appropriate to make an order which gives the claimant more than she or he would have been awarded had all proceedings taken place within this jurisdiction. Third, where possible the order should have the result that provision is made for the reasonable needs of each spouse. Subject to these principles, the court has a broad discretion. The reasons why it was appropriate for an order to be made in England are among the circumstances to be taken into account in deciding what order should be made. Where the English connections of the case are very strong there may be no reason why the application should not be treated as if it were made in purely English proceedings. The full procedure for granting ancillary relief after an English divorce does not apply in Part III cases. The conditions which can be attached to leave, together with the court's case management powers, can be used to define the issues and to limit the evidence to be filed, as was done by Munby J in this case. This enables the jurisdiction to be tailored to the needs of the individual case, so that the grant of leave does not inevitably trigger a full blown claim for all forms of ancillary relief.</span></p>

In addition, both parties have referred to their written evidence in the children proceedings. The wife gave oral evidence over two days. She clearly finds this contested litigation very distressing,  and has had to manage many changes recently. The wife is not financially astute as the husband clearly is. Whilst I may not be able to accept some of her evidence on certain matters, generally her evidence was credible. Her role during this marriage was clear, it was primarily as a homemaker and mother. That was ultimately accepted by the husband during the children proceedings. The stability she has been able to provide, in particular during recent years when the husband was absent for significant periods of time as he was often travelling abroad relating to the family business or to receive medical treatment due to ill health, has been of particular benefit for the children and the family as a whole. Her role in continuing to be able to provide that stability and security remains an important consideration, will continue for many years to come and requires proper and effective support. The husband considers the wife has exaggerated her financial claims, which in places she has, and he says they need to be viewed within the context of the more limited jurisdiction regarding Part III claims.</p>

His period in the family business, by all accounts, was a very successful period, both for him and the business. Since then he has been involved in managing his exit from the family business while looking at using his considerable expertise in realising his earning capacity, as explained in the magazine interview with him, which is found in the trial bundle. The husband&#8217;s evidence on some issues was less than satisfactory, in particular his wholly inadequate management and oversight of the movement of the family possessions from the family home in Country A, his inconsistent accounts of the purpose of the companies he is still involved in and his explanation regarding the insurance schedules produced by PGF.

The PGF has been successful in his claim to ownership of this land, the husband says there are no further appeals and in his closing submissions says the Area S land has been sold to a third party. Second, the PGF claims to be the owner of the beach chalet which the husband also transferred to the two younger children in 2019.

Whilst she recognises she is the legal owner of the shares, as confirmed in the evidence from Ian Edge, her evidence was that it would not be possible for her to sell them due to the nature of her relationship with her father.

The wife&#8217;s evidence is that she knows little about its existence and only became aware of more details recently when her father communicated with her about her tax status here, following her move to London in August 2020. In her Form E she states &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">On 30 September 2008 my father settled a discretionary trust, the P Trust. I am not a beneficiary of the P Trust.

The husband submits that in the absence of information being provided about it, which would have been done if it had limited value, the court can infer that with the existence of professional trustees, solicitors and concern about the wife&#8217;s tax status it is an unquantified but substantial resource, taking into account what is known about the wife&#8217;s family. In part I agree that inference can be made in the light of what is known about the Trust and the maternal family, however it is limited by the fact that there is no certainty the wife will be added as a beneficiary and there is no tangible information regarding the value of the trust funds.</p>

That proposition under Sharia law is not really disputed by the husband.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.61in">The husband&#8217;s vagueness in relation to the PGF schedules needs to be contrasted with the prompt steps he took regarding the removal of artwork from Country A to Switzerland in late 2020 and his ability to produce details of watches that had been sold (including producing a detailed list during the court hearing on 17 January 2023). This supports the husband&#8217;s keen eye, personal knowledge and interest in the location, ownership, movement, storage and sale of these various valuable chattels. The fact that valuable chattels make up such a large part of the asset schedule provides an insight into the knowledge and expertise the husband has in relation to such matters.</p>

The husband&#8217;s evidence on this issue has not been consistent or reliable. His oral evidence about these matters has to be seen in the light of the emails in 2018 and 2019 which demonstrate a detailed knowledge by him, or those who worked for him, of the items on the insurance list that were owned by him. His suggestion in his oral evidence that there was a fluidity about ownership of items was an attempt by him to distance himself from this list and any additional items that may be attributable to him. Whilst it is right that some of the items on the list have been sold by the husband, so there is some support for his point about the lack of reliability of the list, that does not fully account for the balance of the items on the list that have been part of an established insurance process that has taken place over a number of years. I have considered whether this list was produced as part of the ongoing conflict between the husband and PGF with a view to undermining the husband but consider that unlikely in the light of the wider circumstances of the case and the husband&#8217;s evidence about the emails and the prior existence of the insurance schedule.</p>

In the figures Mr AS gave for the land costs per square metre, they are averages and there is variation depending on the location of the plot within each area. The wife could choose to live in the D district area, which is less expensive. The building costs are based on a build area of 1,650 sqm, whereas the evidence demonstrated that it would be possible to build up to 2,250 sqm on a 750 sqm plot. The figures given in the SJE report are valid until July 2023 when there may be inflationary increase, or a decrease. The indications from the evidence are that there is likely to be an increase due to the level of demand, which seems to remain strong in particular areas. As Mr AS said <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;all prime locations, prime areas would probably hold up for their prices even if there is an economic or political downturn&#8217;</span>.

I do not regard those adjustments as reasonable in the circumstances of this case for the following reasons. The evidence from Mr AS is that these areas are prime locations and the wife needs to be in a position to have some flexibility regarding price. Whilst there may be some contents from the previous family home that can be used in the circumstances of this case, the lack of clarity about the condition of the contents and the background to this case means the amount provided for furniture etc should be included. I am also satisfied the contingency fund and maintenance sum should be included. This will help to reduce the risk of delay in the project being completed and properly provide a fund for any delays or other unforeseen consequences with the contractors as outlined by Mr AS.</p>

Since then he has reduced the proposed figure. During this hearing the husband produced details of fourteen rented properties that he said he had provided in September 2022. According to the wife, none of the properties produced are in the two areas the wife wishes to live; three are in adjacent boroughs, one is not in the city, many do not have sufficient bedrooms on the basis that there should be at least one bedroom for the wife and each of the children with one guest room. That leaves three properties that would be suitable, albeit smaller than the wife wished and in less desirable areas at a rental cost of between a sum equivalent to &#163;10,725-&#163;13,407 GBP pcm and are unfurnished.</p>

The husband contends for a shorter timeframe of 21 months based on Mr AS&#8217;s answers to Mr Southgate but that gave no room for any delays inherent in any stage regarding such a project, which Mr AS recognised happened in most cases. In the circumstances of this case, I am satisfied the wife and children should not bear the risk of the likelihood of such delays and I consider a period of 30 months overall is the correct timeframe, based on 9 months for the purchase and design and 20- 22 months to complete the remainder of the project.</p>

I accept the wife&#8217;s evidence that it would be a good location going forward for the family to meet and it is a place that she has found supportive during her marriage breakdown. That needs to be viewed in the context of the way the paternal family have operated in the past and the risk in the future as outlined in the judgments in June and July 2022.</p>

For illustration, he has demonstrated what the figures would be if there was a 33% step down at the end of the youngest children&#8217;s tertiary education and the year after the wife turns 75 years. The husband also relies upon the various future resources that will be available to the wife in due course including the ABC shares, her one third share in her mother&#8217;s ABC shares and her parents&#8217; property in Country A and London (the wife does not accept she has any share in her parents&#8217; property in London or her mother&#8217;s ABC shares).

There was some change in that position after the husband left the family business, but it still remained high. The email and budget exchanges in July 2020 were looking at a continuing annual budget in the region of &#163;2m. In his oral evidence the husband stressed the importance of the steps that were being taken to reduce the budget in July 2020 due to their changed circumstances, but that was not reflected in his own expenditure in Switzerland, where he was renting a property at EUR 8,000 pm, and the rental property in London for the family which was &#163;40,000 pm.</p>

Her entitlement to the ABC shares is secure and known. However, the balance of the future resources are not guaranteed in amount. It is not known what, if any, resources will need to be realised by the wife&#8217;s parents to meet any financial or care needs they may have. Whilst I do not wholly accept the way the husband puts his case, I do consider it reasonable in the circumstances of this case that there is some allowance for a property trade down in the context of the housing allowance made for the wife which could release capital, the wider financial resources she may become entitled to over and above her entitlement to the ABC shares and the stepping down of her expenses in a similar way as in <span style="font-style:italic">Juffali</span>.</p>

In his oral evidence the husband said his intention on the sale of the property on X Street is he planned to move to the larger property on Z Street; (viii) the paternal grandmother is based here, sees the children regularly although the husband suggests she may return to live in Country A; (ix) it is of note that the husband required the wife and children to come to the UK when he sought to protect them.</p>

The family were largely based there for most of their marriage and had the husband not become estranged from the PGF and the marriage remained in place it is likely they would have remained based there. However, that is not the position now. In the light of the events over the last few years I accept the wife&#8217;s evidence that whilst she will (subject to the various pre-conditions being fulfilled) return to Country A with the children but she has put down some roots here and is likely to spend significant periods of time here in the way she has described. The situation within the paternal family remains fluid</p>

That stability is part of the wife&#8217;s needs and will undoubtedly be of benefit for the children.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.61in;margin-right:0.12in">This was a long marriage where there has been no issue about the contribution the wife made as mother and homemaker. That is particularly so in the circumstances of this case. First, in recognition of the dynastic nature of the paternal family and the need for a male heir she underwent a number of procedures to ensure that was achieved. Second, the husband accepts that for a part of their marriage he was away for significant periods of time due to the demands of the family business and his own health and related personal issues. In his oral evidence in the children proceedings he volunteered he was away for about 75% of the time, correcting it to 50% the following day. There is no suggestion that the wife has been other than fully available to support the children and her husband, including, for example, actively engaging in ways to help reduce their outgoings in July 2020. The stability the wife has provided for the children has greatly benefitted them and that is likely to continue for the rest of their minority, and probably beyond. It is in their interests that the wife has the financial support and autonomy to continue to provide that stability.</p>

What he has done does not appear to be unusual and to his credit in his oral evidence the husband did not seek to criticise or challenge that, accepting that the wife would follow her father&#8217;s wishes regarding those arrangements. In relation to the wife there is less clarity about the extent to which the assets in which she has a contingent interest may need to be utilised by her parents prior to their death.

The husband remains the eldest son, it appears likely the PGF has retained control of a significant number, if not all, of his assets which are considerable.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.61in;margin-right:0.12in">The standard of living during the marriage was very high. The level of expenditure illustrates that. Even when the husband was seeking to reduce expenditure with the assistance of the wife and her sister the annual expenses still remained high. There was limited, if any, demonstrable change by the husband when looking at the level of rent he paid in Switzerland, the rental of a property for LM in London, the level of rent for the first property for the wife in London. Having said that, other expenditure, such as for the yacht or the funding of other building projects, had clearly changed. The court recognises that the wife&#8217;s future needs need to reflect the changed situation, the separation of the parties and the likelihood of changes at appropriate points over the life of any Duxbury fund to reflect reduced expenses and/or other resources becoming available for adequate provision for her reasonable needs. Those changes are likely to be when the youngest children have completed tertiary education and at the age of about 75 years, along the lines outlined by Roberts J in <span style="font-style:italic">Juffali </span>[161]<span style="font-style:italic">.</span></p>

The eldest is the male heir to the family business and is going to need to be supported in how to manage and navigate the difficult and fractious paternal family relationships. The burden of that is likely to fall mainly on the wife who has demonstrated a consummate skill in not being drawn into the heat of the conflicts within the paternal family. Both parents have had to manage the recent ill health of the younger daughter and are likely to need to provide her with the support she will require in the future.</p>
