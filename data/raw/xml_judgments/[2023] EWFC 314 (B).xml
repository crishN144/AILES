Joe is over 1 year old.  The Local&#160;Authority that brings the application is London&#160;Borough&#160;of&#160;Haringey, represented by Ms&#160;Brown.  </span></p>

She is a social worker who now works for Luton Social Services, but she had been a senior social worker at Jamma&#160;Umoja and had case responsibility for the family.  Jamma&#160;Umoja provided two reports relating to the assessment of the mother&#8217;s care of Joe at that unit: an interim report of 25&#160;October&#160;2021 and a final assessment on 23&#160;November&#160;2021. </span></p>

Ms&#160;Tomkinson explained that she worked for Jamma&#160;Umoja for some two years and had assessed a number of families, but it was in her experience extremely rare at the end of a 12-week assessment period to know very little about a parent.  However, that had been her experience of the mother.  She formed the view that the mother had not shown any evidence of change or any increase of insight during her time at the unit.</span></p>

However, overall, the assessment was negative and Jamma&#160;Umoja raised concerns about the mother&#8217;s behaviour, her presentation, and her ability to safeguard Joe whilst in the community as well as on the unit.  It was Jamma&#160;Umoja&#8217;s view that the mother had not fully engaged with the assessment.  </span></p>

It was the mother&#8217;s view that she was being victimised.  Jamma&#160;Umoja also reported a concerning incident that whilst being accompanied by a staff member to take Joe to a play group away from the unit, the mother had crossed the road in inappropriate places and walked into the road causing cars to stop sharply on two occasions, with Joe accompanying her.  Ms&#160;Tomkinson did not see this incident herself but reported on what she was told by colleagues, but it is disputed by the mother who asserts she did nothing dangerous with Joe.  </span></p>

He said that the mother had shown at times that she is capable but that does not mean that she can do it all of the time.  He was clear that he was not saying that she is or has been devoid of regulation, but the problem is that it remains limited.  </span></p>

He gave me the example of the mother&#8217;s use of cannabis, saying that the mother is believed to continue to be using cannabis despite having explained her insight that she was using cannabis as a form of self-medication; he said that it was one thing to say it, but it is another to be able actually to demonstrate it.  </span></p>

He also assessed the mother.  His opinion was that there are likely features of paranoia or persecutory illness.  His view was that it was reasonably likely that the mother has a paranoid illness.  He also recorded in relation to her toxicology results that they are positive for cannabis and cocaine for the tested period of February&#160;2020 to August&#160;2021, and that these are inconsistent with the mother&#8217;s claims to have not used cannabis after the third month of pregnancy and to have not used cocaine since Christmas&#160;2020.  </span></p>

However, he identified that the mother denies having any mental ill health which could be problematic in terms of her engagement with treatment.  He told me that the risk of drug misuse and of exacerbating psychosis because of that misuse remains.  He said that the mother&#8217;s account of being laughed at by the GP when she sought a trial of antipsychotic medication did not sound plausible.  </span></p>

In this case, there have been a variety of different laboratories undertaking hair strand testing analysis.  What this means is a deterioration of the quality of the evidence overall, because making direct comparisons between different laboratory results is not feasible: they use different techniques, in some cases they treat hair differently.  For example, DNA&#160;Legal combs out dreadlocked hair, whereas the other laboratories appear simply to test a section of matted hair.  DNA&#160;Legal tests the washes relating to the hair sample as well as the hair itself which the other companies used in this case do not do.  However, it does mean when looking at the testing results, it is not possible to put the results from different companies alongside each other and make a direct comparison to see how change has occurred over time as the variations in testing can bring about differences.  Although, I do recognise that despite these limitations, it is still feasible for the court to discern trends particularly where the differences are marked.  </span></p>

That recent assessment indicates that the London Borough of Enfield has no concerns for Kate.

In Kate&#8217;s case, she moved into her father&#8217;s care due to her mother&#8217;s mental health problems.  Subsequently, however, she has been able to maintain regular contact with her mother, including regular stays, and she has the benefit of an older half-sibling in that household.  </span></p>

It appears to have been a casual relationship with a mismatch of expectations as to what each of the parents hoped from it.  If Joe is in the father&#8217;s care, he is going to need contact with his mother.  The mother&#8217;s mental health, her learning needs and substance misuse, combined with previous relationship issues between the parents may lead to disagreements and conflict.  There is also a risk that the father may be insufficiently protective, and simply make Joe available to spend time with his mother without proper measures being put in place to ensure his wellbeing.  </span></p>

They were concerned that the age of Joe renders him more vulnerable than Kate, who moved into her father&#8217;s sole care when she was either five or six years old; accounts vary.  I accept that Joe is much more vulnerable than Kate, who is able to express what is going on at home and is able to do many tasks for herself.  </span></p>

If Joe were to be adopted and later was made aware of the sort of childhood that Kate had experienced in her father&#8217;s care, I cannot help but think that Joe will struggle to understand why it was felt necessary to keep him away from her rather than growing up together.  </span></p>

I am satisfied that in this case the father is able to provide good enough care for Joe with the support of his network and from the Local&#160;Authority.  </span></p>

There is a greater level of vulnerability for Joe, the father&#8217;s use of substances still needs to be monitored and support given with that, and the father will be taking on the sole care of a much younger child.  He will, in my judgement, also need the support of the Local&#160;Authority to manage the mother&#8217;s contact with Joe.  </span></p>

The mother was clear about her wish to care for Joe, but the mother&#8217;s behaviour at times has been problematic, including when Joe was present, and it is important particularly during these early stages that he is not exposed to any harmful or worrying situations.

However, I am going to throw that ball into the Local&#160;Authority&#8217;s court to work out and suggest how it is to be conducted going forward.  The supervision plan will need to also set out what the proposals are for any further drugs testing, for visits to the father&#8217;s home, for the health visitor&#8217;s role, and also whether a nursery place, or something like that, is intended for Joe or attendance at children&#8217;s centres.  </span></p>
