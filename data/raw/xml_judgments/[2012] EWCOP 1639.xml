On 18 May 2012, an urgent application was made to the Court of Protection by her local authority, which was concerned that her position should be investigated and protected.  E&#8217;s death was imminent.  She was refusing to eat, and was taking only a small amount of water.  She was being looked after in a community hospital under a palliative care regime whose purpose was to allow her to die in comfort.</span></p>

I found that E lacked capacity to make a decision about life-sustaining treatment and declared that it was in her best interests to be fed against her wishes with all that this entails.  I now give fuller reasons for what was a very difficult decision.  </span></p>

	      <p class="Body1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.07in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">There are established instances of the withdrawal or withholding of life-sustaining treatment from people in a permanent vegetative state who have no degree of awareness.  There are also a few cases in which treatment or continued treatment has been found not to be in the best interests of very young or very elderly patients suffering from incurable terminal illness.  </span></p>

	      <p class="Body1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.07in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">E's case has raised for the first time in my experience the real possibility of life-sustaining treatment not being in the best interests of a person who, while lacking capacity, is fully aware of her situation.  She is in many ways the opposite of a PVS patient or a person with an inevitably fatal condition.  She is described as an intelligent and charming person.  Albeit gravely unwell, she is not incurable.  She does not seek death, but above all she does not want to eat or to be fed.  She sees her life as pointless and wants to be allowed to make her own choices, realising that refusal to eat must lead to her death.  Her situation requires a balance to be struck between the weight objectively to be given to life on one hand and to personal independence on the other.</span></p>

She has two sisters who are both in long-term relationships and now have young children.  Unhappily, and unknown to her parents until many years later, E was seriously sexually abused between the ages of 4 and 11.  At the age of 11 she began to control her eating and from the age of 12 or 13 she started binge eating with self-induced vomiting, and also began to use alcohol.  At the age of 15, her weight had dropped to the point that she was admitted for nine months to a specialist unit for the treatment of adolescent eating disorders.  This was successful in the short term and, although her weight remained low, she was able to complete her schooling satisfactorily and go to university to study medicine, where for several years she achieved highly in a demanding course.  She then became involved in a bad relationship and began drinking heavily.  She had to drop out of her medical training, but went travelling with a new boyfriend in what she remembers as a very happy time in her life.  However, in early 2006 she was again admitted for inpatient treatment and thus began a continuous series of emergencies and admissions that have now lasted for six years. </span></p>

In the past two years, she has mostly been treated in her own flat in the community as a result of the failure of the residential placements and the unavailability of further funding.  This has led to a &#8216;revolving door&#8217; series of emergency admissions for medical and psychiatric care, often after she was found in a collapsed state after drinking as much as a bottle of spirits a day.  Indeed, alcohol has for some time represented her only source of calories.  She has been placed under compulsory Mental Health Act section on about 10 occasions, including for one period lasting for almost 4 months.</span></p>

He was commissioned to report by the Official Solicitor.

The triad of anorexia, alcoholism and personality disorder are extremely rare, but not unheard of, in the UK.

Her ambition up to the point when her illness overtook her in her mid-20s was to make a success of her life by using her considerable talents in pursuing a medical career, thereby helping others.  She wanted happy relationships and she wanted a family.  Over the past six years, these ambitions have dimmed with the progress of her illness.</span></p>

She recognises that everything that could have been done to help has been tried and that she has endured a lot of pain with very little benefit.  She describes her life as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">"a pure torment".</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">  All the things she had wanted to do have proved impossible because of her illness.  She can&#8217;t achieve any of her goals and she feels crushed.  She feels she is in a situation where she is able to give nothing to the world and the world is able to give nothing to her.  She is conscious that she represented a huge burden to her family, who have always been extremely supportive and caring.  She feels that her life is pointless.  She would have wanted to have a relationship with her sisters&#8217; children but because of her condition that is not possible.   She has tried to explore every avenue to get over her demons but has failed.  She wants to live for the remainder of her life as she chooses, and if necessary to be allowed die with dignity.  She understands that she will die without intervention.  She does not want to be killed, she just wants to be allowed to act as she wants.  It is possible that she might change her mind, but not because somebody forces to do so.  She has core beliefs and it will be those beliefs that will determine if she wants to stay alive.  She asks the court to respect her wishes.</span></p>

An example of this is the use of a PEG.  The PEG can be seen as a "medical abuse" which links to E's early life experiences.

Although I am not an expert in the field of substance misuse I am well aware that successful treatment for alcohol dependence can occur after many years of dependence and although E&#8217;s history of persistent alcohol dependence is unfavourable in terms of prognosis, it should be remembered that this pattern of misuse has occurred on a background of persistent and profound malnutrition.  </span></p>

Again, the pattern of behaviour which has led to the formulation of this diagnosis has occurred on the background of persistent and profound malnutrition.  Should this pattern of behaviour persist following restoration of weight, there are numerous psychotherapy approaches, including residential, which have proven to be effective in terms of managing this condition, in particular Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT).</span></p>

Subsequently, addiction treatment programmes aimed at enhancing E&#8217;s motivation to remain abstinent from harmful substances could be employed and are well recognised as having a significant level of success.&#8221;</span></p>

In the end, the presumption in favour of the preservation of life is not displaced.</span></p>

I find that the resulting interference with E&#8217;s rights under Articles 8 and 3 is proportionate and necessary in order to protect her right to life under Article 2.</span></p>

Had the authorities not made that commitment, I would not have reached the conclusion that I have. </span></p>
