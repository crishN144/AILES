	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">K is a much loved sister and daughter who until earlier this year was living at home. She suffers from a rare inherited condition which progressively destroys the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.  It is a condition that has affected two of her siblings who died when they were teenagers.  Since May 2023 K has been repeatedly admitted to hospital with respiratory problems which have required her to be intubated and placed on a ventilator. She has also needed repeated courses of antibiotics.  The view of her treating doctors is that she is reaching the end of her life, and that it is in her best interests to receive palliative care.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This final hearing was listed by Moor J on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December.  The family were unrepresented before Moor J and also before me. The second respondent B stated that they were unable to secure legal representation. Whilst it is never easy for anyone in this situation to represent themselves, it was not suggested that I adjourn this hearing.  B drafted a number of questions for the treating expert and others, most of which were asked by Ms Richards for the Official Solicitor.  B also asked a number of other questions herself, and she gave evidence and made submissions. I have a number of written documents from her in the bundle and read an email that she sent after the hearing yesterday.  She has therefore been able to participate fully in the proceedings and to put forward the views of the family.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are only three options for K in her current situation. Option 1 is to continue to treat her in the intensive care unit (ICU) with oral tracheal intubation to allow her to receive continuous breathing support.  Events over the last few weeks demonstrate that she is dependent upon this.  Her life expectancy under this scenario is likely to be measured in weeks or months rather than years.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Option 2 is to extubate K and to cease any further attempts to re-intubate her in the event of respiratory difficulties. In this scenario she would continue to have full active management (suction, fluids, antibiotics) but her prognosis is unlikely to be measured in more than days.  She would receive palliative care with the aim of symptom control.  Although there would be the possibility of transferring K to a hospice or home, this is likely to be burdensome and probably unrealistic given the timeframes concerned.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Option 3 is for K to have a tracheostomy to manage her breathing support without having a tube going into her mouth and down her throat. This would require a short operation under general anaesthetic, followed by care and treatment in the ICU.  Her prognosis under this regime is very difficult to gauge, but it is likely to be measured in weeks and months rather than in years. Dr. B, her treating doctor,  suggested a period of about two or three months but this is very inexact.  This option is not favoured by the treating team or Dr. Bell, the independent expert instructed by the Official Solicitor but it is put forward as a possible best interests option by Dr. O the consultant who was asked by the Trust to provide a second opinion before they issued proceedings.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Trust&#8217;s case is that it is not prepared to offer option 1, a stance with which the other experts agree. To continue the status quo is against all accepted current practice as oral tracheal intubation is only used as a temporary measure. If breathing support is clinically indicated on longer term basis, a tracheostomy is the usual treatment. The trust submits that Option 2 is the only one which is in K&#8217;s best interests although it is prepared to implement Option 3 if the court disagrees with Option 2.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">K&#8217;s sister, B, has been representing the family at this hearing and throughout.  For reasons which are not at all difficult to understand, she has found it difficult to focus on the issues that are before the court.  It was apparent during the hearing at various stages that she finds the issues under discussion extremely distressing.  She is very close to her sister and this family has suffered an enormous amount of tragedy and loss and the pain she is suffering was palpable.  B clearly believes that the treating team do not have K&#8217;s best interests at heart and that she needs to be moved to another hospital. In an email sent for my attention on the evening of the hearing,  B asked for help and said &#8216;with the right treatment and proper management I have full faith she will recover I have seen this&#8217;. During the course of her evidence and submissions B suggested that K was being discriminated against because of her disability and that she would not have been treated in this way had she not had the condition she does.  B believes that with proper treatment K will improve and be able to manage without ventilation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The family have always been against K having a tracheostomy but at the end of the hearing B made clear that their dearest wish was for K to live.  At some point she noted that a tracheostomy would only give K a few months more life but my interpretation of what she said was that the family would favour tracheostomy, i.e. Option 3 over the alternative (although I should stress that this was very unclear).  B does believe that settings such as the ICU only know how to deliver &#8216;the harsh treatment of sedation&#8217;.  She said that she is against there being a policy of no CPR and that her sister is strong and courageous, not NHS property.</p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Official Solicitor&#8217;s position at the beginning of the case was that she wished to hear the evidence before making a recommendation.  At the end of the case, and having explored the possibility  of a trial period of having a tracheostomy with Dr. O during his evidence, the Official Solicitor recommended the court follow Option 3. In so doing she recognised that there is no real distinction between a temporary tracheostomy and Option 3 because of the time that would be needed to undergo such a trial and K&#8217;s limited life expectancy.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr B&#8217;s view that it is not in K&#8217;s best interests to undergo a tracheostomy was clear and firmly expressed. He said his view was one which was shared by the treating team. In his original report he recorded that the discussions that had been had with the family over the proceeding weeks and that they were opposed to the tracheostomy.  Following receipt of  the report of Dr O on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November and K&#8217;s cardiac arrest following self-extubation and subsequent re-intubation on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December, he prepared a further witness statement dealing with the option in more detail and on the basis of K&#8217;s current condition. Dr. B explained that in addition to the operation itself (which is relatively straightforward), there is a burden of care associated with a tracheostomy, even though it is easier for a patient to tolerate than an oral tracheal tube.  The nearest proxy that the treating team have in terms of K&#8217;s tolerance of such is her clinical condition when intubated without sedation.  She made repeated efforts to move the ET tube, successfully doing so on several occasions. Sudden and unplanned removal of a tracheostomy causes the immediate loss of a secure airway; therefore in order to practically keep it in situ she would require either sedation or physical restraint.</p>

If she was not sedated her arms and head would need to be restrained. He stated that physiotherapist treating her reported  that K grimaces when being given treatments such as this showing that she finds this distressing.  When being asked to consider the possibility of carrying out a tracheostomy  as a trial he said that the process would take a significant period of time. Whilst the operation was routine it is not simply benign. There would be a full anaesthetic with muscle paralysis, surgical incision and the use of a rigid plastic tube. K would have to have some time to recover from this. K is now fully dependent on the ventilator, and her condition is deteriorating. She is becoming more distressed by interventions and it was unrealistic to believe that she could tolerate anything other than other than a level of sedation that would prevent her being able to interact with her family.</p>

When he saw her she had been off sedation for about 48 hours, and appeared alert. She occasionally appeared to fix her gaze on him or her sister but otherwise looked around more randomly. She appeared to reach for her ventilator tubes but this did not seem to be with intention of removing it.  He concluded that K was in the final stages of her life, and that tracheostomy would provide the greatest chance of her survival to allow for her discharge from the ICU and the only chance of being discharged home with any degree of stability. Noting that she was attempting to engage with her surroundings he considered that tracheostomy represented the best option for preserving and promoting her quality of life.  He took the view that this was a finely balanced decision.</p>

His instruction was to consider the care she was being given and the options for her treatment, including tracheostomy.  In his oral evidence he said that he formed his initial opinion quite deliberately without looking at Dr. O&#8217;s report to avoid being influenced in any way.  During his visit he discussed K with the nurses (including the matron) and the physiotherapist who were responsible for optimising her respiratory status.

His belief was that she would not.  His conclusion was that there would be a predictable ongoing requirement for sedation to tolerate essential interventions and a need for one-on-one direct attendance to avoid K triggering an unplanned removal of the tracheostomy.  In his oral evidence he said that (having spoken to the nursing staff about how distressing the interventions are) he could not envisage &#8216;sedation being taken away to the point that she can have any quality of life without getting distressed by all the lifesaving interventions and the medical and nursing interventions and therapies. I cannot see in that scenario the restoration of a quality of life where she can take pleasure from the environment&#8217;.

Whilst Dr. B suggested that there was a possibility of a move home or to a hospice with extubation, the palliative care required and the timeframe makes this unrealistic.  B is very anxious that K is not safe where she is and made a plea to the court for help for her to be moved to another hospital.  I do appreciate how very distressed this family is, but there is no hospital which has offered to take her. K has respiratory problems as a result of her underlying neurological condition, and so a specialist respiratory hospital would not be in a better position to treat her.</p>

The first was the inherent value of life itself, as K would only live for a very short time if she is extubated.  The second related to what K might think if she had capacity.  From the evidence we have K loved life,  and she is both strong and a fighter. Her family is very important to her and so she would want to be with them as much as possible.  Third are the views of the family. Although B has found it hard to advance a case she does not want her sister to die and the value to B of possible interaction with her sister is very important.</p>

Therefore, whilst she did not say so explicitly, the tracheostomy option would be better as it gives K a longer life, albeit (as B observed at one point in her evidence, not by very much). It can also be inferred that they would support a reduction in sedation. The views of the family are not at all straightforward because they are predicated on the tragically false belief that K can recover.  B went so far as to say in an email sent to the court after the hearing that the NHS team are deliberately withholding treatment from her.  She said that her sister should be transferred to another hospital for her safety.   I should record at this stage that there is no evidence to support this or that K has been treated differently in any way as a result of her learning disability.</p>

The factors set out by Ms Richards above, are very powerful, as are the heartfelt views of the family. There is no doubt at all that the  preservation of life carries very great weight, even if it is for a short time. So too does the benefit to K of being able to spend at least some time being able to engage with her family.  I bear in mind that many people would be prepared to tolerate some level of distress, pain and discomfort in order to be able to spend some precious time with loved one before dying.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Despite these powerful submissions I have come to the conclusion that it is not in K&#8217;s best interests  to have a tracheostomy.  The evidence of both Dr B and Dr Bell who have both seen K more recently than Dr. O is that they do not believe that K will be able to tolerate the interventions required with a tracheostomy without sedation or physical restraint. I accept their evidence which is based on more recent and a wider knowledge of the case. Whilst I can appreciate that K is strong and courageous, the staff do have experience of how she has reacted to the current regime which is probably the best guide we have as to how she would react in the future. The truth is that K is unlikely to be able to benefit much, if at all, from being more awake. On the contrary, she is likely to suffer in a way that cannot easily be explained to her.  The interventions she would require are frequent and burdensome. She would live for longer, but this would come at a heavy price.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In coming to my decision  I bear in mind that K&#8217;s deterioration has been very rapid and there has been a paradigm shift in her condition since she saw Dr. O on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November. At this point, only two weeks ago, her condition was such that he was able to envisage the possibility of her going home.  Having heard from Dr. B, I  also accept that it is not really possible to conduct the tracheostomy as a sort of trial.  The operation would need to be conducted and for K to recover somewhat from it, which will take a number of days.  It would only be then that the reduction of sedation could be tried.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In all the circumstances, therefore, and considering K&#8217;s best interests in the widest sense, the prospects of K being able to obtain any benefit from a longer life and/or interaction with her family following a tracheostomy are too poor to outweigh the significant burdens that this will entail.  Whilst sedation can shield her from the most distressing symptoms and interventions, this is not a case where she has no awareness at all.  In her fragile state, an operation under general anaesthetic is still burdensome, as are all the sorts of treatments she will continue to have to have in the ICU until she dies.  Ultimately, and unless the Trust make a successful application to withdraw treatment it is thought she will succumb to an overwhelming infection within a few months.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I also bear in mind that the only other option, namely palliative care and extubation, will also carry with it the potential for distress and discomfort to K with symptoms that will require careful management. It will mean that the time with her family will be very short and realistically it seems there is no alternative to remaining in the ICU.  Ultimately, however, it is my clear view, having read the care plan provided,  that it is this pathway which is in her best interests, not a tracheostomy.  I will therefore make the declaration sought by the Applicant Trust.</p>
