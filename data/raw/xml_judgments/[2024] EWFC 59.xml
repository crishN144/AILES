	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 13 October 2023 I handed down judgment in the parties&#8217; financial remedy proceedings.  The net effect of it was to leave the parties in the position whereby H exited the marriage with ca &#163;25.3m and W just over &#163;18m.  Excluded from those figures was The M Trust.  I now have to determine what should happen to this settlement (&#8220;the trust&#8221;).  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By the time of the final hearing before me it was common ground between the parties that the assets of the trust were entirely matrimonial and that they had an equal entitlement to them.  However, there were problems in valuing the net assets. In particular, there was significant difficulty related to the assessment of the tax liabilities which attached to the trust, involving tax law in several different jurisdictions, and on which the tax experts disagreed, and a lesser issue as to the value to be attributed to L Co, a NFI held within the trust.  Whilst it would have been possible to attribute a value to L Co, it would have been unreliable and risky to attribute a figure to the tax liabilities, so uncertain was their assessment.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The letter of wishes which accompanied the establishment of the trust in 2015 provided that in the event of a divorce between the parties they would like the trust fund to be divided as to &#8531; to each party and &#8531; between the children.  Using a mid-point figure for the value of the trust net of tax, the assets amount to approximately &#163;2.4m.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During the hearing H argued that I should keep the trust in existence for the benefit of the children.  In particular, that would avoid incurring unnecessary tax liabilities which I was led to believe might otherwise either be deferred indefinitely or avoided.  This of course had the advantage of enabling the court not to have to enter into the speculative exercises of valuing (i) the tax liability which would occur upon the winding up of the trust and (ii) L Co.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties agreed that the purpose of the trust when set up was for the benefit of the three children. In the light of that, the wealth that was being provided for each party under the terms of the order that I made, and what I understood to be the fiscal undesirability of winding up the trust, I set out in the judgment that it was the intention of the court that the M Trust structure was to be retained for the children and any tax liability to be borne out of trust assets and if that proved impossible shared between the parties.  My findings can be seen in the judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Further, placing the funds in a bank account for the children for the specific purpose of support for the children which would be accessed at some time in the future would lead to the immediate problem that this would be likely to be considered to amount to the creation of a new settlement (whether bare or otherwise) with the tax consequences set out in the Rawlinson &amp; Hunter letter of 29 February 2024.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The third alternative of distributing the funds to the parents on an undertaking made separately that each party makes of their share a gift to the children creates the issue of pretence.  To escape tax, the undertaking cannot refer to The M Trust because there will then be a specific asset held for the children; it simply would not be an honest representation to say that this use of funds did not derive from the trust.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I very much regret that the parents have got themselves into this situation.  To some extent I accept that it has flowed from a well-intentioned wish of the court to use the funds as the parents had intended without there being a proper understanding of what the tax consequences were to be.  The problems have been magnified by the fact that the accountants for each side have given different advice and come to different conclusions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having provided in a way that will leave each party exiting the marriage with the very significant funds referred to earlier, most of them already liquid, it is lamentable that they have now spent over &#163;300k arguing about how a relatively small fund of about &#163;2.4m net of tax should be used and in particular in circumstances where they each agree that they are equally entitled.  It is hard to see the dispute as other than about who is seen or presents themselves as the donor of money to the children.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The futility of the argument is magnified when one remembers that the parties will each incur heavy expenditure upon the children, who are and will be privately educated. Those expenses are under my order appropriated 60:40, reflecting the overall division of assets.  It is likely that the sums expended by each party on the support of the children will mean that the provisions of the letter of wishes in the event of divorce will be put into effect as the parties originally intended.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The division of these trust assets between the parties should not be overcomplicated.  The only asset whose value is in dispute is L Co.  The difference between the two figures reflected the dispute as to whether there should be a minority discount to take into account the relatively small size of the shareholding.  My draft judgment sent to counsel and the schedules provided in October 2023 showed that I was of the view that no discount should attach and that I accepted the argument of Ms Hart (W&#8217;s expert accountant) that this was appropriate as the asset would only become realised as part of a sale of the whole.  All other figures will flow from the resolution of that dispute.  </p>

They are his ventures and W is right to say that she does not wish to be involved in them.  I do not accede to the argument that they should be valued at &#163;1.021m, a figure substantially in excess of the two competing figures that were before me at trial.  I use the figures that were presented to me in October and excluding the minority discount L Co assumes a value of &#163;835k.</p>
