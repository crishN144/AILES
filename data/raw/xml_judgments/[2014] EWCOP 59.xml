That is, I think, part of the overall picture, and an important one at that.

	      <content>
		<p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.98in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">&#8216;The best interests test involves identifying a number of relevant factors.  The actual wishes of P can be a relevant factor: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4(6)</ref>(a) says so.  The beliefs and values which would be likely to influence P&#8217;s decision, if he had capacity to make the relevant decision, are a relevant factor: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4(6)</ref>(b) says so.  The other factors which P would be likely to consider, if he had the capacity to consider them, are a relevant factor: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4(6)</ref>(c) says so.  Accordingly, the balance sheet of factors which P would draw up, if he had capacity to make the decision, is a relevant factor for the court&#8217;s decision.  Further, in most cases the court will be able to determine what decision it is likely that P would have made, if he had capacity. In such a case, in my judgment, P&#8217;s balance sheet of factors and P&#8217;s likely decision can be taken into account by the court.  This involves an element of substituted judgment being taken into account, together with anything else which is relevant.  However, it is absolutely clear that the ultimate test for the court is the test of best interests and not the test of substituted judgment.  Nonetheless, the substituted judgment can be relevant and is not excluded from consideration.  As Hoffmann LJ said in the Bland case, the substituted judgment can be subsumed within the concept of best interests.  That appeared to be the view of the Law Commission also (at para 55).&#8217;</span></p>

Nevertheless, &#8220;the right thing&#8221; is to be judged, as Baroness Hale's recent speech makes clear, by reference to the standards of the incapacitous person himself, and not by what the reasonable incapacitous person might be thought to think.  Further, in my judgment, the concept of being remembered &#8220;as having done the right thing&#8221; still has relevance even if, because of the lack of testamentary capacity, the right thing has to be done for the testator by the Court of Protection.&#8217;</span></p>

Finally, insofar as Sir Alan Ward and Arden LJ were suggesting that the test of the patient's wishes and feelings was an objective one, what the reasonable patient would think, again I respectfully disagree. The purpose of the best interests test is to consider matters from the patient's point of view. That is not to say that his wishes must prevail, any more than those of a fully capable patient must prevail. We cannot always have what we want. Nor will it always be possible to ascertain what an incapable patient's wishes are. Even if it is possible to determine what his views were in the past, they might well have changed in the light of the stresses and strains of his current predicament. In this case, the highest it could be put was, as counsel had agreed, that "It was likely that Mr James would want treatment up to the point where it became hopeless". But insofar as it is possible to ascertain the patient's wishes and feelings, his beliefs and values or the things which were important to him, it is those which should be taken into account because they are a component in making the choice which is right for him as an individual human being.&#8217;</span></p>

However, in the ordinary case the Mental Capacity Act is not a vehicle for imposing on people views, wishes and feelings that clearly are contrary to those they held before losing capacity, do not hold now and would not hold if they regained capacity, however right those views may be, and however unworthy P&#8217;s views are according to most people&#8217;s standards.</span></p>

For various reasons all of us never quite get round to doing many of the things we know we ought to do. Making a Will may be one of them. Most people would wish to make a Will if they knew both that they were going to be incapacitated by a stroke tomorrow and the consequences of dying intestate or leaving a defective Will. They would seek to avoid the sometimes arbitrary nature of intestacy, the consequences of dying intestate on those dear to them, the resulting inconvenience and worry for their family, the possibility of family discord and avoidable litigation arising from a failure to make clear their intentions.</span></p>

Hence, it seems to me, the case law emphasises that adult autonomy is not the only consideration and that in many cases and for many people it is in their best interests that they be remembered with affection by their family and as having done &#8216;the right thing&#8217; by a Will.</span></p>

I also accept his daughter&#8217;s evidence that when she went to England in 1983 with a passport in the name of Dawson he told her that she would be taken care of and not to worry. If, as seems likely, he knew or suspected from her speech or demeanour that sometimes she was under the influence of alcohol or drugs it did not lead him to break off all contact with her or to refuse her calls. I do not accept that he refused to talk to her by telephone and would keep their conversations short. Similarly, therefore, I reject his wife&#8217;s oral evidence that he would now &#8216;be happy&#8217; not to help his daughter if he knew of her present circumstances &#8216;because she takes drugs and probably spends all her money on drugs, that&#8217;s probably why she hasn&#8217;t got any money&#8217;.</span></p>

According to Mrs Jones, he never mentioned leaving any of his estate to his daughter in a Will, &#8216;not because he had made up his mind but because of the sort of man he was, i.e. old fashioned and authoritarian.

He provided her with a good standard of living over many decades, paid all outgoings and also gave her a weekly allowance for her own use.  The couple took regular holidays abroad. In due course I believe that his beliefs, values and wishes were such that it is likely that he intended to make arrangements of whatever kind to ensure that she received the greater part of his estate. At the same time I accept that his beliefs and values included making reasonable provision for his daughter in his Will, in due course.</span></p>

This division reflects the length of his marriage, the standard of living when he provided to his wife over many years, the time spent in each other&#8217;s company and similar considerations. It also reflects the fact that I have accepted the evidence that he always intended to provide for his only child in due course and that their relationship was and is a meaningful one.

I assume this was copied to the parties. I have not received any submissions in respect of it. I have not taken the statement into account in coming to my decision and do not propose to do so unless the parties agree that I should or there is a formal application for me to take it into account.</span></p>
