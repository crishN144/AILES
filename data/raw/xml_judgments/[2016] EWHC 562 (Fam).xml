	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On 10 March 2015, at the conclusion of that final hearing which occupied a full eight days of court time, Holman J made a raft of orders in respect of the financial provision which was to be made for W.  That hearing had addressed the issues of entitlement and computation.  It has been referred to in these proceedings as &#8220;the Phase I hearing&#8221;.  Throughout its course, H&#8217;s case had been that, notwithstanding the length of the marriage (some 21 years), W&#8217;s claims should be very significantly restricted in value because of (a) the effect of a post-nuptial agreement (PNA) into which they had entered some five years into the marriage; and (b) his &#8216;special contribution&#8217; in terms of the generation of wealth.  His position falls into stark focus when that case is translated into figures.  From assets of c.$240 million<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		<p class="FootnoteText"><span/><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The assets in this case have been computed in US dollars rather than a sterling equivalent figure.</span></p>
	      </authorialNote>, he was offering her not one penny over and above those assets which she already held in the sum of c.$5 million (approximately &#163;3 million).  Notwithstanding the fact that the marriage had lasted for over 20 years and two children had been born during its course, H&#8217;s case was that W&#8217;s financial entitlement on her &#8220;exit&#8221; from the marriage was contractually dictated by her unwillingness to accept a sum of $71 million which he had offered to pay in accordance with the provisions of the PNA.  The fact that, on his case, she would be leaving the marriage with no more than about 2% of the available wealth was, he contended, an inevitable consequence of her intransigent stance in relation to the pursuit of the litigation to a final hearing.</p>

The principal area of dispute is the application of discounts to the value of H&#8217;s interests in various investments.  The case was released to me pursuant to an order which the judge made at the pre-trial review on 9 December 2015.  I have within the material in the bundles before me a complete transcript of the judgment which Holman J delivered on 6 March 2015.  It includes, as one would expect from this judge, a detailed and careful exposition of the facts relating to the background history and the arguments which were advanced by leading counsel for both parties at the Phase I hearing.  I do not propose to rehearse those facts in this judgment which should be read in conjunction with that delivered by Holman J for a full understanding of the case.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Under  paragraph 2(a) of Holman J&#8217;s substantive order dated 10 March 2015, H and W were each entitled to receive an equal share of the net assets as valued on the agreed date of 31 December 2014.  For the purposes of the hearing, the judge had been given a schedule of assets which demonstrated this couple&#8217;s net wealth to be in the order of $240 million.  That figure took no account of the substantial discounts for which H was then contending in terms of the valuations of a number of his assets. Helpfully, the asset schedule provided to Holman J also set out values on a discounted basis.  H and W were both then in their mid- to late forties.  Neither was working in remunerative employment.  H had retired some seven years earlier having taken the decision that he had by then accumulated sufficient wealth to enable the family to live extremely comfortably for the rest of their lives.  His unearned income at the time of the Phase I hearing was several millions of dollars a year (para 115 judgment). W had made her contribution to this long marriage as a wife, mother and homemaker.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The asset base was complex, but certainly not atypical for this type of case.  With his investor&#8217;s eye H had, over the course of several years, invested the parties&#8217; accruing wealth in a number of different assets.  In addition to liquid cash deposits and their homes in London and Aspen, there were a significant number of marketable securities, hedge funds, venture capital and private equity investments, as well as direct and single asset investments.  Most of this wealth was held within a structure of offshore trusts and other entities designed to maximise tax efficiency for the benefit of H and W, although there was no issue between them as to the reality of his/their beneficial entitlement to the underlying wealth.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Of the gross available wealth (approximately $240 million as at 31 December 2014), some $180 million (c.75%) was invested in property or liquid cash deposits.  In broad terms, the remaining $60 million was invested in 36 individual securities, hedge funds, private equity investments and venture capital partnerships.  Thus, in terms of the underlying composition of the asset base, some 25% was tied up in assets which, by their nature, were risk laden and partially illiquid.  It is these assets which were the principal target of W&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">Wells</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">

	      </authorialNote>-sharing approach.  To her section 25 statement, the basis of her case before Holman J in Phase I, she had exhibited a schedule in which she set out those assets which she wished to receive by way of distribution in specie at the conclusion of the case.  Together with a share of the cash funds and the property in Aspen, she was then claiming a full half share of the assets which were available for distribution.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">H (through his then leading counsel, Mr Charles Howard QC) was arguing strenuously for a discount of some $20 million in relation to the value of his interests in the various illiquid entities and investments.  That level of discount was appropriate on his case because of the inherent risks and lack of marketability in relation to a significant number of them.  In a sharing case (which the judge decided this to be), the appropriate level of discount was obviously crucial since it was likely to impact upon W&#8217;s award by several millions of pounds.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I am told that the judge had made it plain from the outset that he had insufficient time to deal with the issue of extraction and the assessment of discount (if any) since the arguments in relation to the PNA and special contribution had absorbed most of the time allocated to the case.  There was simply insufficient time for the judge to hear evidence or argument about discounts.  Without that evidence, his lordship felt unable to test Mr Bishop&#8217;s submission that W&#8217;s list contained what he called &#8220;duffs&#8221; as well as &#8220;plums&#8221;.  For that reason, he announced at a relatively early stage of the hearing that, apart from W&#8217;s claim to one of the properties (which he rejected) and to a share of their art collection, he would make his award on a lump sum basis and, for these purposes, would treat the assets as having the discounted value which was then being asserted by H (i.e. $225 million, <span style="font-style:italic">per</span> paragraph 2 of the judgment).    He deliberately left open for the purposes of this hearing further forensic investigation by W into H&#8217;s case in relation to discounts.  At paragraphs 122 and 123 of his judgment, Holman J said this:</p>

			<p class="FootnoteText"><span/><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The judge must plainly have meant $240,000,000.</span></p>

After the major issues as to the agreement and as to special contribution have been determined by this judgment, and in the light of the very bruising and painful experience of the past two weeks, I fervently hope that the parties will, indeed, now resolve the lingering issue as to discounts by sensible negotiation and give and take.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"> The letter pointed out that subsequent events and the responses from the managers of the relevant investments had cast doubt on H&#8217;s case in relation to the discounts.  First, since the February 2015 hearing, he had been able to liquidate approximately $59 million worth of investments at short notice and with no discount whatsoever.  Secondly, the responses from the various investment managers demonstrated that, in the majority of cases, the assets were indeed capable of being transferred to W despite his earlier assertions that they were not.  A schedule appended to that letter set out the 29 investments which were transferable.  They had a combined gross value of just over $54.7 million or a discounted value of just under $43.8 million.  The letter pointed out that, because of H&#8217;s continued unwillingness to contemplate any division of the assets in specie and his refusal to engage in negotiation despite the earlier offer of a round table meeting, the single remaining issue was the quantification of the final payment due to W.  W&#8217;s figure in respect of that final payment was therefore predicated on the basis of the undiscounted value of the net assets (i.e. c. $240 million) since, on her case, there was no justification for applying the discounts for which H was contending.  Despite the fact that she would be entitled to a sum of just under $10.5 million on this basis, she offered to accept a reduced sum of $8.2 million in full and final satisfaction of her claims.  That time-limited offer remained open for acceptance for a period of two weeks.  By the time H&#8217;s open counter-proposal was received, it had lapsed.</p>

She contends that the reason why he has fought &#8220;tooth and nail&#8221; (to use her expression) to avoid an in specie division is because he knows very well that it is in his financial interests to retain the bulk of the portfolio of assets which, together, they built up over the course of the marriage.  W told me (and I accept) that she is no financial ing&#233;nue.  Her evidence (which was not challenged) was that, as a couple, they had always discussed what investments should be made during the marriage. Her evidence was that she was very familiar with the structure of their assets and the performance of the underlying investments.

An award which is comprised entirely of cash is, on her case, inherently unfair because, in a climate of zero interest rates, she now has to go out into the market and begin again from scratch.  Not only does she have to find the investments, she has to pay teams of lawyers and accountants to assist her in building a new investment portfolio.  There are risks inherent in that exercise to which she would not be exposed if she had been allowed to take her half share of the matrimonial portfolio.  Significant costs would have been avoided.  These are risks and costs to which H is not exposed since he has retained the bulk of their joint assets in tact save for those which he has liquidated in order to meet the lump sums payable under Holman J&#8217;s order.   On her case, receipt by her of those cash sums does not deliver value which is equal to the value retained by H in the investment portfolio.  </p>

He reminds me that W was willing from the outset of these proceedings to take an in specie division.  Because of the underlying composition of the matrimonial portfolio, this was easily achieved.  What they were seeking to divide was not a single substantial block of illiquid shares but a portfolio of many different investments which readily lent themselves to a consensual or judicial distributive exercise.  Neither would be involved in the future management of the other&#8217;s investments and each would leave the marriage with personal control and autonomy over their individual portfolios.

Whilst receipt of a share of the assets in specie would come to her pregnant with whatever risks they attracted, she would have had complete control of the timing of any future realisations and could thereby have managed those risks on the basis of whatever investment strategy she chose as being in her best interests.</p>

It was not, says Mr Bishop, fixed in stone and, had H engaged in the process as a matter of principle, it would have been feasible to produce a division of the assets which reflected a broadly equal and fair spread of both value and risk.  If that could not be achieved by agreement (as the judge clearly wished), it could have been achieved by means of a judicial determination reflected in a series of property adjustment orders.  The fact that there were outstanding future capital calls of some $16.6 million in respect of some of the assets would not have prevented an in specie division since assets pregnant with those future capital calls could have been distributed on a broadly even basis in circumstances where each party would have had more than sufficient liquid resources (or access to such resources) to meet those liabilities.</p>

If his valuations and discounts were genuine and reliable predictors of true underlying value, it would have been wholly immaterial to H whether he took the asset or cash (as he requires W to do).  Mr Bishop contends that H&#8217;s overarching and unshakeable resistance to the principle of sharing is reliable evidence from which I can, and should, infer that he knows it is to his financial advantage to retain the assets.  In rejecting the principle, he left the court with no option but to make the lump sum orders it did.  That unreasonable stance should now find reflection in the manner in which I approach Phase II and the computation of the remaining balance due to W in respect of a full half share.  The &#8216;ship has now sailed&#8217; in terms of the opportunity to share in specie.  Some of the assets which were available for sharing as at the end of December 2014 have now been sold.  Even if those liquidations had not occurred, the passage of time which has since intervened would mean that another round of due diligence would be required in order to ascertain what had happened to the various funds during the thirteen months since the last valuation date.  Since there is no way to provide a reliable benchmark as to current value, the only way to achieve a fair result, he submits, is to undertake the computation exercise from the foot of gross and undiscounted figures as at the agreed valuation date (i.e. 31 December 2014).  </p>

Discounts crop up in a number of areas when the valuation of assets is undertaken in ancillary relief proceedings &#8230; as here, where it is said that the assets are illiquid, risky or deferred.  Although the technique has a respectable pedigree it must be recognised that it is one that is devoid of any science and is never more than a guess by the expert valuer of what lesser price than face value a hypothetical purchaser would pay for the asset in question.  And it is almost invariably the case that the expert will align his guess with his client&#8217;s interests, so that the expert for the owning party will almost always suggest a higher discount than the expert for the claiming party.  So the court is asked to choose between less than disinterested guesses.  Here H argues for a discount of 25%.  W says it should be 15%.  How and by reference to what considerations can I possibly decide this dispute ?  It is impossible, and any decision made by me would almost certainly be wrong.  It is for this reason that I am clearly of the view that a <span style="font-style:italic">Wells </span>sharing is particularly appropriate where the asset in question is the subject of a dispute about discounts.&#8221;</p>

Each has the benefit of extremely experienced lawyers who had heard the clear terms of Holman J&#8217;s advice to the parties in March 2015.

I accept that it was unrealistic at that stage to expect him to take H&#8217;s instructions and thereby re-open the evidence.    I am therefore not reaching any conclusions on the basis of H&#8217;s failure to waive his own privilege.  Those discussions, whatever their nature, must remain private and I cannot speculate about how reasonable or otherwise either of these parties was being in maintaining their open positions merely on the basis that W now says she has nothing to fear from laying before the court what was said during negotiation.    </p>

W has received the vast bulk of her award in cash and is not seeking anything other than a further tranche of cash at this hearing.  If discounts are ignored, as she contends they should be, she will have received as her share of these investments a substantial cash payment which, in relation to the illiquid assets left in H&#8217;s hands, ignores the facts of deferred receipt, illiquidity, uncertainty and H&#8217;s lack of control.  Significantly, he points to the fact that W&#8217;s own expert accepts, in principle, that there should be some discounting in order to achieve a fair cash equivalent value.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In relation to the independence and underlying integrity of the discounts relied on by H, he points to the fact that they were initially quantified in February 2013 not by H but by Kitano (the asset management company which administers his finances).  Citigroup had played an important role in that exercise.  Its advice in relation to discounts and/or likely bids had informed and underpinned the figures which were subsequently presented to H&#8217;s experts.  The discounts were independently reviewed in November 2013 by Ernst &amp; Young and the remainder in December that year by Deloittes.  Mr Cusworth points to the impeccable pedigree of those firms.  The individual accountants instructed, Mr Tullis and Mr Morris, carefully analysed the investments, cross-checked them against other valuation methods and concluded that the discounts applied were reasonable.   Despite his genuine belief that the figures approved by Ernst &amp; Young and Deloitte were fair and accurate, H was still prepared to accommodate W by agreeing to accept lower discounts in an attempt to bridge the gap between the experts.  </p>

Whilst W responded with an open offer to accept a reduced payment of c.$8.2 million, that sum was greater than that to which she would be entitled in the event that her own accountant&#8217;s discounts were accepted in their  entirety.  Thus, contends, Mr Cusworth, W&#8217;s criticisms of H&#8217;s stance are unfounded.  Far from being unwilling to negotiate, his client was throughout trying to tread a middle ground in an attempt to achieve a final compromise and avoid further litigation.</p>

I heard about how she had successfully sold one piece of art which she retained for a sum far in excess of that which Christies had attributed to it in their valuation exercise.  She told me that H had had similar success in relation to the auction price achieved for one of his pieces of art.  She pointed to the figure he had been given by an estate agent in respect of the former matrimonial home at Phillimore Gardens.  He had retained that property on the basis of an agreed value of c.&#163;30 million.  He had already had a preliminary indication from an estate agent that he should market the property for a sum which was $10 million in excess of its agreed valuation.  She told me that exactly the same situation had arisen in relation to their property in Aspen.  Initially H had said it was worth $21 million.  W insisted on a joint valuation since a recent mortgage valuation had come in at $32 million.  The joint valuation produced a figure of $29 million.  Thus, in terms of embedded value, a sum of $8 million would have dropped out of the pot she was to share had she accepted H&#8217;s original figure.</p>

She sought with grace and elegance (if I am permitted to say so) to convey to me the strength of her feelings and the importance which she attached to the principle that the assets should be split in a fair way.

He gave his evidence in a calm and measured way but, perhaps not surprisingly, his evidence was shaped and honed by his experience as a very sophisticated financial investor of many years&#8217; standing.  He told me that the Lone Star funds (which lie at the centre of the current dispute between the accountants in terms of the value of the discounts claimed) were global investments comprised in the main of distressed assets.  Those which remain are the &#8220;tail end&#8221; of restructured loan payments and properties which had been in negative equity.  He accepts that he received a significant payment of some $22 million in 2014 from one of the funds but he told me that this was a &#8220;one off&#8221; and that there were unlikely to be any further windfall receipts from the Lone Star funds.  Whilst the funds were nearing the end of their lives in terms of an &#8220;exit date&#8221;, there was every possibility that the general partners (or fund managers) would simply extend that date (June 2016) with the result that H&#8217;s period of risk in relation to these assets was extended into an uncertain future.  H was keen to impress upon me that, because he had no control over investment strategy, his financial interests may not necessarily be aligned with those of the general partners.  Whilst he accepts that he suffered no discount on the return he received from the four funds which were liquidated to meet the second lump sum payment to W, he told me that there were other funds which had not paid out despite the fact that he had submitted redemption notices some time ago.</p>

Secondly, he had assumed that certain shares were transferable when, in H&#8217;s view, they were not.  He accepts that he had throughout approached the case as one where W would receive a cash payment on a clean break basis although he believed that her target had always been a cash payment based upon gross asset values rather than an in specie division.

It is an approach which I find to be genuine in terms of her <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">subjective</span> conviction that a cash award on the basis of heavily discounted values is an award which &#8216;short-changes&#8217; her in terms of a full 50% of the assets.</p>

H told me that he was pursing his appeal in relation to special contribution (which was true) and that he assumed the lawyers would be speaking to one another about settlement.  Because W had made it abundantly clear to him that she did not agree to discount any of the assets, he told me that a detailed negotiated settlement would have meant a further round of extensive due diligence before he felt she would be prepared to select which assets she wished to retain.  By that stage he had already liquidated those assets which were readily capable of realisation in order to meet the payment of $60 million which she had received.  He saw little prospect of recovering any significant part of that sum.  There was no offer from W to sit down and talk until she received that first tranche of her award and he had no reason whatsoever to believe that she was likely to depart from her previous stance of intransigence over the discount issue.

That had been Holman J&#8217;s clear and unequivocal injunction to the parties.   His unwillingness to attend a meeting, or even to authorise his solicitor to attend a meeting on his behalf, seems to me to have been a lost opportunity to sit down and explore how an in specie settlement might have been achieved and the costs of this hearing avoided.  I accept that H knew, and knows, W better than any of the lawyers in this case.  His impression of the futility of achieving any shift in her position to reflect the need to factor in discounts at <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">some</span> level (if not his own figures) may well have been a view he held quite genuinely.  I take on board the fact that he is probably right that, even if she had been prepared to countenance discounts for the purposes of a negotiated settlement, the accountants&#8217; work would not thereby have come to an end.  There may well have been further expense involved in a fully negotiated outcome to this case which involved in specie sharing.  However,  I suspect the costs would have been significantly less than those which have now been incurred and we would not now find ourselves in the somewhat artificial situation of having to assume wholly undiscounted values (on W&#8217;s case) simply because that is now, as she contends, the only fair way to deal with the case.  </p>

The fact that he had no control over the funds would, he said, inevitably have led to demands from W for collateral security to counterbalance her inability to participate in their strategic management.  It was no solution, on his case, to look to the alternative solution of paying her 50% of the net distributions as and when they were received since there would be complex tax issues to be considered, a further potential overlay on working through an equal division as to value.  Whilst H was prepared to accept that an in specie division would have been possible, there was, in his mind, little prospect of agreement as to the mechanics of the division.  As I have said, by the time the case had crystallised evidentially in relation to overall transferability, it seemed that we were down to only five or possibly seven investments which could not be transferred to W<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="9">

In this context, and having listened to all the evidence, I suspect that there may well have been a resistance on H&#8217;s part to the idea of breaking up the structure of the underlying investment portfolio.  When he was asked by Mr Bishop whether he accepted that these assets represented the fruits of their marriage partnership, he was reluctant to characterise them as such.  He acknowledged that W had been a good wife and supportive of his career but he clung to the mantra that these were merely financial assets and this was no more nor less than a valuation exercise.</p>

Within the material in the bundles I have a memorandum of a round of interviews which Kitano conducted in June 2013 with Mr Adam Graves (Deutsche Bank) and Mr Dave Schnur (Citigroup Global Markets).  Mr Schnur, in particular, had provided assistance with the range of discounts applicable to the hedge fund investments.  He provided his opinion on the basis of his knowledge and experience as the director of Citigroup responsible for fund research.  With a team of fifteen professionals who were involved in active transactions concerning the buying and selling of private equity and hedge fund LP investments, Mr Schnur had discussed H&#8217;s portfolio with Kitano and provided prices which were then available for the various types of investment.</p>

Depending upon the particular nature of the fund, the reports provided helpful data on the average percentage discount to be applied.

Significantly, as Mr Morris was to confirm in his oral evidence, he did not look at, or rely on, the Cogent Report which had informed Kitano&#8217;s initial valuation exercise.  In section F of his report, Mr Morris sets out in relation to each of the eight entities with which he deals the basis for applying a particular discount.  In two cases, the discounts he quoted reflected the transaction costs associated with liquidating H&#8217;s interest in the fund; in another they were based on an actual bid to purchase his interest.  Other funds attracted discounts because they were minority interests with lack of control or because they contained restrictions on transferability.  In these instances, Mr Morris records that Kitano&#8217;s original discounts appeared to be <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;within a reasonable range&#8221;</span>.  In relation to funds to which discounts had been applied because of a perceived lack of control (i.e. minority or limited partnership interests), the report describes the underlying methodology which had been used to consider values and discounts.  These involved an analysis of closed-end funds and a transaction review of acquisition premiums.  Several industry studies were identified with brief descriptions of their pedigree and conclusions.</p>

In reaching his conclusions, Mr Tullis had considered (amongst the material with which he was provided) the market-based quotes from Citigroup in relation to the hedge fund, private equity and general and limited partnership interests held by H as well as the ELM Capital report relating to the second half of 2012 and the 2013 Cogent Report.</p>

Simply stated, Mr Tullis, on behalf of Deloittes, said that, from what he had seen, nothing had come to his firm&#8217;s attention which would cause it or him to believe (i) that H&#8217;s general approach to valuation and discounts as at May 2013 (the valuation date for his Form E exercise) was inconsistent with commonly accepted valuation practice; and/or (ii) that H&#8217;s approach and the methods used were improperly applied; and/or (iii) that his estimates of discounted value were unreasonable.  Put another way, Deloittes was prepared to &#8220;sign off&#8221; on H&#8217;s figures and saw nothing unreasonable in either the figures or the route he had taken to reach them.  Appended to the report were extracts of various industry standard tables based on empirical data showing how discounts for lack of control and marketability had been tracked over a number of years by date, volume of transactions and price in order to ascertain the implied discount in any one year in accordance with whatever formula was deployed by the particular study.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of W, Mr Bezant (FTI Consulting) produced the Memorandum dated 16 February 2015 (to which I have already referred).  That was intended for the purposes of the hearing in front of Holman J in February / March 2015.  At that point in time, H had ascribed to his business assets a total discounted value of $160 million.  (This compared to a Form E value (March 2014) of $137 million.)  Mr Bezant&#8217;s view was that the discounts applied by H were excessive.  In particular, he challenged the 39.5% discount which had been applied to his Lone Star interests and the discounts of c.24% which he applied in relation to his other equity investments.  Mr Bezant had carried out his own valuation on the basis of the information provided to him and reached a preliminary conclusion that the assets were worth $175 million rather than $160 million.  He criticised the work undertaken by Ernst &amp; Young and Deloittes for its generic (rather than specific) approach to valuation. That approach had been driven by a review of general valuation literature rather than a bespoke approach dictated by the specific nature and characteristics of the underlying assets.  He further took issue with the fact that Ernst &amp; Young&#8217;s conclusions failed to reflect the way in which the market for these types of investments varied with other comparable investments.  In particular, he pointed to a demonstrable and marked change in the discounts market over the 12 months between 30 December 2013 and January 2015.  Notwithstanding a material fall in the value of market discounts in the period between the preparation of H&#8217;s Form E and the agreed valuation date of 31 December 2014, nowhere did this find reflection in the work of either of H&#8217;s expert witnesses.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In terms of H&#8217;s original methodology, Mr Bezant explained that H had valued his partnership interests by adopting the values estimated and reported from time to time by the various individual fund managers (the net asset values of the underlying investment funds) and had applied to those figures a discount to reflect the difference between the underlying assets within the fund and the market value of an interest in the fund itself.  That methodology was based upon a fundamental assumption that a partnership interest in an investment fund is worth less than a proportionate share of the fund&#8217;s underlying net asset value.  Whilst Mr Bezant was prepared to accept that it is common to apply a discount in this way because empirical data suggests that, on average, partnership interests sell at discounts, he pointed out that such interests may also sell at premium to net asset value.  Herein, in his view, lies the importance of a bespoke valuation exercise rather than the sort of &#8220;across the board&#8221; review which Ernst &amp; Young had undertaken.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The first point to note is that Mr Bezant acknowledges and accepts that, in appropriate circumstances, discounts may be both appropriate <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">and</span> necessary if the ascertainment of fair market value is the object of the exercise in hand.  He provided a number of reasons or justifications for his view.  First, the &#8220;time value of money&#8221; will often require a discounted approach.  In practice an investor is likely to see the return of his capital over a period of time and a purchaser of that fund interest will often require an inbuilt discount to reflect that delay in securing the return of capital.  Secondly, there may well be a contractual requirement on an investor (transferred to a purchaser of that investment) to make further capital commitments to the fund.  Thirdly, a marketability discount may well be appropriate if there is a limited market for the sale of the particular asset or where an individual investor is precluded by contractual restrictions from selling his asset.  Fourthly, a discount may well be appropriate to reflect the ability of an owner from realising value once his investment is placed on the market for sale.  In certain circumstances this discount for lack of liquidity may be no more nor less than the time value of money but Mr Bezant recognises it, in principle, as a legitimate basis for discounting.  These are all scenarios and accounting procedures well known to professionals (lawyers, accountants, judges and investors) who have experience of these types of cases.  Mr Bezant&#8217;s approach emphasises the need to determine (i) whether or not a discount should be applied, and (ii) if so, the extent of such discount, by reference to the specific characteristics of the fund and the market conditions at the valuation date.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mr Bezant&#8217;s approach was informed principally by two external points of reference.  He relied on the Cogent Report to ascertain the range of discounts applicable to the private equity funds and a report produced by Hedgebay for the hedge fund investments.  (Hedgebay is a recognised market leader in secondary markets for hedge funds.)  By reference to the most recent report from Cogent Partners (H2 2014), Mr Bezant has tracked the average discounts applicable to different types of private equity funds.  He has reproduced the movement in those average discounts between 2010 and 2015 in a graph which is set out at internal page 6 of his first report.  This shows clearly that, since the date of the Citigroup input in 2013, the average discount paid by reference to the net asset value of the fund has fallen.  As Mr Bezant deduces, this correlates with a rise in the price of secondary interests in private equity funds.  It was by applying the average net asset value reflected in that (most recent) Cogent Partners&#8217; report to each specific fund by type and in accordance with the underlying fund strategy that Mr Bezant and his team at FTI Consulting concluded that, as at 31 December 2014, H&#8217;s interests were worth $175 million rather than the figure of $160 million contended for by H (and supported by Ernst &amp; Young and Deloittes).</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In anticipation of the Phase I hearing, both Deloittes and Ernst &amp; Young produced updated reports.  They are both dated 21 January 2015.  The Deloittes report appears to be an identical reproduction of Mr Tullis&#8217;s first report (prepared some 13 months earlier) save for the date of the report itself and the valuation date inserted in his &#8220;Summary of Findings&#8221; at the conclusion of the report.  In his second report, Mr Tullis adopts 31 December 2014 as the appropriate valuation date but merely repeats the conclusions which he lifts in identical terms from his first report.  Of particular note, at internal page 2 of his report, he makes reference to the information on which he has relied in compiling his updated report. That mirrors precisely the terms of his first report, including the reference to the Cogent Partners&#8217; report of January <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">2013</span>.  In other words, Mr Tullis did not make any reference to the updated information in the January <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">2015</span> Cogent Partners&#8217; report which informed much of the analysis carried out by Mr Bezant.  Thus there is no reflection in Deloittes&#8217; updated report of the material change in the market during 2014 resulting in the fall in average discounts and the concomitant rise in the price of secondary interests in private equity funds.</p>

Aside from the date, it, too, appears to be a complete replica of Ernst &amp; Young&#8217;s November 2013 report. Mr Morris declined to accept that it was no more than a &#8220;cut and paste&#8221; exercise, as suggested to him in cross-examination by Mr Bishop, but that is what the major part of the document looks like to me in terms of format, if nothing else.  It is true that the list of five entities which appear on the first page of the earlier report as the investments to be valued had expanded to a total of eight entities by the time of the second report, thereby demonstrating some input of new information into the updating exercise.  However, when he was asked by Mr Bishop about two of these investments which should now more appropriately be considered as falling within the &#8220;marketable securities&#8221; category as paid up investments, Mr Morris appeared to be unaware of any change in the underlying composition of the asset base.  As in his first report, and in the same terms, Mr Morris concluded that, as of 31 December 2014, H&#8217;s own discounted value <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;appears to be within a reasonable range&#8221;</span>.

For his part, and in answer the criticism advanced by FTI Consulting that his approach had been &#8220;generic&#8221; rather than &#8220;specific&#8221;, Mr Morris said that he and/or his team had had numerous discussions with Kitano which had, in turn, informed the analysis which his firm had undertaken.  They had also reviewed the terms and conditions of each partnership agreement, for each investment, with a particular focus on transferability restrictions.  Superimposed upon this exercise, they had then reviewed various third party data sources relating to investments which attracted discounts because of a lack of either control or marketability.  That information had been weighed and considered by the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;combined and vast experience (approximately 60 years of valuation experience)&#8221;</span> of the two partners involved in the work.</p>

The discounts applicable to secondary markets were between 20% and 37%.  These bands were used by Deloittes as a cross-check against H&#8217;s own figures and formed the basis for their view that his figures were <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;not unreasonable&#8221;</span>.</p>

In relation to the five hedge funds (which were subsequently liquidated by H), Ernst &amp; Young justified discounts of 7% on the basis of time value for money.  H&#8217;s discounts of 8% for these investments were thus not unreasonable.  (Of course, at the time of producing that report Ernst &amp; Young were not to know that H would subsequently redeem each of those interests on the basis of nil discounts in the total sum of c.$60 million.)</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">That joint statement is a fairly lengthy document which summarises the approach which each of the three experts adopted in relation to the valuation exercise. It concludes with a comparative table of areas of agreement and disagreement and a helpful schedule of discounts relied on by each of H and Mr Bezant in relation to each individual asset.    The principal areas of disagreement in terms of discount are the Lone Star funds where H has applied a 39.5% discount across the board.  In terms of approach, as the schedule makes plain, Mr Bezant has relied heavily on the updated information from the Cogent Partners&#8217; report of January 2015 which he has then applied by way of updating to H&#8217;s original valuation methodology.  That Form E presentation had itself relied heavily on both the Citigroup data and the earlier Cogent Partners report from 2013.  By comparison, both Mr Tullis and Mr Morris spread their particular analytical nets wider in terms of generic market research.  They rely on instances of lack of alignment in partner interests together with lack of marketability and control as steering the discounts into a higher bracket than that allowed for by Mr Bezant&#8217;s alignment with the most recent Cogent Partners&#8217; research.</p>

I had the considerable benefit of decades of collective professional experience to draw upon in reaching my conclusions and I remind myself of the oft-quoted maxim that &#8220;valuation is an art and not a science&#8221;.   Each of the accountants from whom I heard had formed a view as to the value of these assets and the appropriate discounts which the underlying investments attracted.  Whilst Mr Bezant&#8217;s views were reached independently by way of updating, he had started from the platform of information which had underpinned H&#8217;s presentation in his Form E. The approach of H&#8217;s two experts was to view all available data, informed by discussion with the various fund managers, by way of a cross-check of H&#8217;s own figures.  These, they concluded, were still reasonable as the basis for assessing relevant discounts.  The opinions of H&#8217;s two experts were shaped and informed by all the information and empirical research to which each has referred in his reports.  </p>

On W&#8217;s case discounts can safely be ignored.  This adds value of some $21 million to the bottom line figure in respect of which she seeks a further adjustment of 50%.    However, Mr Bishop&#8217;s fall-back position does require a consideration of discounts, even if only by reference to those five or seven assets which are agreed to be non-transferable.  This scenario reduces the difference between the experts to just under $1.34 million.</p>

These liquidations took place in 2015 and were applied in part to fund the cash payments which W has already received.  Together, H had attributed to these assets a gross value of $58.3 million.  On the basis of discounted values of between 5.625% and 7.5%, he sought to reduce that value by some $3.72 million.  The rationale for these particular discounts was the time which it would take him to receive the funds (i.e. the time value of money) and the risk which pertained during that period.  In fact, as we now know, H was able to redeem each of these investments without suffering any discount at all.  By way of example, one particular fund (Catalysis) paid out in just over two weeks from his request and he received an uplift over and above the value he had given in his Form E.  </p>

Together they are worth some c.$4.87 million to which H attributes a discounted value of just under $3 million, a discount approaching some $2 million.  At a time when these investments were worth just over $12 million gross (the date of H&#8217;s Form E in 2013), H sought to apply discounts which reduced their value to just under $6.5 million.  Despite that level of discount, between March and September 2014, they paid out total cash distributions of over $23 million and still retained their current value of just under $5 million.  The funds are at the end of their lives, according to Mr Bezant, and it is simply a matter of waiting for the final distributions before they are wound up.  Mr Bishop points to the fact that it would have been a simple matter to agree to share the rump of these funds on the basis that H could have paid to W 50% of any net sums received.  Instead, he continues to assert that the remaining value should be discounted by a full 39.5%.</p>

He also relies on the fact that these funds are now well past their extended close date but have still not yet been wound down entirely.  This points to a genuine uncertainty as to their effective realisation date and the risk to which H is exposed during this period warrants, in aggregate, the substantial discount of nearly 40%.</p>

He submits that what Mr Bezant did was to &#8220;review the review&#8221; conducted by W&#8217;s accountants.  Rather than independently laying the groundwork for his valuation by applying a number of different approaches to asset division, he contends that Mr Bezant has applied two single pieces of research (the reports from Cogent and Hedgebay) to his task to two separate categories of assets.  There was, says Mr Cusworth, no analysis of the particular investments concerned; instead Mr Bezant reached his conclusions on the basis of &#8220;a single, simplistic tool&#8221;.  Whilst Ernst &amp; Young and Deloittes considered external data, they also read all the underlying agreements pertaining to the various investments and spoke directly to the managers/stewards of the separate funds.  This made theirs a &#8220;bespoke&#8221; valuation exercise rather than an &#8220;off the peg&#8221; overview.  In summary, he contends on behalf of H that the FTI Consulting exercise was no more than a desktop analysis which depended for its core validity on one set of industry standard data.  Further, he submits that, by their nature, the Cogent and Hedgebay reports rely upon data extracted from completed transactions and specifically those for which there was an existing market.  The band of discounts contained in the reports does not reflect those funds for which there is no ready market.  These would be likely to attract a more significant discount and would operate (had they been included) to shift the market average away from the figures relied on by Mr Bezant.  It is for this reason that the methodology adopted by H&#8217;s accountants (i.e. the range of valuation cross-checks) is a more reliable approach when considering appropriate discounts.</span></p>

He had followed that framework, absorbing within in developments which had occurred in relation to each class of assets since 2013.  He regarded his approach as a genuine &#8220;bespoke&#8221; approach.  Neither of H&#8217;s accountants had attempted to work out what discount should be applied on an asset by asset basis.  Instead they had looked at a range of averages and had given their collective seal of approval to H&#8217;s opting for a particular figure within that range.  If their discussions with third party fund managers had fed into their conclusions, Mr Bezant said he could see no evidence of what, if any, influence these had brought to bear on those conclusions.  All he could see were identical reports from each which reflected no movement in underlying market trends over the twelve months and more which had elapsed in between.  The absence of any analysis of changes in market value and discount trends was, in his opinion, a significant omission and revealed a flawed approach.</span></p>

The discounts which H had given in his Form E were consistent at the time with those contained in the 2013 Cogent Report.

Nowhere in these reports do they reflect the significant market shift which Mr Bezant had demonstrated by means of the graph he produced at <span style="font-weight:bold">[1/B:151]</span>.  That graph, or table, was based upon the most up to date information contained in the Cogent Report which had been prepared in January 2015.

He had focused specifically on the discounts applicable to private equity investments.  He had taken his updated information directly from the source which H and his private in-house investment managers had recognised as their point of reference (i.e. the Cogent Report).  The empirical data and studies which were referred to in the reports produced by Deloittes and Ernst &amp; Young were more relevant to smaller companies than to sophisticated investments such as those held by H.  He would not attach substantial weight to them and he regarded the updated Cogent Report as the single most relevant and important source of information for these specific categories of investments.  Cogent was a tailored piece of research which most nearly reflected the underlying nature of H&#8217;s assets.  By contrast, the generic studies relied on by Messrs Tullis and Morris did not address the specific nature and character of the investments at the heart of this case nor did they address their value at a particular point in time.  That data was inherently less reliable than the Cogent Report for a number of reasons.</p>

H had an enforceable <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">contractual</span> entitlement to a share of the profit generated by the funds and there was a binding mechanism for winding up the funds at the end of the investment period so there was no prospect of his funds becoming &#8220;trapped&#8221;.  In these circumstances, H was not exposed to the same level of general risk as an individual investor in a general private equity fund.</p>

Mr Bezant told me that these were simple exercises of arithmetic based upon general equity funds.  They did not &#8220;graft on&#8221; to those calculations the specific attributes of the underlying investments with which we were concerned in this case.  That specificity had been absorbed within H&#8217;s original valuation methodology by reference to both the Citigroup figures and the Cogent Report.  That was the methodology adopted and updated by Mr Bezant. </p>

Mr Bezant&#8217;s approach had been to apply a 0% discount to these funds because of two factors.  The first was the climate of very low interest rates which had pertained throughout the relevant period.  There would have been minimal return on the funds even if H had been in a position to invest them as liquid cash in a bank account.  The second was the nature of the hedge fund investments themselves which provided contractually for H&#8217;s share of the net asset value of the individual funds.  Once redemption notices had been served, H would know in about thirty to forty days what he could expect to receive and the exposure to risk was thus very low and did not attract a significant discount.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">The Lone Star funds were, in Mr Bezant&#8217;s view, in a separate category being funds at the very end of their lives.  There was very little left to do to liquidate the remaining assets and his professional view was that the individual fund managers would want to ensure that the funds were wound up expeditiously in order to return the last of the capital to the investors who would then be free to look at new investments.  These funds had been started in 2002, 2005 and 2008.  They had contractually defined lives precisely to ensure the return of funds to the investors.  They had already gone through permitted extensions and what remained (some $5 million) was the final tranche of the redemption funds.  The fund manager&#8217;s stated intention, coupled with the governing information which was available in relation to the Lone Star funds, was that the last of the funds would be realised and returned to investors by June 2016.  In these very specific circumstances, the fact that these were non-transferable investments did not, in Mr Bezant&#8217;s professional view, justify any discount, let alone the 39.5% for which H contended.  Whilst a discount might have been justified back in 2013 (when H&#8217;s Form E was sworn) when the investment period was materially longer and the level of funds invested significantly greater, we were now in a very different position.  Whilst the precise sum which H would receive was not set in stone, there were few &#8211; if any - external factors operating on that entitlement and it was highly unlikely that there would be any further investment &#8220;churn&#8221; which might affect underlying NAV in the funds.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">He was taken by Mr Bishop to the basis of H&#8217;s calculation of his 39.5% discounts across the board in relation to these assets.  This involved the aggregate of a 30% discount for lack of marketability and a 15% discount for lack of control.  On this basis the investments were valued at 60.5% of NAV.  Mr Bezant said that this approach ignored the contractual basis of guaranteed return and the terms of H&#8217;s investment.  There was already in place a mechanism for determining what entitlement the general partners had to salary and bonus.  The rights of the limited partners (such as H) were governed by that arrangement but those rights did not affect H&#8217;s own entitlement to withdraw funds at the end of the investment period whether that was fixed or governed by an entitlement to serve redemption notices.  Mr Bezant maintained that his approach of not discounting these funds was appropriate because of a combination  of the effects of very low interest rates, the clear expectation that the Lone Star funds would be closed in the very near future, and the guarantee which H had in terms of receiving his share of the underlying NAV.  In 2014, the Lone Star funds had been worth c.$20 million.  Those funds had been paid out more or less in their entirety to H by way of interim distribution with less than $5 million remaining.  There were no further investment or strategic decisions to be made by the General Partners.  In 2014 the expectation was that the entire Fund would be wound up within the next 18 months.  On this basis, H could expect to recover his remaining funds by June 2016.  On this basis, if interest rates were 0.5%, Mr Bezant told me that he would not expect to apply more than a 1% discount if he had to wait for two years and the period between December 2014 and June 2016 was less than that.</p>

He said that the empirical studies relied upon by Mr Morris and Mr Tullis as the basis of their work in relation to discounts become irrelevant if the best expectation you have founded on reliable primary information is that you will get paid in full.  Here, there was available what Mr Bezant described as &#8220;superior information&#8221;.  That overreached any general statistics and informed his professional view about the Lone Star assets.</p>

He accepted that it was not permissible to look at events which had happened after the valuation date of 31 December 2014 in order to assess value or discount as at that date.  However, he took the view that it was not only permissible but necessary to use information which subsequently comes to light in order to test the reliability and appropriateness of the assumptions which had been made at the date of valuation.  In circumstances where he thought H&#8217;s discounts had been sensible, he had adopted them.  Where they were out of date, he had adjusted them.  That &#8216;tailored&#8217; approach had informed the discussion which he had with Messrs Tullis and Morris with a view to producing their joint statement dated 24 December 2015.  He said that, whilst their discussions had been perfectly cordial, at no stage of those discussions had they been prepared to deal with the individual categories of assets and/or to consider each one on the basis of its particular characteristics.  Theirs was very much an &#8220;across the board&#8221; approach.

Nevertheless, he had confidence in that source as &#8220;a helpful tool&#8221;.  Not only was Cogent internationally recognised as a source of expertise in the field of secondary market transactions, they had also been recommended to H by Citigroup as a reliable predictor.  He had merely refreshed H&#8217;s own methodology on the basis of the most up to date information.  The fundamental flaw in the analysis performed on behalf of H was that it represented as valid in 2014 figures which were by then completely out of date.</p>

As such it was more properly to be regarded as a marketable security although the volume of trades since the IPO appear to have been insignificant.  H had applied a 3% discount.  Mr Bezant accepted that, if H were to attempt to sell his entire holding as a single block, a discount was appropriate.  However, if he chose to realise cash over time, the level of risk or discount could all but be eliminated.  For these reasons, he had attributed a 0% discount because H had no immediate need to liquidate and the timing of any future realisation of this asset was entirely in his hands.  Because he had not received any updated information which would have enabled him to consider the extent of any premium which now had to be attached to the investment as a result of the IPO, Mr Bezant had treated the two &#8220;unknowns&#8221; as neutralising the position and maintained his position that no discount should attach to this investment.</p>

Thus, the basis of Deloittes&#8217; work was, in reality, an assessment or review of what had already been done.  Mr Tullis said that there was nothing in their initial approach to valuation with which he would take issue.  The principal reason for the application of discounts by Kitano was its expectation that the hedge fund investments would be redeemed after a period of two years.  Smaller discounts had been applied in relation to the funds which were to be liquidated in 2015.  The fact that they had been wound up and funds repaid to H without any discount did not change Mr Tullis&#8217;s view that it was appropriate to apply discounts in 2013.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">In relation to the Lone Star funds, he justified a discount of almost 40% on the basis that these funds had a higher level of volatility and restrictions.  H&#8217;s interest as a limited partner gave him no control at all and he took issue with the approach adopted by Mr Bezant.  Because the General Partner continued to maintain control over the funds, Mr Tullis believed it was still appropriate to factor in liquidity concerns.  Even on the basis that June 2016 was the anticipated liquidation date in December 2014, it would still be appropriate to factor in a time value discount for money in his opinion since a period of eighteen months carried with it a level of asset risk.  The fact that H was entitled to redeem during certain windows only provided limited certainty but no clarity as to the amount he would actually get back in terms of his contractual percentage entitlement to the underlying NAV of the funds.  This risk arose principally because it was all too easy to envisage a situation in which the interests of the General Partner did not align with those of a limited partner or investor.  He gave me the example of a general partner who wanted to liquidate a fund so as to create a new fund whereas the limited partner may want to stay in the old fund to maximise the value of any return due to him.  In Mr Tullis&#8217;s view, the aggregate discount to be applied was nearer 40.5% but he had not argued with H&#8217;s figure since he could not say that 39.5% was unreasonable. </p>

There was nothing to suggest a delay at that stage.  However, he confirmed that he had increased the level of discount over and above that which would apply to the time value of money specifically to reflect the fact that H&#8217;s interests were not necessarily aligned with those of the general partner.  He disagreed with Mr Bishop&#8217;s proposition that, at the very end of the life of these funds, the fund managers would be unlikely to act to H&#8217;s disadvantage.  Whilst he did not tell me what factors might indicate a lack of alignment as at 31 December 2014, he did say that nothing had come to his attention from source (i.e. Lone Star) to indicate that an increase of 15% for lack of marketability was unreasonable.  That and the discount to represent the time value of money were the two factors which underpinned the discount of 39.5% in his professional opinion.</p>

Whilst he accepted that the evidence of market movement which Mr Bezant had extracted from the later Cogent report could be relevant, he did not think it applied here because he did not consider the averages given by Cogent applied to these funds.  Since they were not direct comparables, he had no cause to revisit his earlier conclusions about the reasonableness of the discount with had been applied for the purposes of H&#8217;s Form E presentation.  For the purposes of my conclusions I am simply not in a position to evaluate the substance or reliability of what Mr Tullis says about the correlation or comparability of the Cogent data with the underlying nature of H&#8217;s investment funds.  Clearly H and Kitano considered them to be reliable comparables for the purposes of his Form E.  It appears that Citigroup also considered the Cogent figures to be relevant.  Mr Bezant agrees that they are highly relevant.  Thus, if forced to form a view about Mr Tullis&#8217;s evidence that I should ignore Cogent&#8217;s data and the figures which appear in the two reports, I am ultimately persuaded by the combined weight and reliance placed by others on that research.  I regard it of particular relevance that H himself relied on the 2013 Cogent report for the purposes of his own presentation to the court.</p>

Because the reports related to the same subject matter, he saw no issue or problem arising out of the fact that he had simply repeated the content of his first report in his second (updating) report.  He told me that there had been discussions between the Deloittes team and Kitano in the period between December 2013 and January 2015 although he accepted that those discussions found no reflection in his second report.

When taken to the graph which appears in the 2015 report showing how discounts in relation to the secondary market in different types of private venture capital had moved over time (and specifically between 2007 and 2014), Mr Tullis accepted that this empirical research had not been taken into account in the preparation of his second report.

Whilst that view might be informed by Mr Tullis&#8217;s lack of familiarity with Part 25 of FPR 2010 (and he told me during the course of his evidence that he had not read it and knew nothing of its contents), I have to say that I would have found it helpful in deciding between the differing approaches of the valuers to have had a more detailed explanation about the precise nature of the evidence which underpinned Mr Tullis&#8217;s conclusions.  Whilst he appeared to be saying that he was entitled to ignore the 2015 Cogent report because he had access to superior information which enabled him to take a more informed view, I was left at the conclusion of his evidence not knowing what that superior information was.  Where the range of discounts between the accountants produced a difference of more than $11 million overall, in my judgment that information would have been central to any evaluation of the expert evidence. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">He was pressed in cross-examination by Mr Bishop about his failure to take any account at all of Cogent&#8217;s market research in relation to these particular markets and the prevailing market trends for discounts.  Mr Morris accepted that he had &#8220;closed his eyes&#8221; to this data but justified its omission on the basis that Cogent did not exist before 2001 and it was not research which he had used for the purposes of his lengthy professional career.  He had preferred to rely upon his own reference sources and his general experience in valuing the appropriate level of discounts to be applied to the assets he had been asked to consider.  In any event, the Cogent report tended to cover transactions which were significantly larger than the majority of H&#8217;s holdings.  In his opinion, they would have been too small to have informed the analysis undertaken by Cogent.</p>

On behalf of H, Mr Cusworth&#8217;s primary submission is that this is a straightforward accountancy exercise and not an exercise of substantive discretion.  He says that Holman J has already determined in the Phase I hearing that W should receive her award as a series of cash lump sums and she is only entitled to more if I am satisfied that the cash and other assets which she has retained and/or received to date are worth less than 50% of the excess beyond the level of assets which underpinned the judge&#8217;s order (i.e. the discounted valuation of $218,266,659).  </p>

First, they are inappropriate because of the indications that there is embedded value in the portfolio.  Second, the discounts relied on by H are arbitrary, artificial and unnecessary.  Third, they are inappropriate in circumstances where W has been deprived of the outcome of <span style="font-style:italic">Wells</span>-sharing which could and should have happened but did not as a direct result of H&#8217;s intransigence based on self-interest.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">Mr Cusworth has pointed out, with some force, that W appears to wish to re-write history in this case.  He reminds me that H first produced his evidence in relation to discounts in 2013.  There was no challenge from W to these figures until the beginning of 2015.  He points to the fact that, at the Phase I hearing, Holman J appears to have rejected W&#8217;s case that discounts were entirely immaterial to <span style="font-style:italic">Wells</span>-sharing or an in specie division of the assets.  The judge accepted that the discount issue had to be resolved in order to divide the assets in specie.  H&#8217;s position at the Phase I hearing was that transferability issues and the absence of agreed discounts precluded the judge from carrying out an in specie division at that point in time and the judge himself had already ruled that he had insufficient time to deal with the discount issue.  He points to the fact that W&#8217;s actual target in terms of the composition of her award has always been cash.  I am told that at the conclusion of the Phase I hearing, she made an open offer to accept a further $9 million in cash so as to avoid the need for directions in relation to a Phase II hearing.  Her letter of 17 April 2015 proposed a meeting but made no specific proposals.  She did not respond to H&#8217;s counter-proposal to split the difference between the accountants on the discounts and, by that stage, H had no option but to pay the second tranche of just under $50 million which was due on 2 August 2015.  (The first payment was always going to be a cash sum because it represented less than 50% of her entitlement to the liquid cash assets.)  He does not seek to underplay the reasons why she would want cash:  the wealth which has been transferred to her since April 2015 has, and will, enable her to invest with maximum flexibility in whatever classes of assets she chooses and to spread the risk in whatever way she deems appropriate.  Finally, Mr Cusworth contends that Holman J could easily have maintained her in specie claim but chose instead to deliver the entire value of her claims in cash lump sums.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">It seems to me that the principle of fairness is one which must underpin each and every order made by the court pursuant to its powers under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> since it is fundamental to the exercise of judicial discretion.  Fairness will not always mean sharing on an equal basis since each case will turn on its own facts.  However, Holman J has already decided that <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">this</span> wife and <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">this</span> husband will share their assets on an equal basis.  That his intention was that W was not to be precluded from running her arguments about the appropriateness of discounts in computing her award seems self-evident to me from paragraph 122 of his judgment at the end of the Phase I hearing.  He left &#8220;expressly open&#8221; W&#8217;s ability &#8220;to investigate whether the true and appropriate net worth of the husband should ignore the discounts for which he contends&#8221;.  In my judgment, his Lordship&#8217;s reference to the words <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;true&#8221;</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;appropriate&#8221;</span> in relation to H&#8217;s net wealth connotes elements of both (i) actual fair market value, and (ii) a consideration of W&#8217;s case that, even if discounts are applicable, fairness dictates that they are ignored because of the loss to her of receiving her share of the assets in specie.  That much is clearly reflected in the recitals at paragraphs 2(e) and (f) of the order which he made on 10 March 2015 at the conclusion of the hearing.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">Further, it seems to me that arguments about &#8220;embedded value&#8221; are, in one sense, no more than the other side of the coin in relation to &#8220;discounts&#8221; for lack of liquidity, marketability or the time value of money.  As the respective cases advanced by these parties demonstrate very clearly, a particular asset or category of assets can be said to attract an element of both.  In that sense, they are corollaries of one another.  Just as an asset may have inherent qualities of risk, it may have equal potential for uplift or reward.  In the same way, a category of assets which, by its nature is risk-laden, may well be counter-balanced elsewhere in the portfolio by assets, or a category of assets, which have the potential to deliver a premium.  (This much was confirmed by Mr Bezant to be a perfectly principled approach in relation to the example he gave of the Lone Star funds.)  It is scientifically impossible to attribute to a particular asset a fixed percentage in respect of risk or reward which is bound to be right.  The experts from whom I heard, with all their wealth of experience, can do no more than express a view as to the likelihood of either and that is what they have done.  As Mostyn J observed in <span style="font-style:italic">GW v RW </span>(above), any view which I express is almost bound to be wrong insofar as it does not coincide with the views of one or other body of experts.  All that I can do in these circumstances is express a view in relation to factors emerging from the evidence or the respective approaches of the individual experts which pull me towards one direction or another.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">In my judgment, W&#8217;s primary case that I should ignore any potential discounts because of (i) embedded value, and/or (ii) her lack of opportunity to participate in full <span style="font-style:italic">Wells</span>-sharing across the board cannot succeed.  In the first place, to rely on the existence of potential embedded value (from which she has been deprived of benefit in future) is to ignore the element of latent risk impressed upon the assets which H is retaining as a result of the manner in which the judge structured his order at the conclusion of the Phase I hearing.  I do not accept that these assets are entirely risk free or the equivalent of cash in H&#8217;s hands.  The degree of risk may be small or it may be great; that has to be reflected in the percentage discount applied.  Secondly, whilst W seeks to criticise that assessment of risk and the discounts H relies on as &#8220;arbitrary, artificial and unnecessary&#8221;, her criticism in terms of the general principle is not supported by her own expert, Mr Bezant.  He accepts that discounts should be applied to some of H&#8217;s investments although he disagrees with the level of discount which has been applied by Ernst &amp; Young and Deloittes.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">Standing back, it seems to me that there were two alternatives open to Holman J when the case was before him in February 2015.  He could have adjourned the entire hearing on the basis that the time estimate was wholly inadequate for a resolution of all the issues before him.  That would have involved a great deal of wasted time and effort together with a significant waste of costs.  His Lordship decided to proceed and make use of the time he had.  He could have heard the evidence and restricted his conclusions at that stage to findings of fact in respect of H&#8217;s case in relation to the PNA and special contribution.  It would have been open to the judge at that stage to make a finding as to whether or not W was entitled to a full 50% share of the available assets.  On that basis, the case might have been adjourned for further settlement negotiations and, if those were not successful, a further listing for an adjudication in relation to computation and extraction.  He did not take that course but, instead, ruled on her entitlement to a full half share <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">and</span> provided for the manner in which, absent agreement, she was to receive value for her 50% share.  Despite his encouragement to the parties to settle the remaining differences between them, he provided a default mechanism for how she was to receive her award and that was in the form of two (or possibly three) lump sum payments.</p>

Mr Bishop and Mr Bradley seek to criticise the work of Ernst &amp; Young and Deloittes because of what they perceive to be the limited nature of their respective briefs.  In essence, what they have done, at one stage further into the valuation exercise, is to review the work undertaken by H and Kitano and conclude that the discounts applied appear to be within an acceptable, or reasonable, range.  I collect no assistance from the written reports prepared by H&#8217;s experts nor from their oral evidence as to what they consider to be an appropriate range or where within that range H&#8217;s assets fall.  In particular, I find no commentary on how the discounts which applied in 2013 are still appropriate in December 2014 when it appears to be accepted that there was a considerable downturn in the level of discounts applied to these types of investments over that period, as evidenced by the 2015 Cogent report.</span></p>

I have set them out earlier in this judgment and do not propose to rehearse them again in any detail for the purposes of my analysis of the expert evidence.  I bear in mind that there were some factual errors in Deloittes&#8217; report such as the transportation of one particular asset from the 2013 report to the 2015 updated report when it had, in fact, been sold during the intervening period.  I accept that the 2013 quotes for market value supplied by Citigroup appear to have been relied on for the purposes of the 2015 update when these quotes were out of date.  I accept, too, that there was no reference in Mr Tullis&#8217;s report to the updated 2015 Cogent report despite the fact that he had referred to the figures in the 2013 report.</p>

The work undertaken by Mr Tullis and Mr Gregory was essentially an overview by way of cross-check of the initial exercise performed by Kitano on H&#8217;s behalf.  Mr Bishop describes it as &#8220;a largely passive exercise&#8221;.  Mr Tullis and Mr Gregory were able to tell me that nothing had been brought to their attention which caused them to suggest to Kitano and/or H that their original figures in respect of discounts were wrong or required adjustment for the purposes of the second phase of this litigation.  They were unwilling to move from that position even when confronted with the fact that there had been a significant change in respect of an important element of the information which had informed and underpinned H&#8217;s 2013 presentation in relation to discounts.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">The exercise which Mr Bezant had performed was different.  He has reached his own conclusions in relation to the discounts to be applied to the private equity and venture capital assets.  He took as his starting point the body of work which H and Kitano had undertaken.  That had involved input from Deutsche, Neuberger Berman and, more significantly, Citigroup which had actually provided quotes in relation to the prices which they would be prepared to pay for the assets in the secondary market.  Those quotes were informed to a degree by both the Cogent and ELM reports.  Mr Bezant&#8217;s evidence was that this was a sound platform from which to perform the evaluation of discounts.  He then undertook an independent review of the source data in order to provide his updated conclusions to the court.  Having identified a clear downward trend in terms of the discounts on trading in the secondary hedge fund markets during the period from June 2013 to December 2014, Mr Bezant reflected those market conditions in his revised figures.  On the basis of what he considered to be the best available information at the time, he took the analysis performed by Cogent in relation to each separate class of assets<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="12">

It is said that he had not looked to alternative source materials by way of cross-check and he had not made allowances for dealing costs.  Mr Cusworth pointed to an instance where he had been inconsistent in his classification of two particular investments and had fallen into error in reclassifying another fund on the basis of information he had gleaned from a third party source.  He criticises Mr Bezant for using average discounts to update his presentation to the court.  He argues that if an investment can be shown to be performing at a level above or below average in 2012, it is wrong to assume average performance in 2014.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">In my judgment this latter criticism is slightly unfair to Mr Bezant.  He took as his starting point the most recent and relevant index (because it had informed H&#8217;s initial presentation); he differentiated between the various types of fund by strategy; and he applied the relevant (January 2015) Cogent figures to H&#8217;s 2013 presentation.  He told me during the course of his oral evidence that he was not able to &#8220;unpack&#8221; the larger and smaller deals which fell into each class but he was able to comment upon the fact that the end of 2014 was a very healthy and attractive environment in which to realise these types of investment.  As he told me, it is not what happens over the passage of time which matters.  Rather, it is the circumstances of the initial investment and the prevailing market conditions at the valuation date which are crucial.  In terms of choosing between the approaches adopted by the experts, it is difficult to reach a conclusion that this was an unreasonable approach for Mr Bezant to take.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">It is disappointing that the line of dialogue between the three experts in December 2014 was not more productive in terms of the areas in respect of which they felt able to agree, if only in relation to principles.  Neither Mr Tullis nor Mr Gregory was familiar with English court procedures or the manner in which expert evidence is received under Part 25 of FPR 2010.  Each expert has a duty to the court and not simply to the party instructing him.  That obligation is designed to facilitate a more inquisitorial rather than adversarial approach to these finely tuned issues of valuation.  Each of H&#8217;s experts said during the course of his evidence that he did not regard himself as under any obligation to share information with Mr Bezant.  I do not criticise them for that approach and I do not speculate on the reasons why they took that view.  However, I suspect it may well be that their professional experience of commercial litigation in the United States is somewhat different from the forum of an English matrimonial hearing and the nature of the task which  confronts me in determining the facts in that particular context.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">On balance, I found Mr Bezant&#8217;s evidence to be of greater assistance to me than that of Mr Tullis or Mr Morris.  I have reached that view because I am able to see from Mr Bezant&#8217;s written report (the Memorandum) and collect from his oral evidence the fundamental basis or rationale for the opinions he is expressing.  To the extent that he has adopted an asset by asset approach, I can discern the various factors and empirical data which he has relied on to shape his conclusions.  That holistic analysis is missing from the written evidence put before me by Ernst &amp; Young and Deloittes and the oral evidence of Mr Tullis and Mr Gregory did not address that lacuna.  In relation to the private equity and venture capital investments, in my judgment the approach which Mr Bezant adopted was an entirely reasonable one.  He took the baseline established by H/Kitano in 2013 and reflected in his conclusions as to present value the changes and market movements which had occurred during the period to December 2014. I cannot determine whether he was right or wrong to reclassify one of these investments but I can understand the basis of his approach and the manner in which he used the information in the updated Cogent report to revisit the 2013 figures.  I accept that this was relevant and reliable information and, to the extent that it was ignored altogether by Mr Tully and Mr Morris, I am inclined to place less reliance on their figures.  It was, after all, information which H himself considered to be highly germane to the calculation of his original discounts.  Mr Bezant did not have the advantage of updated information from Citigroup (the other evidential platform for H&#8217;s original presentation) but he has done the best he can by absorbing into his conclusions the updated Cogent material which is, for the purposes of our valuation date, about as up to date as it could possibly be.  Whilst his approach was criticised because of his use of average discounts to the various categories of investment held by H, I did not have the underlying evidential data which would have enabled me to test whether and, if so, the extent to which this was a material criticism.  I have no idea which (if any) assets were performing above or below par in terms of the general market trend identified in the reports to which I have been referred.  In the absence of this evidence (which neither of H&#8217;s experts referred to with any specificity in their reports), I have to go on what I do have.  The conclusion I have reached is that Mr Bezant&#8217;s approach is not unreasonable in all the circumstances and, in the main, it is the evidence which I find to be of most assistance in determining the appropriate level of discounts to be applied to H&#8217;s portfolio.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">For these reasons, and on the basis of Mr Bezant&#8217;s evidence, I do not accept that I should only apply discounts to those assets which H has demonstrated to be non-transferable.   Having accepted that Mr Bezant&#8217;s evidence has been of greater help to me than the expert evidence relied on by H, it is not for me to cherry-pick that evidence in terms of the clear position which Mr Bezant takes in relation to the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">applicability</span> of discounts.  W&#8217;s position in terms of the underlying rationale for ignoring her own expert&#8217;s view is that I have to look to the wider picture and H&#8217;s alleged intransigence over an in specie sharing.  Yet this leads me to a situation where she is asking me to disregard discounts where the expert evidence is that they should be applied.  Because of my interpretation of the exercise which Holman J intended for the purposes of this Phase II hearing (see paragraph 151), I take the view that, having rejected W&#8217;s primary case, it would be wholly artificial to take that course.  In seeking to calculate what further sums may be due to her, my task is to establish on the basis of the best evidence available what level of discount should be applied to the assets which H has retained in order to reach a fair market value of those assets.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">In relation to Lone Star (wherein lies the most significant area of disagreement between the three experts), I have reached the conclusion that Mr Bezant&#8217;s approach is a reasonable one but I depart from his opinion that I should ascribe no risk whatsoever to these funds.  Having listened carefully to all the evidence and submissions in relation to these funds, I have come to the conclusion that there ought to be some discount notwithstanding the fact that the intended distribution date is now only some four months away.  These are &#8220;tail end&#8221; funds; the main value in Lone Star has already been distributed and I accept that there may be some risk in the final winding up of the rump of these investments.  However, I do not accept that a discount for lack of marketability or liquidity is anywhere near as significant as that contended for by Deloittes and Ernst &amp; Young.  I accept, too, that any uplift in discount for the time value of money is more or less insignificant given the very low level of interest rates which are likely to prevail over the next four months.  I cannot simply speculate or travel along the continuum between 0% and 39.5%.  Because I regard Mr Bezant&#8217;s opinion in relation to discounts to be the best and most reliable evidence I have, I propose to adopt a discount of 10% in relation to the Lone Star funds.  That is the figure he told me he could accept as the maximum discount which could reasonably be applied to these funds although his personal view was that H would not in fact see a loss as great as 10% on the return of his funds.  By my calculation, that reduces the value of the Lone Star funds to $4,382,195 once a discount of $486,910 has been applied.</p>

On behalf of H, his experts seek to apply various different percentages ranging from 0.03% to 0.30%.  Mr Bezant takes as his baseline 0% discounts.  In terms of monetary value, the difference between them is only $19,589 (or 0.0017% of the dispute in relation to discounts).  In my judgment, fairness requires that there should be some discount to reflect the cost of liquidating the assets.  Since the number is so small, I propose to adopt H&#8217;s suggestion and split the difference.  The figure for discounts in respect of the marketable securities will therefore be $9,795 leaving a net value of $15,444,792.</p>

Mr Bezant accepts that quite substantial discounts are warranted in respect of at least four of these investments and, in this respect, his figures for those discounts coincide with those advanced by Ernst &amp; Young and Deloittes on behalf of H.  What separates the experts in respect of the lower end of the discount range is whether discounts should be applied now to those funds which returned 100% to H when they were sold.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">These discounts are in the range of 7%.  They reflect no more nor less than one factor which is the time value of money.  They do not reflect any risk to H in the period between when he made his redemption requests and the date on which the funds paid out.  H&#8217;s discounts have been calculated by assuming a 30% discount for marketability over a two year period.  This is based upon an assumption that the time value for money is 15% per annum.  Mr Morris has assumed a 6 month liquidation period and a 15% investment return.  Mr Bishop challenges this latter assumption on the basis that the time value of money is essentially the financial loss suffered by being kept out of funds to which you are entitled at an earlier date.  That investment return must be calculated on the basis of what would have been received for cash or an equivalent very low risk return.  That rate of return, given the low interest rate environment, could not properly be assessed at more than 0.25% or 0.5%.  Furthermore, he challenges Mr Morris&#8217;s use of a 6 month period to calculate the delay.  Since payment in respect of these funds would typically have been made within 30 days of the redemption date on the basis of a 10% withholding payable some 90 days thereafter, the risk to the investor is minimal particularly in circumstances where the hedge fund in question can reasonably be expected to honour the redemption notice, which is what in fact happened in relation to all the four funds in issue.</p>

I cannot look to the actual return received by H in order to conclude that Mr Bezant is right to apply a 0% discount to these four investments.  That is not what he has done.  He has based his view upon his consideration of the prevailing market trends at the end of 2014 in the period immediately before the redemption notices in respect of these funds were served.  I have rehearsed at some length what those market trends were and the low interest environment in which the assets were liquidated.  At that point in time, Mr Bezant regards the risk to have been negligible.  He said during the course of his oral evidence that he was not taking the impermissible step of using hindsight to justify his conclusions but, rather, he was using what we now know has happened to test the reliability of those independent conclusions as they stood at the relevant time.  I do not regard that as mere tautology.  In these circumstances, I propose to adopt a value for these funds which reflects Mr Bezant&#8217;s discounted value (a value agreed by Mr Tullis and Mr Morris all bar the four hedge funds which have been liquidated).  The discounted value will be taken as $60,018,986 on the basis that I accept that the additional discount of $3.72 million which H seeks to ascribe to these funds is unwarranted.</p>

It is agreed that Opus should be treated as a marketable commodity following its public offering in March 2014, but they disagree about H&#8217;s ability to liquidate his stock (which represents an 11% holding) other than in stages.  His holding has been valued at $13,851,624 which Mr Bishop points to as evidence of embedded value which militates against discounting.  H seeks to attribute a 3% discount to reflect the time it will take to cash in his investment.  Mr Bezant applies a 0% discount on the basis that his 11% stake will be relatively easy to place since Opus did not appear to have any significant liquidity problems as at the agreed valuation date.  He has also taken the view that it is legitimate to neutralise the discount by reflecting potential embedded value which would attract a premium to the quoted price.  </span></p>

The figure for the value of the horses which W was to receive is already factored in to the net value of the matrimonial estate as I have calculated it to be.  I suspect that the purpose of adding back the figure for her net discounted assets less liabilities was the methodology adopted for delivering full value in relation to the Phase I lump sums.  If it has a further relevance to the calculation of the sum due at the conclusion of this hearing, I was not told why.</p>

Adopting the methodology used by W&#8217;s solicitors in their open offer, she is due a further sum of just under $5.5 million.  Since the lump sums which H has already paid were calculated on the basis of a half share based on <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">his</span> discounted figures (which were the figures adopted by Holman J for the purposes of Phase I), he owes her one half of the balance on the basis of the true net value of the discounted matrimonial estate.  If either party wishes to make further submissions in relation to any other adjustments which may be required, I will consider them before settling the final figure which should appear in the Phase II order.  For present purposes, my provisional judgment is that the balancing sum due to W at the conclusion of the Phase II hearing is $5,421,842.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">By way of final cross-check, I stand back and ask myself whether this additional cash payment does, indeed represent a fair outcome for <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">both</span> parties.  In my judgment, it is an entirely fair result.  W is receiving the totality of her award in cash but that is the inevitable consequence of the decision which Holman J took when he provided the parties with a specific default mechanism for quantifying her entitlement in the absence of agreement as to an in specie division.  Because he had pre-ordained the manner in which she was to receive value in relation to the most substantial part of her claim and the specific sum which should be paid to her (the first and second tranches of the lump sum payments), it is not now open to me to deliver the in specie division which she sought.   In order to reflect fairness to <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">both</span> parties, the judge specifically provided that the door would be left open to W to investigate <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;whether the true and appropriate net worth of the husband should ignore the discounts for which he contends&#8221; </span>(paragraph 122 of Holman J&#8217;s judgment).  As I have already said, the reference by the judge to &#8220;true and appropriate&#8221; net values has to incorporate a consideration of whether all, some or none of his assets would properly have attracted appropriate discounts as at the agreed valuation date.  To ignore such discounts if they were properly applied to reduce his overall net wealth as at that date would be wholly unfair to H in calculating what sum represented 50% of that net wealth.  For reasons I have already given, I do not regard it fair to override these basic principles and proceed on the basis of assumed gross values simply to reflect what is, in essence, an allegation by W of litigation conduct on his part.  To the extent that he has overstated the appropriate level of discount, I have adjusted the position by means of an overall readjustment to the net asset base.  In my judgment, the additional lump sum which I have found to be due to W properly reflects her full half share.  It is an award which is fair to her and fair to H.  </p>
