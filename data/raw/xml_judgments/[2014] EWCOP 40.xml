For this reason, I always try to prepare LPAs for clients with as many safeguards in place as possible.</span></p>

However, I am not aware of any provision which provides that the remaining attorney is not entitled to still continue making those decisions which they were always permitted to make on a several basis. Further, the MCA is silent as to whether or not an attorney can be reappointed. It is my understanding of English law that statutes are prescriptive and that, when read in conjunction with the common law, a person is entitled to do something unless there is a statutory restriction providing otherwise. It would therefore be my understanding that, in the absence of a statutory restriction on the reappointment of an attorney, that there is no reason why a donor cannot do so.</span></p>

In the first instance, executors are obligated to act together, but on the death or incapacity of either one of them the survivor is entitled to continue to act, even in relation to decisions where they would otherwise have had to have acted jointly. Insofar as any substitutional appointment is concerned, the testator is at liberty to prescribe whether any one or more of the substitutionary executors is to replace a particular executor alone or any executor unable to act, and in which case creates a new joint appointments, or whether they are only to act in the event that the originally appointed executors are unable to act when the new executors will act alone or jointly depending how many of them are appointed. </span></p>

In this situation it is advisable to have a replacement attorney. The surviving original attorney(s) may act with the replacement attorney in making decisions which may be taken jointly and severally, but cannot continue to make decisions which were to be taken jointly. The replacement attorney will make those decisions.&#8221;</p>

When one of the events mentioned in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/13/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 13(6)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> occurred, which terminated the joint appointment, the joint and several appointment would come into operation and enable the surviving attorneys to continue to act.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">However, because of the design of section 4 of the prescribed form, I do not think it would be possible to achieve this by appointing A, B and C to act jointly and severally as replacement attorneys in the same instrument. Having already ticked the box to appoint the original attorneys to act jointly, there is no facility for the donor to state that the replacement attorneys shall act jointly and severally.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">In my view, the safest way of achieving the effect of joint attorneyship with survivorship would be for the donor to execute two LPAs: the first appointing the attorneys to act jointly, and the second appointing them to act jointly and severally with a condition that the second LPA will come into operation when the first LPA fails for any reason. The second LPA could also provide for the appointment of one or more replacement attorneys, if that is what the donor wishes.</p>

Similarly, if it had been the intention of Parliament that attorneys could be re-appointed in the manner suggested by Mr Satchell, it would have said so and it would have made provision to accomplish this. </p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Mr Satchell&#8217;s comparison with the appointment of executors was neither helpful nor relevant. The appointment of attorneys is governed by its own primary and secondary legislation and, in order to resolve this issue, we need look no further than the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> and the LPA, EPA and PG Regulations 2007 as amended by the 2009 regulations. </p>
