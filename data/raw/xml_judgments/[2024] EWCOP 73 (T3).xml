The application before me should have been made far sooner than the date upon which full term was reached and the birth was due. I understand that the applicants failed to take legal advice until the last moment. As a result, they did not follow the judgment of Keehan J in <span style="font-weight:bold">NHS Trust v FG [2014] EWCOP 30</span>, and in particular the annex thereto, which sets out in clear terms what is required of applicant Trusts in cases concerning obstetric care. Regrettably, almost none of the stipulated steps were taken, including making an application no later than 4 weeks before the due date. </p>

The court was placed in an extremely difficult position to try and arrange a listing. It came before me the next day, Friday 29 November 2024. Papers trickled in during the morning. There was no bundle. I had a flurry of last minute requests for legal representatives and clinicians to attend remotely. The Official Solicitor had not been notified of the application until the day before and had next to no information. She was not able to arrange for an agent to meet PQ. Counsel instructed on behalf of the Official Solicitor said candidly that the Official Solicitor could not advance a positive case. Counsel for the applicants invited the court to proceed to a full hearing, with oral evidence, to enable the CS, if approved, to take place at 4.30pm that day. All of this was, to put it mildly, unsatisfactory, as well as being unfair to the subject of these proceedings, PQ.</span></p>

By good fortune, the medical presentation which was thought to be so urgent on Friday 29 November 2024 (the risk of pre-eclampsia) dissipated over the weekend and the case, while still urgent, was not at the level of immediate and imperative necessity which it appeared to be. </p>

Failure to do so is likely to create the difficulties which faced me in this case, at a time when judicial resources are under enormous strain. As I have already said, failure to do so is unfair to the patient and likely to be contrary to their best interests. </span></p>

However, a urine sample on 27 November 2024 evidenced some protein. The mother&#8217;s blood pressure was elevated on 28 and 29 November 2024. Together, these signs were suggestive of pre-eclampsia which can lead to seizure or stroke, haemorrhage, and failure of organs. That was the position before me on Friday 29 November 2024, and was the principal reason advanced by the applicants for an urgent elective CS. Having decided to adjourn until Monday 2 December 2024 (the next working day), I gave various directions for updating information. </p>

In any event, the evidence satisfied me that she has been unable to weigh up the benefits and burdens of CS as against spontaneous labour. Were she fully able to do so, it is likely that she would wish to take reasonable medical steps to ensure the wellbeing of her baby in the safest way.</span></p>
