All four children were under the age of 5. The parents are &#8216;R&#8217;, (hereafter &#8216;the Mother&#8217;) and &#8216;T&#8217;, (hereafter &#8216;the Father'). In March 2019 Child 4 was taken by ambulance to a local hospital with a report that she had been suffering fits for an hour. It was rapidly established that Child 4 was seriously unwell and was treated on an emergency basis. It was the view of the treating team that her condition might well have been the result of a non-accidental injury, in the absence of any other explanation from her parents. </p>

An interim care order was made by HHJ Murden in respect of Child 4 and her three siblings on 28 March 2019. The case was initially allocated to HHJ Hayes QC and then reallocated it to me. I note at this point that the three older children have been placed throughout separately from Child 4. The first foster carer of the three children found that she could not cope with them, and they were moved to a second foster carer in early June. </p>

The LA argue that the children are likely to suffer future physical harm if they were to be placed in the care of a person(s) who are found to have inflicted the injuries. </p>

The LA accepted that if I did not find that either of the parents had inflicted the injuries then they would not pursue a care order. Equally, the parents&#8217; advocates accepted during the hearing, that if I found the parents had inflicted the injuries then they were not arguing that the children should return to the parents. The outstanding issue is whether if the LA&#8217;s case is made out, the children should go to live with a paternal aunt, who lives in a country in Europe, (&#8216;Country 2&#8217;) pursuant to a care order.

Dr Y, a paediatric consultant on the treating team, confirmed that in his view all the relevant tests had been carried out, and the care she had received was entirely appropriate. Mr Richards, whose expertise and experience I will set out below and who acted as in independent medical expert and reviewed the medical notes, gave evidence that all the treatment she received was in line with good clinical practice, and normal for the condition in which she presented. Once she had been stabilised Child 4 was transferred for a CT scan. This showed abnormalities around the brain which would account for the clinical presentation. There was no abnormality of the skull joints and no abnormal scalp swelling or skull fracture. A series of blood tests were performed which showed normal metabolic parameters, other than features associated with acute illness.  </p>

Mr Richards in his subsequent report said he could identify no abnormality and none has been noted or treated by the caring doctors.</p>

The LA considered the situation with the treating team at the hospital. Dr E sent an updated referral to the LA Children&#8217;s Services stating that based on the scan report, with no history of trauma, non-accidental injury is &#8220;much more likely&#8221;. A strategy meeting was held on 25 March and the view was taken that there were significant concerns about the older children being left in the care of the Father, given that he could be in the pool of perpetrators. The Mother was at this point staying in hospital with Child 4. the LA identified a family friend who could stay overnight and supervise the children, with the Father. The next day the friend had to go to work and the maternal grandmother agreed to stay. However, the LA visited and discovered that the children had been left in the sole charge of the Father. In those circumstances they decided to commence the care proceedings. </p>

They came to the UK in 2015. They initially lived with the Mother&#8217;s parents in what she describes as a very small house, and moved into their own flat in June 2018. This is a two bedroom flat; the Mother and Father slept in the living room/kitchen with Child 4 in a cradle; the two older girls slept in one bedroom and Child 3 in the other smaller bedroom. The Mother said the flat was not small, but the Father accepted that it was small for four children and two adults, he also accepted that it was possible to hear what was happening in one room in the rest of the flat.  I have no doubt that the living conditions were cramped, particularly given four such young children. The parents very recently moved out of the flat, in part due to rent arrears, and are now living with the maternal grandmother.  </p>

Although the Father did say that the Mother had some back problems during the pregnancy. Child 4 slept in a Moses basket next to the parents&#8217; bed. The parents said the daily routine was as follows. Child 4 would normally wake between 5-6am and one of the parents would feed her (Child 4 was always bottle fed). She would then go back to sleep and feed again at around 9am and then about every 3 hours. The Mother says that Child 4 was generally a quiet baby. She would be put down around 9pm and wake once in the night to feed. The pattern on the night of Saturday 23 March was somewhat different to this, but that factor alone carries little significance, as Child 4 was only 5 weeks old and patterns inevitably change somewhat.  </p>

There are significant inconsistences about key points in those statements which I will refer to below. Given that she had only given two fairly short written statements, and that they did not cover much of the detail that was essential to understanding her case, I encouraged her to give a full oral account in her evidence in chief. The Mother had changed her solicitors very close to the hearing, and Ms Praisoody had only been instructed shortly before the hearing. I was therefore very concerned to ensure that the Mother had every opportunity to tell the Court as full a version of events as possible. Ms Worsley and Mr Hutchinson did not object to her expanding her oral evidence in this way. I took the Mother through much of her evidence in chief, again so that I could be satisfied that there was nothing she wanted to say that she did not have a full opportunity to say, particularly as there was initially some confusion with Ms Praisoody over which precise days the Mother was describing. I was satisfied by the end of evidence in chief that the Mother had given as full and as clear an account as she wished to do. </p>

Child 4 was then put back in her cot. During their oral evidence both parents said that the maternal greatgrandmother had come round to the flat at around lunchtime for about an hour. However, there was no suggestion that she was alone with Child 4, or that she could have harmed her and at the time she was there Child 4 was behaving entirely normally, so there was no need to call her as a witness or consider that matter any further.  </p>

This is more than a little difficult to accept, as it is to accept that the other three children simply went to their two rooms, played and caused little or no trouble.

I note here that nobody in the parents&#8217; position could have failed to realise the importance of the parents&#8217; precise movements on the Saturday late afternoon and evening. The failure to refer in the statements to the fact the Father went out appears to me to be an important omission and one that cannot be explained either by a simple failure of recollection or not realising the importance of the matter.  The Father said that he had gone to the shop to buy a non-alcoholic drink and had been out for about one hour. He initially said that the shop was 15 minutes away, but then accepted it was only 4-5 minutes away. He said that he went to the shop and happened to meet a friend who he chatted to for a few minutes. I note here that it was difficult to work out how the Father could have been out for as long as an hour on his account of what had happened. He also said in cross examination that he could have been out for longer, but then a little later said that it was only an hour.  My strong impression was that the Father was not being truthful about how long he was out, and I simply cannot tell whether he did only go to the shop, or whether he was out for longer and went somewhere else. I note that if the Father had mentioned the friend in his statements, as opposed to in cross examination it might have been possible to get a statement from that friend. However, given that the precise time the Father was out would not ultimately help me in determining what happened to Child 4, there was no benefit in pursuing this course at such a late stage of proceedings, and no one suggested that I should do so.  </p>

There was hypoxic ischaemic injury (HII) where the brain itself is injured and this occurred in multiple locations. This occurs when the brain itself moves back and forth and the cells of the brain become damaged. There were subdural effusions where the linings on the surface of the brain had become torn. These multiple injuries to the brain and the multi-compartmental bleeds overly the brain can all be explained by a shaking injury.  </p>

However, he did emphasise that the video is short (about 45 seconds) and Child 4&#8217;s presentation is not particularly clear. He also said that once she had suffered this scale of injury to her brain he would not expect her to behave normally, and she would not be likely to suck milk normally, although some milk could go into her mouth.  He said that if the feeding was normal that is one of the clearest indicators that all was well with the baby at that point. He did suggest that her condition could well have deteriorated over time, so she could have suffered the injuries on the Saturday, but not shown the more severe symptoms until the next morning.

The second foster carer had described to Ms K the very difficult behaviour the children had been exhibiting when they moved to her. This included being violent to each other, biting and appearing to have very few clear boundaries. Apparently, the foster carer described the children as being &#8220;wild&#8221;.  The children seem to have now calmed down with the second foster placement, but the experience of the first foster carer, who Ms K had not spoken to, but the social worker had spoken to,  had described the children as being very difficult and having no boundaries. The Mother was quick to blame this behaviour on the foster carers and not to appreciate that it was the parents&#8217; conduct which must have led to this situation.  </p>

In particular, Ms K said that she thought it was very unusual for the Mother to have taken the video of Child 4 on the Saturday afternoon if she thought the baby was unwell, rather than just taking her to hospital. She also said that she found it concerning that the parents did not ring the emergency services first thing in the morning. The Mother had said this was because she did not speak English and did not want to wake her brother early, but Ms K said she found this concerning.  </p>

Built into the preponderance of probability standard is a generous degree of flexibility in respect of the seriousness of the allegation. Although the result is much the same, this does not mean that where a serious allegation is in issue the standard of proof required is higher. It means only that the inherent probability or improbability of an event is itself a matter to be taken into account when weighing the probabilities and deciding whether, on balance, an event occurred. The more improbable the event, the stronger must be the evidence that it did occur before, on the balance of probability, its occurrence will be established.</span>&#8221; </p>

It is this: in the criminal jurisdiction the &#8220;lie&#8221; is never taken, of itself, as direct proof of guilt. As is plain from the passage quoted from Lord Lane&#8217;s judgment in Lucas, where the relevant conditions are satisfied the lie is &#8220;capable of amounting to a corroboration&#8221;.

Therefore, the medical evidence all points clear and unequivocally in one direction. I fully accept that the authorities, in particular Re B, make clear that the court should not stop there, but must consider all the evidence. However, given the clear and unequivocal medical evidence, it does seem to me that I would have to find some unusual or unexplained factor, to depart from the unequivocal medical evidence in this case. </p>

Neither parent gave at all satisfactory evidence, and both made significantly inconsistent statements, both within their own evidence and between each other. Both parents were, in my judgment, evasive in their answers at key points. I take into account the fact that they were giving evidence through interpreters, and that can be a barrier to clear communication, but the interpreters were excellent, and it seemed to me that the Father in particular was deliberately avoiding or confusing questions that he did not want to answer. The Mother also avoided difficult questions, and had a notably hazy recollection of those parts of the critical evening that involved the Father, whilst having a much better one in respect of events concerning the children alone.

Their description of the children&#8217;s behaviour was not credible. The Father suggested that the three older children, including Child 3 who was aged 13 months, largely put themselves to bed with no trouble. The Father said he had no difficulties managing the children. These descriptions are not credible, but are made even less so when it is remembered that these are the same children who were described by both foster carers as being difficult to manage, and by the first foster carer as being &#8220;wild&#8221; and &#8220;violent&#8221; to each other.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.03in">The parents must have been under enormous strain, and this creates risk factors, which following the analysis in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re BR </span>sets the framework for the findings of fact. In particular I take into account the following factors. Firstly, the parents were under considerable financial strain, including rent arrears. Secondly, they had relatively little support with none of the children going to nursery or school and only limited help from the maternal grandmother, who seems to have had a difficult relationship with the father and sometimes the Mother. Thirdly, both parents themselves had a difficult childhood, although it is impossible to know how this impacted on their behaviour with the children. Fourthly, the Mother had had some health issues during the pregnancy with Child 4 and thereafter, having so many children in quick succession must have had some impact on her physical and mental wellbeing. Fifthly, there was potentially stress between the parents as evidenced by the domestic violence incident in 2017. Finally, and probably most importantly the parents must have been exhausted. This has perhaps been slightly underplayed in the case as a whole. Young children are exhausting, and these children and particularly the Mother had been cooped up in the flat for at least 2 days. The parents, on their own account, were feeding Child 4 at 11pm, Child 3 at 12pm, Child 4 at 2-3am and 5am, and Child 3 at 7 am. Even if one accepts that these were babies who woke drank their milk and went straight back to sleep (a somewhat unlikely proposition), that list of times shows how little sleep the parents must have been getting. It is not difficult for any parent to crack under the strain of looking after young children when they are tired. It would be surprising in my view if these parents were not at the &#8220;end of their tether.&#8221; </p>

It is not unusual for parents to want to diminish the stress they are under, but given the issue in this case, it seems probable that the parents are deliberately not being frank about whatever was going on in the flat, and the problems they were having. Given that they were the only witnesses of fact called it is not possible to determine precisely what was happening in the flat, but I do find that the parents were not being honest with me about conditions within the family home. </p>

I find it not credible that they could not have realised the importance of this fact, once they had been told the nature of Child 4&#8217;s injuries. Both parents sought to actively mislead the court in this respect by suggesting that the Father remained in the flat; or that the Mother wasn&#8217;t sure whether he was in the flat or not. It is now plain the Mother knew that he went out, and self-evidently the Father knew. I find that this was a deliberate lie, relating to a material issue, made out of fear of the truth. Therefore, applying <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Lucas</span>, albeit in a civil context, I can and do place reliance on that lie as an indicator of the parents&#8217; responsibility for Child 4&#8217;s injuries. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.03in">It now appears that the Father was out for at least an hour, but the circumstances in which he went out, what he did and when he came back, remain very unclear. The video probably, but not certainly, fixes a likely time for the injury. Mr Richards said that he thought Child 4 was not behaving normally in the video, for what it is worth that is also my view. However, I do note that Dr Y, who is a consultant paediatrician, put in his notes that he did not think the injury had occurred before the video was taken.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.03in">However, I do not need to make a determination on that issue, because whether the injury had or had not occurred by the time of the video, does not establish whether it was the Father or Mother who inflicted the injuries. It is possible that the Father shook the baby before he went out, and that is why he went out; or it is possible that the Mother shook her whilst the Father was out. The video does not ultimately help to resolve that issue and neither does the timing of the video. The police screenshot indicates it was taken at 20.10, which accords with what the Mother told the nurse. However, that would put the Father&#8217;s return about an hour later than he suggested. It is possible that the phone was set to GMT and not BST, which I know does sometimes happen, in which case the video was taken at 19.10. As I have said, the precise timing will not assist me to determine who injured Child 4, but the most likely time is 20.09 being the time the Mother told the nurse and very close to the time recorded on the phone.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.03in">The parents were also neither consistent about what happened when the Father got home. The Mother had said in her statement that she showed the Father the video and he had said not to worry the baby seemed fine. She then said that she was not sure he had seen it. The Father denied seeing it, and said he went to care for one of her daughters and did not watch it. If the Father&#8217;s story that he did not injure Child 4 and did not witness the Mother doing so is true, I find his statement that he did not watch the video very difficult to believe. He came back from being out and the Mother was sufficiently worried about the baby to take a video and want to show it to him. The baby was then undoubtedly unwell in the night, and I find it inexplicable in those circumstances that the Father would not watch the video.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.03in">I do not accept that the parents&#8217; recollection of events that evening is as poor as they are now making out. When they made their first statements it was within two weeks of the incident, and the Mother spoke to Dr Y on 26 March. Further, this was on any view an intensely memorable evening. It may be that the trauma of that evening and the next </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.03in">In relation to the 2am feed, again recollections seem very hazy. By the end of the hearing they both accepted that the Mother was sufficiently worried that she had suggested calling an ambulance, but that the Father said that Child 4 was alright and it was not necessary. The Mother in her police interview said she had no recollection of the 2am feed; in the record from the hospital nurse it is clear that she was concerned about the baby at 2am; in Dr Y&#8217;s notes the suggestion (though it is not 100% clear) is that the video was taken at 2am; in her evidence in chief she said the baby fed normally at 2am. The Mother seemed to have forgotten that Child 4 vomited and had to be changed, and according to the Father both parents changed her.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.03in">In relation to both 2am and 5am the Mother said that one reason she did not call an ambulance was the parents&#8217; poor English. I do not accept that this can be the real reason. The Mother had called the police in 2017 during the domestic violence incident and it seems could make herself understood. It is possible that the parents convinced themselves that Child 4 was not seriously unwell, but it seems highly probable that this was in whole or in part because they knew that one of them had injured her, and were worried about the consequences. In any event, the parents&#8217; descriptions indicate strongly that an ambulance should have been called much sooner, and the failure to do so was itself conduct that put Child 4 at great risk. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.03in">For all these reasons I find that all the threshold findings sought by the LA are made out. I am unable to determine on the balance of probabilities whether the Mother or Father is solely responsible for causing the injuries that Child 4 has suffered, I therefore find that both the Mother and Father are in the pool of perpetrators and that the parents have deliberately sought to mislead the professionals involved and the court. I want to emphasise that that does not mean that the parents do not very much love their children, and never meant to do Child 4 any harm. These types of injuries can, and often are, caused in a momentary loss of self-control. However, my findings do mean that the parents have put Child 4 at significant risk, and that she and her siblings remain at significant risk, certainly at the present time. I will deal with the consequences of those findings, and what happens next at the next hearing in January.  </p>
