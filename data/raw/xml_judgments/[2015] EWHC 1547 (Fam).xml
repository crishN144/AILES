DJ Reid approved their consent order on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2011. The order is quite complicated. I will set out only the most salient points. The husband was to pay the private medical insurance of the wife, for so long as there was a periodical payments order in her favour. The matrimonial home was to be transferred to the wife. The husband wished to be released from the mortgage. I understand that the wife borrowed approximately &#163;144,693 as an additional sum from her parents, in order to enable her to deal with this, as well as taking a mortgage herself of &#163;189,000.</p>

He was also to pay her 20% of his annual bonus, for the benefit of the children. That was to be reduced to 15% after SD became an adult. The husband was also to pay ED&#8217;s school fees and a further 25% of his annual bonus to the wife as a contribution towards SD&#8217;s school fees.</p>

On 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2013, the husband applied to vary the periodical payments. He sought relief from the spousal periodical payments, which he asked to be reduced to nominal, and for the wife to pay SD&#8217;s school fees in their entirety. It appears that there had been a reduction in the quantum of his bonus. However, his basic salary had increased by &#163;30,000 to &#163;115,000 per year. It is said that it has increased further since.</p>

The hearing took two days. She heard oral evidence from both parties and reserved judgment. I have already indicated the inconsistency in relation to the date of the order. The order itself provided that, on the basis that the husband agreed to pay 50% of any extras for both girls, the spousal maintenance was to cease forthwith. There was to be a clean break. The arrangements for SD were to continue as per the original order. If she obtained a scholarship, the husband would continue to make the payments as per the order of DJ Reid. I understand that SD has not obtained such a scholarship.</p>

There followed a number of emails between the Deputy District Judge and the two counsel then instructed. These were commenced because counsel for the wife indicated an intention to appeal and said that there was no proper analysis of the respective financial positions in the draft judgment. As a result, the Deputy District Judge made some amendments to the draft.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst it may be that there is some force in those complaints, I have decided to confine my consideration to the merits of the appeal itself. I accept Mr Horton&#8217;s submission that the appeal is from the order, not the judgment (see the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Vaughan v Vaughan</span> [2007] EWCA 1085; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 1 FLR 1108" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 1 FLR 1108</ref>). However, I also consider that on this appeal the wife must now have the opportunity to respond to anything that was put forward in the husband&#8217;s further submissions to the Deputy District Judge.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I have indicated, the reviewed judgment was produced on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2014. The Deputy District Judge recited that the husband had told her that he had brought the case back because he did not think the court order was fair. She found that the wife did earn &#163;40,000 gross in 2013, but that this was not the position now. She also found that the husband had completely overlooked the wife&#8217;s childcare responsibilities and the impact of the Jackson reforms on the area of work in which she specialises, namely personal injury. The Deputy District Judge, therefore, did not accept that the wife could earn &#163;40,000 per annum. It is quite clear that the Judge accepted the wife&#8217;s earnings disclosed as being her earning capacity.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do accept that housing has to be factored in. The wife has a mortgage on the matrimonial home. It appears to cost her some &#163;490 per month on an interest only basis. The husband and his second wife are entitled to a home of their own. Mr Horton suggested a &#163;600,000 mortgage. He postulated that this would cost around &#163;40,000 per annum, on a repayment basis at 3.5% interest. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, I have to compare like with like. If the wife&#8217;s mortgage is considered as interest only, so must the husband&#8217;s.  On that basis, I calculate the payments would be &#163;21,000 per annum. I accept that his second wife should be making a contribution. If it was equal, it would be &#163;10,500 per annum, which would mean that the husband&#8217;s net income would reduce to &#163;56,988 and the wife&#8217;s, on the basis of her mortgage, to &#163;23,802. Again, the disparity is significant and cannot be right.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have carefully considered Mr Horton&#8217;s list of outgoings for the wife. I consider that some are simply not generous enough. However, in total, they come to &#163;51,269, as against an income of &#163;45,088. She is, therefore, &#163;6,181 short on Mr Horton&#8217;s figures. If the husband is ordered to pay the school fees for both children, he will have to find a further &#163;7,732. This will just restore the wife to credit, ignoring the fact that I consider some of her outgoings understated by Mr Horton. If the husband is ordered to pay the entire school fees for both children, I calculate that he will be left with &#163;59,756 for himself and the children, when they are with him, as against &#163;37,414 for the wife.</p>

The order was made in 2011. The husband&#8217;s net income at that time was &#163;104,057. It is now &#163;106,763. Why should he, therefore, be relieved of the burden of paying the wife &#163;6,000 per annum in those circumstances, particularly when her income has fallen during that period, unless he is to take on the balance of SD&#8217;s school fees as a <span style="font-style:italic">quid pro quo</span>?</p>

It appears that there are significant extras, both on the bill and off the bill. I have come to the conclusion that the best way to do this fairly is to require the wife to pay the extras off the bill and the husband to pay those on the bill. I entirely accept Mr Horton&#8217;s submission that they should not be more than &#163;500 in one go, unless the husband agrees in advance. I have in mind, for example, a skiing trip, which would probably exceed &#163;500.</p>

It is impossible to operate a crystal ball and be able to determine what may possibly happen at some point in the next eight or so years.

She had an earning capacity of &#163;40,000 per annum, which I accept in that case was higher than that of her husband, whose earning capacity was only &#163;27,000 per annum. The safety net argument did not cut any ice with Mostyn J. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on the basis that it could not be said that Mostyn J was plainly wrong.</p>

Some judges would have retained the nominal order. She did not. The fact that I have found her to have erred elsewhere does not, in my view, undermine everything in her judgment. Rule 30.11 permits me to set aside or vary the order below, so it must be possible to part allow an appeal, but leave other provisions intact.</p>

This Deputy District Judge did exactly that. I cannot find that she was outside the band of possible decisions when she came to that conclusion.
