	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The question I have to determine is whether the arrangement made for the care of the First Respondent, KW ("Katherine"), in her own home, by the Applicant, Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council ("Rochdale"), amounts to a deprivation of liberty within the terms of Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights 1950, which is incorporated domestically by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref>. That arrangement is approved by me pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/15" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 15</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> ("MCA"). If it does amount to a deprivation of liberty then my order will have to provide for periodic reviews by this court. Such reviews plainly have significant resource implications for this hard pressed local authority. Every pound spent on such reviews is a pound less for other vitally necessary projects.</p>

She is severely mentally incapacitated, to use the new language of the MCA; she is of "unsound mind" to use the old language of Article 5. She suffered brain damage while undergoing surgery to correct arteriovenous malformation in 1996<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		  <p class="FootnoteText"> 1998 and 2000 have also been mentioned in the papers as the year for this unhappy event. The differences are immaterial.</p>
		</authorialNote>, when aged only 34. This resulted in a subarachnoid haemorrhage and long term brain damage. She was left with cognitive and mental health problems, epilepsy and physical disability. She was discharged from hospital into a rehabilitation unit and thence to her own home, a bungalow in Middleton, with 24/7 support.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In April 2013 Katherine was admitted to hospital. Her mental health had declined. In May 2013 she was transferred to a psychiatric ward, and later to another hospital. On 28 June 2013 she was discharged and transferred to a care home where she stayed until 14 April 2014, when she returned home. For appreciable periods between 28 June 2013 and 14 April 2014 Katherine's confinement to the care home was not authorised under the terms of the MCA. On 26 June 2014 Katherine, acting by her litigation friend, made a claim for damages under Articles 5 and 8 of the Convention. On any view she had suffered an unlawful deprivation of liberty during those periods when her confinement was not authorised under the MCA. Her claim has been settled with modest compensation and a written apology. I approve the terms of the settlement. </p>

She believes it is 1996 and that she is living at her old home with her three small children (who are now all adult). Her delusions are very powerful and she has a tendency to try to wander off in order to find her small children.  Her present home is held under a tenancy from a Housing Association. The arrangement entails the presence of carers 24/7. They attend to her every need in an effort to make her life as normal as possible. If she tries to wander off she will be brought back. The weekly cost of the arrangement is &#163;1,468.04. Of this &#163;932.52 is paid by Rochdale and &#163;535.52 by the local NHS Clinical Commissioning Group ("CCG").  </p>

Mr Simon Burrows, representing Rochdale, is constrained to concur. Notwithstanding their excellent arguments, and with great respect, I do not agree. I find it impossible to conceive that the best interests arrangement for Katherine, <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">in her own home</span>, provided by an independent contractor, but devised and paid for by Rochdale and CCG, amounts to a deprivation of liberty within Article 5.  If her family had money and had devised and paid for the very same arrangement this could not be a situation of deprivation of liberty. But because they are devised and paid for by organs of the state they are said so to be, and the whole panoply of authorisation and review required by Article 5 (and its explications) is brought into play. In my opinion this is arbitrary, arguably irrational, and a league away from the intentions of the framers of the Convention.</p>

It seems obvious, at least to me, particularly having regard to the first class of case, that the framers plainly had in mind detention of such persons in a state institution such as a secure hospital, asylum or prison. It is noteworthy that in not one of the cases from the Strasbourg court since the advent of the Convention has it ever been suggested that lawful detention could happen in such a person's own home.</p>

It is surely relevant, however, to understand the historical and social context in which Article 5 came to be promulgated. Europe was still reeling from the bestial abuses perpetrated by Nazi Germany and its allies. With the onset of the Cold War the spectre of the gulags was very real. The Convention as a whole, and Article 5 in particular, was devised as a bulwark against the repetition of those lawless abuses. To my mind, Article 5, as originally devised and intended by its framers, has absolutely nothing to do with the best interests care regime which Katherine enjoys in her own home.</p>

Secondly, liberty of tastes and pursuits. And thirdly, liberty of combination among individuals. Each of these components requires a positive and reasoned intellectual function which is hard to ascribe to a person of unsound mind, which is why Mill qualified his doctrine as applying only to those human beings in the "maturity of their faculties." </span></p>

She communicated with difficulty and had limited understanding, spending much of her time listening to music on her iPod. She needed help crossing the road because she was unaware of danger.  She was living with a foster mother with whom she had been placed when she was removed from home. She was devoted to her foster mother (whom she regarded as her "mummy"). Her foster mother provided her with intensive support in most aspects of daily living. She had never attempted to leave the home by herself and showed no wish to do so, but if she did, the foster mother would restrain her. She attended a further education unit daily during term time and was taken on trips and holidays by her foster mother. She was not on any medication.</p>

With that sentiment I naturally wholeheartedly agree. Discrimination is found where like cases are not treated alike.  However, when making Lord Kerr's comparison you do not have two like cases. You are comparing, on the one hand, a case where an 18 year old does not need protection and, on the other, a case where the 18 year old does. They are fundamentally dissimilar. The dissimilarity justifies differential treatment in the nature of protective measures. For me, it is simply impossible to see how such protective measures can linguistically be characterised as a "deprivation of liberty". The protected person is, as Mill says, merely "<span style="font-family:'Nimbus Sans L'">in a state to require being taken care of by others, [and] must be protected against their own actions as well as against external injury". And nothing more than that. In fact it seems to me to be an </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Nimbus Sans L'">implementation</span><span style="font-family:'Nimbus Sans L'"> of the right to security found in Article 5.</span></p>

She had never attempted to leave the home by herself and showed no wish to do so, but if she did, the foster mother would restrain her. So this was a proleptic rather than an actual constraint. The only actual constraint imposed on her was assistance in crossing the road. But for Lord Kerr "liberty means the state or condition of being free from external constraint". Because a "normal" 18 year old could cross the road unaided, and because a "normal" 18 year old was free to leave her family home whenever she wanted, MIG was not free from external constraint and was therefore in a situation of deprivation of liberty within the terms of Article 5. </p>

On the other hand section 47(1) of the MCA provides that "the [Court of Protection] has in connection with its jurisdiction the same powers, rights, privileges and authority as the High Court."

This allows a transfer to be made where the court "considers that in all the circumstances, it is just and convenient to transfer the proceedings." It is very odd that there appears to be no equivalent power to permit proceedings relating to adults to be transferred from the Court of Protection to the High Court, where, for example, the High Court is already exercising inherent or statutory powers in relation to the protected person.
