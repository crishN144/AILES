	    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:11pt">This hearing arose in the context of an application dated 6 August 2022 for a variation to a statutory will made in 2008 on behalf of P (&#8216;current statutory will&#8217;).  The application was made by his deputy, who is also his brother. P is represented by the Official Solicitor (OS), as his litigation friend.  The parties are agreed that there is no dispute as to the substantive terms of the proposed statutory will and that it is in P&#8217;s best interests (&#8216;new will&#8217;).  The OS made suggested amendments to the new will which have been accepted by the deputy.  </span></p>

The background will be set out below.  This judgment also does not concern the investment strategy adopted by the deputy or any other issues around the management of P&#8217;s funds. </span></p>

The deputy seeks to dispense with the notice requirements on largely pragmatic grounds, but has made no application for that purpose.  This hearing was requested by the OS.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:11pt">The dispute centres, in particular, on the residuary bequest made to unidentified charities (&#8216;charity&#8217;).  In summary, the OS&#8217;s position is that the changes agreed mean that charity is adversely affected so that the Attorney-General (A-G) must be served to allow representations to be made, as appropriate, in relation to those charitable interests.  This is a matter of procedural fairness and mandatory procedural requirements set out in the Rules cannot be ignored.  </span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:11pt">The deputy argues that the charities are not identified, there may be nothing left in the estate by way of residue to satisfy the charitable bequest at the time of P&#8217;s death in view of the fact that the estate is diminishing (see below). Further, the cost of notification would in those circumstances be disproportionate.  He raises also an issue an issue of trust in him as the brother and longstanding deputy of P submitting that to require notification would be a paternalistic act on the part of the court.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:11pt">In relation to the carers, the parties reach a common position by different routes.  In essence the position is that there is a compelling reason to dispense with notification to the carers because, inter alia, it is in P&#8217;s best interests not to take any steps likely to disrupt his care. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:11pt">P&#8217;s estate is presently worth in the region of &#163;12 million which includes his home.   The evidence supporting the application is not in dispute. It forms the backdrop to the application to vary the current statutory will which is that a combination of the economy and an increase in P&#8217;s living and care needs mean there is now a substantial shortfall between income from investments, and expenditure on P&#8217;s living and care arrangements. This shortfall is in the region of &#163;250K per annum.  </span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:11pt">The shortfall is estimated to increase year on year because it will have to be met by progressively liquidating capital, and as the bulk of his income is generated from investments, P&#8217;s assets will be exhausted by the time he is 88 years old.  Evidence from JM Finn, which manages P&#8217;s portfolio of investments indicates that his liquid assets will fall below &#163;2 million in the next 10 years so that by the time he is 80 it will be reduced to approximately &#163;1.4 million, and even if some growth is assumed, his liquid assets will be exhausted by time he reaches 84.  </span></p>

It provided for the creation of a discretionary trust for a period of 2 years less one day, of &#163;1million plus his home (&#163;600K) and chattels, in favour of four categories of beneficiaries including carers, and for a residuary gift to be held on charitable trusts.  The trustees have power to benefit any charity but there is particular reference in the schedule to the current will to charities for the relief of those suffering from mental impairment.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:11pt">Alternatively, the applicant agrees with the OS that it is right to avoid discord between carers.  There is one main carer who has been with P for about 25 years and also several others who potentially stand to benefit.  It would be wrong to have one carer representing the class of carers. It is agreed that notification gives rise to a risk of conflict between carers that potentially impacts on P&#8217;s care and this would not be in his best interests.  In these circumstances, there is reason to dispense with notification to the carers. </span></p>

P&#8217;s estate should not have to bear the costs of representation by the A-G.   Further by reference to Civil Procedure Rules (&#8220;CPR&#8221;) 19, that such joinder would be premature as the parties are not in contentious litigation. It is argued that this course would also be &#8216;heavy handed&#8217; at this stage.   Reference was also made to P&#8217;s best interests being to maintain his welfare needs while he is still alive rather than assuring the interests of those who will survive and charities that might hypothetically benefit under the will.  It would not be in JH&#8217;s best interests to join the A-G. The court is invited to take a &#8216;pragmatic&#8217; approach to the notice provision in PD9E with regard to the A-G.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:11pt">In relation to carers PD9E applies and requires service not only on those likely to be adversely affected but those &#8216;likely&#8217; to be &#8216;materially&#8217; affected.   The use of &#8216;materially&#8217; marks it out as different and separate to &#8216;adversely&#8217;. It could connote a significant change in the nature of the property demised, or an increase in benefit i.e an advantage.  One way or other a discretionary beneficiary will be likely to be materially affected by the alteration of the size of the fund, whether it means they are more likely to receive something, or that they are likely to receive more.  The possibility of a reduction of the estate to &#163;600K at the date of death is not relevant to this where the question is one of &#8216;likely to be materially affected&#8217; which recognises that circumstances may change. CPR 19 can be properly applied to an application for a statutory will to ensure that a class of potential beneficiaries is represented before the court.

I accept for the reasons given by the OS that this means they are likely to be materially affected by the changes so that the notification obligation arises.  I cannot see that there is a cogent rationale for construing &#8216;materially&#8217; as being negative in nature when &#8216;adversely&#8217; is also a negative concept.  </span></p>

The applicant did not dispute that any residuary beneficiary is likely to be adversely affected by the proposed changes to the statutory will.  Case law demonstrates the applicability of PD 9E to charities and not just to individuals and its terms do not indicate any such restriction.  I have already noted that the fact that there are no identified charities in the will is not an unusual mechanism by which testators leave charitable bequests.  </span></p>

The requirements of procedural fairness whether underpinned by the ECHR or the principles of natural justice must be given high regard.   The rhetorical question posed by the applicant, and the objection that the hypothetical nature of charity makes notification otiose misses the point that the court is seized with the matter now and once the statutory will takes effect the Court of Protection will no longer have jurisdiction in relation to it.  This also means that notification now is not premature. </span></p>

There is an identified and practical mechanism for achieving the same via the A-G. The fact that to date case law to date has dealt only with identifiable beneficiaries does not preclude this conclusion.  </span></p>

The A-G may or may not make representations on the proposed changes but must be given the opportunity to do so.  This also highlights, in my view, the protective nature of paragraph 9 PD 9E to proposed beneficiaries.  As a matter of fairness it is does not elevate the interests of beneficiaries above those of P.  </span></p>

However, in the circumstances I find that the balance is in favour of notification due to the current size of the estate, and the potential significant adverse effect on charity of the proposed changes.  It is far better that the will is dealt with on a proper footing as envisaged by the Rules.  There is no prejudice to P in taking this approach.  I do not find notification to the A-G to be disproportionate.  </span></p>
