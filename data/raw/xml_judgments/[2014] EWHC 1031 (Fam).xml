There can be little doubt they love him and are totally devoted to him.

Despite the differences between them they have maintained a working relationship which is clearly in EF&#8217;s best interests and respected each others&#8217; position.

If a child&#8217;s life can only be sustained at the cost of significant pain and distress it may not be in their best interests to receive such treatments e.g. use of invasive ventilation in severe neuromuscular disease. It is important that all options to relieve or overcome the negative effects of treatment are explored before proposing that it should be limited. However if such treatment can only be delivered at the expense of compromising the child&#8217;s consciousness, e.g. by deep sedation, its potential benefit may be significantly reduced. Other examples of particularly burdensome treatments include ECMO, renal dialysis and, sometimes intensive chemotherapy.&#8221;</span></p>

Whilst on the ward he required frequent intervention to assist him with his breathing. When he arrived on PICU he was being hand ventilated (bagged), he was placed on a ventilator on a setting which breathes for the patient. This was changed on 13 March to CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) which just supports EF&#8217;s own breathing, but does not given him any additional breaths should he stop breathing.

He requires almost constant care, and has a 1:1 nurse allocated to him all the time. He is swaddled most of the time to make sure he does not try and pull out the tube. As well as basic hygiene care he requires pressure care to prevent him getting pressure sores, but he dislikes being placed on his right side and will cry. He has a full wash 1 &#8211; 2 times a day and is suctioned round his mouth and nose when required. He can&#8217;t be taken out of his cot.

They have noted his desaturation and apnoea attacks have increased and are more prolonged. They describe isolated incidents of smiling, but otherwise report that EF does not respond purposefully to the care they administer. For example, when shining a torch into EF&#8217;s eyes to check pupil size and reaction, he did not show normal signs of flinching and turning away or try and reach out to grab the torch.</span></p>

The most recent was in February. The sleep studies show a patient&#8217;s respiratory patterns and, in particular, how well those patterns are maintained. The results of those studies have demonstrated that he is suffering from central sleep disordered breathing. This means that his control of his respiratory muscles is compromised, as opposed to him suffering from a problem associated with an obstruction or primary lung disorder. He was clear in his written and oral evidence that an infection would not affect his central control of breathing; the primary problem was central control of these functions from the brain. </span></p>

They have shown a widespread motor neurone abnormality within his swallow and peripheral muscles, including loss of nerve fibres supplying the tongue. This trend he concludes demonstrates that with time EF will not only have increasing difficulty moving, but also breathing. Were EF provided with respiratory and cardiac support on an indefinite basis (which may increase the length of his life), he is likely ultimately to lose all movement, including the ability to form facial expressions.</span></p>

EF has undergone 4 EEGs. The first in March 2013 was normal, the second in June 2013 showed minor abnormalities, the third in November showed sharpened discharges which were more suggestive of an evolving epileptic disorder. The fourth in February this year showed clear evidence of background abnormalities with increased epileptiform components. There is no evidence of clinical seizures, but the overall appearance of the EEG was abnormal. These changes he says show evidence of evolutionary changes within EF&#8217;s central brain processes. The most recent one showed electrical abnormalities which if the process continues will result in seizures, which will have an adverse effect on cognitive functioning.</span></p>

EF is suffering from increasing episodes of bradycardia which are not always associated with his apnoeas. This suggests there is a disease process which is affecting his heart. The extensive cardiac investigations have resulted in a diagnosis of sick sinus syndrome, this is a description which indicates dysfunction of the intrinsic control of the heart. The recent EEGs have revealed frequent drops in his heart rate.  He said this is caused by the reduction in EF&#8217;s ability to maintain his heart rate, which is under electrical control.</span></p>

I do not think that this in isolation would be sufficient to determine that EF has a progressive neurological disorder, because EEGs in any individual can vary from one day to the next, and because I did not see described abnormalities that would categorically place this in  the domain of a degenerative disorder. Similarly although EF&#8217;s EMGs which measure muscle electrical activity appear to have indicated progressive abnormality of motor nerve cells, this alone would be insufficient to categorically determine that EF has a neurodegenerative disorder in my opinion. Taken together with the clinical impression that EF has worsening apnoeas and bradycardias, the changes in EEG and EMG over time certainly support the impression of his clinicians that he has a progressive disorder. EF&#8217;s condition is serious, he is unable to breathe consistently adequately, and therefore has needed recurrent ventilation. The episodes of bradycardia are further cause for concern as such episodes can sometimes precede cardiac arrest, and if the bradycardias are indicative of a neurological disorder the possibility that this may ultimately progress to cardiac arrest has to be viewed as a reasonable likelihood. I do not think EF has a curable neurological disorder.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> She deferred to Dr V as the treating neurologist regarding any deterioration in EF&#8217;s condition, as he would have seen EF over a longer period of time.</span></p>

To re-insert the tube it is necessary to place a metal blade at the back of the mouth to enable them to visualise the relevant area, prior to putting the tube in. Intubation is a very painful process; it has recently been described by a 15 year old on their ward as akin to having a sword thrust into his chest. The same boy described suctioning as feeling like he was being suffocated. Whilst Dr W accepts EF is not able to express his own views due to his age, he said that description gave an indication of what the procedure feels like which in his opinion, bearing in mind EF&#8217;s underlying neurological condition, would not be in his best interests.</span></p>

He said the bag used is larger than an oxygen mask and needs to cover the mouth and nose and as far as possible seal in the air being delivered. With a young child such as EF it often covers the eyes as well. He would need to be held in a position that ensures his airways are as clear as possible, pressure would need to be placed on the mask as it is put and secured on EF&#8217;s face. He said most patients, if they have sufficient cognitive ability, will react by trying to remove the mask, which is indicative of how it feels. A tube goes to the back of the mouth and then air is delivered. There are risks of aspiration involved in this procedure. That is air going into the stomach which can produce an immediate response, particularly if there is food in the stomach. This can increase the chance of vomiting which for EF could have serious consequences. He said this was not a benign process, could be distressing and increase the risk of bradycardia. He said bagging is not used for protracted periods of time. It is often used as a prelude to intubation and part of resuscitation.</span></p>

They feel that any deterioration has been related to periods of time when EF has had infections, which has distorted the picture and do not provide a secure basis to make such fundamental decisions regarding EF&#8217;s future care. It is clear EF&#8217;s mother spends a lot of time caring for EF, when he was on the ward she stayed with him and whilst she is unable to stay on the PICU, the family are given 24 hour access. I was able to see four video clips of EF; three when he was on the ward, one in January, the second in February and the third just prior to his admission to PICU. The most recent one was two days ago. The one in February, in particular, shows EF listening to his mother&#8217;s voice, fixing her with his eyes and on occasion smiling in response to what she was doing. He was able to move his arms to the mid line and appeared to lightly grip her hand. The other videos show more limited responses. The parents feel the hospital has given up on EF.</span></p>

After that they accept EF should not be further intubated. This is based on their previous experiences of EF being extubated. On three occasions he has had to be reintubated within 24 hours of extubation. They said this has been in the context of occasions where he has been intubated for relatively extended periods. Where he has been intubated for only a few days his extubation has been more successful. He feels EF is sensitive to sedation, his reaction to it is not normal and that needs to be accounted for in the 24 hour period after extubation.</span></p>

The overall picture as described by Dr V is that the deterioration they have noted when comparing the various investigations undertaken over the last 14 months and the particular features of the changes is that, when looked at all together, they would not be affected by viral or bacterial infection. Dr V was clear, for example, that the decline in the central control of EF&#8217;s lungs and muscles was caused by difficulties in the central control from the brain and that would be unrelated to any infection. Dr V&#8217;s evidence taken together with the evidence of Dr W about the clinical investigations regarding infection support the conclusion that EF&#8217;s recorded deterioration is likely to be unrelated to infection and is more likely to be due to his underlying degenerative neurological condition.</span></p>

Whilst he has some limited quality of life now the fact is the burden of either method of artificial ventilation long term will, in my judgment, result in any benefits of that treatment, including the possibility of prolonging life, being far outweighed by the burdens. Thereby the strong presumption in favour of prolonging life is rebutted.</span></p>

The descriptions given by Dr W of the distress and pain that EF is likely to feel during the procedures involved in reintubation would not be in EF&#8217;s best interests as it is unlikely to prolong life significantly in the context of EF&#8217;s overall neurological condition. In addition, his quality of life when he is intubated is very poor. For example, he can&#8217;t leave his bed, will be sedated, will be at risk of pressure sores.</span></p>

Mr Hockton makes the powerful point in his submissions that based on the parent&#8217;s past experience of reintubation following extubation the potential value of it prolonging EF&#8217;s life, albeit for a limited duration, affording him and his parents spending more time together tips the balance in favour of the burdens of such a procedure on a time limited basis being in EF&#8217;s best interests.</span></p>

I have to look at the position of EF now. His life expectancy is limited and his decline is tragically inevitable and imminent. No further treatment can be offered to him. He is cognitively intact as far as the doctors are able to tell. Whilst he is still able to experience emotion, to make associations (for example recognising his parents) he is also likely to experience fear, pain and sadness. The burdens of reintubation both in terms of the actual procedure and the loss of quality of life, even once in the first 24 hours, are not in EF&#8217;s best interests. The potential value of possibly prolonging his life for even a short period of time is outweighed by the distress that is likely to be caused to him by undergoing such a procedure.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Long term the same applies in relation to bagging. Although it is a less invasive procedure than intubation, for the reasons outlined by Dr W it is still likely to be distressing, frightening and painful for EF. It also carries the risk of aspiration which can result in vomiting. This would be risky for EF as it may result in further respiratory distress and cardiac arrest. These burdens long term outweigh the benefits of such treatment, which is unlikely to prolong life significantly due to the underlying medical condition. Also, long term it will be a procedure that is difficult to clinically manage without the option of moving onto to a ventilator. The more it is used, the more it will increase the distress for EF and increase the risks involved in the procedure, in particular aspiration.</span></p>

This is based on the experience of the parents of previous extubations and respiratory difficulties EF has experienced within the first 24 hour period. Whilst bagging is invasive and carries risks it is less invasive than reintubation.  The question is does that tip the balance the other way for that short time limited period?</span></p>
