	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 6-10 March 2023, I heard a final hearing of the local authority&#8217;s application for care orders for SH, SA, SI and A and care and placement orders for A.  The case came before me in week 90.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother, S, was unrepresented by choice at the time and she was not in attendance on days 1 to 4 of the hearing or for judgment on day 5.  Again, by choice, despite clearly wishing to challenge all the evidence.  I note she also failed at the time to attend the advocates&#8217; meeting.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I note from my judgment in those proceedings that I had read all the bundle, which consisted of 1,440 pages, including Mother&#8217;s response to the guardian&#8217;s report and a letter dated 2 March 2023 which she had written, setting out the reasons why she did not intend to attend the final hearing.  I noted that the mother&#8217;s engagement with professionals within those proceedings had been limited and her compliance with court orders somewhat patchy.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There was a negative PAMS assessment of her for which she lodged a part 25 application for an independent social work assessment which was refused.  I note that a ground rules hearing took place on 25 October 2022 in relation to her in respect of her participation at the final hearing in accordance with the cognitive functioning assessment as provided for within those proceedings, more particularly paragraphs 17 and 18 of that assessment, and more particularly the use of simplified language and breaks, given her general difficulties in learning.</p>

	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the outset of the proceedings, the local authority proposed placing the mother and children in a residential unit in order to assess how she was able to manage the children as a sibling group and impose routines and boundaries.  However, whilst initially agreeing to this, the mother subsequently retracted her agreement and at a hearing on 15 July 2021 the children were removed from her care.  In March 2022, Mother stopped contact with the children in reaction to the local authority&#8217;s proposed reduction in family time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The threshold document for the purposes of the care proceedings before me relied upon the mother&#8217;s long-standing substance and alcohol misuse, neglect, domestic abuse and chaotic lifestyle.  The Mother did not accept that the threshold was crossed.  The children&#8217;s guardian supported the local authority&#8217;s application, a key issue being Mother&#8217;s inability to accept responsibility, her tendency to blame others and her lack of engagement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On day 1 of the final hearing before me, (I had no prior involvement in this case until then) I refused Mother&#8217;s application to adjourn for the reasons set out in my written judgment at pages 38 to 71 of the bundle  The outcome of this was notified to the mother and although no formal permission was sought to appeal this decision, she indicated to the court that her intention not to attend remained steadfast.  Despite that, I treated her subsequent challenge to my decision as an appeal and again refused her permission to appeal for the reasons set out in my written judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Throughout the multi-day hearing, the mother was also informed of the subsequent change of care plans for SH and SI.  At the conclusion of the hearing I found the threshold met for the reasons set out in my judgment and made care orders for the four children and a placement order for A, the consent of the mother was dispensed with.  No permission to appeal that order was made.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This brings me to the application currently before the court which is dated 4 January 2024.  The mother now seeks to reopen my findings on the basis that she now states that she was not able to participate in the proceedings by reasons of the absence of an intermediary when one was required.  Accordingly, the proceedings were procedurally unfair.  </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The court experience is likely to be an anxiety-provoking situation for the mother and her difficulties may mean that she is likely to find it challenging to communicate effectively and may see the court as intimidating, which could lead to increased levels of anxiety and/or stress for her, which could lead to the following: feelings of panic or mental overload, a shut down in terms of performance and engagement, outbursts of frustrated behaviour and the urge to provide any answer simply to bring the questioning to an end&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A number of recommendations were made by the expert which is not unusual and often quite standard in cases of this nature, none of which, however, in that report was for the appointment of an intermediary.  I know not why the current proceedings proceeded straight through to an intermediary report being ordered without an updated cognitive assessment report being required.  However, it is not for me to second-guess the reason for that.  However, the assessment report that has been provided in the current proceedings concludes that the mother is a vulnerable person in the &#8216;court communication environment&#8217;, will struggle during hearings and recommends the use of an intermediary.  Of course, this is alongside other recommendations not dissimilar to those put forward previously by Dr Furlong.</p>

I repeat that it records that notwithstanding the deficits in Mother&#8217;s cognitive skills, the mother demonstrated her ability to understand the information that is presented to her using simplified language where necessary.  Although it records she experiences general difficulties with learning, her profile does not satisfy the criteria for a diagnosis of significant learning disability.  As indicated, it makes a number of recommendations for professionals working with her as well as accommodating her in court.  </p>

However, the assessment reflects her complete denial of the allegations made against her which she contended as being malicious.  The assessor was concerned as to her ability to take any responsibility for the situation regarding the children and the local authority&#8217;s involvement, placing the blame on others.  The assessor concluded that the mother showed limited understanding of the children&#8217;s emotional needs and was unable to offer the parenting that these children needed, despite some improvements having been made&#8221;.</p>

I note that the final hearing before me was on 6-10 March 2023.  Mum, of course, would have been five months pregnant at the time, although at the time of the application for an adjournment, no information had been provided as to her being so.  None of the professionals were aware of that and there was no medical evidence filed in support of her application for an adjournment.  The hearing took place before me four months prior to the birth, and by my calculation Mother would have been in the second trimester.</p>

That ultimately led to an assessment from Dudley Lodge on 11 January 2024.  Within that report it shows that mum has demonstrated an ability to meet her daughter&#8217;s basic care needs, albeit there was an initial reluctance to change and to trust professionals.  The report states that they remain tentative as to Mother&#8217;s ability to make long-term changes due to her recent acceptance of the concerns, but she has displayed commitment.  However, this needs to be tested in the community and the vulnerabilities remain and cannot be underestimated, as such change as the mother has evidenced is in its infancy and untested.  It also comments that the assessment relates only to the new child, and the unit would have concerns as to Mother&#8217;s ability to care for more than one child at this time alongside her daughter.</p>

Intermediaries are not to be appointed on a just in case basis.  This is notable because in the family justice system it appears to be common for intermediaries to be appointed for the whole trial.  &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..a judge appointing an intermediary should consider very carefully whether a whole trial order is justified and not make such an order simply because they are asked to do so.  The judge must give careful consideration not merely to the circumstances of the individual but also the facts and issues in the case.  Intermediaries should only be appointed if there are compelling reasons to do so and intermediaries should not be appointed simply because the process would be improved.</p>

Indeed, it is an ongoing duty throughout the case.  Furthermore, by virtue of paragraph 1.4, all parties and their representatives are required to work with the court and each other to ensure that each party or witness can participate in proceedings without the quality of their evidence being diminished and without being put in fear or distress by reason of their vulnerability, as defined with reference to the circumstances of each person and to the nature of the proceedings.</p>
