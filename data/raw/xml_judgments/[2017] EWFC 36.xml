	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is my judgment on a trial of the facts ordered by Her Honour Judge Garland-Thomas on 27 February 2017. The facts in dispute are whether, or not, A repeatedly raped his daughter, Y, more than 20 years ago when she was under 16. It is said that the abuse continued after she turned 16.  A strongly denies the accusation. His wife B says that the allegation is impossible to believe, as does Y&#8217;s sister C. Y herself suffers from mental illness and has not participated in the trial. Her counsel take a neutral stance in relation to the allegations, as does the Guardian.  The local authority submits that the accusation is true.</p>

		    <p class="ColorfulGrid-Accent11" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;It is also important to have in mind the role of a judgment given after trial. The primary function of a first instance judge is to find facts and identify the crucial legal points and to advance reasons for deciding them in a particular way. He should give his reasons in sufficient detail to show the parties and, if need be, the Court of Appeal the principles on which he has acted and the reasons that have led him to his decision. They need not be elaborate. There is no duty on a judge, in giving his reasons, to deal with every argument presented by counsel in support of his case. His function is to reach conclusions and give reasons to support his view, not to spell out every matter as if summing up to a jury. Nor need he deal at any length with matters that are not disputed. It is sufficient if what he says shows the basis on which he has acted.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are myriad background facts which are not disputed and which are not necessary for me to spell out here. They are well known to the parties, and should the matter proceed further then they can be detailed by the advocates to the Court of Appeal. Any reader of this judgment unfamiliar with the background would be helped by reading the judgment of His Honour Deputy Judge John dated 23 September, 2016 when he made an interim care order. This contains a useful summary of the history. For an exhaustively full account of the background reference should be made to the chronology prepared by junior counsel for the local authority, which has left no stone unturned. I am grateful for the preparation of that very useful document.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although I have been confronted with thousands of documents, and heard oral evidence over many days, I am satisfied that I can give my decision relatively shortly without an exhaustive mechanical iteration of the evidence and arguments I have heard. Like Lord Justice Longmore I agree that judgments in this country are quite long enough already (see <span style="font-style:italic">Aerospace Publishing Ltd v Thames Water Utilities Ltd</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2007/3" uk:canonical="[2007] EWCA Civ 3" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] EWCA Civ 3</ref> at [70]), without them being extended by reams of recitation of evidence which is known to everybody and which is largely uncontroversial, or of only marginal relevance. In my opinion there is a lot to be said for judgments reverting to the structure and length of those of the judicial giants of the Victorian-Edwardian era. I have reached a clear view and I have cited the principal aspects of the evidence, as well as the relevant legal principles, in order to justify my decision.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As stated, Y has not given oral evidence. She is presently detained in a psychiatric hospital under the Mental Health Act. There is compelling, unchallenged, medical evidence that it would be very harmful for her to give oral evidence in court. A therefore has not had the opportunity of confronting his principal accuser, nor has the court had the opportunity of assessing under cross-examination the reliability of the evidence deriving from her.       </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">FPR 22.2(1)(a) provides that the general rule is that any fact which needs to be proved by the evidence of witnesses is to be proved, at the final hearing, by their oral evidence. FPR 22.6(2) in effect removes the right to give oral evidence-in-chief as in all cases a witness (other than a summoned witness) will have been required to provide a witness statement, which will stand as evidence-in-chief. Oral evidence-in-chief now requires the permission of the judge be given. FPR 22.11 provides the right to cross-examine a witness on his or her witness statement. Thus, the general rule is that facts in issue are to be proved by written evidence-in-chief and oral evidence given under cross-examination. Of course, facts may also be proved by hearsay evidence pursuant to the Civil Evidence Act 1998 and FPR 23.2 &#8211; 23.5, but the general rule is that oral evidence given under cross-examination is the gold standard. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Why is this? It is because it reflects the long-established common-law consensus that the best way of assessing the reliability of evidence is by confronting the witness. In <span style="font-style:italic">Crawford v Washington</span> (2004) 541 US 36 at 62 Scalia J, when discussing the explicit command to afford cross-examination of witnesses in criminal cases contained within the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, stated:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;To be sure, the Clause&#8217;s ultimate goal is to ensure reliability of evidence, but it is a procedural rather than a substantive guarantee. It commands, not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination. The Clause thus reflects a judgment, not only about the desirability of reliable evidence (a point on which there could be little dissent), but about how reliability can best be determined. Cf. 3 Blackstone, Commentaries, at 373 (&#8220;This open examination of witnesses . . . is much more conducive to the clearing up of truth&#8221;); M. Hale, History and Analysis of the Common Law of England 258 (1713) (adversarial testing &#8220;beats and bolts out the Truth much better&#8221;).&#8221; </p>

In private law proceedings about contact the father was accused of sexually abusing a very vulnerable and damaged female, X, some years earlier. Obviously, if true, this would have a major effect on the contact proceedings. Therefore, a fact-finding hearing was convened.  X gave oral evidence by video-link. The local authority, a party to the proceedings, paid for the father to be represented. There was no question of an abusive cross-examination by the father directly of X.  X was permitted to give evidence-in-chief. This took some time. The father&#8217;s counsel cross-examined for an hour until the court day ended. The judge prevented cross-examination continuing the next day. She felt it would be &#8220;inhuman&#8221; to require X to do so. Thus, the father, largely, and the guardian, completely, were unable to test the reliability of X&#8217;s evidence.</p>

There are many ways in which her evidence could be received without recourse to the normal method of courtroom confrontation. Family proceedings have long been more flexible than other proceedings in this respect. The court has power to receive and act upon hearsay evidence. It is commonplace for children to give their accounts in videotaped conversations with specially trained police officers or social workers. Such arrangements might be extended to other vulnerable witnesses such as X. These could include the facility to have specific questions put to the witness at the request of the parties. If she is too unwell to cope with oral questioning, the court may have to do its best with her recorded allegations, perhaps supplemented with written questions put to her in circumstances approved by Dr W. On the other hand, oral questioning could be arranged in ways which did not involve face to face confrontation. It is not a requirement that the father be able to see her face. It is, to say the least, unlikely that the court would ever allow direct questioning by the father, should he still (other than in this court) be acting in person. The court's only concern in family proceedings is to get at the truth. The object of the procedure is to enable witnesses to give their evidence in the way which best enables the court to assess its reliability. It is certainly not to compound any abuse which may have been suffered.&#8221; </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;In the light of these considerations, the best approach for a judge to adopt in the trial of a commercial case is, in my view, to place little if any reliance at all on witnesses' recollections of what was said in meetings and conversations, and to base factual findings on inferences drawn from the documentary evidence and known or probable facts. This does not mean that oral testimony serves no useful purpose &#8211; though its utility is often disproportionate to its length. But its value lies largely, as I see it, in the opportunity which cross-examination affords to subject the documentary record to critical scrutiny and to gauge the personality, motivations and working practices of a witness, rather than in testimony of what the witness recalls of particular conversations and events. Above all, it is important to avoid the fallacy of supposing that, because a witness has confidence in his or her recollection and is honest, evidence based on that recollection provides any reliable guide to the truth.&#8221;</p>

But she was a mere child. She was in a relationship with W. She describes it in terms which are frighteningly abusive. She describes actual as well as statutory rape and being passed around as a virtual sex slave amongst his circle of friends. Whether any of this is true is debatable as, the fact of the contraceptive pill aside, there is no corroboration for any of Y&#8217;s allegations.

She had overdosed on paracetamol and had attempted suicide by hanging. By this stage, Y had been diagnosed as suffering (mildly) from cerebral palsy as well as epilepsy.

The procedure was unconventional and broke virtually every rule set out in the Memorandum of Good Practice for Achieving Best Evidence which derived from the Cleveland report. Above all, the session was not video recorded. Instead Y, who is plainly a prolific writer, would write down what she wanted to say and then her writings would be transcribed into the interview template by the constable. My copy of the original statement, which runs to 19 pages, is extremely poor as it has been highlighted and re-copied over the years with the result that the more important passages are very difficult to read. However, an agreed transcription was prepared during the hearing. In it, she alleges that her father had touched her inappropriately in and around her vagina from about age 8 and had had full sexual intercourse with her from age 13. She described how 11 days earlier on Sunday 19 May, 1996 she had visited her parents because her niece G was staying. She described how awful was the atmosphere in the house with everyone arguing; how her sister C went out; how her mother either went to bed or went out; and how she was left with G and her father. After watching television for 45 minutes she described how her father forced sexual intercourse on her on the settee, while G was watching. I repeat that this was only five days after her parents had confronted her and threatened her with legal action if she spread any more rumours.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before I turn to the retractions that have been made by Y I jump forward to the following year, 1997, to two important pieces of further writing by her. At some point in that year, when she was 17, Y wrote a letter in which she repeated that she had been abused by her father. She also stated that she had fallen pregnant (but she did not say by whom) and that she had, when aged 16, undergone an abortion. This we know to be totally untrue. Y has never had an abortion. It is important that this hard untruth is exposed, because it does illustrate that reality and fantasy are neighbouring companions so far as Y is concerned. Similarly, in May 1997, that is to say exactly a year after she made her initial allegations, Y wrote a document describing the abuse meted out to her by her father. The problem with this document is that what she describes is completely different to the acts described by her year earlier. She describes, among other things, extreme violence; being threatened with a knife; having objects thrown at her; forced sodomy; and the insertion of inanimate objects into her vagina. These descriptions are not just an elaboration of what she had said a year earlier; it was a completely different story. Again, the inconsistency is stark, and in any semblance of a fair trial the author of those accounts should have been present to be confronted with them.</p>

On 30 May, 1996, immediately following the completion of her statement, the police arrested A. He was remanded in custody, and when in Swansea prison suffered violence at the hands of other prisoners. Y wrote two letters to her father while he was in prison. In the first she wrote that she had &#8220;retracked&#8221; her statement. She went on to apologise profusely and to say &#8220;dad I am not sly, I didn&#8217;t say what they said I did, as I never even wrote the statement, Monday, AL did&#8221;. This is a difficult sentence to understand. The retraction itself (T579), made on 19 June, 1996, is written in rather formal language where Y admits to having lied and apologises to all concerned. The second letter to her father when he was in prison explains that she had told social services that she had been lying but no one would take any notice of her. In February 1997, she wrote a letter from Cf to her father after he had been released in which she stated that she had been lying and that she had been trying to tell the staff at Cf that she had been lying.</p>

In the second letter, she says &#8220;it never ever happened, my father&#8217;s never laid a finger on me&#8221;. It is true that in this letter she was expressing a strong desire to return home; that, on one hand, might supply a motive for the retraction, but on the other hand it is hard to understand if her father had indeed abused her in the way that she had alleged, why she would want to return home to live with him.

After repeated admissions to various hospitals or other units Y returned to live with her parents in May 2009 together with her new partner who she had met on the unit. In January 2011 Y fell pregnant. In May 2011 Y was discharged from after-care under the Mental Health Act into the care of her GP. Z was born on 25 October, 2011.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The birth of Z caused the local authority to take protective measures in view of the unresolved allegations made many years earlier by Y against her father. They required Y to agree that she would supervise all contact between A and Z. Y is recorded as having said when this agreement was being discussed &#8220;do you think I would have self- harmed as bad as I did for 16 years if nothing had happened?&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is perhaps surprising, or at least arguably inconsistent, that the local authority took this step given that they had taken no equivalent step on the birth of any of C&#8217;s five children in 2001, 2003, 2006, 2007, and 2008. All of these children, and in particular the younger two who are girls, had spent time alone with their grandfather without any intervention by the local authority, notwithstanding the gravity of the allegations that had been made against him many years earlier by their aunt Y. Although it can be argued that C was less than full and frank in her description of what was going on in the house during the childhoods of her and Y(see below) it cannot be disputed that C is a devoted and thoroughly competent parent to her five children. She told me, as one would expect, that her five children are the most important things for her in the world and that she would not in any circumstances expose them to risk. Therefore, in allowing her five children who have unsupervised contact to their grandfather, it must follow that she authentically does not believe that A has abused Yin the manner alleged or at all.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following the making of this agreement by Y with the local authority, and following representations by her that she would never leave Z alone with her grandfather, the local authority closed its case in respect of Z. The arrangement for accommodation was that although Y had her own place she would spend every day with her parents. It is clear that Y did not comply with her agreement and has allowed Z to spend time with her grandfather unsupervised. However, it is equally clear that no harm has befallen Z. Had Y not suffered her calamitous psychiatric collapse in 2015, which manifested itself in repeated acts of self-mutilation and ligaturing, there is every reason to suppose that the arrangements I have described would be continuing to this day undisturbed. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In February 2016 Y was sectioned. She has been in a psychiatric unit ever since and is under close supervision. Her condition is truly pitiful in that she seems to wish to engage in self-harm at almost every opportunity. As I have stated above, the medical evidence is very clear &#8211; for her to give evidence or to participate in the proceedings could aggravate her condition considerably. She has been asked by her junior counsel if she wishes to say anything to me through any medium, in writing or on video, but she has shaken her head.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">One thing is clear. Y has a very strong and appropriate relationship with her daughter. It is fair to assume that Z is the most important person in Y&#8217;s life. Y does not lack capacity and has a full insight into her condition. She recognises that her actions are life-threatening. She has expressed the view, somewhat to my surprise, that were anything to happen to her she would prefer Z to be placed with her parents rather than with her sister C. This is almost impossible to reconcile with the allegations that she has made against her father. Her allegations have primarily been against her father but she has also accused her mother of complicity, albeit passively. Similarly, her return to live (largely) with her parents once Z was born is very difficult to square with the accusations of the most serious nature that she has made against both of her parents.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the absence of any oral evidence from Y, and specifically in the absence of the opportunity having been afforded to A and B to confront Y with her manifold inconsistencies, I cannot be satisfied that it is more likely than not that A abused Yin the manner alleged. Quite apart from the question of the fairness of the process there are just too many inconsistencies in the accounts given by Y for any fact-finder to conclude that it is more likely than not that the events happened. It is noteworthy that there is no corroboration for any of the allegations at all. They all derive from Y and it is her word alone that determines whether these events occurred. And her word is not to be regarded as reliable. I do not need to find whether her allegations were untrue on account of malice or delusion. Indeed, I do not have to even go so far as to find that her allegations are positively untrue. All I need to find, and I do, is that I am not satisfied that they are true which is qualitatively different from fixing someone with a deliberate falsehood.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The decision of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (Children</span>) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2008/35" uk:canonical="[2008] UKHL 35" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] UKHL 35</ref> confirms what we all already knew, namely that if an allegation in relation to a past (as opposed to future) fact or event is not proved to a probability of 51% then it is treated as not having happened: see Lord Hoffmann at paragraph 2. The court may feel that there is a not fanciful (im)probability, say 25%, of the event having happened, but that mere suspicion, for that is all it is, entirely falls by the wayside. This is in contradistinction to the court&#8217;s conjectures about future risks where even a probability appreciably less than 50% is sufficient to carry a case over the statutory threshold. If there is an inconsistency of approach, then that is a legal consequence that we all have to live with. At all events, A and, ex hypothesi, B are entitled to be treated as if the specific alleged events never happened.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, I am wholly unsatisfied at the absence of explanation from A and B for what was going on in that household to have driven Y so dramatically off the rails. Plainly, there were bad things happening to a very vulnerable child. At this distance of time it is not possible to say precisely what or by whom, but the consequence of those bad things is plain to see. It would be grossly irresponsible for the local authority to propose, or for the court to endorse, a plan whereby Z were brought up by A and B. In any event, they are not of an age, or of sufficiently robust health, to bring up boisterous little girl aged nearly 6. A now suffers from Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (albeit mildly) and B has recently suffered a heart attack.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As we have now reached the position where the specific allegations against A are not proven, and are therefore treated as not having happened, there is no reason why C cannot be considered to be a full-time carer for Z. I am concerned by the rose-tinted nature of her evidence - it brought to mind the three monkeys: seeing, hearing and speaking nothing evil. It is difficult to accept that she could have been unaware of problems within the family. However, she was not in a position of parental responsibility, and this put her in an entirely different position to A and B.</p>

Given that I have now found that A is not to be treated as having done what he was suspected to have done, it follows that Y, even though she was the author of the allegations in the first place, cannot be fixed with culpability for exposing Z to risk.</p>
