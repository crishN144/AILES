At some point in this chronology the respondent and his solicitor parted ways and so by the time of the hearing before me on 15 June the respondent was once again representing himself. It is clear that the respondent had at an earlier stage instructed a solicitor for the enforcement proceedings (and so it is obvious to me that he was aware of them and aware of the hearing). </span></p>
