He was not the only defendant. The other, a brother of the wife named Mordechai Schmerler (&#8216;Mordechai&#8217;), is the legal owner of the property, which is at 98 Kyverdale Avenue, London N16.  </p>

A Get was pronounced on 12 May 2013, after which long-drawn out proceedings in relation to the parties&#8217; children followed. Those children are Z (born in June 1996 and now independent and married); N (born in January 1998, independent and married); T, born on 26 September 1999, so aged 20, and living with the father: she is engaged to be married this summer, when it is anticipated that she too will leave home; and finally M, who was born on 8 November 2007 and so is now 12. She too lives with her father in the former family home. Sadly none of the children are presently seeing their mother. </p>

The wife has now left the community, which has caused a significant rift between her and her children, as well as her former husband and the rest of their respective families. She has been interviewed in the press about her experiences before leaving the group, which has not been well received in the community. </p>

Eventually the husband himself petitioned for divorce on 22 July 2018, and Decree Nisi was pronounced on 3 December 2018. However, by then he had already long previously gone through a reli<span style="color:#2A2A2A">gious ceremony of (re)marriage in New York in May 2016, with his present wife Malka. </span></p>

He told me that he did not get involved as he did not believe that they had anything to do with him. I cannot accept that explanation. The husband is an intelligent man, and must have been well aware of the significance at least of his wife&#8217;s application. I find that he was aware of and played a part, together with others in the community, in the decision that only the wife&#8217;s brother would have any involvement in the initial proceedings. As matters developed, Mordechai, who is a part-time teacher living in Israel with 6 children of his own, also played little part in the process. However, for reasons which will become clear, I take findings in the Chancery judgment as the starting point for the issues which I have now to decide. </p>

Mordechai provided no money for the purchase, has never lived there, and has no evident means of making mortgage interest payments.

In those circumstances I have no hesitation in finding that the future plans for her own life which she described to me are entirely reasonable.

It is not clear whether the funds previously received have in some part been earned by him specifically, but not declared for tax avoidance reasons, or alternatively simply provided as genuine charity, and if both, in what proportions. Further, it is equally impossible now to identify with any certainty the extent to which any further capital funding, beyond the meeting of household outgoings, will be forthcoming and if so on what terms. </p>

Donations are received from members of the community and when a need arises in the community assistance is given. We rarely turn anyone away. On occasions, when funding is required for a specific need individual benefactors are asked to assist and they will donate large sums. This has been the case with Mr Kliers although because of the purpose of the assistance, the money given to him is by way of a loan rather than a gift. There is no loan agreement. I told the benefactors that the money was required to assist Mr Kliers and his children to keep their home. On this basis various members of the community loaned him large sums. As the sums were so large, the money was loaned on the understanding that it would be repaid on Mr Kliers selling his home or re-mortgaging. In the community we operate on trust. There is no written agreements and no specific terms for repayment. The benefactors are all aware that the sum will be repaid at some point and the money is therefore a loan rather than a gift or general donation.</span>&#8217; </p>

He was less sure about any offer of long term rental assistance, as he wouldn&#8217;t want to open himself to something &#8216;with no limit&#8217;. He did not rule out absolutely the possibility though of any further help &#8211; clearly any further requests will be dealt with on their merits, but in circumstances where this family has already received a lot of assistance. If those funds were required to be returned in the timeframe proposed, Mr Kliers would still require a home for his current wife and baby daughter now aged just 8 months old, and so then no more than 9. It is therefore probable as I find that those loans would be extended to the date of J&#8217;s majority in due course. </p>

Obviously the primary carer needs whatever is available to make the main home for the children, but it is of importance, albeit it is of lesser importance, that the other parent should have a home of his own where the children can enjoy their contact time with him. Of course there are cases where there is not enough to provide a home for either. Of course there are cases where there is only enough to provide one. But in any case where there is, by stretch and a degree of risk-taking, the possibility of a division to enable both to rehouse themselves, that is an exceptionally important consideration and one which will almost invariably have a decisive impact on outcome."  </span></p>

But to cite the case as if it laid down some rule that both spouses invariably have a right to purchased accommodation is a misuse of authority. It is perhaps of some interest that Thorpe L.J., who would have refused leave to appeal in this case, must have taken the same view. Here the children were adult. There was no question of the husband needing a home to receive them. His needs related entirely to himself and his new Polish family.&#8221; </span></p>

No doubt any home move can be unwelcome for a child, but if presented positively to her by her father and step-mother, there is no reason why it should cause her any undue or harmful disquiet. Whether the husband will feel able to so present such a move is another matter; but that is not something that should prevent the court from making such an order if it otherwise considered it to be fair, in all the circumstances. The husband&#8217;s own case is that in the event that he did have to move he would require the sum of &#163;900,000 to rehouse himself appropriately, and in the area occupied nearly exclusively by his community. That he puts his case this highly can only be on the basis that he now has Malka and her 3 children to house as well.
