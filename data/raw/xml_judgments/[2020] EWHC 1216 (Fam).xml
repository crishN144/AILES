The Local Authority seek findings that William died at the hands of either his Mother, Father or older brother (Charles) and places all three in the pool of perpetrators. The parents and Charles say that William committed suicide by hanging. There is no suggestion of there being any possibility of accidental death (other than in a game) or any other person being involved. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The fact-finding hearing was split into two parts. I heard six days of evidence in October 2019 but then had to adjourn because the Police disclosed, part way through the second week, that they had been exercising covert surveillance on the family at various dates whilst they were under investigation. No PII application had been made at the appropriate time, and the fact of the surveillance only came to light after repeated requests and then orders for disclosure. I heard the PII application in private and with only the Police representatives present and refused the application and held that the material should be disclosed. The material (some 367 pages) was disclosed on the Friday of the second week and unsurprisingly the parties applied for an adjournment, which I granted. Because of the need to digest the information, take instructions and then find other dates which all concerned could do, the adjournment has been unfortunately long. The second part of the hearing commenced on 10 February 2020. In this second part I heard all the family members and Mr Lee the forensic architect expert. All the other witnesses were heard in the first part. I will deal with the late disclosure material below.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The first relevant date in the chronology is an incident on 6 July 2006 when Charles was in primary school. There was an incident when Charles allegedly kicked another child at school and the Father attended the school. He is reported to have repeatedly kicked Charles and pushed him down stairs and into a door. The school would not allow Charles home and there was a referral to social services. Charles, Tina and Belinda were taken into protective custody with the girls returning home the next day and Charles a few days later. The Mother is recorded as later denying the incident occurred. The Father was convicted of assault on a minor in respect of this incident in December 2006 and given a conditional discharge of 6 months. </p>

The incident in the waiting room led to a hospital referral at which the Father refused permission to speak to the children or the Mother. There is an incident in March 2012 when Charles is recorded as having been abusive to another child and was not allowed to attend lessons. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In October 2013 William was reported as being aggressive at school to another pupil and himself and a social worker contacted the parents about a CAMHS referral. The social worker records the Mother being highly aggressive at the school and having to be removed by her daughters. When the Mother was asked about this incident in cross examination she suggested that it was the school&#8217;s fault and that William had been unfairly treated. She initially suggested that she had no recollection of it, but then did accept it had happened but denied being aggressive. It was a consistent theme of her evidence that William&#8217;s well documented problems at school, particularly at [The Primary School], were the fault of the school. In January 2014 the case was closed on the basis that the school was addressing concerns for William. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">William moved to [The Secondary School] in September 2015. It seems from the evidence that this was not his first choice of secondary school as many of the other children from [The Primary School] went to a different secondary school. Mr Wright who at the time William was there was a senior teacher at [The Secondary School] and is now deputy head, gave evidence. He is a highly experienced teacher who had been at the school for 11 years. He gave evidence of an incident on 28 September 2016 when William was reported as being out of control at school and started kicking and punching the wall.  Mr Wright had been urgently called by another teacher because William was out of control. He said that he tried to reason with William but he was so concerned about the other pupils that the police were called to the school and ultimately two officers had to restrain William, including handcuffing him. William was excluded from [The Secondary School]. Mr Wright was very clear about the extreme nature of William&#8217;s behaviour and said that during the incident he was impossible to talk to or reason with. He said that he had never come across behaviour like that from a child of that age (at that point 12 years old).  It is recorded that there were numerous failed attempts to engage the family and that they felt the school had unnecessarily escalated the incident.   </p>

Mr Brown said that the meeting began badly with William being very aggressive (in [the family&#8217;s first language]) with his Mother, to a degree that he described as shocking. He said the Mother seemed to be quite timid and almost scared of William. William was defensive and angry and was rude. However, as the meeting progressed he became more cooperative and conversational. William wanted to return to mainstream education and he would like to go to the secondary school he had originally wanted. Although it was made clear in the meeting that this was a considerable way off, the sense I have of the meeting was that William was given at least the possibility of a return to mainstream school if his behaviour improved. By the end of the meeting, William was in a more positive frame of mind and was recorded as then attending all his lessons for the rest of the day and having had a good day.  </p>

Whilst appropriate attention must be paid to the opinion of medical experts, those opinions need to be considered in the context of all the other evidence. The roles of the court and the expert are distinct. It is the court that is in the position to weigh up expert evidence against the other evidence (see A County Council &amp; K, D, &amp; L <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2005/144" uk:canonical="[2005] EWHC 144 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] EWHC 144 (Fam)</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 FLR 851" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 FLR 851</ref> per Charles J).

It is a means of satisfying the attributable threshold condition that only arises where the court is satisfied that there has been significant harm arising from (in shorthand) ill-treatment and where the only 'unknown' is which of a number of persons is responsible. So, to state the obvious, the concept of the pool does not arise at all in the normal run of cases where the relevant allegation can be proved to the civil standard against an individual or individuals in the normal way. Nor does it arise where only one person could possibly be responsible. In that event, the allegation is either proved or it is not. There is no room for a finding of fact on the basis of 'real possibility', still less on the basis of suspicion. There is no such thing as a pool of one.  </span></p>

As is made clear in Lancashire at [19], O and N at [27-28] and S-B at [43], the person is not a proven perpetrator but a possible perpetrator. </span></p>

At the same time it will, as Lord Nicholls put it in Lancashire, "keep firmly in mind that the parents have not been shown to be responsible for the child's injuries." In saying this, he recognised that a conclusion of this kind presents the court with a particularly difficult problem. Experience bears this out, particularly where a child has suffered very grave harm from someone within a pool of perpetrators.  </span></p>

Centrally, it does not alter the general rule on the burden of proof. Where there are a number of people who might have caused the harm, it is for the local authority to show that in relation to each of them there is a real possibility that they did. No one can be placed into the pool unless that has been shown. This is why it is always misleading to refer to 'exclusion from the pool': see Re S-B at [43]. Approaching matters in that way risks, as Baroness Hale said, reversing the burden of proof.  </span></p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.59in;text-indent:0.24in"><span style="font-style:italic">To guard against that risk, I would suggest that a change of language may be helpful. The court should first consider whether there is a 'list' of people who had the opportunity to cause the injury. It should then consider whether it can identify the actual perpetrator on the balance of probability and should seek, but not strain, to do so: Re D (Children) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2009/472" uk:canonical="[2009] EWCA Civ 472" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] EWCA Civ 472</ref> at [12]. Only if it cannot identify the perpetrator to the civil standard of proof should it go on to ask in respect of those on the list: "Is there a likelihood or real possibility that A or B or C was the perpetrator or a perpetrator of the inflicted injuries?" Only if there is should A or B or C be placed into the 'pool'.  </span></p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.59in;text-indent:0.24in"><span style="font-style:italic">Likewise, it can be seen that the concept of a pool of perpetrators as a permissible means of satisfying the threshold was forged in cases concerning individuals who were 'carers'. In Lancashire, the condition was interpreted to include non-parent carers. It was somewhat widened in North Yorkshire at [26] to include 'people with access to the child' who might have caused injury. If that was an extension, it was a principled one. But at all events, the extension does not stretch to "anyone who had even a fleeting contact with the child in circumstances where there was the opportunity to cause injuries": North Yorkshire at [25]. Nor does it extend to harm caused by someone outside the home or family unless it would have been reasonable to expect a parent to have prevented it: S-B at [40].  </span></p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.59in;text-indent:0.24in"><span style="font-style:italic">It should also be noted that in the leading cases there were two, three or four known individuals from whom any risk to the child must have come. The position of each individual was then investigated and compared. That is as it should be. To assess the likelihood of harm having been caused by A or B or C, one needs as much information as possible about each of them in order to make the decision about which if any of them should be placed in the pool. So, where there is an imbalance of information about some individuals in comparison to others, particular care may need to be taken to ensure that the imbalance does not distort the assessment of the possibilities. The same may be said where the list of individuals has been whittled down to a pool of one named individual alongside others who are not similarly identified. This may be unlikely, but the present case shows that it is not impossible. Here it must be shown that there genuinely is a pool of perpetrators and not just a pool of one by default.  </span></p>

One of the most important lessons of such research is that in everyday life we are not aware of the extent to which our own and other people's memories are unreliable and believe our memories to be more faithful than they are. Two common (and related) errors are to suppose: (1) that the stronger and more vivid is our feeling or experience of recollection, the more likely the recollection is to be accurate; and (2) that the more confident another person is in their recollection, the more likely their recollection is to be accurate.  </span></p>

In fact, psychological research has demonstrated that memories are fluid and malleable, being constantly rewritten whenever they are retrieved. This is true even of so-called 'flashbulb' memories, that is memories of experiencing or learning of a particularly shocking or traumatic event. (The very description 'flashbulb' memory is in fact misleading, reflecting as it does the misconception that memory operates like a camera or other device that makes a fixed record of an experience.) External information can intrude into a witness's memory, as can his or her own thoughts and beliefs, and both can cause dramatic changes in recollection. Events can come to be recalled as memories which did not happen at all or which happened to someone else (referred to in the literature as a failure of source memory).  </span></p>

The nature of litigation is such that witnesses often have a stake in a particular version of events. This is obvious where the witness is a party or has a tie of loyalty (such as an employment relationship) to a party to the proceedings. Other, more subtle influences include allegiances created by the process of preparing a witness statement and of coming to court to give evidence for one side in the dispute. A desire to assist, or at least not to prejudice, the party who has called the witness or that party's lawyers, as well as a natural desire to give a good impression in a public forum, can be significant motivating forces.  </span></p>

A witness is asked to make a statement, often (as in the present case) when a long time has already elapsed since the relevant events. The statement is usually drafted for the witness by a lawyer who is inevitably conscious of the significance for the issues in the case of what the witness does nor does not say. The statement is made after the witness's memory has been "refreshed" by reading documents. The documents considered often include statements of case and other argumentative material as well as documents which the witness did not see at the time or which came into existence after the events which he or she is being asked to recall. The statement may go through several iterations before it is finalised. Then, usually months later, the witness will be asked to re-read his or her statement and review documents again before giving evidence in court. The effect of this process is to establish in the mind of the witness the matters recorded in his or her own statement and other written material, whether they be true or false, and to cause the witness's memory of events to be based increasingly on this material and later interpretations of it rather than on the original experience of the events.  </span></p>

Such questions are misguided in at least two ways. First, they erroneously presuppose that there is a clear distinction between recollection and reconstruction, when all remembering of distant events involves reconstructive processes. Second, such questions disregard the fact that such processes are largely unconscious and that the strength, vividness and apparent authenticity of memories is not a reliable measure of their truth.  </span></p>

This does not mean that oral testimony serves no useful purpose &#8211; though its utility is often disproportionate to its length. But its value lies largely, as I see it, in the opportunity which cross-examination affords to subject the documentary record to critical scrutiny and to gauge the personality, motivations and working practices of a witness, rather than in testimony of what the witness recalls of particular conversations and events. Above all, it is important to avoid the fallacy of supposing that, because a witness has confidence in his or her recollection and is honest, evidence based on that recollection provides any reliable guide to the truth. </span></p>

They may arise for a number of reasons. One possibility is of course that they are lies designed to hide culpability. Another is that they are lies told for other reasons. Further possibilities include faulty recollection or confusion at times of stress or when the importance of accuracy is not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the record-keeping or recollection of the person hearing and relaying the account. The possible effects of delay and repeated questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one person of hearing accounts given by others. As memory fades, a desire to iron out wrinkles may not be unnatural &#8211; a process that might inelegantly be described as "story-creep" may occur without any necessary inference of bad faith. </span></p>

In terms of the difficulties with oral testimony, particularly some years later, much compounded in this case by the trauma of what happened that afternoon, I entirely accept and agree with what Leggatt J said. However, the difficulty in a case such as the present is that there are no contemporaneous documents that assist me on what happened on the afternoon of 23 June 2017.  There is some evidence of what Leggatt J might describe as known facts, e.g. the record of the incidents in 2006 and 2013, and the professional evidence of William&#8217;s behaviour and of the meeting at [The Pupil Referral Unit] in the morning of 23 June. None of this goes directly to the afternoon of 23 June. However, some of that evidence of known or probable facts does show, beyond any doubt, that family members have told lies in their evidence as I explain below.

The relevant terminology was explained in Dr Marnerides&#8217;s evidence as follows; &#8220;typical hanging&#8221; is used when the ligature knot is situated to the nape of the neck and the ligature runs anteriorly. &#8220;Atypical hanging&#8221; is the term used for other positions of the knot. &#8220;Complete&#8221; or fully suspensory hanging is where the body is completely suspended with the feet not touching the ground or any other surface. &#8220;Partial&#8221; hanging is when the body is partially suspended, for example the toes could be touching the ground. The marks on the neck tend to be horizontal rather than diagonal and may resemble marks seen in ligature strangulation.  </p>

Firstly, that this was an act of self-harm through selfsuspension, as suggested, or secondly that this was in fact an act of compression of the neck by some means involving a third party. In either case there is no evidence of a clear-cut ligature mark and in relation to a scenario of hanging (suspension) there is no evidence of a mark rising on either side. Whilst in some cases of so-called atypical hanging a rising mark may not be seen, particularly if hanging is at low level, what is proposed here is a relatively high level suspension even if the feet remained in contact with the ground. Although there is no evidence of a clear-cut ligature mark this does not exclude third party ligature compression of the neck by a soft broad ligature. Other third party methods of compression of the neck would include an arm-lock where the neck is compressed in the crook of an assailant&#8217;s elbow, compression of the neck using a forearm or one-handed compression of the next in the crook of a hand. </span></p>

In both tests he started by seeking to reproduce the knot at the curtain end as seen in the police photos. This was described as a simple overhand knot.  In the first static test Mr Lee created the knot to approximate the size of the knot in the photos. The test was undertaken at 30 degrees so as to replicate the position a person would need to be in to hang themselves from a static position. The test was terminated at 15 kg because the knot unravelled at this weight. For the second static test the knot was pulled as tightly as possible by an adult 30 year old man. The second test was terminated at 50 kg because the curtain rail hooks holding the end of the wires to the transducers began to move along the rail and suggested the knot was unravelling. For the third static load test the knot was again tightened and the transducer wires were fixed. That test was taken to a maximum load of 65 kg, which showed a permanent deformation of the rail by 1 and 1.5mm. </p>

The first dynamic load test resulted in the load hitting the crash pad underneath, so never reached the velocity required to mimic 56kg. The second dynamic load test did result in the knot unravelling. There was some displacement of the curtain rail.  </p>

Counsel for the Respondents emphasised that Mr Lee was not a forensic knot expert. This is true, but what Mr Lee was doing was conducting an experiment with a knot that resembled that in the police photos. As such, I do not consider his lack of &#8220;expertise&#8221; as a knot expert to be critical as long as I can be satisfied that he did the experiment in an appropriate manner.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The first point raised, or argument about Mr Lee&#8217;s &#8220;assumptions&#8221;, is that the fabric of the testing duvet cover was not identical in all respects to that of the original duvet cover. It is not possible to know what material differences that might make, but it is at least possible that the original fabric slipped less. The second, raised by Mr Vater, was that the original duvet cover could have had fastenings which would have impacted on its unravelling. This seems to me unlikely given that the fastenings (as shown in the police photos) were small plastic poppers, and although they might have had some impact I cannot see how it would have been much. The third is that the police photo only shows the knot as it ended up. As Mr Vater put it, the knot could have originally have had a longer tail and then partially slipped through. I find this very difficult to follow. If the end of the duvet cover had slipped through, then it seems likely that it would have unravelled and William hit the floor given that it was holding 56kg.  </p>

The brackets had been removed at least once by the police and it is impossible to be certain that when they were replaced they had the same strength. Equally, the rail may have suffered some deformation or metal fatigue by the fact that, on the parents&#8217; case, William had hung himself from the rail and the Father had tried to hang himself from it. The earlier tests could have caused fatigue to the rail.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Another point relating to the curtain rail and layout of the room, although not strictly within Mr Lee&#8217;s evidence, are the dimensions involved. The curtain rail was 2.7m above the floor. The window sill/ledge was 1.88m below the curtain rail, and 18cm wide. William was 1.54m high. Therefore, he would have had to loop the duvet over the rail 34cm above his head and tie a knot tight enough to hold his weight, again well above his head. These dimensions are all agreed. He would have had to do this whilst balancing/standing on a ledge 18cm wide. He might have stood on something else, there was a bookcase/table in the photos to one side, but the photos and the parents&#8217; evidence shows he would have had to get down from the table and move it, and then climb on the sill before hanging himself.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">When considering the evidence of all of the family witnesses there are a number of factors I bear closely in mind, and to some degree echoing the points made by Leggatt J in Gestmin. Firstly, William died in June 2017, well over two years ago. The mere passage of time will have dimmed memory and may have led to certain memories being distorted. Secondly, the events of the day he died and the surrounding events will inevitably be highly traumatic to all members of the family, whatever the truth of what happened. That may well lead people to positively try not to remember distressing events, or to have subconsciously blanked parts of their memory. It is therefore important that I am cautious about making assumptions when witnesses say that they cannot recall something. Allied to this is that they have given a number of interviews and statements and it is hardly surprising that there will be variation in accounts.  Thirdly, it is clear that the family feel a great sense of grievance at the Local Authority and the police. This is hardly surprising given the considerable length of time that has passed and the prolonged investigation, and perhaps particularly for [the Mother] the physical impacts of the post mortem, which must have been incredibly distressing. Also, the fact that a decision was made not to charge but Lucy remains in foster care is unsurprisingly something the family find hard to accept. The fact that the family are highly antagonistic to the Local Authority is therefore in itself not surprising. When considering the Local Authority&#8217;s arguments about the tendency of some members of the family to exhibit aggressive behaviour I have to take this into account.  </p>

However, I accept that this is a family which is hostile to outside agencies, and each member is very unwilling to give a true account of family dynamics. Although this is most unfortunate and makes my task more difficult, it does not mean that the family is lying about what happened to William. Their refusal to accept the well documented issues with aggression by Father, Mother, Charles and William may be a desire to keep these matters private.  </p>

Suicide is unacceptable in Islam, and is something that will give rise to great unhappiness in any family.  It is important that I am careful not to ascribe undue weight to the multiple inconsistencies in the evidence, and the rather consistent answers of &#8220;I can&#8217;t recall&#8221; or &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember&#8221; that were given to many of Mr Twomey&#8217;s questions.  </p>

Importantly, without that third party evidence, such as the records of the incidents of 2006 and 2013, it would not have been obvious listening to the evidence that the family witnesses were lying. In other words, each of the family witness could quite convincingly lie in the witness box under oath. This necessarily makes it difficult for me to judge the evidence they gave on the crucial events of the afternoon of 23 June. </p>

Equally, I fully accept that for Tina her brother&#8217;s death was intensely traumatic, whatever the circumstances and she may very well have limited recall about the day of William&#8217;s death. She was only 16 at the time, and thus herself a child.

She was the one speaking to the LAS, and the obvious and indeed necessary thing to do was to ask her parents what happened so she could tell the LAS. This could have been a panicking reaction, but I do not think so.  Her evidence about the circumstances of her call to the ambulance service is difficult to accept. I can see that she would have been incredibly upset, and that could have manifested itself as anger and aggression. But it is much less clear why she would not have told the ambulance service over the phone that William had tried to hang himself. She was in my view not telling the truth about Lucy as the evidence plainly shows that Lucy was in the room during the phone conversations.  </p>

In his statement (undated but I think September 2019) he said that in the days leading up to his death William had &#8220;presented as normal&#8221;, but the Father did go on to refer to a concern that William had been going out at night with his friends. He said that he and Charles had spoken to William about his behaviour. However, there was no reference to this conversation or conversations in oral evidence, and nothing to suggest that there was the level of concern that Charles gave evidence of. The Father&#8217;s oral evidence was wholly focused on William behaving normal and not being problematic in the period before he died.  In my view this was absolutely clear evidence of the Father not being truthful with the Court about what was happening at home shortly before William&#8217;s death. I highlight this point because if William did commit suicide then there would have been no reason for the parents not to tell the Court about these problems and any discussions they had had with William.  </p>

The Father said that just as he was leaving for Wickes the Mother and Lucy arrived home. This simply does not make sense. The Mother said she and Lucy came straight home from school.

I note at this stage there is no doubt that the lock was drilled because I have seen a photo of the lock. That of course does not tell me when or in what circumstances the lock was drilled. Mr Twomey asked a number of questions about what happened to the drill and why none of the ambulance staff saw it.

The lady on the emergency call was consistently saying to lie William on the floor and to keep him flat. Of course, time feels differently in a crisis situation, but on the true timeline there would not have been time to get frustrated by the delay, put William in the car, drive out, and then reverse back and take William out of the car and back into the house where Mr Reeve found him. </p>

It is far more likely the family lied on this point because they wanted to keep Lucy out of the scene, probably because they were worried about what she might say.

I decided that the benefit I would gain from hearing her oral evidence would not outweigh the potential harm to her as a young person with a very young baby. Although she could have given evidence about William&#8217;s mental state on the day he died, she could not give evidence about what happened on the afternoon of 23 June.

This surveillance (not phone tapping) gave rise to transcripts running to some 367 pages. It was this material which I ordered should be disclosed to the parties in October and led to the adjournment of the first part of the hearing. I ordered disclosure, and rejected the Metropolitan Police&#8217;s application of public interest immunity, because I took the view that the material was potentially exculpatory and the probative value outweighed any public interest in non-disclosure.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The first factor is the lack of rising hanging marks on his neck. It would, both pathologists agreed, be extremely unusual for there to be a lack of such marks in a fully suspended hanging. The lack of petechial haemorrhages in the eyes is also a strong indicator against a fully suspended hanging.  There was a great deal of cross examination about what might be the case if this had been a partially suspended hanging, with William&#8217;s feet either on the sill, or on the bags or other material on the floor. However, the Mother, who says she was the first person in the room, was entirely clear that she saw William fully suspended with his feet not touching the floor. She was asked twice about that and gave a clear answer. The Father said the same thing and said he was positive that William&#8217;s feet were off the floor.  It therefore cannot be the parents&#8217; case that William died in partial hanging when he was found. The lack of hanging marks is therefore highly material.  </p>

This cannot be ruled out as impossible, but it seems to me to be highly unlikely. If William was trying to kill himself by hanging then he would surely have stepped or jumped off the sill rather than partially suspending himself. It seems to me highly improbable that he was playing some kind of &#8220;game&#8221;, given that he had to tie the duvet cover round the curtain rail and then tie the knots.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The second factor is that the marks on William&#8217;s neck are, according to both pathologists, more indicative of compression of the neck by strangulation than by hanging. Dr Marnerides was careful to say that he could not rule out these marks being from a low-level hanging, but it was clear that his view was that strangulation was more likely. There is little absolute clarity on this point because the ligature which is said to have been used is the duvet and that, being relatively soft, might not have left a ligature mark. But on the evidence as a whole, a partial hanging seems to me to be very unlikely.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The third factor is the bruises on the upper limbs. If William hanged himself then there is no obvious explanation for these at the time of his death. The medical evidence was that the bruises were most likely to be recent (hours) before his death and not a number of days earlier, although this could not be ruled out. There was suggestion in cross examination that they might have been caused by the teachers restraining him at school, but there was no evidence suggesting this was the case. Occasional references were made to William playing rugby but there was no evidence he had done that in the days before his death. There is no evidence that William had been in a fight or physically restrained in the time frame of the bruises. There was some suggestion in cross examination that they could have been caused by the manhandling of William into and out of the car. This is not impossible, but the form of the bruises is more in keeping with him having been gripped in a fight (looking like finger marks).  </p>

I fully accept that Mr Lee is not a knot expert, but the crucial part of his evidence was the tests that he carried out.  If this was a fully suspended hanging then Mr Lee&#8217;s dynamic tests are more relevant than his static tests. William weighed 56kg. The outcome of the first dynamic test indicates very strongly that if the knot had been of the size shown in the police photos then it is likely that it would have unravelled and not taken the weight. It took a considerable level of tightening that would probably have been beyond the strength of a 13 year old boy to make it hold anything equivalent to William&#8217;s weight, particularly as the knot had to be tied well above his head. This is another factor where it is not possible to be too definitive. William might have been stronger than I and Mr Lee are assuming. The knot might have been smaller and tighter and then loosened, as Mr Vater seemed to be suggesting in cross examination, though it is difficult to understand the mechanism by which this would have happened. However, overall the combination of the police photo and Mr Lee&#8217;s tests cast very considerable doubt as to whether the knot would have withstood a fully suspended hanging. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Further, Mr Lee&#8217;s dynamic test indicates that if there had been a fully suspended hanging, the curtain rail would probably have distorted. This is a factor which in my view carries some forensic weight, but not very much. This is because if William did hang himself from the curtain rail then that in itself might have led to some structural failing both in the rail and the brackets. I cannot be confident that the rail and the brackets were in the same condition as on 23 June and this means that I think it would not be safe to place any reliance on the evidence of distortion of the curtain rail.  </p>

Unfortunately, because the matter was not immediately investigated as a crime scene the police investigation at the time of William&#8217;s death was flawed. This has undoubtedly made my task more difficult, but it has not prevented me reaching clear conclusions on the material before me.  </p>

On the evidence I have heard, this is a family where considerable levels of aggression and, on occasion, violent behaviour has occurred and seems to be normalised. The incidents where there is external verification are spread over a long period, but that does not tell me anything about what was happening in private in the family home. In 2006, the Father was witnessed assaulting Charles and I have no doubt this event occurred, despite the Father and Charles&#8217;s protestations to the contrary in the witness box.

The evidence of Mr Brown when he was excluded from [The Secondary School] was not minor misbehaviour but seriously violent and out of control behaviour. This is supported by the teachers at [The Pupil Referral Unit]. It is also in my view important that the parents sought to minimise this and the other incidents, invariably suggesting that the school overstated the incidents and they were always the schools&#8217; fault. The fact that the parents, and siblings, were not expressing deep concern about William&#8217;s behaviour at school, both at the time and now, suggests something unusual and very worrying was happening in the family. The explanations of family shame and not wanting to discuss William&#8217;s death do not explain the parental responses to William&#8217;s conduct at the time he was in [The Primary School] and [The Pupil Referral Unit]. This appears to be a family where severe aggression was either accepted or normalised. It is important to be clear what I am not finding. There is no record of persistent domestic violence; there is no record of physical violence by the Mother; and the records of physical violence by the Father and Charles are limited. However, I have no doubt that this is a family capable of both violence and aggressive conduct to each other. This is highly relevant when I come to my conclusions on what I believe most likely to have happened.  </p>

In fact, none of the family put forward any explanation as to why he would have committed suicide.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">Charles referred to. However, there is no evidence that William was engaged in the Blue Whale challenge; he had undertaken none of the other Blue Whale stages; Tanya makes no mention of it, and the school had no knowledge of Blue Whale or any similar game at the time. Tanya did refer to William having made himself pass out at school a couple of months before he died. I cannot say it is impossible that he was trying to make himself pass out and it went horribly wrong, but this seems to me to be highly unlikely given the complexity of tying the duvet cover round the curtain rail and climbing onto the window sill and all the evidence about William&#8217;s state of mind that day. He might have played such a game in front of friends at school (perhaps to show off); it seems very different to do it at home in a locked room in the way suggested.  In relation to the image Charles refers to, teenagers look at a lot of violent images in video games. They very rarely copy them by committing suicide in the manner suggested.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The final issue is the events of the afternoon of 23 June 2017. As I have already said, between William and Lucy leaving school and the call to the ambulance service at 17.57, there is no independent verification of any of the family members&#8217; evidence. I have a number of inconsistent stories, many of which have changed between the different versions given. I note the Local Authority&#8217;s schedule of inconsistencies filed with its Closing which ran to 19 pages. I have only referred to a few of them above. Not all of them I accept, and some are explicable, but there was a huge amount of inconsistent evidence from the family.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It is not possible to piece together one coherent version of what happened. The Father&#8217;s evidence that the Mother only got home after Charles left and just as he and Tina were leaving for Wickes simply does not make sense on the time line. The story about why the Father drilled the door again does not make sense, and has changed. If he was worried about William, the logical thing was to go upstairs and look for him. If he was worried about Lucy, the logical thing was to go outside and look for her. There was no rational or reasonable ground to drill the door because someone else might be inside. This just made no sense.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Further there are critical inconsistencies which undermine the story I have been told. Charles said that he and his parents had spoken in recent days to William about not going out. The parents made no reference to this, save very briefly in the Father&#8217;s statement. The parents were strangely reticent about the purchase of the TV, when this should have been a positive thing and there was no obvious reason for them not to explain about it. Tina and the parents lied about Lucy not being in the room when the ambulance service was called. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In my view, much the most likely scenario is that there was an argument, probably about William going out, someone lost their temper and in the ensuing fight (or perhaps restraint) William was strangled, possibly with a soft ligature. I make clear here that I am not making findings about this being what happened, for the reasons I have explained it is not possible to know. I merely posit this scenario to show why in my view it is significantly more likely that William was killed by the Father, Mother and/or Charles, than that he committed suicide.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I am faced here with two inherently improbable occurrences, William committing suicide or William being killed by a family member. However, there is one version of events which fits with all the evidence taken together, namely that he was killed. It fits with the forensic evidence of the cause of death, the bruises and the likelihood of the knot unravelling. It also fits with the family&#8217;s overall characteristics and would explain why they could not give a coherent and consistent narrative, and why neither Tina nor Charles asked at the obvious times as to what had happened to William. It would explain why Tina and her parents lied about whether Lucy was in the room when the ambulance service were on the phone. I have no doubt that on the balance of probability it is significantly more likely that he was killed than that he committed suicide. I have taken into account the surveillance material but ultimately determined it is of little value.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I turn then to whether I can exclude any of the three people from the pool. I have somewhat reluctantly concluded that I cannot. I will do the exercise referred to in Re B. Firstly, who had the opportunity.  It is clear on the evidence that the Father, Mother and Charles all had the opportunity; they were all in the house at the period when William could have died.  The Father was in the house throughout, is capable of violence and has lied in his evidence. The Mother was also in the house at the relevant time on her own evidence. It is much less clear that she is capable of violence, and I have no doubt that she was distraught at William&#8217;s death. However, that does not mean that she did not play a key role in whatever happened. Given that I cannot reach a conclusion, on the balance of probabilities, of the circumstances of William&#8217;s death other than that he was killed rather than committed suicide, I think that there is a real possibility that the Mother was directly involved in his death.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I have thought closely about whether I can take Charles out of the pool.  The timing of the bruises and the injuries does not help me to establish whether the death happened before or after Charles left. I thought that Charles was the most truthful of the family witnesses, much of what he said seemed heartfelt and rang true. However, there is strong reason to believe that the parents were changing the timeline to try to establish that Charles was out of the house at the time William died.
