At the first hearing in the FPC on 6 August the reaction of the father was so concerning that the police attended the family home whilst everyone was at court and secured a police protection order in relation to S and J and their cousin. This was because the father stormed out of court threatening to kill himself and that social services would never get his children.  The FPC gave directions on 6 August, including giving permission to the LA to amend the application to include all the children. They adjourned the matter for a contested interim care hearing on 9 August. On 9 August the FPC granted the applications for interim care orders in relation to S and J. The children were placed with Ms L, where they have remained to date. They have had supervised contact with their parents. Unfortunately the father refused to sign a contact agreement, setting out various expectations. As a result he has not attended contact since early September 2012. The mother has continued to attend contact alone.</p>

The mother signed an agreement with the LA. The father refused and as a result a prohibited steps order was made restricting the people who could stay at the family home to family members, due to concerns about strangers in the home and the children being left in the care of unknown adults. The matter was listed for a further contested hearing, as the parents withdrew their consent to the agreement. The hearing on 18 September had to be adjourned due to delays in getting the court documents translated and the LA pursuing applications for interim care orders for MA and MO. There had been no improvement in the home situation and in some areas it had deteriorated. The LA were particularly concerned about the risk of emotional harm caused by the parents instructing MA and MO not to discuss matters with the social worker who, according to the social worker, they had built up a good relationship with. Further directions were made, including giving the mother permission to file evidence concerning her mental health and giving the LA permission to refuse contact with the father pending him signing the contact agreement.  There were further delays, particularly in translation of the documents, and the hearing listed on 4 October had to be adjourned to a two day hearing on 23 and 24 October. </p>

She said her relationship with the parents had initially been very good, but she accepted it had deteriorated by the time the LA issued proceedings. It was suggested to her that was due to the discrimination by the LA against the parents; that they had prematurely ruled the parents out as future carers. She denied that was the case. She pointed to the extensive support given by her to the family prior to the commencement of proceedings, which she said had elicited no improvement in the parent&#8217;s care of the children.

Just prior to the interim care orders for MA and MO she noted a change in their behaviour towards her. The parents had refused to allow her to see them at the family home so she had to see them at school.

She was asked about why she had not taken up advice about not smoking during her pregnancy with S. She said most her of babies had been born prematurely and had low birth weight. She said she had tried to get the father to attend contact but had been unable to persuade him to sign the agreement. She was inconsistent as to whether she would accept any help or advice in the future from the LA. In relation to the events last Friday she said they were contacted by some Polish friends to say MA had come to their home. She asked them to bring him to her. She said when he arrived she did not phone the police or the LA, as MA begged them not to. She did try and contact her solicitor and left a message. She denied MA smoked cannabis. She said she would not try and hide him and when the police attended MA went with them.</p>

He was adamant that this had all been made up by the LA, in particular the social workers JJ and AC. He felt very strongly that he and his family, as well as the wider Roma community, had been discriminated by this LA who had removed the children from the parents care on the basis of untruthful evidence. As he put it in one of his long answers <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;..all her [JJ] evidence is a lie. What she wants to achieve is damage my personality and discriminate against me&#8217;.</span> He has pursued a number of complaints about the behaviour of the social workers and other professionals who have been involved in the family. It was very difficult to get him to focus on the questions. He regarded the requirement to sign the contact agreement as humiliating and an exploitation of parents. He was unable to see the wider picture of the negative impact of his stance on the children. On the contrary, as he said in his evidence, it was a good thing that they did not see him at contact as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;they abscond so I can see them&#8217;.</span> Trying to get him to focus on the questions put to him in his evidence became almost impossible. This resonates with references in the papers of the various attempts made by others to try and discuss things with him. He would hijack any issue with his unswerving agenda that everything had been made up and the discrimination against the family. Sadly, his evidence did not greatly assist me and merely confirmed the various assessments that had been made in the written material.</p>

In their oral evidence the parents, particularly the father, made it clear they considered the social workers had made up the evidence in their statements. Whilst this court is not unfamiliar with parents feeling the social workers have exaggerated their evidence it is rare for the suggestion to be it is effectively all made up. In considering the parents position I am very conscious of the very difficult circumstances in which they arrived in this country. It is accepted they and their family were trafficked. They have had to endure moving to a new area, albeit with the support of specialist organisations. Their spoken English is limited and they have required interpreters to give instructions and oral evidence. The parents are convinced that they have been discriminated against by the LA because the family are of Roma origin. They repeat this at every opportunity without examining or considering the underlying evidence.</p>

The support given by JJ, who was the first allocated social worker in September 2011 when the family arrived in D. She has attached to her statement dated 30 August 2012 a detailed schedule of support given to the family by her and other professionals, which has not been challenged. It demonstrates support given in assisting the family improve their housing, getting school and nursery placements for the children, travel expenses, liaising with other agencies (for example attending the schools at the request of the parents), assisting with claims for financial and other support as well as undertaking regular social work home visits with an interpreter. It is difficult to see how such a level of support can found a basis for suggesting this family had been discriminated against. In her oral evidence JJ described how she considered she had a good working relationship with the family at the start, in particular the children, but this became increasingly difficult. It was clear the father&#8217;s attitude was becoming increasingly entrenched. JJ was refused entry to the family home; she had to see the children at school. The Guardian&#8217;s assessment is that the parents willingly accepted the practical support from the LA, but the moment their parenting was questioned the barriers came down. I agree.</p>

Unfortunately the resulting report merely provided yet another example of the parents&#8217; uncompromising and entrenched attitude. They were simply unable to prioritise the children&#8217;s welfare over their own agenda. Whilst the mother&#8217;s position is somewhat less hardened than the fathers, they present themselves as joint carers and my assessment is that the father has the controlling influence in the relationship.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I have carefully considered the detailed written submission made by Mr Pidduck that essentially the LA process was flawed as the combination of the police attendance at the family home on 6 August, the terms of the draft contact agreement, the failure to accede to an ISW assessment, and the suggestion that the LA had made their mind up at an early stage in the proceedings provides some justification for the father&#8217;s position in not co-operating or having confidence in the LA. I consider there are a number of difficulties with that submission and I reject it. First, in the light of the information before the LA on 6 August and the father&#8217;s behaviour they cannot be criticised for referring the matter to the police in the way they did. Having considered the oral evidence of AC I am satisfied that she embarked on the parenting assessment with an entirely open mind. It was a careful piece of work which gave the parents every opportunity to participate in, separately and together. The assessment demonstrates again that the father was simply unable to discuss the LA concerns about his parenting, as he simply would not accept them. It was accepted by the parents that the assessment by Dr Frith was an important preliminary step before considering as ISW assessment. The position statement on behalf of the father at the hearing on 25 January stated <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;the merits of awaiting the outcome of the psychological assessment [before pursuing an assessment by an ISW] are recognised and, subject to instructions from the father, this application will not be pursued at this stage.&#8217;</span> The father gave those instructions as the ISW assessment was not pursued at that hearing. The parents failed to attend the appointment with Dr Frith for reasons which were only advanced for the first time during this hearing, nearly three months after that failed appointment. So even if the court accepts (which I don&#8217;t) the analysis advanced on behalf of the father he failed to attend the appointment that could provide the foundation for the independent assessment he said was required.</p>

They took no steps to return MA when they became aware of him being at their friends house, they did not contact the authorities (although the father states he did in his most recent statement) and there is no evidence to corroborate any contact with their solicitors. It has all the hallmarks of the parents being behind this as a last ditch attempt to bolster their case this week by trying to demonstrate that MA wishes to return home. What their actions have done is increase his anxiety as so graphically described by Mr P in his oral evidence.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">I am entirely satisfied on the evidence that if the children returned to the care of their parents there would be no change in the parenting or care they received prior to being placed with foster carers. The parents can see no basis to change as, in their view, all the evidence has been made up. They will, in my judgment, not accept any social work intervention or support that questions their parenting. Therefore each of the children, if they return to the care of their parents, are likely to continue to suffer harm.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Whilst the LA plan involves separation of the siblings, that has to be weighed in the balance with the other considerations. Sibling relationships are important and the research evidence suggests the most enduring relationship. J and S will be placed together, although they will not have the benefit of direct contact with their older siblings. This has to be balanced with their need for security and stability due to their age. Whilst MA and MO will be in separate placements the plan envisages regular sibling contact between themselves and with L. They will lose the benefit of direct contact with J and S and will need to be considered carefully as part of their life story work.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">The parents rightly emphasise the Roma origins of the children and their Catholic faith. The evidence suggests that none of the placements proposed for the children by the LA will be with a Slovakian family, whether of Roma origin or not. This is an important consideration, but it cannot determine or overshadow other welfare considerations. As RR and Ms Royle described in their evidence this aspect of the children&#8217;s identity and origin can be dealt with in placements in a number of ways. The LA have made significant efforts to try and gather information to help with this from the parents and other agencies. Whilst it can never replicate living within the birth family what it can do is make sure that aspect of each of the children&#8217;s background is properly recognised by those who care for them.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Each of the children has suffered harm. I am satisfied they are each at risk of future harm if returned to the care of their parents. This is due to the inability of the parents to recognise the deficits in their parenting in the past, and that harmful parenting is likely to continue in the future. There is little or no prospect of the parents accepting parenting advice and support in the future. Put simply they see no need to change.</p>

I am entirely satisfied I don&#8217;t. For the reasons set out above I do not accept the reasons why the parents did not attend the appointment with Dr Frith. It is revealing they don&#8217;t suggest any further assessment themselves. In reality I doubt they saw any need for it in the first place; this is consistent with what they said at the LAC review in January.  Their views about there being no need for them to change are entrenched.</p>

It will ensure he retains an allocated social worker, at least during the currency of the supervision order. It will help provide a structure to support him in his educational and emotional needs. Finally, it will enable him to access support, independent of his parents.</p>

I note this has the support of the Slovakian Central Authority.
