E&#8217;s primary and only attachment now is with his prospective adopters and to move him now would cause considerable emotional harm and distress.  That coupled with the longer-term risk posed by the parents&#8217; failure to accept the findings and their inability to work honestly with professionals, in my judgment, makes the risk too great to run.</span></p>

However, the brief summary is as follows:  Mother is now aged 43, she is an Indian national, was previously married to GS and they have two children, L, now 20 and J, now 13.  Mother came to the UK in October&#160;2019 on a visitors&#8217; visa and both daughters, and her husband joined her a couple of months later.  It seems the marriage ended very swiftly, in or around December&#160;2019, and at some point in 2019 to 2020, Mother had formed a relationship with E&#8217;s Father, NS.  He has been in the UK since 1999 and is a British Citizen.</span></p>

NS pushed Mother, then pregnant onto the sofa, J tried to intervene, and NS slapped her on the cheek twice and NS was abusive to Mother and both girls.</span></p>

Mother was taken to hospital for a check-up and Mother and both daughters were then looked after by the Local Authority and engaged in interviews with both the police and the Local Authority.  They each confirmed the allegations made to the police on that day, on 18&#160;August, but by October, L withdrew her statement, saying she wanted to get on with her life and focus on her studies, although she stood by her allegations.  The police took no further action.  Mother and the girls were rehoused by the Local Authority.  However, by November&#160;2020, Mother and J returned to live with NS and L went to live in Birmingham with a boyfriend.</span></p>

I then had a fact-finding hearing to consider the allegations made by L, Mother and J.  In fact, L withdrew her cooperation from those proceedings and so a fact-finding hearing took place only to consider the allegations of physical assault by NS on Mother and the two girls and the allegations of failure to protect in relation to Mother prioritising her relationship with NS.  As the fact-finding judgment shows, Mother had, by the time of the fact-finding hearing, resiled from all of her earlier statements and said that NS had not assaulted her or any of the children and she blamed L for making up false allegations and indeed J also said the allegations were false and L had put her up to it and L had slapped her, not NS.</span></p>

In addition, finally, I concluded that Mother had prioritised her relationship with NS in a way which put J at risk of significant harm.</span></p>

Having considered all of the available evidence, she opposed the parents resuming care of E and considered that the available evidence from DV Act and from the mobile phones showed insufficient insight by the parents into the risk arising out of continuing parental relationship and the Court&#8217;s findings.  In addition, Ms Dawkins acknowledged the significant harm that is likely to be caused to E, if he were moved from his prospective adopters.  Therefore, for those reasons, the Local Authority invited the Court to grant the adoption order.</span></p>

However, carrying out the balancing exercise of the welfare analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the plan for adoption as against a return to birth parents, I have to consider as a starting point, E&#8217;s reality now. In summary, I conclude that there are greater risks and uncertainties in moving E from his prospective adopters to the birth parents than in leaving him where he is.  If he were removed from the prospective adopters, there is a high probability of fairly immediate and significant distress and trauma occurring for E.  Whilst the Guardian says that this could be managed with a proper and sensitive transition plan, I prefer the evidence of Ms&#160;Terry, who has assessed E&#8217;s attachment and the impact of the move and I agree that whilst it may not be irreparable harm, it would be very significant distress and harm that E would encounter.  I was particularly struck by the point that he has been told by his prospective adopters that this is his forever family, and that for a child of two years, eight months to be removed from the only family he has any memory of, would be very damaging indeed.</span></p>

The Local Authority have proposed that their plan for E is letter box contact once a year and the Guardian supports that.  In her evidence, AS identified that because of their opposition to adoption, the parents would simply not be able to manage post-adoption contact in a way that kept E in mind, and it would be too difficult for them and for E to manage that contact.  I agree with that approach.  Therefore, whilst I understand that the parents&#8217; desperate wish to see their son again, I am satisfied that imposing an order on these adoptive parents is not in E&#8217;s best interests.  They are, however, committed to the indirect contact, and will keep contact under review and I hope that in later life, they will be able to support E in seeking out his birth family, should he wish to do so.</span></p>
