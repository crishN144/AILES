There are no concerns about his care and he has progressed well in that placement. At the adjourned Final Hearing in August 2022, it became apparent that Joe&#8217;s foster carer sought to care for him throughout his minority. In the circumstances, it seemed to me that the court had no choice but to adjourn that Final Hearing. The FC has not sought to become a party to the proceedings and all parties have agreed that that is not necessary. She has, with the assistance of the father&#8217;s solicitor, filed a statement from herself and from her daughter, F, in support of their position. </p>

They have a dog and two horses, which they walk and ride regularly. They both regard Joe as being a member of their family and see him as being very attached to each of them. Joe was her first foster care child and in the last 16 months she has also provided some respite care for another child.

The article refers to a lot of historical research on the concepts of being in foster care associated with stigma. In particular, there is reference to a review done in 2015 by Silver, Golding and Roberts, which summarises poor psychological outcomes for children in care academically, socially and psychologically with increased mental health problems.

So is fast coming to the point where he will remember little else other than living with her, over and above the time he spent living with his mother in various placements. This research also does not provide information as to whether the children involved in the sample were children with whose parents agreed that they should remain in foster care. </p>

The article also emphasizes that children need to be helped to build and develop their resilience and sense of identity and self-esteem to recover from those difficult experiences. Positive relationships with their foster carers, their peers, teachers, therapists and birth families, where possible, will be key in helping children to rebuild their resources, identity and self-esteem, so tells me the article. The article ends by saying that in fact more direct research is needed about this area. I am inclined to agree. </p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">Having read this article, I have also asked myself the question, whether there is any less stigma to being a child subject of a Special Guardianship Order or even an adopted child. There does not appear to be any specific research on this point, but if friends at school or peers find out that you live with your grandma, for example and not your mum and dad, the explanation, one way or another, in my view, will still likely involve being asked to explain how you came to be placed with your grandma. Whether she is your real grandma, and what may well lead to a discussion around the fact that there was a period in foster care before this happened. </p>

The assessment was undertaken in the context of Joe living with his mother under the supervision of the maternal aunt.

In her evidence, to which I will refer later, Miss Seekins felt that at the time, although the maternal aunt was supporting the mother and Joe, it created difficult relationships between them, with the mother and her sister, because she felt that her sister was taking over. </p>

During the period of pre-proceedings in November 2020, Joe and his mother moved to a mother and baby foster placement, which endured for approximately four months. This provided an environment as close to normal family life, where parenting can be modelled. The carer indicated that she then sought to serve notice on the placement, as progress was not being made. It was considered that the mother was unable to meet Joe&#8217;s needs consistently and she was said to be preoccupied with her mobile phone and Joe being given insufficient attention and supervision.</p>

It is clear now that having considered all the evidence regarding welfare and the completion of all the assessments, that one of the significant factors of risk that is ongoing is the mother&#8217;s complex profile in respect of her mental health. </p>

Sadly, the social worker was on a period of leave and so she did not attend the home. Nursery provision was not provided immediately, until ten days after return to the community and after some bedding in sessions, the only real help, says the mother&#8217;s team, was short lived help through, a support worker, who helped the mother find the nursery and fill in nursery forms. </p>

Up until the hearing in August, the social worker&#8217;s understanding had been that she was prepared to care for Joe as long as she was required to. Obviously since then, FC  has confirmed that she would wish to continue caring for Joe under the Care Order.

It is clear that she holds in high regard her ability to parent and care for Joe and her own family, which comes from a core strength of being passionate, caring and patient. She has been approved as a long term foster carer for two children, but said that she would only pick another child if she felt that that child would fit in with Joe. </p>

Her reasons really centred around her genuine belief that she is better enabled to help Joe, as he may develop any of the difficulties exhibited by his parents, and she would be able to access effective support much quicker as a foster carer under a Care Order. </p>

Social work visits and potentially not knowing that your carers have committed to look after you as your parents for the rest of your life.</p>

That might result in him internalising feelings of stigma or the fear of being bullied at school. Knowing that he is a foster child may cause him to feel embarrassed and internalise feelings that he is not good enough.</p>

However, the actual evidence in this case from the social worker was at this time, there is no risk of placement breakdown for Joe with FC. She wants to care for him. She is committed to caring for him as his foster carer until at least he reaches his majority and possibly beyond. If she was offering to pursue an SGO or adoption, then her age or any other factors referred to by the social worker would not be relevant, like her perceived motivation of FC not wanting to let go or of her wanting to seek his further opinion on legal orders when he is older. I find myself asking, why are they relevant factors in her offering to care for him as his long term foster carer? </p>

Joe will likely need ongoing support to help him understand the decisions that have been made for him as he grows and becomes more aware of his family&#8217;s circumstances.

Sometimes creating a fantasy image of their birth parents, or conversely demonising them. Not knowing where they fit in. Feeling rejected, and feelings of insecurity. Identity issues may come into the fore in adolescent years and the feeling of being rejected. Potentially meeting their birth parents and then suffering another period of loss in them not being what the child thought they might be. Adopters generally are prepared to understand these feelings and are trained and are provided with guidance of how to support a child through those complex emotions.</p>

On the contrary, there is going to be a risk of breakdown, because he is an older child that is being asked to start again in terms of investing in his placement and having to consolidate the existing losses and trauma that he has already experienced. It seems fairly obvious to me that one of the factors in the welfare checklist is the likely effect of change on a child and the reason for that is that the longer a child is stable and feels safe in a placement, the more difficult it becomes to justify moving the child and causing a level of disruption that could be wholly detrimental to the stability that is actually trying to be achieved in the longer term.</p>

There is no reason to think that having raised him until he is 18, that FC or her daughter would suddenly not consider Joe as part of their family anymore or vice a versa. ii) furthermore, the children's Guardian&#8217;s analysis is entirely flawed in the assertion that FC is being &#8216;indecisive&#8217; because she does not want to make any tough decisions which is what being a parent is about. </p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">This conclusion is wholly unjustified and is not based in any evidence. On the contrary, FC has bought up her own two children, with no local authority involvement. As I have already found, there were layers of honesty in her thinking and she is doing what she believes is the best planning for Joe&#8217;s future. She has not asked Joe whether she should fight for him during these proceedings. She has fought so because of her love for him and her conviction that his placement with her will meet his needs. </p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">iii) Equally, whilst I accept that because FC is 62, she is statistically more likely to be at an age where health difficulties may arise. The evidence before the Court, however, is that there are no concerns about her medical health. She is fit and active and the fact is, as I said earlier, if she was applying for an SGO now, this would not be an issue at all. iv) I reject the children's Guardian&#8217;s conclusion that FC and F are not offering Joe permanency. Her repeat use of the word &#8216;certainty&#8217; is wrong legally and is wrong in reality. No one can offer this nor can it be promised and neither is this what is expected from adopters. </p>

Her analysis, I am afraid, was not careful and considered. She did not even go back to speak to FC after the hearing in August and she certainly did not speak to them again before filing her final report, nor before we started this Final Hearing. </p>

I accept the submission of Mr Williams. There is paucity in her analysis of the pros and cons of long-term fostering versus adoption in her final report. vi) in particular, I find that there was a lack of analysis in respect of the impact of moving Joe from FC   and the emotional harm that that would bring, and further a lack of analysis as to whether the parents are unreasonably withholding their consent, given that there is another realistic option which, but for the nature of the order being sought, she would have supported as an alternative plan. </p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">In so far as the three new areas of concern that the children's Guardian relied on, to suggest that Joe may have to be removed from the care of FC on an interim basis - I entirely disagree with her analysis of FC&#8217;s evidence because of the following: a) the reference/comment to FC being too close to the parents was withdrawn and in any event the Local Authority supervising contact under a Care Order would maintain a boundary. b) I reject her assertion that FC does not understand the stigma of being in care and I will return to this point below, but she drew an analogy with bullying. I found FC&#8217;s evidence to be considered and realistic in that children suffer many types of stigmas in a school environment, and it is about how such stigma is managed and how Joe can be supported. I am satisfied that FC understands that there is a risk of this externally and internally for Joe.</p>

The Local Authority accepted that these were not inflicted. They were as a result of lack of supervision. If anything, when FC was talking about fingertip bruising and grabbing, it made me concerned about the nature of the bruising that she saw on Joe and that whilst she was trying to be understanding of the mother&#8217;s difficulties, she was worried that this might have been something more than just him bumping into things as a result of being unsupervised. I am satisfied that FC fully understands her safeguarding duties to protect Joe, and I have no doubt that if he ever suffered any injuries during his contact with his parents, she would report this immediately. She does not need any training about this issue.</p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">In my judgment, and considering the totality of the evidence, sadly both professionals, social worker and children's Guardian, have failed to demonstrate a proper understanding of what permanence might look like for Joe on each option. It appears to me that they closed their minds to the permanence that long term fostering can offer Joe and its consequential benefits. They each failed to remind themselves that the Court has to be satisfied that nothing else will do, resulting in each of their evaluations being flawed.</p>

I have accepted that there is a risk of this for Joe, but I do not see that there is necessarily, for him, any less stigma between him being identified in the playground as a looked after child, or as a child who is subject to an SGO or as an adopted child. Because if he is asked the question of why he lives with his &#8216;grandma&#8217;, who is not his real grandma, then the answer will still involve a conversation about the fact that he has spent time in care, or of how he became an adopted child. I am very conscious that for Joe he has known nothing else at this point, other than being in foster care with a carer who he calls grandma and an Auntie F, who are loving, nurturing and caring and really gentle and attuned to him.</p>

On the contrary, they have already been telling him that he is extra loved, because he lives with them, but he gets to see his parents. I also do not accept that he might be more identifiable, because he has a carer who he calls grandma in the playground. In the current world of mixed and blended families, there are so many issues that might cause a child to feel stigmatised and lots of children live with families of many different makeups and have different surnames to their carers, or even their parents, especially step-parents. </p>

She is willing to commit to the central plank of long term fostering and is willing to make that a serious long term commitment with Leicestershire County Council. She is offering him a permanent placement and there is no reason for me to find that there is a risk of placement breakdown in her care, given that I accept what she says about her commitment to Joe.</p>

He is already an inclusive part of her family network, with a sense that her home is his home. She describes him as a &#8216;member of our family&#8217;. He has a relationship with the wider family members and the family pets. She has support in caring for him. </p>

I accept her evidence that he fits into her family. She is seeking to care for Joe because she wants what is best for him, rather than seeing her role as a foster carer as an ongoing career for her. </p>

They are because of her wish to have support from her supervising social worker. Support that she can get Joe, were he to need it, and for him to be involved in the decision making as he gets older. These are objectively reasonable justifications for the position that she has taken. They are not focused on any form of financial motivation and I cannot see how these aspects can be a negative, which is how both the social worker and the Guardian see them. </p>

A forever family with her, with ongoing support from the Local Authority, which she does not envisage as being intrusive to him, but at this stage aiding her to assist him, should he develop needs that are over and above any other child of his age, given his parents&#8217; difficulties.

Indeed, the backup proposal from the Local Authority is that Joe would remain with FC. Her care is clearly of a high standard and in any event she does not even rule out the other permanency options in the future. In my judgment, it is highly likely that any matching panel will approve her in the circumstances. </p>

This provides a stable and alternative option should something unforeseen occur and in any event this could also be done on a private law basis. It does not have to be as a foster carer. g) There have never been any attempts to destabilise the placement by either parent. Both have behaved entirely appropriately throughout the proceedings and despite their apparent proximity to the placement. The fact is that they have cried together at the back of court. In my view, that is entirely natural, given their collective love of Joe and collective opposition to the Local Authority and Guardian&#8217;s case for adoption.</p>

He has the opportunity to have a relationship and knowledge of his siblings. j) If and when FC    is ready to speak to Joe about his legal status, I have little doubt that this will be done in a sensitive, supportive and positive way.</p>

The level of intervention from the Local Authority that Joe will be exposed to, as a looked after child, does not tip the balance in favour of placing him for adoption. Long term fostering, in the circumstances, will do for Joe and will meet his needs more than adequately. The Local Authority wants permission to look for an adoptive placement and find a family that can provide Joe with a stable life and a family life. In my judgment, he already has that with FC.</p>
