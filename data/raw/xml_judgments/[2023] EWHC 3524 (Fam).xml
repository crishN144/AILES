	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">There have been two court hearings in Ukraine in respect of parties' marriage. The first instance decision was in May 2023. That decision didn't require the mother to enter into negotiations for reconciliation with the father. It acknowledged the request for a divorce from the father and he referred to a report of domestic abuse made by the mother to the police in December 2022. The court found the report showed unfounded allegation of domestic abuse against the father towards the mother. The lower court however was satisfied that the mother&#8217;s fear of harm to herself and A from the Father was well founded. The Father appealed and the Appeal Court upheld the findings by Lower Court save that it set aside the findings of the lower court as Mother&#8217;s fear of domestic abuse to herself, and her child was not proved on the basis of no evidence filed by the mother. It is agreed between the parties that I should have regard to those decisions of the lower court and appeal court but neither preclude me from having regard to the mother&#8217;s allegations made to this Court at their highest. </span></p>

The court needs to look at protective measures to go back. The mother indicted that she didn't feel safe to return home and wanted accommodation back in Ukraine. This would be confidential for herself and A and would be paid for by the father. She would receive an adequate amount of maintenance and any order made in this court will be lodged by the Father with the Ukrainian court prior to her return. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The father contended that the parties had a happy relationship, although sadly he acknowledged that the mother and he had suffered the heartache of having 4 miscarriages and 3 stillbirths before A being born. This rosy picture of life of the mother and father in Ukraine does not sit well with the mother&#8217;s decision to leave her home and Ukraine with A in January this year. The father doesn't suggest she did this for any other reason but the war. The absence of any reason to me is that the mother&#8217;s actions equates to the allegations that she was a victim of domestic abuse and adds weight to the mother&#8217;s allegations. This view accords with some of the recordings by the Ukrainian court in which it is recorded that whilst the father expressed affection for their child he didn't for the mother. In pursuit of his application, he looked at reconciliation and gave reasons. It focused much on the message it would send to others and their neighbours rather than reasons relating to their loving relationship. Therefore, I am satisfied it is appropriate to take the mother&#8217;s allegations of domestic abuse at their highest.</span></p>

I am satisfied with the protective measures now offered by the father to provide confidential address and financial provisions and the following order by me that he doesn't threaten, pester or harass the mother. The protective measures in place and the order of this court will be lodged with the Ukrainian court prior to her and A&#8217;s return. It's appropriate and in the child&#8217;s best interests for the summary return of her to Ukraine. I acknowledge the war exists, but I am satisfied that where they live is not affected by the war to a degree that it would limit the ordering of return. </span></p>
