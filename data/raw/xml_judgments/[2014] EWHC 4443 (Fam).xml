	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-weight:bold">THE JUDGE</span>:  This is an application for maintenance pending suit made on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2014 by a wife in the course of her substantive application for financial remedy orders.  At this hearing the wife has been represented by Mr&#160;Howard&#160;QC and Mr&#160;Castle and the husband by Mr&#160;Posnansky QC.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The wife&#8217;s case is that the husband should pay maintenance, for herself and the children, of not less than approximately &#163;270,000 per year but that a proper sum is &#163;392,000.  The husband offers global payments of &#163;202,000.  If the wife&#8217;s substantive claims are not resolved for a year, which is likely if they are not settled, the sum at issue is between &#163;70,000 and &#163;190,000.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The parties have together spent a sum approaching &#163;100,000 on this application.  Some of this expenditure might have been incurred in any event, because this hearing has also been listed to determine some directions, but it is clear to me that the bulk has been spent on the application for maintenance pending suit.  One of the issues this inevitably raises, and which I address below, is whether this has been a proportionate application.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Dealing briefly with the background, the parties married in 2002.  The marriage came to an end in 2013 and the parties separated finally in February 2014.  There are four children of the marriage aged between 3 and 8.  Following the breakdown of the marriage an alternative home was, by agreement, purchased for the wife and the children.  It is not far from the former matrimonial home and cost &#163;2.9 million.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The parties&#8217; resources, broadly expressed, are as follows.  The husband has non-trust assets with a combined value of approximately &#163;49 million.  The former matrimonial home is valued at approximately &#163;2.6 million; its value depends on the amount of land included with it.  The husband also has an interest in assets held in trust.  The total value of these assets is approximately &#163;130 million but the husband&#8217;s life interest is confined to approximately &#163;100 million.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The husband has a very substantial income of up to approximately &#163;1.7 million net per year.  A significant proportion of this is retained, in the trusts or businesses, to meet expenditure and for re-investment.  However, on a broad analysis, and the contrary has not been argued, I am satisfied that the husband could afford to pay what the wife seeks if I conclude that it is reasonable for him to do so.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Following the separation, the parties sensibly agreed that the wife would transfer to the husband certain assets which were in her name to avoid adverse tax consequences.  As part of this agreement the husband paid the wife a sum of &#163;1 million (now reduced to &#163;960,000) which forms part of the &#163;1.4 million referred to above.  By letter dated 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> April 2014 the husband, through his solicitors, confirmed that he did not expect the wife to use the sum of &#163;1 million to fund her legal costs or her living expenses.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Until July 2014 the husband continued to pay the wife the sums he had paid during the marriage with some additional expenses.  Combined, the husband was paying to or for the wife approximately &#163;9,600 per month from which sum she was paying certain household utility bills.  As from 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> July 2014 the husband began paying the wife &#163;13,900 per month or &#163;167,000 per year.  In addition, he has been paying additional expenses, now confined or to be confined by him, to staff costs of just over &#163;35,000 giving a combined total of &#163;202,000.  As referred to earlier in this judgment, this is the annual sum he proposes by way of maintenance pending suit.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The husband has also been paying the wife&#8217;s legal costs but by letter dated 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> September of 2014 it was indicated that this was to end.  It was asserted that he was simply underwriting the wife&#8217;s costs and he did not intend to continue doing so.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Pursuant to an Order I made in August, the parties have exchanged open proposals.  These followed an unsuccessful private FDR.  The wife seeks &#163;9 million for housing (split between two properties) and further capital of &#163;12 million as an income fund and of &#163;760,000 for certain specified items.  Accordingly, she seeks total resources including her present wealth of, broadly, &#163;22&#160;million.  The husband offers &#163;10 million whilst asserting that the wife&#8217;s housing needs could be met at &#163;3.5 million and her income needs with a fund of &#163;4.3 million.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Looking at their respective offers, the sum at issue before me (at its highest) represents under one per cent of the wife&#8217;s proposals and under two per cent of the husband&#8217;s proposals.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">In her Form E the wife asserts that the family enjoyed an extremely high standard of living, although she adds that this was entirely dictated by the husband and that she would have liked to spend more money on certain things, such as holidays, than the husband permitted.  The budget with her Form E, for herself and the children, totals &#163;518,000 per year.  Very recently the wife has produced a specific budget for her maintenance pending suit application.  This gives the total to which I have referred, namely &#163;392,000.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The wife&#8217;s statement in support of her application is undated but was clearly completed in July 2014.  In this, the wife repeats that her accounts were always overdrawn during the marriage and that meeting those family expenses for which she was responsible, on the sums paid to her by the husband, was a constant struggle. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The husband&#8217;s annual budget in his Form E is &#163;610,000.  A considerable part of this is not in respect of living expenses (or what might properly be called living expenses for the purposes at least of assessing interim maintenance) as it includes, for example, &#163;135,000 for life insurance and family protection insurance and &#163;40,000 for pension contributions.  The amount for general living expenses including the children, save for school fees, is closer to &#163;200,000.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">A major part of the husband&#8217;s case is that the family lived on approximately &#163;230,000 to &#163;265,000 per year including school fees.  With his statement he has produced spreadsheets prepared by his accountant setting out his income and the family&#8217;s expenditure for the tax years 2011, 2012 and 2013.  Based on these schedules the husband contends that the total annual family expenditure was, on average, &#163;245,000 including school fees of approximately &#163;40,000.  He additionally contends that the wife&#8217;s reasonable income needs are &#163;156,000.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Turning now to the parties&#8217; submissions, which I propose only to summarise, Mr&#160;Howard submits that in assessing the wife&#8217;s maintenance claims at this stage of the proceedings I should err on the side of caution or generosity.  He submits that, as an absolute minimum, the wife should receive for herself and the children a total of &#163;280,000 but that the amount she seeks, namely &#163;392,000, is a reasonable and fair sum.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">During the course of the hearing Mr&#160;Howard submitted that if I did not award the wife maintenance at this level, or either of these levels, she would be unable to meet her reasonable income needs.  I questioned this, having regard to the fact that the wife has &#163;1.4 million in available resources.  In response, Mr&#160;Howard referred to two principal matters.  First, the husband&#8217;s agreement in the letter of 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> April 2014 that he did not expect the wife to use the sum of &#163;1 million to fund either her legal costs or her living expenses.  Secondly, that the wife wishes to sell her present home and move to a property in Surrey costing in the region of &#163;5.5 million.  This is referred to in the wife&#8217;s Replies to Questionnaire.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">In her Replies the wife says that, in order to purchase the property she wants, she would need to use the &#163;1 million she received from the husband as well as obtaining a mortgage (to be guaranteed by her uncle) and a bridging loan.  There is no reference in the wife&#8217;s Replies to her investments of just under &#163;400,000.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_21">
	  <num>21.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">I have considerable doubts as to whether the &#163;1 million should be treated as being unavailable to meet even part of the wife&#8217;s income needs, as asserted by her, but even if I do, in my judgment Mr&#160;Howard&#8217;s submission is not sustainable because the wife can use her investments for this purpose.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Mr&#160;Howard additionally refers to the husband&#8217;s withdrawal of his agreement to fund the wife&#8217;s legal costs.  By letter dated 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> September 2014 it was stated that, because the husband was concerned he was simply underwriting the wife&#8217;s legal costs, he would stop paying her costs in respect of the financial remedy proceedings after September 2014.  Mr&#160;Howard contends that this was an attempt to intimidate or pressurise the wife in the run up to the FDR and to compel her to erode her relatively limited capital base.  When determining this application, I take into account that the wife may well have to use her investments to meet her legal costs.  </p>

The wife does not accept that the family&#8217;s annual expenditure was as contended by the husband.  Mr&#160;Howard points to the fact that the schedules contain, in part, estimates and do not include <span style="font-style:italic">ad hoc </span>transfers made by the husband to the wife to discharge accumulated indebtedness.  Mr&#160;Howard made clear that the wife does not seek a higher standard of living than that enjoyed by the family during the marriage.  She merely seeks a different standard of living which includes more expensive holidays and other additional expenditure because she no longer has the use of the husband&#8217;s estate or trust assets.</p>

It does seem to me that the determination of the wife&#8217;s reasonable needs for herself and the children, both present and prospective, depend crucially upon the investigation of a variety of issues raised not only in the interim provision affidavits but also in the substantive case affidavits which cannot be resolved without full discovery and oral evidence.  Therefore, if I decide a figure within or approaching the high ground, the wife would be foolish to assume that the same conclusion would have emerged from a substantive hearing.  Equally, if I decided a figure in the low ground, the husband would be rash to assume that that same result would flow at the substantive hearing.  </p>

The discipline imposed by the parties and the preparation of the case should ensure that the duration of the interim period is a matter of months rather than years and any under provision or over provision can always be corrected when the account comes to be taken at the substantive hearing.  During the course of the substantive hearing the account that the judge takes is principally an account of the applicant&#8217;s prospective future needs but there is no reason why account should not be taken of the much less significant reckoning of her needs and the needs of the children over the interim period.  If that account reveals that there has been over provision and if that over provision is the product of excessive demands and estimates on the part of the applicant, then there is every opportunity to do fairness by set-off.&#8221;</p>

Further, however, even if I take the wife&#8217;s maintenance pending suit budget as put forward by her, making the difference in the parties&#8217; positions &#163;190,000, can it be proportionate to have spent nearly 50% of that sum on legal costs?

This has been expressed forcefully in a number of reported cases.  To state the obvious, the overriding objective puts proportionality at the centre of litigation.  Courts, in the past, might have been more willing to provide an opportunity for parties to have interim issues addressed.  The climate has changed.  Courts are more aware of and more focussed on the need to protect their own resources and on the need to seek to ensure that legal costs are not disproportionate.</p>

I am satisfied, on a broad assessment for the purposes of this interim hearing, that the annual sum sought by the wife of &#163;392,000 very substantially exceeds the marital standard of living.  That standard is not necessarily a ceiling but, in my view, there would need to be some specific, powerful, justification for that standard being exceeded on an interim basis.

In my judgment, the court&#8217;s intervention is neither required nor justified in this case.  On any view, with maintenance being paid as proposed by the husband, the wife will have available to her resources which will enable her to meet her income needs.  She will have available to her, from her own resources, such sum which she might choose additionally to spend on meeting her and the children&#8217;s living expenses between now and the final hearing.  To put it another way, the sum which the husband is paying is reasonable because it is sufficient to enable the wife to meet her reasonable income needs for herself and the children over the course of the next twelve months.  </p>

The purpose of an interim hearing is simply to ensure that one party has sufficient resources to meet their interim needs and to meet them in a way which does not prejudice their longer term position or place them at a significant disadvantage, for example if the wealthier party was seeking to erode the resources located in this jurisdiction when enforcement might be an issue.  The wife in the present case is neither prejudiced nor disadvantaged if she chooses to use part of her resources to meet her reasonable interim income needs.  I would anticipate that the final award would be calculated by reference to her actual resources unless the husband can deploy an add-back or reattribution argument.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">I propose, therefore, to make an order in the sum proposed by the husband.  In my judgment this is a reasonable sum by way of maintenance pending suit.  It might not be the sum which I would have awarded if, for example, no substantive payment was being made, but it is certainly within the bracket of reasonableness for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/22" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.22</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>.  In coming to this conclusion, I do not consider that I should either err on the side of generosity or parsimony; I should simply determine what sum it is reasonable for the wife to receive to enable her to meet her interim income needs from the resources available to her.</p>
