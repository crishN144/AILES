Although the Local Authority do not seek to rely on the hearsay evidence of what they reported in that meeting the chronology is important.

	      <p class="Indented" style="margin-left:0.39in">&#8220;There is only one rule of law, namely that the occurrence of the fact in issue must be proved to have been more probable than not. Common sense, not law, requires that in deciding this question, regard should be had, to whatever extent appropriate, to inherent probabilities. If a child alleges sexual abuse by a parent, it is common sense to start with the assumption that most parents do not abuse their children. But this assumption may be swiftly dispelled by other compelling evidence of the relationship between parent and child or parent and other children. It would be absurd to suggest that the tribunal must in all cases assume that serious conduct is unlikely to have occurred. In many cases, the other evidence will show that it was all too likely.&#8221;</p>

In particular it is not for the mother to disprove it by proving how the injuries were in fact sustained. Neither is it for the court to determine how the injuries were sustained. The court's task is to determine whether the local authority has proved its case on the balance of probability. Where, as here, there is a degree of medical uncertainty and credible evidence of a possible alternative explanation to that contended for by the local authority, the question for the court is not &#8216;has that possible alternative explanation been proved&#8217; but rather it should ask itself, &#8216;in the light of that possible alternative explanation can the court be satisfied that the local authority has proved its case on the simple balance of probability&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

In particular, it was not sufficient for a judge to rely primarily on the fact that a child might be able to stand up to and overcome a thoroughly unsatisfactory interview; rather, a clear analysis of all the evidence was required and the child&#8217;s interview had to be assessed in that context.

She was unable to think of a reason for the Children fabricating allegations although wondered if they were being manipulated (I think by CC) [Z21]. In the second interview on 16 March 2023 she said that each slap would be &#8220;Just once&#8221; [Z46] and again denied the use of a metal pole, sticks and cables [Z47]. The photo of the stick and metal pole were shown to her and she denied seeing either before [Z48], she said that the stick could have come from the garden, from the Children playing with sticks and she never used sticks to hit the Children [Z49]. I note that she now accepts the use of a cane (in response to the allegations) and that the pole the Children &#8220;must be referring to is pole we usually keep next to the shoe rack&#8221; [C95/6]. Neither was admitted in either of the interviews on 16 March 2023.</p>

Given the Mother&#8217;s admission she lied I find they were deliberate untruths. I have to consider if they relate to a significant issue. Clearly they did, they were central to the allegations of beating. I have to consider if they were advanced for a reason that does not point to guilt i.e. because of shock, pain, humiliation and feeling overwhelmed. There are two reasons I reject the Mother&#8217;s explanation for the untruths: first because she gave lucid answers to other questions in interview. Second, by the time of the interview with the Guardian it is hard to envisage the shock continuing and by that stage the Mother had legal advice. I do not find this explanation a credible explanation for the inconsistency and her evidence about what did or did not happen has to be seen against that backdrop.</p>

	    <p class="Number" style="text-indent:0.5in">I note that when the police attended for a welfare visit on 7 March 2023 the Children and CC appear to suggest that an online report may have come from a neighbour, the social work chronology says it was from CC. When they were asked by police if they had any concerns about child abuse there was nervous laughter between them. I observed to counsel that whilst it is difficult to be certain it did appear to be in the manner of there being concerns but them not being sure if they wanted to share them. Two things arise from this, first if they were nervous to share something it is consistent with there being something to share and second, more importantly, it is not consistent with a plot masterminded by CC to get the parents in to trouble. If that were the case then this was the opportunity for the Children to start their lying about what was going on in the home. Counsel for the Father suggested there may be two other alternatives: that there was a plot but the Children were having second thoughts or that CC had made the report online intending to involve CD and CE in the fabrication but had not yet had time to discuss it with them. Whilst there is merit in that submission it does not sit easily with the Father&#8217;s evidence in cross-examination that &#8220;long ago, CC had this in mind and that&#8217;s why I believe most of the scenarios the Children setup were provocative to the Mother to beat them&#8221; and later &#8220;CC must have been preparing their minds before the social work visit&#8221;. If that is the case (i.e. this was  not only a plot to fabricate what happened in the past but a plot to provoke actions which could then be relied upon) it seems extremely unlikely that neither of the Children would go on to make the allegations when they had the opportunity to do so when the police visited on 7 March 2023.</p>

It is clear from the audio recording that for much of the recording CD was in distress, there are specific instances when, after what appears to be the sound of a cane hitting him, he cries out or weeps more loudly. There are times when the apparent sound of a cane hitting him is not followed by louder noises from him but if the Mother is asserting he was fabricating distress in response to a trivial tap I reject that. His sounds of distress are entirely convincing, they are kept up throughout the recording and I find it highly unlikely he would have been able to fake his distress for the extended period of the recording. Accordingly taken with my finding above I find on the balance of probabilities that:</p>

The foster carer has not been called to give evidence, had she been I would have asked whether those were the exact words used or whether CE might have been saying that there was anger or on and off discipline over the course of that period rather than a sustained period of beating for 7 hours. In any event the description of duration by CE in the VRI is imprecise as the question was &#8220;How long was he stood on the back of your legs for?&#8221; not how long was the period of discipline.</p>

It goes to his credibility that he did not make that admission earlier as it tends to suggest he was seeking to minimise the effect of and extent of his behaviour. I have considered if an alternative explanation could be applied but by the time he drafted his response to the allegations he had legal advice and some time had passed since the shock of being arrested. I can think of no credible alternative explanation than that he was seeking to mislead the court in his response. Taking that into account and the Father&#8217;s admission to using a &#8220;few canes&#8221; when CA dropped from the hanging position during a previous punishment I find on balance the Father would, on occasion, beat the Children if they did not hold the stress positions he required them to adopt.</p>
