	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The primary purpose of this judgment is for the court, once again, to draw public attention to the very substantial deficit that exists nationally in the provision of facilities for the secure accommodation of children. There are a number, and it is, sadly, an increasing number, of children and young people under the age of 18 years [&#8216;a child&#8217;] whose welfare and behaviour requires that they be looked after within a secure regime which restricts their liberty. These specialist units are limited in number and, at present, the number of secure beds is far out-stripped by the number of vulnerable young people who need to be placed in them. Courts are regularly told that, on any given day, the number of those needing a secure placement exceeds the number of available places by 60 or 70. It is not the role of the courts to provide additional accommodation; all the court can do is to call the problem out and to shout as loud as it can in the hope that those in Parliament, Government and the wider media will take the issue up.</p>

The approach of the court is that such orders will &#8216;only very rarely be appropriate&#8217; and &#8216;must always remain a measure of last resort&#8217; [<span style="font-style:italic">Re SS (Secure Accommodation Order)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2014/4436" uk:canonical="[2014] EWHC 4436 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWHC 4436 (Fam)</ref>]. For some children, placement in a secure children&#8217;s home will represent the only way of meeting their complex needs, as it will provide them with a safe and secure environment, enhanced levels of staffing, and specialist programmes of support [Government Guidance (2014), paras 40-42].</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In order to maintain focus on the wholesale failure to provide adequate resources to meet the needs of these most vulnerable and needy young people, it is neither necessary nor helpful to individualise the details of the particular case that is currently before the court. The young person, her parents, and the local authority responsible for care are, therefore, to remain anonymous. Within the proceedings it is accepted that no criticism can attach to the local authority, or the individual social workers, who have striven to find a suitable secure placement. The point to be made most firmly is that the situation faced by this local authority is one that can be, and is, faced by every other local authority in England and Wales on a regular basis; it is, tragically, the norm. Naming the local authority in this judgment would therefore be an irrelevant distraction. </p>

If her distressing personal history is, therefore, to be publicised, it is necessary to enhance the normal degree of anonymity by removing any reference to the geographical context, including the names of the solicitors acting for the various parties.</p>

She was then charged with assaulting her grandfather. Multi-agency support was put in place and the situation improved for around 12 months. However, in the Summer of 2020, X became increasingly violent towards her mother and in August 2020 she was charged with assault. In turn, X alleged to the police that her stepfather and mother were violent towards her.</p>

During the last two weeks of October, at just 13 years old, X absconded from home on four occasions. In November 2020, X was removed to local authority care by the police, after apparently assaulting her mother with a metal bar.

This followed an incident at school where X attempted to jump from the roof. The school also reported that X had had numerous discussions with friends and professionals about ending her life. Whilst she was an inpatient X tried to abscond from the ward, she headbutted and punched the walls and doors and attempted to self-harm by scratching her wounds. She self-harmed using drawing pins, drawing blood from her arm and trying to strangle herself with her sock. X also made threats to kill staff and she damaged furniture.  </p>

For much of her time in the secure placement, X had been on a one-to-one staffing ratio with checks to avoid self-harm occurring once every 5 minutes during the night.

The placement lasted for less than a month, during which there were many occasions on which X placed herself and others at risk of harm. As a result X was detained under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MHA 1983</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 2</ref> for assessment.

The positive obligation that arises for public authorities under Arts 2 and 3 in cases such as this was explained by Lord Stephens in the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Re T </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2021/35" uk:canonical="[2021] UKSC 35" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] UKSC 35</ref> at paragraphs 175 and 176. The discharge of this positive obligation is currently being left to the court and to individual local authorities, yet neither of these agencies has access to the necessary resources to meet this obligation, nor, in the case of the court, the knowledge or real expertise to do so. One consequence of the lack of sufficient secure placements is that local authorities turn to the High Court to authorise a DOLS placement in other accommodation, often at very significant additional cost. Frequently, as the reported judgments describe, and as X&#8217;s circumstances demonstrate, the accommodation that is authorised via DOLS is not appropriate to meet the young person&#8217;s needs and is simply chosen as being the &#8216;least worse&#8217;, and often the only, option that is available.</p>

Many of these applications relate to children, like X, who should be in secure accommodation. The data suggesting that it is regularly the case that there will be, on any given day, some 60 or 70 children for whom a formal secure accommodation order has been made under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 25</ref>, yet no registered secure placement can be found, is therefore likely to understate the true position in circumstances where, instead of applying for a secure order (because of the lack of secure placements) local authorities simply by-pass the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 25</ref> procedure and apply directly to the High Court for DOLS authorisation.</p>

In addition to recording information about those children who are placed within the statutory scheme, either in registered secure children&#8217;s homes or in a health service facility, the report shone a light on, what it called, the &#8216;invisible&#8217; children whose placement is not reflected in the official statistics.

Often these children are incredibly vulnerable, at risk of being sexually or criminally exploited or harming themselves, yet there is no space in a secure children&#8217;s home for them to be kept safe. Councils are having to come up with makeshift arrangements like flats or hostels or even caravans. We heard of one child who was living in a holiday home and had to move out for a weekend as it had already been let out to holidaymakers. Councils themselves know that this is often not nearly good enough, but they say it is the only way they can find to keep children physically safe as they wait for something better. These children exist in a grey area of the law, with fewer legal safeguards than other children. Some are locked up illegally with no court authorisation in place at all. Indeed, I have recently intervened in a Supreme Court case to share my concerns about the legal position these children are placed in.&#8217;</span></p>

This is used when no existing piece of legislation allows for a child to be deprived of liberty, but it is judged necessary to keep them safe. As our review of court cases shows, it is often used when a child needs a place in a secure children&#8217;s home but there is none available. The numbers of children in this position appear to be rising, with 327 children included on applications to the high court in 2019/20 compared to 215 last year and 103 the year before.&#8217;</span></p>

Her description of the situation is on all fours with the experience of the judiciary hearing these cases, with the court being obliged to sanction a range of less than satisfactory regimes because there is no available provision for placement in a statutorily approved unit. The report demonstrates that the number of children being placed in &#8216;invisible&#8217; placements, outside the statutory scheme, is increasing and may roughly equal those who can be accommodated in a conventional secure home. On the basis of these figures, the current situation, where the scheme provided by the State is failing to meet the needs of half of the young people who need this level of State protection, is deteriorating so that soon, if not already, more than half of the children will be &#8216;invisible&#8217; and under the radar.</p>

When the criminal court passes an immediate prison sentence or makes a hospital order, the defendant is taken straight to a prison or to a secure mental hospital. There is no question of the authorities then having to engage upon a potentially lengthy process to find a placement because there are insufficient prison or hospital places. Neither is there a need for the criminal court to engage with the relevant authorities in establishing and holding on to substitute care arrangements which, because they fall short of &#8216;secure accommodation&#8217; are, by definition, inadequate to meet the young person&#8217;s needs. If there were no prison cells available to house those sent to prison there would be a public outcry; why should the lack of provision of secure units when a court has made a secure accommodation order be any less scandalous.</p>

As was recognised in the American case of Brooks v Brooks 35 Barb at 87-88 in 1861, the sound development of the child in all aspects is indispensable to the good order and the just protection of society. Human society benefits from the addition of the child as a member of that society, but the child and society will also suffer if society then fails to safeguard and promote the welfare of that child where the parents have proved, by reason of circumstance or inclination, unable to do so. G's welfare is the court's paramount consideration.

Very often the court is told that there is only one place where the child can be accommodated. The court's role is therefore very limited. There are no real choices for the court to make. The court cannot direct that placements shall be made available. The court is not a regulator and cannot inspect potential placements or oversee care regimes. On the other hand, even when there are no other placement options, the court does not merely provide a rubber stamp for the restrictions sought, and there are decisions to be made about the extent of the restrictions that are necessary and proportionate and in a child's best interests. However, the courts, like the parties, continue to be confined by the consequences of what Lord Stephens called a "scandalous lack of provision" for which it appears that there is no end in sight.&#8221;</p>

Despite the regular flow of judgments of this nature over recent years, it is, at least from the perspective of the experienced senior judges who regularly deal with these cases, a matter of genuine surprise and real dismay that the issue has, seemingly, not been taken up in any meaningful way in Parliament, in Government or in wider public debate.</p>

The decision as to whether to accept an individual child for a placement within a home remains with the manager of the individual unit. The SWCU &#8230; does not hold any statutory decision-making powers. The SWCU is a small unit, grant funded by the DfE for the purposes of administering placements and collecting data on secure welfare. ... The SWCU provides a transparent, dedicated single point of contact for local authorities in England and Wales to arrange secure welfare placements and streamline the process of finding the most suitable placement matching the individual needs of each young person needing secure care.&#8217;</p>

Once a referral of a child is live on the SWCU system, it remains live until a placement is found or the referral is withdrawn. Every day each secure unit reports the availability of beds to the SWCU. Homes with a bed that may be available will search the live referrals to identify which young person&#8217;s needs are compatible with the home&#8217;s resources. The offer of a placement will then be made.</p>

The lack of secure placements is long-standing and chronic. My view, expressed during the hearing, was that the stance taken by the Department for Education, to the effect that it was not its problem and was the responsibility of individual local authorities, displayed a level of complacency bordering on cynicism.
