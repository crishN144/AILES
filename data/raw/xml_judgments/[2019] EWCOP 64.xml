This is an appeal against the first instance decision of Mr Justice Cobb. In that judgment the Court of Appeal made it clear that Courts must guard against analysing different capacity decisions as self-contained silos, in order to avoid the Court reaching irreconcilable conclusions on a person&#8217;s decision-making capacity. This case is also helpful as the Court of Appeal cites with approval a number of formulations from the first instance judgment of Mr Justice Cobb as to the matters a person needs to consider when making decisions about their residence, care, contact, accessing social media and the internet and consenting to sexual relations. These are set out at paragraph 19 of Ms Scott&#8217;s skeleton argument as follows:  </p>

This issue arises out of the assessment Ms Clark undertook of Mary&#8217;s capacity to consent to sexual relations.  It is Ms Clark&#8217;s view that Mary lacks an understanding that a person can say no to sex and has a choice as to whether to engage in it. Mary also told Ms Clark that she would not get pregnant because she did not want to. Ms Scott asked Dr Lawson about this. He agreed that if Mary believed she would not get pregnant simply because she did not want a baby, this would render her incapacitous.

Dr Lawson was sceptical of that interpretation, and we invite the Court to share that scepticism.

Further, Dr Lawson was not concerned about Mary&#8217;s understanding the relevant information when he assessed her capacity. He asked Mary about sexual relations, and he concluded that she understands that pregnancy is possible.

There is evidence of her rejecting as untrue, information given to her by professionals which is objectively true, and evidence of her accepting information from third parties as true, when it is objectively untrue.  Dr Lawson said this is not a failure to <span style="font-style:italic">understand</span> the information, but a failure to <span style="font-style:italic">believe </span>it. He agreed that if Mary cannot assess the validity of information when it is given to her, she will not be able to use that information effectively due to her personality disorder. He also accepted that if Mary makes a decision about contact for example, on the basis of incorrect information because she does not accept or believe something that is objectively true, this affects her ability to make the decision about contact because the premise upon which the decision is being made, is wrong.  </p>

The only exception was when Dr Lawson said that there was a possibility that she could sometimes make her own decisions if not with people she knew, but he later clarified that her decision- making is distorted and affected even when she is with those with whom she has a limited relationship and who are not abusive to her.

The evidence is that there is no room for a distinction to be made depending on who Mary is in conversation with. So pervasive and distorting are the disorders on the operation of her mind, that even with those with whom she is in a therapeutic or benign and caring relationship, her fear of damaging that relationship is so great that her capacity to make a decision is vitiated. </p>

In other words, she does not understand that sexual relations are consensual. If that is right, then that would render her incapacitous. The local authority relies on the evidence of Ms Clarke in this regard.  Dr Lawson agreed that if the Court found that Mary did not understand that she had a choice about whether or not to engage in sexual relations, then this would render her incapacitous. In his evidence, he agreed with Ms Clarke that while Mary understood as a matter of theory that a person can say no to sex, she did not understand the choice when it related to her. I agree that this is what the evidence shows. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.04in">I am therefore satisfied that Mary does not appreciate she has a choice as to whether or not to have sexual relations. The case law makes it clear that this must inform capacity, and so I conclude that the local authority has rebutted the presumption in this domain as well.  </p>
