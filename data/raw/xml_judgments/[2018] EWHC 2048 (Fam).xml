At the time of the mother&#8217;s death P had been living with her and her family in Poland.  P&#8217;s father lived in England.  Following the death, the father moved to Poland, collected P and went with him to live with his parents.  In January 2017 the father returned to England leaving P with the paternal grandparents and in June 2017 he collected P and he has lived with his father in England since that time.</p>

Logically, it seemed to me that the same capacity to make an application would be open to, for example, a family friend, schoolteacher or any other person who had played a part in the child&#8217;s life.

Article 21 is engaged with all the benefit of non-merit and non-means funding. Thus, it was that the grandmother and aunt appeared before me with different solicitors and counsel on each occasion.  In theory at least, the court could be faced with a significant number of family relations each making an application for access and each separately represented, notwithstanding that there was no conflict between the family members.</p>
