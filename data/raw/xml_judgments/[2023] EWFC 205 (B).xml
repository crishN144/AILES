The children have both received an education at fee-paying schools, of which more below. Both children live with the wife and, sadly, their relationship with the husband has long since broken down, in all probability a casualty of the relationship breakdown and subsequent litigation between the parties (for the avoidance of doubt I make absolutely no findings of fault here in either direction, but I am aware that each party blames the other for what has happened and I am aware that various orders made in separate Children Act proceedings relating to child arrangements did not solve the problems in this regard).</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Financial remedies proceedings also began in 2013 in the Central Family Court. They took place against a background of affluence in the husband&#8217;s working life. He still had significant amounts of money coming in by way of carried interest from previous private equity work, most particularly the C Partners funds, of which more later, and, in the course of 2014, the husband began working for D Group, an apparently  successful and wealthy private equity business based in the UAE, where he worked as Chief Executive Officer of a private fund with a substantial tax-free income. The wife and children remained living in London and the wife was their primary carer but was developing her medical career again as her children reached school age.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The financial remedies proceedings were difficult and complicated; but were eventually compromised in a consent order approved by DJ Alderson dated 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> May 2015 (&#8216;the 2015 order&#8217;), which was later clarified in various respects by a further consent order, also approved by DJ Alderson, dated 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2017 (&#8216;the 2017 order&#8217;). These orders create a complex structure, but (for present purposes) it is possible and convenient to summarise some of the key features as follows:-</p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in">The order explicitly declares its intention to be that all the capital held by the parties, including capital received in the future from the carried interest in the various C funds (net of the potential &#8216;contingent C EBT liability&#8217;) and the funds held via the E Trust, would be shared equally between the parties. The agreed asset schedule which accompanied the 2015 order suggested that an equal share of the assets at this stage represented each party ending up with a figure estimated to be c.&#163;3,400,000 (albeit with a degree of speculation because it included some future C distributions).</p>
	    </content>
	  </subparagraph>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <num style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:-0.5in">(ii)</num>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in">The mechanism for receiving and sharing future C carried interest payments was itself complicated, has given rise to extensive arguments, and was perhaps the main cause of the need for a second consent order in 2017. In essence, the monies were supposed to be paid into a joint account from which neither party could withdraw money unless they both agreed or there was a further order of the court (see paragraphs 106 to 108 of the 2015 order and paragraphs 8 and 11 of the 2017 order). What had been happening in practice, as is expressly noted in paragraph 11 of the 2017 order, was that the carried interest payments had been made to the husband&#8217;s solicitors (then, as now, Goodman Ray) and then (on the husband&#8217;s account) divided equally between the parties by them. After 2017, some monies continued to be paid to Goodman Ray and then divided by them and other monies were paid into a F Bank joint account; the mechanics of extracting money from this joint account have been a major source of dispute, as I shall set out further below. It is appropriate for me to record that the wife&#8217;s position is that the husband and/or Goodman Ray have not divided these assets equally and have unfairly given an advantage to the husband.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.12in">The order commits the husband to paying spousal periodical payments on a joint lives basis. The obligation comes in two parts. First, a basic sum of &#163;35,000 per annum (CPI linked). Secondly, a sum calculated as being 20% of the husband&#8217;s &#8216;additional remuneration&#8217; capped at &#163;40,000 per annum, and coming to an end after six years (i.e. in 2021).</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in">The order commits the husband to paying child periodical payments at the rate of &#163;15,000 per annum (CPI linked) per child, payable monthly on the first day of each calendar month, to continue (on fairly standard terms) until the children respectively cease tertiary education. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in">The order commits the husband to paying the children&#8217;s school fees (and agreed extras). The order defines this obligation further (in paragraph 3 of the 2015 order) as being the children&#8217;s then (named) prep schools &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">or such other schools as the children attend from time to time, whether by agreement between the parties or by order of the court&#8217;</span>. The children have subsequently progressed to separate independent senior schools. In the case of A&#8217;s senior school, the husband&#8217;s account is that he agreed to the choice of school on the express basis that he would have to pay only 50% of the fees. In the case of B&#8217;s senior school, the husband&#8217;s account is that he was never asked to agree the choice of school and thus never agreed it. The wife has not directly challenged these accounts, nonetheless does not accept that the husband has discharged his obligations in full.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Shortly after the compromise of the financial remedies proceedings in the divorce, in September 2016, the wife issued a fresh application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, Schedule 1, seeking additional financial support for the children, in particular A. On any view this litigation had a very troubled and slow procedural path. Ms Phipps&#8217; note describes what happened as follows (and, although I have not seen all the documents filed in these proceedings, the documents I have seen broadly support this summary):-</p>

H did agree to pay some additional funds, in the sum of &#163;39,000 in total, but was still met with what he describes as a &#8220;barrage&#8221; of requests for additional sums, usually unsupported by any receipts or evidence&#8230;It can be seen from the chronology that the progress of the Schedule 1 proceedings was slow, and delayed by W. She said she lacked litigation capacity. On 17th </span><span style="font-style:italic">May 2018 DJ Duddridge determined that W was a protected party and he invited the Official Solicitor to act as a litigation friend. W refused to release funds paid into the joint account for the OS&#8217;s fees and abandoned her application on 11th October 2018. It was adjourned generally with liberty to restore.&#8221;</span></p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Plainly, the wife&#8217;s ill health created difficulties for the expeditious resolution of this application which were never resolved. The services of the official Solicitor were never secured and the proceedings have never been restored. As will be seen below, this has a resonance with what has happened in the current proceedings.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I also note in passing that there was another significant and litigious dispute about what was to happen in relation to the E Trust and this led to litigation in Jersey, which was concluded by a judgment by Commissioner Clyde-Smith of the Royal Court of Jersey (Samedi Division) dated 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2019. It is a complicated judgment, but could perhaps be characterised as broadly resulting in the outcome sought by the husband rather than the wife; but also dissolving the trust in a manner which divided the assets equally between the parties.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband, once divorced, quickly married again (in 2014) and there is a child of this relationship, a boy (now aged 9). Sadly, this marriage also broke down and has ended in divorce and financial remedies proceedings in the courts in Dubai. He has been ordered to pay a substantial lump sum to his second ex-wife, but he is appealing against this decision and this situation remains so far unresolved.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">A key event in the husband&#8217;s life was the emergence in 2018 of a fraud scandal in the D Group. It is not suggested that the husband was personally involved in the fraud, but it has led to the collapse of the once powerful and wealthy group and, in June 2019, to the loss of the husband&#8217;s employment with D Group. His association with the scandal has (on his account) made it very difficult to find alternative employment, so he has been unemployed for more than four years. He has given a detailed account of the effect of all this on him personally and on his financial situation. If true, it has been a very bad time for the husband. He has had to borrow extensively from family members and others to keep afloat. He has tried to dig himself out of the position by starting up and/or investing in various businesses which have not, yet anyway, produced any income, indeed some have been loss-making. He has also suffered from a depressive order for which he is still being treated. It is appropriate for me to record that the wife challenges a good deal of this account, but it has been far from clear to me what is the real basis of her challenge and the written evidence produced by the husband in support of his account is persuasive. There are also many publicly available documents which broadly confirm the overall problems of the D Group. I have no reason at this stage to doubt what the husband has told me in this regard.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The procedural path of this fresh application has been a slow and difficult one, mirroring what had happened in the 2016 Schedule 1 proceedings. In its early days the application was affected by the difficulties created by the sudden outbreak of the Covid pandemic, as it happens very shortly after the application was issued, and the First Appointment was delayed until 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September 2020. Thereafter, it seems to me that most of the delays have been caused by acts and omissions of the wife. As the First Appointment approached, the wife made an application for a 10 month adjournment on the grounds of her ill health. This application, although not having been formally dealt with, appears to have caused the First Appointment to be put back to 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2021 and then (after the wife was unable to join the remote hearing) to 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2021. </p>

Because of HHJ Gibbons&#8217; concerns about the wife&#8217;s health, nothing substantive appears to have happened on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2022 and the emails exchanged between judge and counsel in the course of April / May 2022 illustrates the difficulties which were being encountered &#8211; the wife wanted to rely upon medical evidence in support of her case, including now (possibly) an assertion that she lacked litigation capacity, but was very hostile to the husband seeing any details about her health, in a situation where he vehemently disputed that her health situation undermined her litigation capacity or justified any adjournment and wished to have an SJE analysis of her health. The final email of HHJ Gibbons in this sequence (dated 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2022) expresses her frustrations with the positions being taken by the wife and comments: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">It is clear that the pragmatic approach I had hoped would progress this matter for both parties will no longer work&#8230;I can see no alternative but to list a further hearing (t/e 1 day) at which the court would consider&#8230;(a) (the wife&#8217;s) application for permission to appeal&#8230;(b) whether the proceedings should be stayed&#8230;(c) general case management directions</span>&#8230;<span style="font-style:italic">At some point (the husband&#8217;s) variation application, which was issued a long time ago, must be heard.&#8221;</span>  This hearing was duly listed before me on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2022 and I have dealt with all the hearings from then onwards.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in">The initial proposal from Mr McCourt was that the official Solicitor should be brought on board for the wife (although no steps had been taken in that regard); but the wife was accompanied at the hearing (albeit remotely) by a friend of hers, Dr X, a Consultant Ophthamologist in his fifties working in the NHS. It was proposed in the course of the hearing that he be made the wife&#8217;s litigation friend if the court accepted that she lacked capacity. I was told that he had discussed with Mr McCourt the nature of the role of a litigation friend and understood what it involved and was willing to take the role. I heard from him briefly (via CVP) and there was nothing to suggest that he would not be a suitable person to fulfil this role. He was willing to (and in due course did) sign an undertaking in relation to the payment of costs in the standard form required by FPR 2010 Rule 15.4(3)(c). It was anticipated, I assume by the wife and certainly by me, that he would be assisted in his task by the instruction of suitable lawyer(s), probably the continued instruction of Mr McCourt, probably (but not necessarily) on a direct access basis as before. This way forward seemed at that stage to me to represent the most expedient way forward in a difficult situation and, although the husband wished to have recorded on the face of the order his reservations and opposition to these steps, the opposition was muted (and the decision was certainly not appealed) and I decided therefore to accept Dr Loughlin&#8217;s view on the wife&#8217;s incapacity and to appoint Dr X as her litigation friend.  </p>

F Bank declined, however, to do the same for the husband&#8217;s half share and his share of the monies remained inaccessible (though not frozen by any court order) in the account. Later disclosure from F Bank (obtained via a Third Party Disclosure Order) shows that F Bank paid this money to the wife on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2022 on the strength of a concise written opinion from Mr McCourt. It has been asserted before me in the current hearing that Mr McCourt&#8217;s opinion (deliberately or otherwise) failed to draw F Bank&#8217;s attention to the 2017 order and that, if he had, then F Bank may have made a different decision. I make no finding at this stage on this dispute; but I note that it has caused a good deal of mistrust and ill feeling between the parties and the lawyers.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I did not receive any further communication on this subject from Mr McCourt or anybody else on the wife&#8217;s side or the husband&#8217;s side and the five day fixture commencing on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2023 was placed in my diary and remained there unchallenged (until very recent developments). I have been told by Ms Phipps that neither she nor anybody on her team had heard any objection to the 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2023 date and they assumed that Mr McCourt would be representing the wife at that hearing until, in early October 2023 in response to being sent the bundles for the hearing, he communicated the fact to the wife&#8217;s solicitors that he was no longer involved. I had made the same assumption as the husband&#8217;s legal team. I have learned only in the last 24 hours that Dr X was aware by 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2023 (from a communication from Mr McCourt) of Mr McCourt&#8217;s non-availability and was reminded of this fact in an exchange of emails with Mr McCourt&#8217;s clerk (Mark Betts) on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2023. Dr X appears (on the basis of the documentation provided by him) to have done nothing at all in response to this knowledge &#8211; neither has he sought alternative counsel nor has he requested (until very recently, far too late, after the husband had incurred his counsel&#8217;s brief fee) a change of trial date. In April or June 2023, or indeed some weeks or even months later, there was plenty of time to instruct a different counsel, but nothing was done to achieve this or even signal the problem to the other side or the court. I note from recently produced medical letters that, in this period, Dr X was himself beginning to suffer from depression and that at some point he was signed off his own work with sickness, but this does not adequately explain or excuse his failures to do something in response to what he had been told about Mr McCourt&#8217;s non-availability.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">It is undoubtedly the case that the wife did not comply with a significant number of my directions and, in late August 2023, the husband applied for a further directions appointment to remedy this, which I listed on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2023. At this hearing, neither Mr McCourt nor DrX attended, but the wife did attend and made some representations of her own, including (again, as ever) for the adjournment of the October hearing. I decided to make most of the directions sought by the husband, which were substantially repeats of what I had previously ordered and the wife had not complied with. Given the proximity of the impending final hearing there simply was not time to adjourn the directions hearing and really no purpose in doing so. The wife has sought permission to appeal this order as well from Sir Jonathan Cohen, but again this has not been pursued to a decision and, in any event, the appeal may have been superseded by other developments. It continues to be the case that the wife has not complied with the majority of the directions I made in January and March 2023 and repeated on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2023 &#8211; for example there is no section 25/31 narrative statement from her, there has been no updating disclosure, no answer to questionnaire and no cooperation with valuations. Nearly four years after the application was made, the wife&#8217;s disclosure is lamentably bad. In contrast the husband has made very extensive disclosure.</p>

She has asked me not to make any substantive orders, but to re-list the case for another five day hearing for which (she says) she will take steps to make sure she is represented by the Official Solicitor. In listing terms this would, of course, put the case back for at least another six months, possibly more. Further, the history of this case leaves me with very low levels of confidence that the wife will, in fact, take the necessary steps to secure the involvement of the Official Solicitor. </p>

Just as with all interim hearings the court needs to make decisions which govern the position pending the final hearing in a way which is fair to both sides and which does its best to draw reasonable interim conclusions from the written evidence which has been presented and/or reasonable interim inferences from the failure to produce relevant written evidence. In the context of the periodical payments orders the court now is in a similar position to a judge dealing with a Maintenance Pending Suit application, who has to make a broad assessment of fairness on the information available (which, by definition, has not been challenged by cross-examination). In the context of the F Bank joint account, the court now is in a similar position to a judge dealing with an interim freezing application, balancing the fairness to one party of having an asset made inaccessible against the fairness to the other party of losing the opportunity subsequently to enforce against a frozen asset. Amongst the factors which may be involved here is my thoughts about how likely it will be, given her track record, of the wife ever in reality getting her act together and taking the steps necessary to be properly represented by the Official Solicitor (if nobody else is available). For whatever reason, she has found this very difficult to achieve over a long period and the repeatedly extended deadlines create a good deal of unfairness for the husband. </p>

Whilst this fact should not, on its own, take away the obligations he has to his former family, it is a relevant matter in considering the level of the obligations. Although the wife has challenged the reasons advanced by the husband as to why his position has deteriorated, his narrative statement gives a very full and detailed explanation which is prima facie convincing and there is no reason, at an interim hearing, for me to have substantial doubts about his presentation.</p>

I have not been persuaded that he has, at the current time, any earned income from his businesses. It follows that, on the basis of an interim assessment, his income is substantially lower than it was when the income provisions of the 2015 order were fixed, and there is therefore ample justification for a reduction in the periodical payment obligations. The figures I have selected as interim orders are informed by this position.</p>

Although her Form E suggests that, in sickness, she receives 50% of her normal salary, the up to date position is far from clear. I note that some of the figures in the Form ES2 represent a &#8216;potential rental income assessed by drive by valuers&#8217; and I am not at all clear what actual letting is taking place, because of the non-disclosure. Nonetheless, the apparently healthy capital position of the wife gives her some options for accruing income which cannot be ignored in the context of an assessment of &#8216;earning capacity&#8217; and &#8216;resources&#8217;. I have borne in mind all these matters in selecting the figures I have for interim variations.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in">I have thought carefully about whether it is fair to allow the husband to have access to the substantial amount of his own money in the F Bank account at this stage. I have listened carefully to the articulate and forceful representations made on this subject by the wife herself, notwithstanding her incapacity. I have decided that in carrying out a balancing exercise it is appropriate for the husband to have access to this money (subject to the deductions to be paid to the wife this is c.&#163;532,246.52) now and it would be extremely unfair to deny him access to that money for a further indefinite period or at all (save for the limited appeal period). Amongst the matters which have steered me in this direction are the following:-</p>

		<p style="margin-left:2in;text-indent:0.12in">For the wife to justify effectively freezing this money she would need to have made out at least a good prima facie case to the effect that she is likely to persuade a court in due course that she has a sustainable claim for capital which could be enforced against this money. I have not been remotely persuaded that such a case exists on the evidence which has been presented. Making an interim assessment, which could later be changed of course, I think it unlikely that she will have any substantiated claim which may be enforced against this money. Certainly, there is a paucity of evidence which points in that direction.</p>

		<p style="margin-left:2in;text-indent:0.12in">I understand the wife&#8217;s argument that enforcement of a debt (if and when established) would be made more difficult if that money is distributed to the husband and used by him, perhaps to repay his substantial debts or to defray his living expenses, but there are other assets against which an enforcement process could in due course be possible (for example, his interest in real property in Switzerland or his UK private pensions). The court should not without a persuasive reason freeze assets on the basis that there is an outside chance that an enforcement application may in due course be justified.</p>

This decision has been informed by the difficulty and complication which has been caused by the joint account provisions in the original orders &#8211; I fear that if continued there would inevitably be further unnecessary court hearings. It has also been informed by the cogent evidence presented by the husband as to how the C payments made through Goodman Ray have been distributed with efficiency and scrupulous fairness by Goodman Ray (see, for example, the Bidwell Henderson analysis). In contrast, there was no compelling or persuasive evidence presented by the wife to justify her assertion that Goodman Ray could not be trusted.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In deciding what costs orders to make I remind myself that the starting point (under FPR 2010 Rule 28.3(5)) is for there to be no order as to costs, but Rule 28.3(7) allows me to depart from this in certain circumstances, including where there has been relevant non-compliance with orders or litigation conduct (as there has been here, as described above). The Court of Appeal decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Barker v Confiance Limited</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2021] 1 WLR 231" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] 1 WLR 231</ref> suggests that, whether pursuant to the undertaking or by reference to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54" uk:canonical="1981 c. 54" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Senior Courts Act 1981</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54/section/51" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 51</ref>, the court can make a costs order against a litigation friend if, in all the circumstances, it is just to make a costs order.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I have reached a clear view that the fair and just outcome here is for me to make an order for Dr X to pay the whole of the costs wasted by the hearing this week not being able to be dealt with as a full final hearing and I assess this at &#163;42,128.79, to be paid within 14 days. While Ms Phipps invited me to consider apportioning this 50:50 between the wife and Dr X, I have decided that the appropriate order is to hold Dr X 100% responsible for these costs. He willingly took on the role of litigation friend and his performance has been wholly inadequate. I accept that he has not been well, but this fact does not adequately excuse or explain his conduct and he should not escape the consequences of what has happened.</p>
