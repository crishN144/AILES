	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">This judgment concerns a child, A, who is now aged two and three quarters.  When she was six months old she suffered injuries and, as a result, the local authority started care proceedings.  For reasons which I will explain below, those proceedings have continued for over two years, but in this judgment I set out my findings about what happened to her and, on the basis of these findings, it will now be possible for plans to be made about her future care.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">A&#8217;s father is now aged 29. Her mother is now 19, rising 20.  They started a relationship several years ago when the mother was 15.  That relationship continued until A&#8217;s admission to hospital in March 2011, in circumstances described below, when the relationship came to an abrupt end.  During the relationship, however, the parties were very close to each other.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">An important feature of this case is that the father has significant learning difficulties.  His full scale IQ is measured at 76 which puts him in the borderline range.  A psychologist has identified that he has a number of areas of cognitive difficulty and is also highly suggestible.  The psychologist advised that, although the father is capable of giving evidence, he should be treated as a vulnerable witness.  Despite these difficulties, the father has a good work record and has been employed as a motor mechanic for a number of years, although he is currently out of work.  The father&#8217;s problems have been compounded by a difficult relationship with his own family from whom he is at present estranged.  It is clear, however, that, until A&#8217;s admission to hospital, the father was on good terms with the mother&#8217;s family.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">A was born on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2010 by a normal vaginal delivery after a pregnancy of 42 weeks.  Until March 2011 her progress was uneventful.  She was seen by the health visitor and the GP for routine appointments.  No concerns were noted and, in particular, there were no concerns as to the care given to her by her parents.  On the contrary, the general impression was that her parents were looking after her well.  They were manifestly devoted to her.  A was cared for at the parents&#8217; flat but, on occasions at weekends, the parents and A would stay at the maternal step-grandfather&#8217;s house whilst he was away having contact with his own children.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">It is said, however, that there were occasional concerns about the father&#8217;s handling of A.  In particular, the mother and maternal grandmother assert that the father was on occasions over-energetic when handling the baby.  In evidence, the maternal grandmother gave various examples.  She spoke of seeing the father bouncing A on his shoulders without adequately supporting her head, banging the bed while the baby was lying on it causing her to bounce up in the air and, on one occasion at a bowling alley, swinging the baby round on his arm.  The father does not accept any of these incidents, but I say immediately that I found the grandmother to be a truthful witness and I accept her evidence that these incidents took place.  Importantly, however, it is not suggested that these actions were malicious or abusive but, rather, examples of na&#239;ve and inappropriate handling by the father.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">On 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> March 2011 A was taken to the GP with a history of having suffered a cold for a few days with a runny nose which had become very red and sore.  In addition, she was said to be vomiting up her feed.  Upon examination, she was found to have impetigo on her nose.  A diagnosis was made of an upper respiratory tract infection and she was prescribed antibiotics for the impetigo.  Five days later on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March, she was taken to the GP again.  The medical notes indicate that the impetigo was improving but had not yet resolved.  The doctor advised that she should continue to take the antibiotics and he also prescribed a treatment cream.  Two days later on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March, A was taken to the GP for a third time.  The skin infection was much better but it was said that she had been suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting over the past three days.  The doctor concluded that she was suffering an adverse reaction to the antibiotics and prescribed a lower dose of penicillin.  </p>

Throughout the day, she was repeatedly sick after feeds.  In the evening, the family stayed at the maternal step-grandfather&#8217;s house and A was put to bed in her Moses basket by the father at about 8.30 pm.  The mother went to bed shortly afterwards and the father stayed up watching television for a further two hours or so before going to bed himself.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">At about three o&#8217;clock in the morning, A gave a cry, described variously by the parents as a weak or different cry.  The mother woke the father, and he got up and took A downstairs to feed her.  The father says that he carried her down still wrapped up in a blanket.  He walked into the downstairs lounge and placed her in the corner of the sofa.  At that stage, there was no suggestion that A was floppy or unresponsive.  The father then went into the kitchen to warm a bottle of milk in the microwave.  He states that he was out of the room for about 30 seconds.  On returning to the lounge, he found A to be floppy and unresponsive.  In oral evidence before me he said that she had fallen forward on the sofa.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The father has given broadly the same account on every occasion when he has been asked about this incident.  The only significant inconsistency is that, on two occasions, he said that he had placed A on a changing mat on the floor rather than on the sofa.  In oral evidence before me, he explained this by frankly saying that he had given an untrue account of placing her on a mat because people would think that he was a bad father for leaving her alone on the sofa.  </p>

She saw that A&#8217;s condition had changed, although she was still breathing.  The mother asked the father to ring NHS Direct who advised that A be taken for examination immediately.  So the mother took the baby downstairs and put on her all-in-one outfit.  Her evidence is that, whilst doing so, she noticed red marks on A&#8217;s forehead.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The couple took A to the minor injuries unit at Trowbridge some 20 minutes away.  On the way, A was given a bottle and drank about eight ounces of milk.  The family arrived at the unit at about 3.50 am and A was immediately seen by a nurse who, having taken a history from the parents, examined A, noting that she was a dusky/pale complexion and that the mother said that this may be her normal colour.  The nurse also observed that her eyes were open, that she was moving all limbs and that there was nothing abnormal about her fontanelles.  However, the nurse also noted blue/purple markings on her forehead.  She therefore decided that A should be seen at hospital and arranged for an ambulance to be called to take her to the A &amp; E department at the Royal United Hospital in Bath.  A left in the ambulance with her parents at 4.20 am.  Shortly before her departure, she was sick.</p>

A junior doctor recorded that she was pale, drowsy and irritable with an area of erythema around her left eyebrow described in the medical records as &#8220;? bruise.&#8221;  A further area of bruising was noted on her head.  As a result of these skin markings, a CT scan was carried out at 6.31 that morning which disclosed that she had subdural haemorrhages.  There were, however, no other signs of brain damage or other intracranial injury.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The doctors at Bath decided to refer A to the neurosurgical team at the Frenchay Hospital in Bristol.  Prior to her transfer, A&#8217;s heart rate dropped and, as a result of this episode of bradycardia, she was intubated and ventilated.  She arrived at the Frenchay Hospital at about 12.30 pm.  Extensive further tests were carried out.  An MRI confirmed the findings of the CT scan but a skeletal survey, ultrasound examination and metabolic investigations revealed no abnormalities and blood tests were also normal save for a high level of platelets.  Her eyes were examined on two occasions.  On 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March, an ophthalmological specialist registrar found extensive retinal haemorrhages in her right eye and slight retinal haemorrhages in her left eye.  In a further examination on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March conducted by a consultant ophthalmologist, however, retinal haemorrhages were only seen in the right eye.  Thereafter, A continued to have episodes of bradycardia and not feeding but overall over the next few days her condition improved.  A further CT scan on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March reported no increase in the size of the subdural collections.  On 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March, she was transferred back to the hospital in Bath.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Meanwhile, the doctors had contacted social services and the police who had started an investigation.  Both parents denied causing any injury to the baby.  The mother, however, quickly came to the view that the father had been responsible for the injuries, and she immediately ended their relationship.  Her decision caused much unhappiness to the father who tried over the next few months to win her back, though his efforts were unsuccessful.  Since then, the mother has largely wanted nothing to do with the father, although it seems that she has approached him on a few occasions, for example, when she wanted some repairs carried out to her car.  Although the mother has continued to blame the father for A&#8217;s injuries, she has consistently said that she believed that they were as a result of careless or inappropriate behaviour on his part rather than any deliberate abuse.</p>

The parents&#8217; contact was initially arranged on four days a week on a supervised basis.  A few months later, the local authority decided to start care proceedings which were issued on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> August 2011.  The proceedings were transferred to the county court and managed by Her Honour Judge Katharine Marshall.  On 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2012, a litigation friend was appointed to act for the father in the proceedings.  In the course of the proceedings, experts&#8217; reports were commissioned from Dr George Rylance, consultant paediatrician at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Newcastle, Mr Peter Richards, consultant paediatric neurosurgeon at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, Professor Alastair Fielder, a professor emeritus of ophthalmology at City University London, and Professor Ian Hann, consultant paediatric haematologist at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London.  A paediatric radiologist also prepared a report but this has not been relied on by any party at the hearing before me.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The first fact-finding hearing was conducted by Judge Marshall in April in Swindon in 2012.  The learned judge found that A&#8217;s injuries had been inflicted non-accidentally by the father.  That finding was the subject of an appeal on the principal ground that the judge had failed to make appropriate provision for the father&#8217;s learning difficulties and that, as a result, he had not received a fair hearing.  On 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> November 2012 the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and ordered a retrial before me.

As a result, a number of steps have been taken to enable the father to participate fully at this hearing.  In particular he had assistance from an intermediary, Miss Erin Kiernan, in addition to his litigation friend.  The advocates were advised to ask questions in a fashion that reflected the father&#8217;s difficulties, and the court allowed regular breaks in the evidence.  One further additional step taken for the hearing before me was the commissioning of a further report by Professor Hann who confirmed that A suffers or at one stage suffered from a haematological abnormality which is considered in greater detail below.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">In determining the issues of this fact-finding hearing, I apply the well-established legal principles.  I have previously summarised those principles at length in my earlier decisions in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re JS</span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"/>[2012] EWHC 1370 Fam and <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Devon County Council v EB</span> [2013] EWHC 968 Fam.  I have those principles firmly in mind and I need only refer to them briefly here.  First, the burden of proof at all times lies on the local authority.  Secondly, the standard of proof is the balance of probabilities.  Third, findings of fact must be based on evidence including inferences that can properly be drawn from the evidence and not on suspicion or speculation.  Fourthly, when considering cases of suspected child abuse, the court must take into account all the evidence and, furthermore, consider each piece of the evidence in the context of all the other evidence.  Fifthly, amongst the evidence received in this case is expert medical evidence from a variety of medical specialists.  While appropriate attention must be paid to their opinions, those opinions need to be considered in the context of all the other evidence.  It is important to remember that the roles of the court and the experts are distinct and it is the court that is in the best position to weigh up the expert evidence against its findings on the other evidence.  The judge is the person who makes the final decision.  Sixthly, in assessing the expert evidence, I bear in mind that cases involving an allegation of non-accidental head injury involve a multidisciplinary analysis conducted by a group of medical specialists.  The court must be careful to ensure that each expert keeps within the bounds of their own expertise and defers where appropriate to the expertise of others.  Seventh, the evidence of the parents and any other carer is of the utmost importance.  It is essential that the court forms a clear assessment of their credibility and reliability.  Eighth, it is common for witnesses in these cases to tell lies in the course of the investigation and the hearing.  The court must be careful to bear in mind, as was pointed out in the case of <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Regina v Lucas</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1981] QB 720" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1981">[1981] QB 720</ref>, that a witness may lie for many reasons such as shame, misplaced loyalty, panic, fear and distress, and the fact that a witness has lied about some matters does not mean that he or she has lied about everything.  Ninth, the judge in care proceedings must never forget that today&#8217;s medical certainty may be discarded by the next generation of experts or that scientific research may throw light into corners that are at present dark.  Recent case law has emphasised the importance of taking into account to the extent that it is appropriate in any case the possibility of an unknown cause.  Even where, on examination of all the evidence, every possible known cause has been excluded, the cause may still remain unknown.  Finally, when seeking to identify the perpetrator of non-accidental injury, the test of whether a particular person is in the pool of possible perpetrators is whether there is a likelihood or real possibility that he or she was the perpetrator.  In order to make a finding that a particular person was the perpetrator of a non-accidental injury, the court must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities.  It is always desirable, where possible, for the perpetrator of non-accidental injury to be identified both in the public interest and in the interests of the individual child although where it is impossible for a judge to find on a balance of probabilities, for example, that parent A rather than parent B caused the injury, then neither can be excluded from the pool and the judge should not strain to do so.</p>

In his initial report dated 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2012, prior to the hearing before Judge Marshall, Professor Hann reported that the blood count results were essentially normal and that an extended set of periodic investigations had ruled out all of the serious disorders and the majority of minor disorders of the coagulation system.  The test did, however, reveal an elevated level of platelets in A&#8217;s blood and this left a residual concern that she may have had a rare blood disorder such as Von Willebrand&#8217;s disease.  In view of this concern, Professor Hann recommended further testing.  In the event, this further testing was not carried out prior to the hearing before Judge Marshall.  Following the successful appeal, however, that further testing was carried out for the purposes of this retrial.  The test ruled out the presence of known disorders such as Von Willebrand&#8217;s disease but left unexplained the presence of the elevated presence of platelets in A&#8217;s blood at the time of the test in March 2012.</p>

A had hyper-aggregation of platelet function of unknown cause. That is a rare finding about which there is no research, so his opinion was based on anecdote and a paucity of published information.  In his long career, he has only seen a handful of cases, all of which have been referred for bruising episodes.  None of these patients had a long term problem and as a result, &#8220;the general feeling amongst colleagues was that such phenomena can be transient and are of no or very little clinical significance.&#8221;  </p>

He said that the abnormality was unlikely to be a moderate or severe bleeding disorder so that &#8220;bleeding out of the blue&#8221; is unlikely, although it may lead to excess bruising and easier bleeding.  He thought it unlikely, however, that this disorder would be a cause of bleeding within the head, adding that there are a lot of disorders of platelet function but rarely do they translate into intracranial bleeding.  Applying this to the present case, he concluded:  &#8220;it therefore makes it more likely you would get bleeding with slightly less trauma but very unlikely that it would cause bleeding with only slight trauma.&#8221;  </p>

No birth-related subdural haemorrhage has so far been found to continue for as long as five months after birth but, given the propensity of some acute subdural haemorrhages to evolve into chronic collections, it is at least theoretically possible that some birth-related haemorrhages may continue for that length of time.  I bear in mind that research into this important area is continuing and the court bears in mind that the judge in care proceedings must never forget that today&#8217;s medical certainty may be discarded by the next generation of experts.  </p>

Most can be excluded in this case, for example, abnormal vitamin K deficiency, intracranial malfunction, metabolic disorder or hypertension.  A further recognised cause of retinal haemorrhage is raised intracranial pressure.  One sign of raised intracranial pressure is swelling or bulging of the anterior fontanelle.  In this case A&#8217;s fontanelles were examined at several points and different appearances are noted.  Mr Richards described how it was very common for the appearance of the fontanelle to vary from examination to examination.  Dr Rylance pointed out that it is possible that A may have had raised intracranial pressure after the subdural haemorrhage and caused by a part of the intracranial compartment being taken up by haemorrhage and so putting pressure on the brain.  He adds, however, that there is no clinical evidence of A having raised intracranial pressure before she presented with subdural haemorrhages.</p>

He quotes the observation in a research paper by Miss Gillian Adams and others in 2004 that &#8220;most authors now agree that the forces necessary to cause this type of injury are far from trivial and in fact are considerable ... it is highly likely that the forces required to produce retinal haemorrhages in a child less than two years of age will be generated by a reasonable person during the course of even rough play or an attempt to rouse a sleeping or apparent unconscious child.&#8221;  Professor Fielder notes that retinal haemorrhages can occur after accidental head trauma but they tend to be relatively few and confined to the posterior part of the retina.</p>

At one point in his report, Dr Rylance observed that &#8220;floppiness&#8221; had been seen by a medical professional in the course of A&#8217;s admission.

Both parents have consistently said that they did not notice any marks on A&#8217;s head before the early hours of 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March. (A suggestion in a note made at the hospital in Bath that they may have said something different was dispelled by evidence from the specialist registrar, Dr Samuel, who made the note.)  The parents&#8217; evidence is that there was a significant change in A&#8217;s appearance in the early hours of the morning when the father, having left her in the sitting room, returned from the kitchen having heated up the milk.  He says that he then observed a change in her appearance, noting floppiness, lethargy and changing colour.  This evidence has led the experts to suggest that the injury must have been sustained immediately or shortly before this change in appearance was observed.  </p>

Dr Rylance added that A&#8217;s forehead swelling was likely to have resulted from injured blood vessel walls leaking fluid as well as blood as a result of the trauma which caused the bruises.  He advised that swelling of this type, if it is going to occur at all, will usually appear within 24 hours of the trauma and last for anything between two and seven days. </p>

He stated that the haematological evidence would not affect his view as to what happened to A but it may affect the degree of force used.  Referring back to his opinion expressed in the report that the level of force was &#8220;relatively low for this type of case&#8221;, he observed that, in view of Professor Hann&#8217;s assessment of the platelet abnormality, the level of force may have been &#8220;even lower than originally thought.&#8221;  Given that there was only a very short interference of brain function with no radiological evidence of damage to the brain substance and that A had recovered rapidly and well, he would speculate that whilst one could not comment with certainty, the force applied was greater than normal handling but at the lower end of the force than would sometimes be seen in these types of injuries.  When cross-examined by Mr Storey, he reiterated that the injury pattern was not one of a violent action.  He said that &#8220;it could be over-zealous handling that crossed the line.&#8221;  </p>

That is a topic about which Mr Richards and other colleagues have developed a close interest as a result of a number of medico-legal cases in which this explanation has been proffered in recent years.  In addition, Mr Richards alluded to a recent case from his own clinical experience in which a child with hydrocephalus, who suffered a low-level fall, was found to have sustained a subdural haemorrhage.  It is too early to draw any further conclusions from this case, save that all doctors and courts must now recognise that there may be cases in which intracranial injuries are sustained as a result of a low-level fall. </p>

It is also important to record that the incidents about which they were giving evidence took place over two years ago.  Furthermore, each has been questioned about these matters on many occasions, and the court recalls the advice given by those who drafted the guidance on achieving best evidence that repeated questions undermine the reliability of the answers.  That guidance was of course directed to the evidence of children but the point is relevant to all witnesses and particularly those with the vulnerabilities of this mother and father.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">So far as the father is concerned, there are three general points that emerged from his evidence.  First, like the mother, he is devoted to A.  It is manifestly obvious that he adores her just as much as the mother.  I do not believe for one moment that he would intentionally harm a hair on her head.  Secondly, he is in a particularly vulnerable and isolated position at the moment, cut off not only from nearly all members of his own family but also from the maternal family who previously had welcomed and supported him.  Thirdly, I was struck by the clarity of his account of the events of 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2011.  I take into account that he has obviously been through that account many times but it was striking that he was able to give me a clear answer to nearly all the questions about it.  One example was when I asked him why he had put A down in the lounge rather than take her into the kitchen.  He responded without hesitation that he needed both hands free to unscrew the bottle before putting it into the microwave.  His clear and unhesitating answers lead me to conclude that for the most part at least it was a truthful account.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">There was, however, one inconsistency in his accounts and although it was only one I think it is significant.  As stated above, his evidence to me and on most other occasions was that he had placed A on the sofa before going to heat the milk.  At the hospital, however, he said that he had placed her on a changing mat.  His explanation for that inconsistency was that he had not told the truth when he had said he had put her on the mat because he thought it would make him look like a bad parent if he said that he had left her on the sofa.  I was unconvinced that he was telling me the truth about this.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">On behalf of the mother, Mr Feehan QC and Ms Griffiths submit that the mother has been consistent in her account as to the key events.  She gave a full account of matters in her police interview, only a day after the admission to hospital, which was accurate in many telling details and from which she has never departed.  She immediately and permanently separated from the only other possible perpetrator known at the time and fully cooperated with all the enquiries.  It is submitted that, at this hearing the mother, although still young, previously assessed as immature and plainly anxious, gave honest and clear evidence.  Of equal importance, Mr Feehan and Ms Griffiths submit, is the fact that, in her police interview when she was only 17, there were no attempts at obfuscation, no failures of memory of any significance and no contradictions.  Such criticisms as can be levelled at her &#8211; for example, her somewhat heartless treatment of the father after the separation &#8211; have no bearing on the identity of the perpetrator of A&#8217;s injuries.  On this point, Mr Feehan and Ms Griffiths submit that there is no real possibility that the mother was responsible.  </p>

Mr Feehan and Ms Griffiths stress that the mother has no interest in supporting the father in this case but has been clear throughout that she does not see this as a case of deliberately or maliciously inflicted injury on his part.  In her opinion, the more likely explanation, as she told the police at a very early stage, is that there has been a serious but genuine accident that the father was too embarrassed or intellectually limited to acknowledge.  The likelihood is that he either dropped A or that she fell from a high surface such as the work surface on which he had previously negligently placed her.  Given his adoration of his child, it is, say Mr Feehan and Ms Griffiths, possible but unlikely that he shook her in a momentary loss of control, and the medical evidence permits of an interpretation of a lesser degree of force than usual could have caused the injuries.</p>

It is significant that the family alighted on accidental over-exuberant explanations and not on other more serious possibilities.  Abuse was simply not thought about.  Furthermore, Mr Storey and Miss Storey-Rae draw attention to the fact that the mother&#8217;s step-father, who saw a good deal of the parents and A together, denies ever seeing rough handling by the father, although he did refer to an occasion when A had been left by the father in a small baby chair known as a &#8220;bumbo&#8221; on the kitchen work surface.

In this regard, they draw attention to the absence of any evidence of abusive behaviour on the part of the father and, given his devotion to A, they submit that it is implausible that he would have deliberately assaulted her even under a momentary loss of control.  In contrast, there is evidence which, if the court accepts it, suggests that the father was na&#239;ve, careless and occasionally over-exuberant in his treatment of the baby.  They suggest that the relatively mild extent of the injuries &#8211; shallow subdural haemorrhages, mild encephalopathy, no brain damage, no fractures &#8211; is consistent with A having sustained her injuries as a result of an impact following a fall rather than an episode of shaking.  The abnormality in A&#8217;s platelets could have led to her sustaining bruising and bleeding with a somewhat lesser degree of force than is usually required.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">A crucial issue in this case is the timing of the injuries.  Whilst I cannot rule out the possibility that the injuries were sustained on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March or even earlier, I find it very much more likely that they occurred at or around 3.15 in the morning of 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March.  Although her unusual pattern of vomiting on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March could be a pointer to the presence of encephalopathy, I accept the evidence of Mr Richards that it is probably attributable either to her illness or to the medication she was taking for that illness.  In contrast, there is a very clear account from both parents of a significant change in A&#8217;s behaviour around 3.15, specifically and in particular the floppiness and the marks on her head, which point to an event at or around that time.  I have considered the evidence about the so-called weak cry but conclude that it is not strong evidence that A&#8217;s condition had deteriorated before she was removed from the Moses basket by the father.  In addition, I accept the mother&#8217;s evidence that nothing untoward had happened to A prior to that point or in her presence.  Both parents state, and I accept, that it was the father who got up to attend to A.  It follows that the traumatic incident which caused A&#8217;s injuries must have occurred between the time that the father and A left the room and the time they returned a few minutes later.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">There is, in my judgment, a gap in the evidence.  I find the father has not told the whole truth about the events of those few minutes.  Something happened to A whilst she was in the father&#8217;s care in those few minutes.  Beyond that I find it difficult to make any firm finding because there is no evidence that clearly points to any specific conclusion.  I remind myself that I cannot base any finding on speculation.  On the other hand, I think it is permissible and indeed appropriate to indicate my impression of what may have happened.  I think it extremely unlikely that his father deliberately harmed A or hurt her in a moment of anger or loss of control.  There is no evidence that he has ever behaved in this way.  There is, however, evidence that he was on occasions na&#239;ve in the way he handled A and sometimes seemed not to appreciate the consequences of his actions.  Accepting as I do the evidence of the maternal grandmother, I find that on occasions he has been over-exuberant in his play with A.  Accepting as I do the evidence of the maternal step-grandfather, I find that on at least one occasion he was careless about leaving A in a potentially dangerous position, namely on the kitchen work surface.  </p>

The presence of bruises on her forehead strongly suggest that she suffered some sort of impact and I accept the submission, based on Mr Richards&#8217; evidence, that the intracranial injuries and encephalopathy could have been sustained as a result of a low-level fall.  That is of course speculation and I emphasise that I can make no finding of exactly how A&#8217;s injuries were sustained.  I do, however, accept Mr Richards&#8217; evidence that these injuries were at the lower end of the scale for so-called non-accidental head injuries.</p>

The insight in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Lucas</span> that people lie for a wide range of reasons such as shame, embarrassment, panic, fear or misplaced loyalty is usually used to support a submission that a finding that a person has lied about one matter should not be necessarily relied on as evidence that a person has lied about everything.  In this case, however, I think that the insight on <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Lucas</span> is helpful for a different reason because, whilst making no finding about the matter, I think it possible that this father has not told the truth about what happened to A because he is embarrassed about an act of carelessness.

I absolve the mother from any responsibility for the injuries and there is to my mind no evidence that she has failed to protect A in any way.

Although it is too early to make a final decision on the details of his future contact with his daughter, my provisional view is that it is likely to be in A&#8217;s best interests to have regular contact with her father as she grows up so that he can play a role in her life.  </p>

I agree with the submission made by Mr Feehan and Ms Griffiths that there should normally be sufficient opportunity by that point for the fact that the party has or may have learning difficulties to have been identified.  At that hearing, those representing the parents should apply for special measures, where they consider that the case for such measures can be made out without any expert advice. Alternatively, where they consider that expert advice is necessary to identify the existence or extent of the learning difficulties, they should apply to the court in accordance with Part 25 of the Family Procedure Rules (as amended) for an expert to carry out an immediate assessment of the capacity and competence of the party.  There must, of course, be full compliance with the terms of that Rule and the accompanying Practice Directions.  In addition, the legal representatives should normally by the date of the case management hearing identify an agency to assist their client to give evidence through an intermediary or otherwise if the court concludes that such measures are required.  If the court is satisfied that an expert report is necessary to determine whether the party lacks capacity or competence and/or as to the extent of any special measures required, it may direct a further case management hearing to take place once the expert has reported so that detailed directions can then be given for the instruction of an intermediary and/or such other assistance as may be necessary.</p>

It is important that those representing the relevant party address these funding issues at the earliest opportunity.  They should obtain prior approval from the legal aid agency for the instruction of the expert and, as soon as possible, give notice to Her Majesty&#8217;s Courts and Tribunal Service that the services of an intermediary are likely to be required.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">It is possible that the injuries sustained by A were attributable in part to the father&#8217;s imperfect understanding of risk to a small baby.  Some people were aware that the father did not fully understand the risk, yet no one took any steps to obtain assistance for him in caring for A.  Now that the risk has been identified, the father will, I hope, receive assistance, but plainly more needs to be done in other cases to identify and address such risks at an earlier stage.  It is sobering to think that, had this been done in this case, it is possible that the injuries suffered by A and the consequences that followed &#8211; the separation of A from her mother, and the lengthy and costly proceedings &#8211; might have been avoided.  </p>
