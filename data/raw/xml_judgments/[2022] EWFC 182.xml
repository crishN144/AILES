During the currency of those proceedings, Her Honour Judge Watson made an interim care order on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2020 and thereafter the local authority applied for a care order.  At all times during the public law proceedings the child has lived in a shared care type arrangement and the clear focus of these proceedings has been the parents&#8217; relationship with one another.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There have been a number of applications previously made in respect of this child.  I am unable to give you a history or exactly how many.  I am aware that prior to the private law proceedings that predated the public law proceedings, a child arrangements order was made on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2017, which stated that the child had been exposed to parental acrimony, different parenting styles and the parents could not communicate with one another.  That was an issue even then. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Even before these proceedings became public law proceedings an expert was instructed to look at whether mother was influencing the child.  The expert, well known to me, Dr Carritt-Baker, is an expert in alienation cases and he had cause for concern that the child might be influenced by mother&#8217;s thoughts and beliefs, although there no fact-finding hearing took place so, of course, I remind myself that those views were that of Dr Carritt-Baker, not necessarily ones adopted by the court.  Dr Carritt-Baker was also of the view that mother could be implacably hostile to contact if her thoughts and beliefs were false.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The position at that time appeared to be that the child was spending time with each of the parents, although I know from the chronology that has not always been the case and it is difficult to ascertain how the allegations of influence had manifested on the arrangements themselves.  It was clear that the report was focused on the harm suffered by the child, but, as I go on to say, things have moved on significantly since that period of time because the child has since spent equal time with the parent and any issue of stopping contact with father is a long and distant memory.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The papers reflected a chronology of competing allegations made by the parents about the care of the child in the other, including some really serious matters.  Those allegations in the proceedings have not been substantiated.  There is poor communication and father considers that information is not shared with him.  Father&#8217;s partner, S, has been dragged into the dispute and the parents have not been able to agree how to discharge their parental responsibility on things such as immunisations.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Carritt-Baker highlighted the low likelihood of success of family therapy and that there would be considerable difficulty around shared care.  Dr Carritt-Baker considered that there was little to suggest that father would interfere with KM&#8217;s relationship with his maternal family.  However, as I have indicated, the landscape appears to have changed significantly since then.  Therefore, I found the report to be of less value in the context of the proceedings where we are now in the light of the more contemporaneous information that is before this court.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The child&#8217;s school in this case has been a protective factor.  The school has tried to empower KM by taking charge of his possessions to prevent them being used in a tug of war.  They have sought to assist the parents and offered to mediate.  The school is well aware of the parental conflict and has observed KM&#8217;s behaviour throughout.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When cases are started by the local authority, they were seeking a public law order, they set out their concerns in what we would call a threshold document.  There is such a document in this case and it is fair that my summary of that is that mother had accepted that KM had witnessed altercations and inappropriate behaviour between the parties, mother accepted that the relationship had broken down between her and father, mother accepted using cannabis at low levels.  Both parents were willing to implicate the other in their response findings.  Father accepted nothing that referred to his own culpability.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority say that the child had been subjected to the warring between the parents.  As all parties are proposing the making of a child arrangements order, that threshold document becomes less important now, save that it feeds into the issue of harm for the purpose of the evaluation under the welfare checklist.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">KM found it difficult to give information about his parents, which seemed to indicate that he was suppressing his views about his family life.  He was likely left with anxieties in his own mind.  There was warmth in the child&#8217;s relationship with each parent.  However, the child&#8217;s behaviour towards mother was controlling, indicating a lack of security within that relationship.  This was reinforced by mother&#8217;s own views that the child was clingy and needed frequent reassurance.  That controlling behaviour was not observed when the child was in his father&#8217;s care.  The child presented as overactive, restless and required authoritative parenting, clear structures and routines to be in place.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issues the child presented with, namely, his feelings of insecurity, are important to report the context and, most importantly, the difficulties the parents have in communicating together about his needs.  It is that issue that Dr Foley considered that needed to be addressed.  Family therapy was recommended.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst Dr Foley could not be certain about what factors have contributed to KM&#8217;s lack of security, that often stemmed from when parenting was not consistent or predictable.  KM would be worried about the difficulties between his parents and that those disagreements related to him.  Quite apart from mother&#8217;s coping strategies, it was highly likely that he had a sense of responsibility for the difficulties between his parents.  Given the difficulties between the parents and the difficulties in terms of communicating in respect of the child, Dr Foley considered that a shared care arrangement was unlikely to be in the child&#8217;s best interests.  During term time the child should reside predominantly with one parent, with contact with the other parent at a weekend.  School holidays should be shared. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_19">
	  <num>19.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Foley went on to say that children who came from authoritative parents were more likely to become responsible adults that tended to be happy and successful, good at making decisions and evaluating safety risks.  Children who grow up with permissive parents were more likely to struggle academically, have behavioural issues and did not appreciate authority and rules.  They may have low self-esteem and report a lot of sadness.  Authoritative parenting is likely to lead to an improvement in the child&#8217;s overall presentation.  It is worth noting, however, that the child would benefit considerably knowing that his parents&#8217; rules would meet his needs regardless of any living arrangement and at the very least be similar, and that he can talk freely with one parent about things in regard to the other parent without the parent becoming upset or angry.</p>

She began her parenting assessment of father and his partner on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2021.  Both father and his partner engaged fully in the process.  Miss Bibi was clear that father continued to be entrenched in the dynamics of his relationship with mother and that sometimes he failed to consider how he has as a parent harmed the child with his behaviour.  She said that father&#8217;s partner appeared to compensate for this because she offered reflection from which father appeared to build upon.</p>

The school Christmas production was a horrible display of how the parents could impact on KM.  Both parents attended separately, father had care of KM.  KM spoke to his mother before the production, but not afterwards.  Father was concerned to leave quickly to avoid conflict, without considering KM&#8217;s need to be praised by his mother, or even say goodbye.  Mother then got upset, not considering the impact of KM seeing her get upset.  The school had to intervene to minimise the upset, but KM was present and no doubt well aware that he was the centre of what was going on.</p>
