Martin is an attorney under the EPA, which covers property and financial affairs only. Therefore his visits to check for physical abuse, even if they were necessary to safeguard Sheila, were not part of his role as attorney. Therefore, the Public Guardian believes Martin was not entitled to claim expenses for these visits.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.25in">Sheila did not expressly provide for Martin to be remunerated and if he intended to charge a daily rate of &#163;400 for acting as her attorney, he should have applied to the court for authorisation pursuant to paragraph 16(2)(b)(iii) of Schedule 4 to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>. By not doing so, he behaved in a way that contravened his authority and was not in the donor&#8217;s best interests.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.25in">The Public Guardian believes the amount of &#163;117,289.45 is an excessive amount to claim for out of pocket expenses. I would put it more strongly than that. I believe that charging one&#8217;s elderly mother a daily rate of &#163;400 for visiting and acting as her attorney is repugnant.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.25in">Martin suggested that the appointment of a panel deputy would be a waste of time and money because his mother&#8217;s estate is effectively already his. I disagree. The panel deputy will, for the first time in eleven years, place Sheila at the centre of the decision-making process, rather than view the preservation and enhancement of Martin&#8217;s inheritance as the paramount consideration.</p>

I shall also direct an officer of the court to invite a panel deputy to apply to be appointed as Sheila&#8217;s deputy for property and affairs.</p>
