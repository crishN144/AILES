None of them can therefore bear any responsibility for the way this case has developed. For what it is worth, I also record that I was new to this case as of the hearing listed on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2019.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0.12in">Inevitably, this judgment is not a comprehensive review of the issues that may arise when considering a potential kinship placement abroad. However, the problems that have arisen are stark and have proved difficult to unravel. One cannot help but feel a sense of despair that, 21 months on from the commencement of proceedings, the welfare outcome for these 3 children remains uncertain.  </p>

The ISW was based in Jamaica. She reported on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2019, so within about 8 weeks of instruction.  The document is headed &#8220;Special Guardianship Report&#8221;. Neither the LA nor any other party understands why the report was given this title.

She also strongly opposed the placement of the children in Bermuda. She outlined her concerns about such a placement. She said that access to education in Bermuda is very limited. Gun and knife crime is at a very high level and almost every family is affected by it. Q&#8217;s brother had been murdered and X had witnessed a shooting. This was one of the reasons she had wanted to move to the UK. She expressed particular concerns about the children&#8217;s safety given she says that Q was a police informant and there is the potential for gang retaliation. She says it is very easy for young men to get caught in gangs, just like Q did.  </p>

Different issues are certainly likely to arise, but complexity is likely to exist whichever country is involved. The 2018 CFAB Report highlighted difficulties in securing collaboration with the receiving jurisdiction where the proposed placement was in Scotland and in Northern Ireland. What was said to make the difference was not whether the country was part of the UK, a signatory to Brussels IIa or The Hague Convention, but the attitudes and processes in the other country and the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;ability to establish an effective, direct point of contact&#8221;.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0.24in">Equally there may be a perception that a placement abroad will carry greater risk and uncertainty than one within England and Wales. There is currently very little research available to establish or refute that suggestion. I note that the CCFC report concluded that the rate of placement breakdown after the making of SGOs to kinship carers within this jurisdiction was 5%, or 7% when the SGO was coupled with a Supervision Order. The CFAB 2018 report found that placement breakdown occurred in 2 of 21 cases where the child was placed from the UK to another country and in 2 of the 8 cases where the child was placed in the UK. In both of the cases where the placement breakdown was abroad, breakdown occurred because the carers were not able to cope with the child&#8217;s psychological and behavioural challenges which were present prior to the placement. The report recognised, however, that there is a lack of knowledge of long-term outcomes for children placed abroad because, unless the local authority was providing post-placement support, it would not necessarily be notified of any placement breakdown. There was a call for further research as to long term outcomes. </p>

Whilst I will look at the available orders in more detail below, under the current statutory framework the court will need to decide between a limited number of options. These include placement under an interim care order (pursuant to Schedule 2 paragraph 19 <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>), placement under a Special Guardianship Order, placement under a Child Arrangements Order and (perhaps) placement under some other form of order, such as wardship. It is hopeless if the eventual assessment does not comply with the relevant regulations so as to prevent the court placing the children under one or more of these possible orders. Should that happen, as it did here, the local authority may be left advancing a sub optimal form of order because it is simply &#8216;the last man standing&#8217;.   </p>

In conducting the investigation, the person preparing the report should analyse and consider the information they ascertain from and about the prospective special guardian. The approach should be objective and enquiring. Information should be evaluated, and its accuracy and consistency checked. The safety of the child is of paramount concern and it is vital that the background of the prospective special guardian is checked rigorously.&#8221; </span>No lesser standard should be expected when the report is prepared to support a placement abroad under a different form of order.  </p>

A social worker employed by the relevant local authority will have a good understanding of the relevant regulations and that local authority&#8217;s procedures and may have the best chance of obtaining Regulation 22 or 24 approval to enable the court to consider the option of placing the children abroad under an interim care order as well as having knowledge sufficient to enable them to complete a lawful SGO assessment. They will also know the local authority&#8217;s policy in relation to the provision of support, including financial support. They may not have any or much knowledge of the country involved and may not be able to travel there to assess the family in their home or their support needs. They may not have an understanding of any cultural, religious or locational norms. A local social worker will plainly be able to assess the situation in the relevant country and will have knowledge of any cultural, religious or locational norms, but may never have met the child concerned or other family members. They are unlikely to be able to compile the necessary Reg 22 or 24 and SGO assessment, present the case to the local authority&#8217;s fostering panel to obtain approval or calculate any financial support that will be payable. An ISW may be in a position to visit the country concerned as well as the child and other family members within this jurisdiction. They may be able to compile the necessary Reg 22 and 24 and SGO assessments. They are unlikely to have any local knowledge and may not be best placed to present the case to the fostering panel.

It is important to verify if the other country considers entering their country to complete an assessment as working in their country. Thought should be given to the travel documents and visas that the social worker uses to enter the country to ensure that these provide the appropriate permissions to work temporarily in the country concerned, if necessary. In addition, legal issues may arise if a social worker is seen to be practising social work in a country where social work is a protected title and they are not registered with the regulatory body. For example, in South Africa, under the Social Services Professions Act 1978, it is illegal to practise social work unless registered with the relevant body and it would be a criminal offence for a social worker to travel there to complete an assessment.  </span></p>

Assistance in these cases may also be obtained from the Central Authority. The DfE advice &#8216;Cross-border child protection cases: the 1996 Hague Convention&#8217; recommends that ICACU is consulted in the first instance in all such cases. They hold useful information about authorities in other countries and have a wealth of practical experience of cross-border co-operation.

In order to access education or support, it may be necessary for there to be an assessment or referral by a local professional.  </p>

Such an option retains the advantages that each would bring to the assessment and removes some of the disadvantages. For example, it may be easier for the UK social worker to arrange and obtain permission to travel to the foreign country if their enquiries are to be conducted jointly with a locally based social worker. This approach would need to be carefully structured in advance so that it is clear <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;the role of each social worker, how the recommendation will be formulated and how much time will be taken by each professional in completing joint or solo visits with the family&#8221;.</span></p>

For example, some hospitals work in multi-disciplinary teams and in complex cases two experts may produce a joint report. There seems to be no reason in principle why such a process could not be adapted to fit this situation. As long as the work undertaken by each social worker is properly demarcated, and it is clear who has formulated the recommendation or whether it has been jointly formulated, then such an approach has much to commend it. Indeed, it is difficult at present to anticipate many disadvantages. </p>

First, professionals working within a foreign jurisdiction may not understand the concept of a &#8216;viability&#8217; report. Indeed, I am not currently convinced that the professionals working within this jurisdiction did. Such an assessment may take many forms, but it best described perhaps by reference to paragraph 67 of <span style="font-style:italic">Re P-S </span>where Sir James Munby said that the question to be answered is whether the proposed carer is <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;a runner&#8221;.</span> That appraisal will need a solid foundation, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;But the appraisal, assessment or evaluation (call it what you will) need not necessarily be too lengthy or too searching at this stage; what is sometimes referred to as a viability assessment or something similar may well suffice&#8221;.</span> The positive assessment from the local social worker took almost 4 months to prepare (5 months if one includes the answers to the supplemental questions) and was highly detailed as I have said. It was plainly not a &#8216;viability&#8217; assessment. </p>

I am told that the LA&#8217;s fostering panel would not entertain an application for foster care status presented by the social worker practising outside of the jurisdiction. In those circumstances I do not follow why that form was given to the social worker. </p>

In other words, the matters that <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">must</span> be dealt with in the report prepared for the court. Those matters were significantly enhanced in 2016 in an attempt to ensure that such assessments were more robust. The parties maintain before me that this error did not come from any information or request that was provided to the ISW. What is most concerning is that once the report was produced no-one questioned its validity, and for 5 months all parties blindly assumed that the report produced did comply with the Regulations. It is simply hopeless if the necessary safeguards are bypassed in this manner without anyone seeming to notice. </p>

They saw that an SGO was used in 5 cases, a CAO in 4 cases, and in 1 case the child was placed under no order, having previously been subject to s.20 care.

I have some concerns about how such a placement would work in the context of kinship carers based abroad. For the reasons set out above, it may be necessary for the placement and contact arrangements to be managed by the local authority, at least in the interim. It may also be necessary for the local authority to be able to act swiftly should the placement break down. I see some difficulty in the local authority being able to intervene in a placement abroad where it has not retained parental responsibility for the children. I would also be concerned that the change of status might also impact on the support services that would be available to the carers, even if a Special Guardianship Order was made subsequently. </p>

By way of example, in April 2016 the Adoption Support Fund was extended to cover therapeutic support for children, living in England, who were previously in care immediately before the making of the SGO. If access to the Fund is not to be available (because, for example, the initial placement is to take place under a child arrangements order) then this needs to be spelled out alongside what proposals, if any, the local authority puts forward to compensate for that loss. </p>

I am told that a placement under Regulation 22 would need to be approved by the LA&#8217;s fostering panel. The supervising social worker would present their report, recommending such a placement, to the panel which would then consider its approval, subject to final ratification by the Agency Decision Maker. The process could take up to a month. The difficulties such a procedure raises are, of course, reminiscent of those that beset the adoption process. I was informed, as I said, that the Panel would be unlikely to accept a recommendation made by a social worker from a different jurisdiction. A recommendation made by an ISW might be approved, subject to the confidence that the Panel had in to the particular ISW. In my view this is an area which would benefit from further consideration and guidance. </p>

It was clear from the recordings in the order made that the key issues in the case included whether each of the children should 'reside in a family placement under an SGO'. It may be that the apparent consensus between the local authority, the children's guardian and the grandparents on the ultimate order they all sought obscured the immediate procedural issue before the court. Given the procedural unfairness that undoubtedly was the consequence, I have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that it was wrong not to have made appropriate provision for the grandparents to obtain effective access to justice at the final hearing. To leave them on the sidelines without party status, without documents and without advice and without any mechanism being identified for the parents of S to cross-examine them on their proposals was unfair in more than one respect. From the children's perspective, it meant that part of their case was assumed to be incomplete when it could have been tested. </span></p>

At the IRH on 3 February 2017, the facts were such that the grandparents were a realistic option for the care of the children. The direction for an SGO assessment which is a mandatory precondition to the making of an order had been made and the reports were complete. I am accordingly at a loss to understand why directions were neither asked for nor made that dealt with how that application would be considered by the court. The consequence is stark even from the judge's own judgment. The grandparents did not know what was happening, did not have the evidence upon which the court was making a decision, were unable to take advice and in the event, in my judgment, did not have effective access to justice. That was not in the interests of the children. The procedure was accordingly unfair.&#8221;</span></p>

As Ryder LJ said in his judgment, in such a situation it is still essential to ensure that the procedure is fair and the proposed carers have effective access to justice. The proposed carers will ordinarily need to be kept fully informed as to what is happening, to have access to all the evidence and to be able to take advice. That is normally to be achieved by granting them party status. Even where there is agreement about the proposed placement there may be issues for the court to consider as to the appropriate form of order, the plan for contact with other family members, the support to be provided by the local authority, etc. It is inconceivable that the proposed carers should be denied the opportunity to participate effectively in that decision-making process. </p>

A care plan is more than a statement of strategic objectives &#8211; though all too often even these are expressed in the most vacuous terms. A care plan is &#8211; or ought to be &#8211; a detailed operational plan. Just how detailed will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case. </span></p>

Nothing less is called for in a pathway plan. Indeed, the Regulations, as we have seen, mandate a high level of detail.&#8221; </span></p>

The local authority&#8217;s obligations in respect of a special guardianship order placement will, therefore, continue for a minimum of 3 years. Given that it may be unlikely within some jurisdictions that the relevant authority will take on any obligation to provide support services, the local authority will need to address in its plan how it is proposed that any long term support that is needed will be reviewed or considered once the 3 year period has expired, in accordance with Reg 5(3). Although one cannot be prescriptive in terms of future needs and levels of support, it is important for the local authority to be alive to these issues now and provide clarity to the family members as to how they will be addressed when the time comes. </p>
