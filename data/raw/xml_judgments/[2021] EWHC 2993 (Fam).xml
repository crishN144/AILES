In relation to legal representation, I note that as long ago as 13 September 2021 the mother raised strong objection to the Covid-19 vaccination but that the Local Authority&#8217;s application is much more recent. The mother says that she has contacted solicitors, but there is no communication from any solicitors and no indication that she would secure the services of solicitors within a short period. In any event, I am satisfied that the mother&#8217;s Art 6 rights to a fair hearing are met without the need for her to have legal representation and that, applying the overriding objective, it would be disproportionate to adjourn this case for the purpose of allowing the mother time to seek legal representation. This case has come to court swiftly following the application but the issues are not complex and the mother&#8217;s position can be simply stated and is clearly understood. Delay will be adverse to the child&#8217;s best interests. I refused the application for an adjournment.</p>

She contrasts other vaccines that she views as tried and tested with the Covid-19 vaccine which she believes is not. As for the flu vaccine, she is opposed to C receiving it together with the Covid-19 vaccine, which she believes is unsafe, and wishes to have more time to look into the safety of the flu vaccine before taking a position in relation to its safety and efficacy. The mother accepts that C does not have any known health conditions and says that her objections would apply to any child and to any responsible parent faced with a decision whether to have the vaccines in question. She asked the court who would be responsible if C suffered an adverse reaction, including fatal complications, following vaccination because she would hold them responsible. The mother did not accept that either vaccine would be effective in protecting C or other children. She did not accept that the decisions about the national programmes of vaccination were based on sound evidence.</p>

The COVID-19 secondary schools vaccine programme should therefore provide protection to young people and reduce the disruption to face to face education. This will help to keep young people emotionally well and happier and this was an important consideration for the CMOs.</p>

She has adduced a number of items that can only be described as anti-Covid-19 vaccination propaganda. For example, she has produced a sheet of photographs said to be of people who have died following Covid-19 vaccination. All parties accept that vaccinations are not risk-free. Adverse reactions and complications can arise. However, the material does not even try to reason that the deaths of those depicted were <span style="font-style:italic">caused</span> by vaccination, let alone to give context in terms of numbers affected or to weigh in the balance evidence of the number of lives that might have been saved by vaccination. To give a flavour of the nature of the material on which the mother relies, it asserts that the deaths of those pictured are the fault of people who wear masks or who undergo Covid-19 tests because they allow the government to manipulate the figures in order to &#8220;destroy these lives&#8221;. The material is devoid of evidence or even rational argument and does not point to any peer-reviewed research evidence that raises any significant concern about the efficacy or safety of either vaccine.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I do not consider it appropriate for this court to embark on an investigation into the merits of any competing theses as to whether national programmes of vaccination of 12-15 year olds for Covid-19 or for children in school years 7-11 for the flu virus, are justified as being generally in the best interests of children in those age ranges. In cases that concern vaccines that are part of national programmes, the question of whether expert evidence is necessary will only arise if there is an identifiable, well-evidenced, concern about whether, due to their individual circumstances, a vaccine is contraindicated for a particular child, or if there is, as MacDonald J put it in <span style="font-style:italic">M v H</span>, &#8220;new peer-reviewed research evidence indicating significant concern for the efficacy and/or safety&#8221; of one or more of the vaccines that is the subject of the application&#8230;&#8221;. Even if such new research were available, I have serious reservations about whether an individual expert or individual judge could or should engage in a wholesale review of the evidence behind an established and continuing national vaccination programme. However, perhaps an expert could assist the court as to the quality and relevance of such new research. In the present case the issue does not arise - mere assertion that a vaccine is unsafe, however strongly expressed, does not meet either of the conditions under which expert evidence might be considered necessary to assist the court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In my judgement, the principles set out by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H</span> (above) apply equally to both the Covid-19 vaccination for 12-15 year olds and the winter flu virus vaccination for children in school years 7-11, as they do to the specific childhood vaccinations considered in that case. Like the standard vaccinations for infants, the Covid-19 and winter flu virus vaccinations are now part of national programmes of vaccination for children approved by the UK Health Security Agency, the successor body to Public Health England. The court can be satisfied, without the benefit of expert evidence, that the decisions to include the vaccinations in national programmes are based on evidence that they are in the best interests of the children covered by the programmes. Given the oral submissions that I received from the mother, it is worth emphasising that vaccination programmes may be in the best interests of children even though administering the vaccines is not free from risk. Very few activities in medicine or life more generally are free from risk. Administering a vaccine gives rise to a risk of harm to a child. Not giving a vaccine gives risk to a risk of harm to a child. Voluminous evidence establishing the extent and balance of risks and benefits needs to be obtained before a decision is made to roll out a national programme of vaccination for children.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In the absence of any factors of substance that might realistically call into question whether the vaccinations are in an individual child&#8217;s best interests, decisions for the child to undergo standard or routine vaccinations that are part of national vaccination programmes are not to be regarded as &#8220;grave&#8221; decisions having profound or enduring consequences for the child.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">There is one qualification that I would make to the general principles stated above. The Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H </span>was concerned with vaccinations for infants or very young children. In this case, C may well be Gillick competent to make the decisions to be vaccinated. I have not undertaken an assessment of his Gillick competence because I consider it unnecessary to do so to answer the primary question raised in this case. The view of a Gillick competent, looked after child of C&#8217;s age deserves due respect when considering any question of their best interests. Given that C consents to the vaccinations, there is no conflict between him and the Local Authority. If, however, such a child refused vaccination, that would raise different questions, namely whether the local authority with parental responsibility could override the child&#8217;s decision and whether the issue should be brought before the court. As I noted in the brief review of the law above, it is established that the court may override a Gillick competent child&#8217;s decision. Those questions do not arise in this case. There is advantage in this being a short and clear judgment and so I shall not indulge in an academic exercise.</p>
