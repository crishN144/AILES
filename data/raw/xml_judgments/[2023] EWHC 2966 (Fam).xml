In another he referred to the fact that &#8220;the Police interview was made under duress, and all that I have stated was coerced out of me and must be struck from the record&#8221;.  He has also purported to file with the court, without leave, an &#8216;affidavit&#8217; from Mr Andrew Devine which I have nonetheless read.</span></p>

In order to respond constructively to at least part of that challenge I have provided him with a further redacted print out of the FamilyMan log of these proceedings.   I asked him again today whether he wishes to be represented by a lawyer; he did not. During the hearing he sought to persuade me that he had been acquitted at the Nottingham Magistrates Court in November 2022.  I reminded him that I have copies of the letter of &#8216;discontinuance&#8217; sent by the Crown Prosecution Service to him (under the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/23/section/23" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 23</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/23" uk:canonical="1985 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Prosecution of Offenders Act 1985</ref>) on 23 November 2022 (before the hearing in the Magistrates Court) and again on 5 January 2023 (after the hearing), and that I had already satisfied myself that this was not a situation of &#8216;double jeopardy&#8217; (see &#167;59 of my earlier judgment).</span></p>

It is, in my judgment, a most serious contempt of court to defy the long-established principle of privacy in adoption cases by covert recording of a hearing; the contempt is aggravated when the recording is published.  Whether proceedings are current or completed, the protection granted by Parliament remains operational.&#8221;</span></p>
