The proposed adopter is Mr X, an American citizen, habitually resident in the United States.  </p>

Legal argument was heard on 3 March 2020, when the matter was adjourned for an addendum skeleton argument to be filed and notice to be given to Cafcass Legal to consider whether the child should be joined as a party. That skeleton has now been filed. It is of the highest standard, comprehensively setting out the applicable law with excellent analysis of the issues, which has been of enormous assistance to the court. </p>

She was removed from her birth parents by the local authority and placed for adoption with Mr X&#8217;s sister, Ms Y, when Z was 18 months old. Ms Y adopted Z when she was 2 years old. Very tragically, Ms Y became seriously ill and died when Z was 3 years old. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">During the adoption assessment of Ms Y she had informed the local authority that in the event of her death she wished her brother, Mr X, and her cousin, Ms W, to be appointed testamentary guardians for Z. Mr X, who had travelled to the UK after his sisters death, made a guardianship application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 5</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>. The subsequent court order, in 2015, appoints Mr X and Ms W as the joint guardians and gives them leave to remove Z from the jurisdiction. That order gives both Mr X and Ms W parental responsibility in relation to Z (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/5/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 5(6)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>). In 2016 Mr X and Z went to stay in Pakistan, where the wider family lived. In 2017 Z was placed in the care of her grandmother in Pakistan, so Mr X could return to the US to secure work and financially support Z. There came a time when Z&#8217;s grandmother was no longer able to care for her and plans were made for Mr X to resume her care. He returned with Z to this jurisdiction where he remains as the full-time carer for Z. </p>

This report has been approved by the Department of Homeland Security which has determined that Mr X meets the eligibility requirements as a Hague adoptive parent. His 1-800 petition (to classify Convention adoptee as an immediate relative) has been approved. The Article 15 report confirming his suitability has been sent to the DfE and the relevant local authority. The latter are in the process of completing the Article 16 report, which is due to be completed shortly and all the indications are that it will be positive. Once that is done the requirements under Article 17 will be considered and, if met, the Central Authorities of both States can agree the adoption may proceed (Article 17 </p>

It is due to this that Mr X seeks the revocation of his guardianship, thereby removing the need for his consent and therefore not benefiting from that position. In conventional circumstances, by giving consent to adoption as a person with parental responsibility the consequences usually mean, if an adoption order is made, that person will lose their status in relation to the child. Here by giving that consent Mr X will gain parental status through the adoption.  </p>

Notwithstanding the persistence of some delegations all along the Conference to insert the word "placement" in Article 17, as in other articles of the Convention, the term "entrustment" was maintained for the sake of clarity and because it offers the advantage that whoever does not understand its exact meaning will try to find it out and therefore obtain a satisfactory explanation.&#8217; </span></p>

Article 40 (1) provides <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;The authorities of the Contracting State of the child's habitual residence, or of the Contracting State where a measure of protection has been taken, may deliver to the person having parental responsibility or to the person entrusted with protection of the child's person or property, at his or her request, a certificate indicating the capacity in which that person is entitled to act and the powers conferred upon him or her.&#8217;</span> This article makes the distinction between &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">a person having parental responsibility&#8217;</span> and &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">a person entrusted with the protection of the child&#8217;s person or property&#8217;.</span> No further elucidation of this is provided in the Explanatory Report in respect of the 1996 Hague Convention.
