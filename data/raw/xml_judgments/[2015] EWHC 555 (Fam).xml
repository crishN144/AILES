Both counsel made nil returns, although Miss Campbell mentioned that she was out of the country.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 25 February 2015, a week after the hand-down, I received from Miss Campbell a lengthy request for amplification of my calculations and reasons. This is totally unacceptable. In that period I had left to sit on circuit and had dealt with much other work. Inevitably the details of this case had faded from my mind. The system depends on requests for clarification of the draft to be submitted promptly and in any event before the judgment is finalised and handed down. If Miss Campbell had anticipated that following her return from holiday she would seek amplification then she should have said so and asked for the hand-down to be deferred. That would have been considered by me on its merits.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my principal judgment I used the Duxbury algorithm to calculate the wife's needs for the three phases I identified. I started with phase 3 (see para 58). The figure calculated was &#163;1,191,357. I found that part of this fund would be met by the wife's pension share of &#163;650,000. That was a perfectly reasonable assumption to make given the greatly increased flexibility afforded to the holders of pension funds by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2014/30" uk:canonical="2014 c. 30" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Taxation of Pensions Act 2014</ref>, which received royal assent on 17 December 2014. It probably would have been a reasonable assumption even had the reform not been enacted.  I heard no argument to the contrary at the hearing. It would have been unreal to take some annuity figure calculated by a pension expert for the trial before District Judge Reid in October 2013 well before the pension reforms were announced in July 2014.  This deals with Miss Campbell's point No. 4. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_7">
	  <num>7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I explained in para 58 that in order to build the phase 3 Duxbury fund the wife would need to preserve carefully &#163;541,357 but that she would have available investment income from that sum to meet immediate needs in phases 1 and 2. I took the Duxbury norm of 3% gross. Miss Campbell asks at her point No. 2 "does the Duxbury calculation of &#163;1,191,357 assume gross investment income on the preserved element of &#163;541,357 remains invested in the fund?" The answer is a categorical no. The calculation in fact assumes that the sum will more than maintain its value in real terms enjoying the Duxbury norm for capital growth of 3.75% while experiencing inflation of 3%. So in real terms, on these norms, it will grow by 0.75% annually while the whole of its income yield will be available for meeting needs in phases 1 and 2. This would have been obvious from reading the explanatory text to Table 14 in the 2014-2015 edition of At A Glance.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Prompted by Miss Campbell&#8217;s propositions I have considered an alternative approach to the computation of the wife&#8217;s needs starting from the position that she has immediate funds of &#163;1,302,491 available to her, which will be augmented by earnings (in years 4-10) of around &#163;14,800 (which at current rates of tax would be &#163;13,007 p.a. net), together with a pension share of &#163;650,000 (in 2015). </p>

I have adopted a return rate of only 3.75% in relation to the pension growth so as not to need to compensate in the arithmetic for inflation. </p>

By the assumed date of her death in around 39 years according to the mortality tables, her capital wealth will have grown in absolute terms to over &#163;2.3m although with the effect of inflation that would have a real value of only about &#163;860,000. </p>

She will, of course, also still have her unencumbered home with a present value of over &#163;900,000. She would thus have, in today's money, on this alternative basis, around &#163;1.5m to pass on at her death, subject to inheritance tax.  </p>

All of the assumptions are necessary simplifications which will not materialise: as Ward LJ said in <span style="font-style:italic">B v B</span><span style="font-weight:bold"/><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1990] 1 FLR 20" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1990">[1990] 1 FLR 20</ref> '<span style="font-style:italic">the only certainty is that it will not happen as we have predicted'</span>.

In this case from the start of phase 1 to the end of phase 3 over 30 years are covered. Generally speaking in most human fields the best prophet of the future is the past. The key assumption is that over a longish period it can be reasonably predicted that a fund will perform in actual gross terms by <span style="font-weight:bold">6.75%</span> annually (i.e. 3% income yield plus 3.75% capital growth) but the owner of the fund will suffer inflation of <span style="font-weight:bold">3%</span> thus giving a <span style="font-weight:bold">real rate of return of 3.75%.</span> The key datum is however the predicted actual gross performance of 6.75%.

This corresponds to capital growth in that 30 year period of 5.74% annually. Over the same period the broader based FTSE-250 has grown by almost 8.8%, while a portfolio based on the US Dow Jones Industrial index (after allowing for the variance in the exchange rate) over the same period would have grown by over 6.9%. Thus it can be seen that the rate of capital return assumed in the Duxbury algorithm of just 3.75% is somewhat cautious, recognising that the recipient of an award is unlikely to be advised to invest the whole of her fund in equities, and that other kinds of investment are likely to achieve lower capital returns. Dividends (i.e. income yield) would also have been paid, perhaps at 3% a year. An alternative perspective is to look at P/E ratios over a long period. From 1990 to 2014 they have averaged for the UK 12.6, which translates to annual growth of 7.9%. So on the basis of history 6.75% per annum is a very reasonable guess.  </p>

However, if they do agree or if the judge decides that assumption is valid on the facts of a case, I cannot for my part see how objection can be taken. If they do not, then the rate chosen by the court should be reasoned." </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before me at the hearing Miss Campbell merely asserted a gross rate of return of 3%. No evidence was adduced as to why the views of the Duxbury Committee should not be followed, and for that reason I preferred, inevitably, to use the customary formula, with its stated economic assumption of an actual gross performance rate of 6.75%. In <span style="font-style:italic">H v H</span> at para 26 Ryder LJ stated that "I am very firmly of the view that there is no 'industry standard' even less an acknowledgement by the Family Division judges that there is or should be such a rate". Of course there is no "standard" rate in the sense that the economic assumptions underpinning the formula are written in marble from which there can be no deviation. But the Duxbury tables are used in countless cases. Their underlying methodology and assumptions are widely accepted as the usual starting point, and where there is no countervailing evidence, the usual finishing point. In that sense they do represent an "industry standard".</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In <span style="font-style:italic">H v H</span> the trial judge devised his own capitalisation methodology and used an actual rate of return of 3.75% net of tax for the purposes of his computations. I think he offered a hostage to fortune in departing from the Duxbury algorithm, especially where an option in the program is to do the calculation on a non-amortising basis (as I myself did for phases 1 and 2 &#8211; see para 59). In his para 25 Ryder LJ stated "it should be noted that 3.75% net would be 5.4% gross, a rate of return that would require some justification". With respect, it requires no particular justification. As I have explained, the central datum underpinning the Duxbury algorithm is a gross actual rate of return of 6.75%. And I have further explained that, irrespective of income yield, in terms of capital growth alone the FTSE 100 has grown annually over the last 30 years by 5.74% and better than that by reference to the FTSE-250 and the Dow Jones Industrial Index.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Her points Nos. 9 &#8211; 13 appear to suggest that the overall result is unfair when compared to the award which she successfully appealed. The first basic fallacy is the assumption that merely because the wife was successful in overturning the original award because of an error of approach by the District Judge, that the re-exercising of the judicial discretion on the correct approach would necessarily result in a markedly 'better' outcome for her. The second basic fallacy is that it treats the spousal maintenance awarded by the District Judge as if it were a guaranteed annuity. That it emphatically is not. It is variable. It would end on the death of either party or the remarriage of the wife. The husband in fact had lost his job and may well have succeeded in a downward variation. One can foresee many other circumstances where a variation might be ordered, most obviously on his retirement. In making her comparison Miss Campbell is simply not comparing like with like. On any view as a result of the appeal the wife is in a more secure, stable and independent position than she was before. She has not gained a pyrrhic victory. Above all, the appeal brought about a clean break, an objective which is not only socially desirable but which accords with the intention of Parliament (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref>A of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>). As the President, Sir Mark Potter, stated in <span style="font-style:italic">VB v JP</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2008/112" uk:canonical="[2008] EWHC 112 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] EWHC 112 (Fam)</ref> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 1 FLR 742" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 1 FLR 742</ref>, [2008] 2 FCR 682 at para 59 "a clean break is to be encouraged wherever possible". In her point 11 Miss Campbell says "W will now have to use her own resources to capitalise H&#8217;s obligation to pay periodical payments during phase 1 &amp; 2. W will fund her own clean break." I confess to failing to understand this point entirely. Of course every claimant must use her own resources to meet her needs, and can only claim periodical payments if they are insufficient. The submission comes close to suggesting that this wife has an independent sharing or compensation claim to the husband's income irrespective of her own resources. As I have sought to explain this could only happen in a most exceptional case, which this case clearly is not (see <span style="font-style:italic">B v S</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2012/265" uk:canonical="[2012] EWHC 265 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWHC 265 (Fam)</ref> at paras 75 &#8211; 79, and <span style="font-style:italic">SS v NS (Spousal Maintenance)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2014/4183" uk:canonical="[2014] EWHC 4183 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWHC 4183 (Fam)</ref> at para 46(ii)).</p>
