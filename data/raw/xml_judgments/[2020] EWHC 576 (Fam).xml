They concern the parties&#8217; daughter, A, who is 10 years old.  Her parents have been married for about 20 years.  Their relationship has, to put things neutrally, been unhappy for a number of years, and ended towards the end of 2018 although the father did not move out of the home until spring 2019.  In October 2019 the mother issued an application for a child arrangements order, stating that she sought a &#8216;live with&#8217; order for herself and for the respondent to have staying contact with A for one night on alternating weekends and for the holidays to be shared equally.    </p>

After the call, the mother says that A shook and cried uncontrollably, and that she slept in her mother&#8217;s bedroom that night. She performed badly in an exam the following day.   </p>

Although the father did not accept that he had screamed at A, he acknowledged that during the conversation he raised the subject of the dispute over the number of weekend nights she was spending with him, causing her to be uncomfortable.  The parties agreed an interim way forward, pending the FHDRA, that contact between the father and A should be supervised by an independent social worker. There were three or four such sessions.  </p>

For some time, the mother had made allegations that she was subjected to bullying and verbal abuse from the father .  Some six years ago she sought assistance from her GP, telling her that the father&#8217;s behaviour was causing her to suffer from low mood and tearfulness. The GP diagnosed an adjustment disorder with depressive symptoms.  The mother has suffered from this condition, with anxiety, over a substantial period of time and she consulted a psychiatrist in 2018, who referred her to a clinical psychologist.  In December 2018, after an episode where the mother suffered a panic attack, as a result she believes of an outburst of anger by the father, she contacted the psychiatrist to ask if she could suggest a therapist who specialised in domestic violence recovery, including emotional abuse and coercive behaviour. She said that someone who specialised in survivor recovery was what she needed most.  </p>

In order to avoid contact ceasing altogether the parties agreed that contact should take place supervised by an independent social worker (&#8220;ISW&#8221;), Ms Lawal-Pettifor.  She was present during several contacts which took place both at the father&#8217;s home and on outings. She prepared reports of the contact which I have read, and which were available to Judge Tolson. The notes demonstrate that contact went very well, and that the father was warm, loving and nurturing towards his daughter. She in turn was relaxed and happy. The relationship was good between them and natural too despite the presence of a professional.   </p>

If there are issues upon which the parties cannot agree, the court will make case management orders to enable them to be resolved. If there are allegations of abuse, then the court will consider whether or not to order that there should be a separate fact-finding hearing, and what evidence will be required to make that effective. A section 7, Cafcass report is likely to be ordered as well, although in many cases (but not all) it will await the outcome of the fact finding.

Where there are allegations of domestic abuse which remain undetermined, the court should not make an interim child arrangements order unless it is satisfied that it is in the interests of the child to do so and that the order would not expose the child or the other parent to an unmanageable risk of harm (bearing in mind the impact which domestic abuse against a parent can have on the emotional well-being of the child, the safety of the other parent and the need to protect against domestic abuse including controlling or coercive control).  </p>

He had approximate eight such hearings before him that day, and took this case over the lunch hour.  It demonstrates his extremely high workload.   The bundle in the case for that hearing is not huge, but it would have required an hour&#8217;s reading as it contained not only the documents described above, but the parties&#8217; respective position statements and detailed reports from the supervised contact visits which had taken place since the end of October.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Both sides were represented. The mother&#8217;s case was presented on the basis that she had been subjected to a decade of aggression, verbal abuse, criticism, gaslighting and then an episode of physical abuse in May 2019. Over the years it was said that the mother had had to seek treatment for PTSD and an anxiety disorder because of the father&#8217;s behaviour. It was in the light of this pattern of behaviour that the father&#8217;s episode of anger towards his daughter over the telephone in October was so serious. The mother said that it caused A very significant distress and put her in fear of her father, such that the mother had sought assistance from a consultant psychologist.   It was argued, in accordance with PD 12J, that the matter should be set down for a fact finding hearing and that in the meantime contact should continue to be supervised.   </p>

He denied screaming or shouting at A during the October phone call, although he did accept that he had queried her about whether or not she only wanted to spend one night the following weekend with him. He said he realised straight afterwards he should not have done this, and that he had planned to apologise to her for causing her distress. Whatever had happened in October, it was argued that it was not sufficient to lead to a refusal of anything other than unsupervised contact. The contact until that date (including the holiday in Europe just a week earlier) had gone very well and the reports of supervised contact between October and January were &#8216;glowing&#8217;. The court was invited to decline to order a fact finding hearing, or indeed any further investigation at all, and to allow the father to resume staying and unsupervised contact.  </p>

The safeguarding letter recommended that a section 7 report should be ordered and that a prohibited steps order should be considered to prevent A from being removed from the jurisdiction.   </p>

He said that the mother&#8217;s case would have to be investigated and that there should be a fact finding hearing, but after the section 7 investigation. He stated that his decision was about interim contact.  He remarked that the case was pitched &#8216;very high&#8217; on behalf of the mother and that there were a lack of specific examples, but also acknowledged that when controlling behaviour is alleged, that is not the whole picture.  He noted that the mother was suffering from anxiety (as he described it) and that there would be a need to consider how A&#8217;s views were coming about &#8211; whether they were based on the words and actions of her father or whether she was picking up on actions, words and attitudes of the mother.  </p>

He directed himself to PD12J and in particular reminded himself that any arrangements for contact must not produce an unmanageable risk to the child. He reminded himself not only as to the potential harm to the child, but also to the mother, and said that overall the matter was governed by s 1, namely the welfare of the child. He stated; &#8220;In my judgment, it should never be that simply making an allegation of domestic abuse produces automatically a cautious approach to child arrangements.  There are grave dangers in that, because the imposition of restricted arrangements upon a child can itself be damaging to the child&#8217;s welfare and can make a difficult situation even more complicated and harder to resolve in future&#8221;. </p>

The mother herself acknowledged that in her application to the court in October (before the phone call), and moreover, supervised contact had already been tried, the reports were very positive, and it was time to move on. He supported the proposals put forward on behalf of the father and it was time to return to normality. The risks of not doing this were greater than doing it, as the child might become caught up in a highly conflictual situation.  Another ski trip was planned and the child should not miss out on that, and also it would be good to test this all out from a forensic point of view.  </p>

The judgment makes clear that the judge intended to make an interim order pending a return to court in April, with the benefit of a report from Cafcass, to consider the way forward (including the likely listing of a fact finding hearing).  The order as to child arrangements, starts off (at paragraph 14.1) by stating &#8216;in the interim the mother shall make sure that the child spends time with her father&#8217; but then settles arrangements for contact until December 2020 and beyond, allowing for Christmas and Easter Days to be alternated between the parents annually, and for birthdays and other festivals .  </p>

The judge did his best to assist with this by setting out his reasons on the face of the order, but in addition what looked to all intents and purposes to be a final child arrangements order was approved. Whether this was in error or not, it was too soon for a such a comprehensive order to be made.  </p>

In fact, before getting to that stage, it is not entirely clear what the judge intended to order here either. He certainly intended that contact should be unsupervised, and that it should be regular and generous.  In his judgment he referred to the need to get back to normality, but there was ambiguity in the information that was presented to him as to what normality actually was.  Some of the paperwork suggested that A had been having regular contact every other weekend for two nights as well as the holidays. This was not in fact the case. There had been some weekend contact, but (for reasons which are not clear) it had been a little sporadic, or &#8216;on and off&#8217;. The holidays had, however, definitely happened. But in preferring the proposals put forward by the father the judge was actually sanctioning a significant amount more contact than had hitherto been taking place.  I do not believe that he was fully aware of that.  </p>

He was entitled to take into account the good quality of the contact as viewed by the independent social worker, and the fact that A had had unsupervised holiday and other contact before the October incident which had gone very well. His reference to the mother suffering from anxiety is difficult to criticise because the report from the GP says just that.

The focus on this,  I believe, led him to give insufficient weight to the allegations that the mother had made in the C1A, and developed at the hearing . It was right that at the point she filed it that she was proposing that A had staying contact with her father at weekends and for half of all the holidays. That might be because the allegations she was making were exaggerated or even untrue, but equally it might be because at that stage she had not appreciated the risk of this behaviour to A as well as herself and only did so later. There are situations where a parent who is or has been abused does not believe that the abuse would be turned upon the child but then realises that it might, when, for example, there is an episode such as is described here, where the father is alleged to have shouted at his daughter over the phone for a prolonged period.   It might also take time for a parent to appreciate the emotional consequences for the child of witnessing one parent abusing another.   </p>

Here I am satisfied that the arrangements are in A&#8217;s best interests and do not pose a risk for her or her mother which cannot be managed.  The father has moved out of the family home and there have been no reported incidents of any sort since October. Safeguarding checks have been completed. The mother is represented by highly experienced solicitors who will have been able to discuss things carefully with her.  All agree that this is a father who very much loves his daughter, and that (whether the allegations are true or not) his motives in seeking contact are genuine, and not as happens in some cases, a means to harass or control the mother. He has been observed to be loving and nurturing in contact visits, and A is relaxed and happy with him. He has not shown any signs of impatience or temper in the supervised contact. Father and A show each other spontaneous affection, and A will gently tease him too. The father is prepared to go to family therapy with A and also to complete an online questionnaire as part of the Freedom Programme.
