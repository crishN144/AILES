	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The cause of P&#8217;s death was a central point of the proceedings relating to K.  Those proceedings included what are commonly called a fact finding hearing and a disposal hearing.  They also contained a hearing at which the parents sought the discharge of the care order.  That application was refused.  The first two hearings were before Bracewell J and the later hearing was before Kirkwood J.  They gave judgment on respectively 29 June 2000, 7 November 2000 and 11 October 2001.  The second judgment of Bracewell J was  delivered in an anonymised form in open court, and is therefore a public document.  I have adopted most of her anonymisation.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the fact finding hearing in June 2000 Bracewell J found to the civil standard of proof that Mrs Haynes had obstructed P&#8217;s airways on four separate occasions leading to cerebral oedema and his death on the last episode.  In short that Mrs Haynes killed P and had intentionally obstructed his airways on three previous occasions.  In doing so Bracewell J heard medical evidence and evidence from Mrs Haynes (and others).  Bracewell J analysed and made findings on such evidence.  She rejected the evidence of Mrs Haynes concerning the history of the four episodes and did not find her to be a truthful witness.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is common ground between all the medical experts who have considered this case (and there have been a great number) that the undisputed elements of the history relating to the four incidents are consistent with, but not diagnostic of, P&#8217;s airways being intentionally blocked.  It is also common ground that in respect of each of the four incidents Mrs Haynes had the opportunity to do this and that no other person did.  In this context there is, of course, nothing unusual in a mother being the person who is most often alone with her baby.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue relating to the cause of P&#8217;s death (and the earlier incidents) was, and is, whether they have a natural or non-accidental cause or causes or whether Mrs Haynes was responsible for them and therefore inflicted harm on P.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Amongst the medical evidence heard and read by Bracewell J was evidence from two paediatricians Professor Meadow and Professor X.  It is already in the public domain that the Professor M referred to by Bracewell J in her public judgment is Professor Meadow.  These experts disagreed.  Professor Meadow was of the view that it was more likely than not that A&#8217;s death was caused by the mother as Bracewell J found was the case.  Professor X proceeded on the basis that the account of the history given by Mrs Haynes was truthful and was of the view that it was more likely than not that the cause of the incidents and thus of A&#8217;s death was an unknown metabolic cause.  Bracewell J found that parts of the accounts given by the mother to Professor X were not accurate or intended to be helpful in finding the truth.   </p>

	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thus the parents had support from Professor X, and the upshot of all the medical evidence in June 2000 was that the choice was between smothering and an unknown metabolic cause.  A considerable amount of work and investigation had been done by a number of doctors as the background to that conclusion.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In 2001 there was an investigation by the police prompted at least in part by the parents reporting Professor Meadow and another doctor to the coroner and the police for perjury and to the GMC for misconduct.  The parents had enlisted the help of a councillor to act on their behalf.  During that investigation a number of other medical experts became involved.  Professor X&#8217;s position remained the same.  Kirkwood J considered the additional medical evidence and the criticisms then levelled at Professor Meadow.  He concluded that there was absolutely nothing in the medical material that had arisen since June 2000 to show that the finding of Bracewell J was apparently wrong and that, if anything, the result of the police inquiries reinforced it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">After the disposal hearing in November 2000 both parents sought permission to appeal the earlier findings made by Bracewell J in June and to appeal the care order.  These applications were refused on paper by Thorpe LJ.  The father sought a reconsideration at an oral hearing.  There is a record of that application being refused but the father has no recollection of attending such a hearing.  It seems that it may have been refused without a hearing on the basis that as the mother (who was then separately represented) had not made such an application the father (then in person) had indicated that he did not want an oral hearing.  No application to appeal the order of Kirkwood J was made. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">No criticism is made of the approach in law taken by either Bracewell J or Kirkwood J.  I comment that the approach taken by Bracewell J has been confirmed by later cases to have been the correct one.  It is manifest from her judgment that she recognised the respective roles of the court and the expert witnesses (to which I return later) and had regard to all aspects of the evidential jigsaw she referred to.  She did not proceed on the basis of suspicion but on the basis of undisputed facts and facts found by her to the civil standard for the reasons she gave.</p>

The local authority rely on those findings to establish the jurisdictional threshold for making a care order in respect of K, and thus the jurisdictional trigger to the court&#8217;s ability to consider what order would best promote the welfare of S. The parents argue that those findings should not be so relied on.</p>

Permission is granted for that expert to perform any examination of, or ethically justifiable tests upon, S that all parties including the Guardian agree. &#8211; Without limiting the scope of the instructions, the expert should be requested (a) the report on all aspects of the case relevant to the question of whether or not the mother injured P, and (b) to comment on all issues raised by Dr Z  [a doctor instructed by the parents to whom Holman J had directed  questions agreed by the parties were to be put] &#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is common ground between the parties that Holman J stated and directed that this order for directions was to be implemented in a stepped way by firstly inviting that further expert (paediatrician) to consider whether there had been any relevant medical advances or changes since June 2000.  The order is not however so limited.  Rather it sets a wide ambit of enquiry and investigation in that it directs the expert to report on all aspects of the case that are relevant to the question whether the mother injured P.

This resulted in a foreign paediatrician being instructed, Professor Y.  This did not occur until June 2005.  At that stage none of the parties revisited, or invited the court to revisit, the stepped approach that Holman J had indicated should be taken and they agreed instructions to Professor Y on that &#8220;stepped basis&#8221;.  Certainly with hindsight it can be seen that this agreed course of action introduced a great risk that, as has happened, the case would not be ready for trial in November 2005.  For example, this risk flowed from the point that the agreed instructions to this newly instructed expert did not contain any instructions for him to consider the parts of the evidence of Professor Meadow which are attacked or questioned by the parents (or any of the other parties) and enclosed a limited number of documents.  </p>

Rather the court has a judicial discretion (i) not to allow parties to call evidence on and challenge issues decided in an earlier case (stage 1), and (ii) to regulate the evidence that can be called and the extent of any challenge to, and revisiting of, the earlier finding and thus the nature and extent of the inquiry relating to an earlier finding (stage 2).

The local authority seek to establish the threshold in the case concerning S on the same basis by relying on that finding of Bracewell J.  No other basis for establishing threshold is advanced at present.  So if the court decides that it cannot now rely on that overall finding of Bracewell J the local authority do not at present seek a hearing at which the mother would give evidence again. Their position is that S should then return home whatever the extent of the other findings of Bracewell J that the court concludes stand.

It underlies the difficult position that doctors, local authorities, parents and others are in when dealing with child protection issues.  </p>

Thus, in my view the attack on the evidence of Professor Meadow is one that should be based on the validity of what he said in this case rather than a more general one by reference to, for example the hearings relating to the GMC proceedings concerning Professor Meadow, as to which there is an appeal, or other cases in which he has been involved.  However the parents have indicated that they wish to rely on extracts from the transcripts of the GMC proceedings and have agreed to, and have been directed to, identify all the extracts they rely on.  I agree with the other parties that they should be allowed to do this.  The relevance and weight of such material can only be assessed when it has been identified and the parents have particularised the reasons why they assert it is relevant.</p>

It was not argued that there should be no supervision or, as it had been in June 2005, that the supervision should be by friends and family.  I rejected that argument in June.  The argument was that two outside supervisors were unnecessary and overly intrusive.  The Guardian suggested that the supervisors could work in two 3 hour shifts and this was supported  by the parents who prayed in aid Dr U&#8217;s view that the mother was a low risk and unlikely to harm S in a moment when a supervisor was not present.</p>

Such reporting may therefore fail to prompt public discussion based on, a balanced and properly informed view of the issues of general public interest and thus, for example, of the differences between criminal and civil procedures, the underlying aim and purpose of the Children Act and the dilemma in Family cases where there is a risk of tragic results whatever decision is taken.</p>
