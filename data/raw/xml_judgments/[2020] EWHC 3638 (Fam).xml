	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in">This is an application by a local authority for final care and placement orders pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/22" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 22</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref>. The current placement application was issued in January this year (2020) but the case has a long and protracted history.  The child at the centre of these proceedings is a little girl, GC, who was born in 2018.  She is now approximately 2&#189; years old.  Her mother is Y, the first respondent.  GC&#8217;s father is not named on her birth certificate, but he is believed to be Z, the mother&#8217;s partner<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in">Within days of GC&#8217;s birth, the local authority issued care proceedings.  At that stage, concerns for GC flowed from her mother&#8217;s history and the risks which were perceived to exist as a result of Mr Z&#8217;s presence as part of the household.  GC&#8217;s mother had previously given birth to an older child, B, who had been placed with the maternal grandmother, &#8216;MGM&#8217;, pursuant to a special guardianship order.  Y has a long history of mental health difficulties.  She took a potentially fatal overdose when B, aged three months, was in her sole care.  The local authority initiated the current care proceedings in respect of GC because of this history and concerns that Y lacked any insight into the risks posed by Mr Z.  She and GC were placed in a residential assessment unit within ten days of GC&#8217;s birth.  The outcome of that assessment process was not positive in terms of this mother&#8217;s ability to provide good enough care for her younger daughter.  GC moved into foster care on 24 April 2018. </p>

Whilst some contact with her maternal grandmother and her partner, Mr MGM, continued on a monthly basis whilst in the care of her foster parents, that contact with the extended family ceased in October 2019.  Shortly thereafter, her grandmother and her long-term partner withdrew from these proceedings recognising that they were unable to protect GC from the potential risks posed by Mr Z in the context of a family placement.  </p>

She has throughout these proceedings maintained her relationship with Mr Z and it is assumed that he is the father of </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">her youngest child.  BC was born in Europe at a time when Y and Mr Z had left England in order to disappear from the view of authorities in this jurisdiction.  Immediately prior to the start of this hearing, they were living at an unknown address in a European Country having travelled through, and apparently lived in, two other European Countries for a period of time.  Y is represented in these proceedings by Ms S who has been fully involved on her behalf throughout this hearing.  GC&#8217;s mother herself has not taken any direct part in the final hearing although I have a short video statement from her.  Whilst I was told shortly before the commencement of this hearing that she had ended her relationship with Mr Z who was on his way back to England, I am very doubtful that this is a truthful representation of the current position.  She misled the local authority on a previous occasion about her relationship with him prior to arriving in X having left her mother&#8217;s home in town X and travelled with Mr Z via other locations.  She confirmed in her evidence to this court that the relationship was ongoing and that Mr Z had taken BC to the beach when she recorded her video statement on 25 May 2020 shortly before this hearing began.  She has been quite unable to remove herself from the relationship over the past two and more years despite the fact that it has come at the cost of any chance that GC might be returned to her care.  From everything which I have heard and read about this case, it appears to me that the underlying dynamic of their relationship is one of coercive control and there are obviously ongoing and growing concerns for the safety of her youngest child, BC.  I need say no more in this judgment about the steps which have been taken in order to address these issues.  Mr Z&#8217;s involvement with the proceedings ended within weeks of GC&#8217;s removal.  In early March 2018, his solicitor reported that Mr Z had given instructions that he was &#8220;washing his hands of it&#8221;; they subsequently came off the record and Mr Z was discharged as a party. </p>

Of particular concern in the context of these proceedings is his reported view that if he is not able to care for his child, no one else will.  He reported during a telephone conversation with one of the independent social workers involved in this case that &#8220;if he wanted to, he would have the means to find [GC] wherever she was placed&#8221;.   </p>

In these periods, his risk assessment has been escalated to &#8220;high&#8221;.  This lack of engagement makes his behaviour unpredictable.  He has numerous offences which have involved violent assaults against both people and animals and is on record as having attended an appointment with a mental health professional whilst carrying on his person what appears to have been a bladed knife.  In January 2018 the police received a report that Mr Z had purchased a quantity of pharmaceuticals which were potentially explosive if mixed together.  He has made numerous serious and sadistic threats against both adults and children.   </p>

He appears to be proficient in &#8220;hacking&#8221; into digital and social media platforms even in circumstances where significant firewalls have been put in place to preserve confidentiality.  This has been a particular concern in this case where several case management hearings, as well as the substantive hearing, have been conducted remotely.  Such was the level of concern for GC&#8217;s safety in her current placement that a formal risk assessment was prepared by a consultant psychologist, Dr Gough.  I shall return to her evidence at a later stage of my judgment.  She attended the final hearing to give oral evidence and has stressed to me the serious and significant risk of physical harm which Mr Z poses not only to GC but to those caring for her.  She describes that risk as multifaceted and one which is likely to continue into the future regardless of any decisions which I make in the context of these proceedings as to where GC should live. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">There are trenchant criticisms made of the local authority&#8217;s conduct of these proceedings, not least because of the significant delay which there has been in securing a final resolution in terms of the future arrangements for GC.  The first interim care order in these proceedings was made in January 2018 when A was a few days old.  She has thus been the subject of this litigation for her entire life and, only months from her third birthday, there are still no decisions about her future.  This judgment will bring that certainty for her and all those who love her but the degree of stress and distress which this long delay has caused to her family and her carers cannot be underestimated.   </p>

In order to avoid yet further delay and enable future planning for GC, I handed down an abbreviated judgment which announced my decision and the reasons for it.  I said that I intended to make orders pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/28/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 28(2)</ref> and (3)(a) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> and under the inherent jurisdiction so as to enable GC&#8217;s name to be changed as part of the risk assessment profile. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The local authority&#8217;s care plan for GC has changed several times throughout the course of this litigation.  Various family members have been encouraged to believe that a placement within the extended family was a clear option only to be told that support for that option was to be withdrawn.  GC was placed with Mr and Mrs S, her current foster carers, on the basis that it was potentially an adoptive placement.  They received GC into their home on that basis only to be told subsequently that other family members were being assessed as long-term carers for GC.  When GC&#8217;s maternal grandmother and her partner withdrew as potential carers, Mr and Mrs US stepped into the frame to care for their greatniece.  Mrs US is the sister of GC&#8217;s maternal grandmother, MGM.  With her husband, she lives in the United States.  They have several children, all now adults, the youngest of whom continues to share their family home with the US&#8217;s young grandson.   They have been positively assessed as carers and, having been given party status, they have attended throughout this hearing.  With good reason, they point to several failings on the part of the local authority which they say has prejudiced the wider family&#8217;s ability to keep GC within a family placement for the remaining years of her childhood and adolescence. </p>

GC&#8217;s mother attended the hearing having made it plain at the start that she had accepted that the court would not place GC back in her care.  As she has done throughout, she was supporting a placement of GC within her extended family.  The judge was critical during that hearing of an assessment made by one of the local authority&#8217;s lead social workers.  He accepted the views of the Guardian that GC&#8217;s particular needs were then pointing in the direction of &#8220;a quiet, calm and nurturing environment&#8221;.  At that stage she had no relationship with her grandmother and Mr MGM.  However the judge was not prepared to rule them out despite observing that there had been some reluctance on their part to engage fully with social services.   </p>

On 10 June 2018 that assessment was completed by an independent social worker who recommended that GC should be placed with her maternal grandmother under a special guardianship order.  Notwithstanding the acknowledged risks posed by Mr Z, the social worker envisaged at that stage that such a placement would enable GC to have some relationship with her mother in the future and recommended a 12 month supervision order to support them in respect of any issues over contact. </p>

The viability assessment which was prepared at the end of May 2018 reflected the fact that the USs were then living on a US Navy base in another jurisdiction but were planning to return to their home in the USA at the end of Mr US&#8217;s overseas posting in about a year.  Mrs US made it clear that, if necessary, she would return to the United States to care for GC immediately.  At that stage, neither knew very much at all about GC&#8217;s circumstances or the risks which Mr Z was then known to pose.  The assessment records that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;she felt both MGM and Y are good parents and she would let them see [GC] any time&#8221;</span>.  No criticism at all can be made of Mrs US for expressing that initial view.  It is clear from what she told the social worker that, whilst she kept in touch with her sister, she was not up to date with family news and had not been drawn into events flowing from GC&#8217;s birth in the early part of that year. </p>

As I have made clear at the start of my judgment, I have little doubt that such a move was designed to ensure that the local authority did not become aware of the pregnancy.  In July, the Guardian prepared a further report for the forthcoming case review hearing which a circuit judge was due to conduct in September of that year.  She acknowledged the many positives which had emerged from the most recent assessment of the maternal grandparents and adopted the description of them as being &#8220;passionate and genuine in their wish to care for [GC]&#8221;.  However, she identified in her analysis some inconsistency in the information which had been provided.  In the Guardian&#8217;s view, this had the potential to impact on the evaluation of risk if GC were to be placed in their care on a longer-term basis.  There is no need for me to set out the list of the Guardian&#8217;s concerns: the most significant issue was the potential for Mrs MGM to minimise the risks presented by Mr Z. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On 28 September 2018, the matter was back before a circuit judge for further case management.  The timetable set by the court for a resolution of GC&#8217;s future had expired some four days earlier on 24 September.  The final hearing had been listed over four days in November 2018.  By that stage there were a number of third party family members who had put themselves forward as potential carers for GC, including further members of the extended family who, like Mr and Mrs US, were living in the United States.  The solicitor who was then acting for the local authority had not complied with the court&#8217;s direction in relation to these third party potential carers and this had caused slippage and delay in the timetable.  In addition he failed to apply to the court for an extension of the timetable as a result of these failures.  Mr and Mrs US had travelled to England and were present in the court building on 28 September 2018 although they were not present at the hearing.  They were then pressing for a full viability assessment.  With the support of the local authority, the judge agreed to sanction that course.  He imposed a tight timetable and included within the raft of orders which he made on that occasion provision for all outstanding viability assessments.  The USs were invited to attend the next hearing with legal representation. </p>

A hearing towards the end of October 2018 which had been listed as a final hearing was adjourned part heard after the judge had heard from several professional witnesses.  At that point the local authority withdrew its placement application on the basis of its alternative plan to continue with the family assessments.  Mr and Mrs S were advised that the decision to place GC with them with a view to adoption had been rescinded.  Formal advice was sought in relation to the legal formalities which would be required to accommodate a lawful placement with the extended family in the United States. </p>

The fact that they continued to provide unstinting love and care for this child is testament to their commitment to GC and her future notwithstanding the shifting sands on which they then appeared to be standing.  </p>

GC, meanwhile, continued to live with Mr and Mrs S and looked to them to meet all of her complex and ongoing needs.  From a human perspective, it is difficult to imagine the distress which the emotional pressures generated by this litigation must have been causing to all those involved.  As I have said, for Mr and Mrs S who were continuing to care for this little girl and to provide for her every need despite the changing intentions of the local authority, the pressures must have been acute. </p>

That was the plan when the matter came back to the circuit judge for a further four day hearing at the end of March 2019.  MGM, GC&#8217;s maternal grandmother, gave evidence on that occasion and confirmed that she recognised the risks posed by Mr Z and would be prepared to step back from her application for a special guardianship order if the court considered that a placement outside this jurisdiction was a safer option for GC  In the light of the catalogue of complaints which was then before the court, the Judge decided to escalate the case to the Designated Family Judge for X.  </p>

In February 2020 there was a positive home study report which supported an adoptive placement with them.  Notwithstanding that report, the local authority had by then revised its position once again from the foot of the two risk assessment reports which were then available from Drs Gough and Tostevin.  Mr and Mrs US were advised that the local authority would no longer support them as long-term carers for GC because of the risks to the child outlined in those reports. </p>

I remained extremely concerned about further delay for this little girl.  Over the course of the next few weeks, I held several remote case management hearings.  As the weeks went on and the guidance changed in line with our increasing familiarity with working remotely, I agreed to list the case on the basis of a remote hearing.  I did not have ten days available within this child&#8217;s time frame and I agreed with counsel that we would take a six day window which I had managed to create on the basis that judgment would have to be reserved at the conclusion of evidence and submissions. </p>

In short, this was a case where I had expert evidence from Dr Tostevin about the potentially catastrophic consequences for GC were she to be moved from her placement with her foster carers.  In circumstances where there were family members offering her a home in the United States, an option supported by GC&#8217;s mother, the foster carers were very concerned that I should make my decision on the basis of the very best evidence available.  They felt that they could shine a light on GC&#8217;s experience of life within their family unit which would provide me with greater insight than that which I would get from merely reading reports.  </p>

I am entirely satisfied that the hearing was fair and complied with the Article 6 rights of all the parties.  The technology worked very well and enabled each of Mr and Mrs US to participate throughout:  he joined the hearing daily from Poland where he was stationed and she from her home in the USA.  We adjusted the court sitting day so as to accommodate the time difference with the United States.  With regular breaks throughout the sitting day, we completed the evidence within five days and I consulted regularly with counsel to ensure that their respective clients were content with the manner in which we were proceeding. With counsel and their instructing solicitors, the digital platform we were using accommodated approximately fifteen participants on a daily basis.  I had a very good opportunity to observe the parties and the expert witnesses and did not feel at any disadvantage in my assessment of them and the evidence they gave me. Notwithstanding the remote nature of the hearing and the importance of the issues at stake, I regard this case as a model of what can be done in an international case involving expert evidence and the future of a child.  </p>

I have to consider the likely effect of a change in the child&#8217;s identity and status arising out of any decision to make an adoption order and these factors have to be considered separately in relation to each of the options before the court.  In this context, I must consider the nature of the relationship which GC has with members of her extended maternal family and with her current foster carers, Mr and Mrs S.  Each has stepped forward in what I am persuaded is a genuine and principled commitment to provide GC with a home and a family.  There is no doubt that each of the potential placements available to her is underpinned by a great deal of thought, care and, to the extent possible, insight into what will be required to ensure that GC&#8217;s next few years are as safe and secure as they can be.  Those early years will inform GC&#8217;s future as she grows into adolescence and later adulthood.  They are vital years in terms of the prognosis for her future.  The trajectory of her life has been interrupted by the events which shaped the early weeks and months of her experience of care and whomever is entrusted with the care of this child will need professional support to shape that insight into GC&#8217;s developing needs over the years ahead. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">What is required of the court is an holistic evaluation of all the circumstances.  Both the positive and negative aspects of each option have to be considered in terms of GC&#8217;s welfare.  The court must conduct a granular analysis of the benefits and risks which flow, or are likely to flow, from each of the alternatives.  This includes any risk in GC&#8217;s current placement if it is approved, just as it includes risks in the alternative care plan which involves placement with Mr and Mrs US.  The court must look not only at the direct risks which might flow from a placement once achieved or finalised but also at risks which could flow from legal or procedural obstacles in achieving such a placement.  A crucial element of the overall balancing exercise will inevitably involve the relevant Art 8 rights of GC and all those willing to offer her a home and a long term family placement.  I can only interfere with those rights to the extent that such interference is both necessary and proportionate.  The evidence will inform that critical balancing exercise.  In this case the court has the benefit of expert evidence in relation to the nature and evaluation of the future risk to GC in each of the alternative placements.  Those assessments and the expert opinions from the professionals who have prepared the reports are an essential part of the global picture; whilst not determinative, they are nevertheless important.  Similarly, in this case the court has the assistance of the professional views of a very senior and experienced Children&#8217;s Guardian who has represented GC&#8217;s interests throughout this litigation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I have reminded myself specifically of all the guidance flowing from the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (A Child) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2013/33" uk:canonical="[2013] UKSC 33" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] UKSC 33</ref> and from the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B-S (Children) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/1146" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 1146" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 1146</ref>.  Each of these authorities emphasise the need for a solid and substantial evidence-based assessment of all the alternative options for a child so as to ensure that the court has sufficient information on which to reach its conclusions.   I am satisfied that, in this case, there are only two realistic options for GC.  As the evidence assembled in support of the case advanced by Mr and Mrs US now demonstrates, each will involve adoption and the reconfiguration of GC&#8217;s legal status outside her immediate birth family.  There is no possibility of GC growing up with the birth family which brought her into this world:  the risks here are too great as even her mother acknowledges.  Given that a placement outside the extended family is properly considered to be the most draconian option for any child in GC&#8217;s position, the court must be astute in its survey of any alternative option which might preserve those family ties.  Whilst there has plainly been delay and uncertainty in this case caused in no small measure by the absence of a clear and consistent care plan, I am satisfied that I am now equipped by a carefully researched evidence base to assess the options which are available in terms of the arrangements for GC&#8217;s future.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Counsel submitted their written closing submissions the following week on the basis that I would prepare a reserved written judgment. I am acutely conscious of the investment which Mr and Mrs US and Mr and Mrs S have made in these proceedings and their outcome.  Having listened to them carefully over a number of days, it is only right that I state at the outset my appreciation for the quiet dignity which they displayed throughout.  Mr and Mrs US&#8217;s wish to offer GC a secure home for the rest of her childhood and thereafter to launch her into adult life from the platform of what they intend should be a loving, settled home is as remarkable as it is selfless.  They are thoroughly good people whose engagement in these proceedings has come from the very best place.  They have already raised a family of their own and I could see the evident delight which Mrs US takes in the presence of her grandchild within the home she shares with her daughter.  They are a thoroughly child-centred couple who have stepped into the breach of a very difficult family situation.  Having had access to all the evidence in the case, they can have been in no doubt about the scale of the task which lies ahead given the clear risks posed to GC and to them by Mr Z.  The individual care plans produced by the local authority demonstrate the extent to which they will need to make significant changes in the way they live their lives if GC were to move to live with them in the United States.  It would have meant the severing of some important ties with other family members in England.   All this they were willing to undertake in order to provide GC with the opportunity to grow up within her extended family.  I should want them to know that they have this court&#8217;s respect and gratitude for the stance they have taken. </p>

It is difficult to underestimate the degree of stress and confusion which they must have experienced as these proceedings unfolded through 2019.  GC was placed with them when she was three months old.  They have loved and cared for her over more than two years as she has grown into the lovely child she is today.  That unswerving devotion has not wavered throughout some very unsettling months over which the local authority&#8217;s planning for GC has changed and changed again.  Over that period, GC has become a fully integrated member of their family.  She is loved not only by Mr and Mrs S but by their young son who regards GC as a sister.  That a choice has to be made between these two sets of prospective carers must be exquisitely painful for each but it is a decision from which this court cannot shy.  I can only hope that they will read this judgment and understand why I have been driven to reach the conclusion which will be reflected in the order I propose to make. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">She has identified a number of static risk factors as well as dynamic risk factors which are likely to be in play in the future.  The former includes both mental illness (including paranoia and psychotic symptoms) and personality disorder (with psychopathic characteristics).  She points to the fact that the risks posed by Mr Z were unmanageable even in the context of a custodial sentence.  He was required to serve the full term of a four year prison sentence.  Since his release from that incarceration in 2016, he has not engaged at all with professionals.  He was observed to repeatedly harm and kill pigeons by biting off their heads and tying them to a hot water pipe.  He failed to engage with professionals on his release from prison and there has been no opportunity as a result to explore how risks might be managed in future.  It is for this reason that Dr Gough concludes in her report that the level and nature of the risk he poses remains static: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;It has to be regarded as controlling, predatory and sadistic&#8221;</span> (paragraph 4.10).  She regards him to pose a significant risk to GC of both physical violence and sexual harm.  The level of caution required is <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;extremely high&#8221;</span>.  She does not regard geographical distance (i.e. a move to the United States) as necessarily offering protection to GC given Mr Z&#8217;s obvious ability to travel between countries and the specific risk posed by his predatory internethacking.  She concludes that the risks to GC and her carers of stalking, harassment and emotional abuse will not reduce as a result of increased physical distance alone.  Further, because he is able to appear and disappear at will, it is impossible to work with Mr Z so as to manage risk in the future.  Any risk management plan must therefore utilise external controls to keep GC and her carers safe.  This will inevitably involve multi-agency professional systems such as border controls, police intelligence, the local authority and multi-agency professionals. </p>

Where, as here, there are concerns about some of the extended family members, including Mrs US&#8217;s sister, GC&#8217;s maternal grandmother, the court would need to be absolutely confident that a placement within the extended family would not expose her to risk as a direct result of those continuing familial ties. </p>

I asked Dr Gough to meet with Mr and Mrs US in order to explore what risk management strategies might be put in place were GC to move to the United States.  The results of that assessment were reflected in her second report in May 2020.   It proceeded from the foot of what was obviously a frank and open exchange of views over more than one meeting.  Mr and Mrs US engaged fully in that process.  Dr Gough identified the position of emotional conflict in which they found themselves believing, as they do, so strongly in the value of family connection and ties.  They told Dr Gough that they found it hard to imagine that a court would require them to cut off ties with their family in England as the price of caring safely for GC.  It was the strength of these ties which led Dr Gough reluctantly to conclude that those beliefs and emotions around the importance of family would have a significant impact upon their capacity to keep GC safe despite their obvious intentions to do so. </p>

She identified two principal risks to A:  the first was the forensic risk of Mr Z discovering where she was and/or wider family members bringing pressure to bear on the USs for information about GC or direct contact with her.

She dismissed as unlikely the possibility that many of Mr Z&#8217;s thoughts could be confined to the realms of fantasy.  She told me that the evidence established that his internet searches had involved violent acts to animals, death, torture and cannibalism.  He had highly developed internet skills and was likely to be better placed than many to deploy those skills to find GC. His failure to engage with any professional agencies informed her conclusion, clearly expressed to me, that the risk he presents to GC and her carers is both &#8220;unassessed and unmanageable&#8221;.  Dr Gough acknowledges that there is no risk-free solution for GC but she plainly has significant concerns about the potential visibility of a placement within the extended family notwithstanding the potential advantage of geographical distance.  </p>

She prepared her first report in December 2019 at a time when GC was almost 2 years old and had been with Mr and Mrs S for 19 months.  She described in that report the harmful and developmentally traumatic effects which the care she had experienced in the first fifteen weeks of her life had produced.  I quote below from paragraph 1.2 of her report because it encapsulates the essence of much of her oral evidence. </p>

However, this is fragile, and she will easily revert to highly avoidant strategies when she perceives stress and threat.  Should a move be considered for [GC], I would be very concerned that, at the age of 23 months, she would be placed in a position where those highly avoidant strategies would be fully triggered, where her bias for threat would be heightened once again and her &#8216;window of opportunity&#8217; for recovery again with alternative carers would be a significant challenge for her.  In the short term, the loss of her primary carers who have provided her with good care since the age of 15 weeks would be highly detrimental.  In the longer term, it is likely that she will continue to use highly avoidant strategies to cope in her life, because those will become embedded as predominant strategies.  Individuals who use highly avoidant strategies through their life are vulnerable to mental health difficulties through their life.&#8221; </p>

It was her clear view that it was very unlikely that any such plan could be supported from GC&#8217;s current home in circumstances where GC was already hypervigilant within her environment and would undoubtedly pick up on the distress of Mr and Mrs S.  Dr Tostevin&#8217;s professional view was that any transition plan would be likely to involve an intermediate placement which would cause additional trauma and harm to GC and was likely to add to the negative long term consequences of a removal from her current home. </p>

She accepted that Mr and Mrs US were good and committed parents to their own children and were likely to offer the same level of commitment to GC.  However, she told me that GC&#8217;s needs were such that it would not matter how good any substitute carers might be.  Any move away from Mr and Mrs S at this stage would be damaging and traumatic for GC and was likely to leave her with irreparable longer-term consequences.   She was asked about the difficult balance between ensuring her physical safety in a placement where Mr Z might be less likely to find her and the potential emotional harm involved in a move.  Dr Tostevin&#8217;s evidence was that this child&#8217;s physical and emotional safety were interlinked, a view which I share.  The emotional harm flowing from a move at this stage was &#8220;very significant&#8221; and it may well be that she would not recover from that harm.  She said: </p>

Dr Tostevin told me that, when she visited GC at Mr and Mrs S&#8217;s home, the child had demonstrated a real eagerness to interact with the people around her with whom she was clearly so familiar.  An autistic child or a child with an organic developmental disorder would be unlikely to present in this way. Whilst she could not rule out the possibility of dyspraxia, she told me that the tension she observed in GC&#8217;s body could equally well be the result of past trauma or a reaction to perceived stress. </p>

This conclusion flowed from the &#8220;absolute joy&#8221; she had observed in GC as she interacted with those carers.  She spoke of &#8220;a real eagerness to interact with people with whom she was familiar&#8221;.  When pressed on this diagnosis by Ms Smith on behalf of GC&#8217;s mother, Dr Tostevin agreed that she could not rule out an element of verbal dyspraxia as contributing to her speech and language delay.  Her professional view remained that GC&#8217;s current presentation was the result of early trauma.  This was borne out by an aspect of that presentation.  When her defensive strategies were engaged and she was under stress and distressed, she lost the capacity to vocalise.  This was the way in which she promoted her own survival by shutting down that part of her brain.  These responses had informed her professional view that the removal of the security which GC&#8217;s current placement provided would be likely to result in a significant chance that she would experience difficulties throughout her life in terms of future relationships, her mental health and entire wellbeing. </p>

Such a move would inevitably involve significant trauma for this child.  She would be separated from the very people to whom she would naturally look to cope with the stress which a move to strangers in a completely unknown environment would provoke.  She was concerned that a move at this stage would expose GC to the potential of multiple new carers.  In addition to Mr and Mrs US, she would be living with their daughter and grandson.  Dr Tostevin was concerned that this experience would be likely to remind GC of her early damaging experiences of the compensatory care she received whilst living with her mother in the residential assessment placement during the early weeks of her life. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">In terms of balancing the potential longer term benefits of growing up in an extended family placement, Dr Tostevin saw this particular family placement as presenting a number of risks for GC.  She saw it as a family placement in which the ethos over several years into her adolescence would be high levels of risk and the need to erect firewalls between her home and other members of the extended family.  The perceived risk of exposure to the English maternal family members was sufficiently great that contact would need to be carefully controlled if not severed altogether.  This would bring the potential for confusion on GC&#8217;s part about her identity and her place within that family structure.  She would need to understand a narrative about why she was different and could not have contact with her maternal grandmother and her half-sister in England.  It would be difficult and potentially damaging for her to make sense of the fact that her birth family was not &#8220;safe&#8221;. Giving her an inaccurate narrative about her life story would ultimately prove damaging in itself if that story did not coincide with her experience of family life.  Being told that she could not reveal information to other family members about the life she was living in the home where she was growing up in case of exposing herself to Mr Z and her mother would involve high levels of stress and worry for a child who was already struggling with issues surrounding her own identity. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">She acknowledged that there was always a risk in the future that GC, as she grew older, might resent the loss of an opportunity to grow up within her extended birth family.  However, she told me that she could not support a move to the USs however good their intentions.  Not only would such a move be likely to involve two moves rather than one before she could travel to the United States to make a permanent home in that jurisdiction:  it was Dr Tostevin&#8217;s professional view that GC might not recover from the psychological trauma of those moves.  She explained that, in terms of GC&#8217;s time frame, the window of opportunity was closing for this little girl.  Her opportunity to develop secure attachments was now at the very end of this window if, indeed, it was not already passed.  She had already developed neurological connections with Mr and Mrs S whom she regarded as her psychological carers.  In the event that her situation were to change now and she was placed with people she did not know and who did not know her, there was no guarantee that she would have the ability to make similarly secure connections in the future.  In this event Dr Tostevin thought it much more likely that any new carers, however wellintentioned, were likely to be dealing with a traumatised young child who felt threatened and in danger once again.  Whilst she acknowledged the commitment that Mr and Mrs US were willing to make to GC, she felt that the proposal to take GC to live with them in the United States for ten weeks before formally embarking on the adoption process was, through no fault of their own, an indication of the extent to which they do not fully understand her needs at this time.  Whilst she felt that the risks to GC might be mitigated if any move could be managed without a transitional placement, her primary concern was the extremely fragile nature of the security which GC was beginning to develop in her placement with Mr and Mrs S.  In making it plain that she could not professionally support any move away from her current placement,  Dr Tostevin told me her clear recommendation for the best possible outcome for GC for the remainder of her life was to remain with her current carers.  </p>

The emotional harm involved in a change of carers at this stage in her development was very significant and she might not recover from such a change.   Whilst she would obviously live her life in a home where the court could expect a good level of physical care and comfort, the damage to which Dr Tostevin was pointing was an inability in future to make healthy relationships and express her feelings in a way which did not trigger inbuilt defences learned in the first two years of her life.  She would develop coping strategies but the prospects for emotional health and happiness in the future were likely to be significantly diminished by a change in the arrangements for her care at this juncture. </p>

That, in itself, was likely to make any ongoing relationship more difficult to manage in terms of future risk to GC.  Dr Tostevin had concerns about the extent to which Mr and Mrs US had true insight into GC&#8217;s ongoing needs.  Whilst the Home Study report which had been undertaken in the United States had approved them as carers for a child under three years with minor or correctable developmental delay, Dr Tostevin&#8217;s evidence was that this was not a profile which reflected GC&#8217;s needs which were significantly more complex.  All the evidence points towards the fact that, as she grows older, GC is likely to need considerable support with her education and peer relationships.  What will be required of those caring for her over the next few years is a consistent and insightful investment in supporting GC through these issues which are likely to be challenging in their various manifestations. </p>

The plan remains for GC to remain with Mr and Mrs S who will become her legal parents through the route of adoption.  The view of the local authority that her complex needs are best addressed within their care is said to have been reinforced by the expert evidence from Drs Gough and Tostevin.  The focus of the plan is very much on safety and healing from the childhood trauma she experienced during the first fifteen weeks of her life.  Future therapeutic input through life story work will be informed by contributions from GC&#8217;s biological family including her mother and maternal grandmother.  In terms of the physical risks posed by Mr Z and, through him, Y (should they remain together), the foster carers have been assessed as able to work consistently and co-operatively with both the local authority and the police.  There is ongoing liaison between both agencies and that communication will be vital in future to minimise the risks to which GC is exposed in this context.   </p>

Suffice it to say that the amended care plan sets out in some detail the practical and financial support which will be made available to Mr and Mrs S in terms of any cost involved in relocation, security equipment and intelligence-sharing.  In addition, the local authority intends to instruct a forensic psychologist to provide clinical and forensic guidance to all the agencies who will continue to be involved in the safeguarding process in this jurisdiction.  Dr Gough is already involved in identifying the appropriate expert to undertake this work.  The protection required in future years will involve GC and her extended family throughout her minority.  In terms of contact with her birth family, what is proposed is yearly letterbox contact with her mother which will in all probability include her brother, BC.

There is within the written material before the court a formal written opinion from a British barrister, CG, on the jurisdictional and immigration issues flowing from the permanent placement of GC with Mr and Mrs US in the United States.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">As Ms Danga identified during the course of her oral evidence, the potential for the breakdown of a placement of GC with the USs during this transitional period is a real concern for the local authority.  The alternative care plan dated 10 June 2020 deals with the Hague Convention adoption process in Section 4.  The local authority&#8217;s plan would be to proceed with the adoption process in this jurisdiction rather than in the United States where the potential for delay and uncertainty are so much greater.   Having engaged the Article 15 process, a further delay of some eight weeks is envisaged whilst information is assembled for the Adoption Replacement Report.  If GC is to be removed from the care of Mr and Mrs S, the likelihood is that the child would need to move to a bridging placement which could take a number of weeks depending on the time scales for introducing her to new and different carers.  Introductions would be required in terms of the foster carers at that bridging placement and to the USs with whom GC currently has no established relationship.  Whether or not there is a bridging placement, GC would need to be placed for ten weeks with Mr and Mrs US before formal steps towards an adoption could take place.  The local authority&#8217;s current plan is for that ten week placement to take place in this jurisdiction so as to minimise the distress and anxiety for GC and to enable the local authority to monitor any additional trauma and the USs&#8217; ability to manage this little girl&#8217;s complex needs. </p>

The local police service would need to be engaged in arrangements for GC&#8217;s ongoing security and safety.  At the present time, there is no formal evidence before the court in terms of the likely extent of liaison between the two jurisdictions in relation to the risks posed by Mr Z or the measures which are likely to be available in the US to keep her safe within the home she would be sharing with her new adoptive parents. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In terms of the transition plan which is proposed by Mr and Mrs US, Ms Danga was asked to consider the practical implications for GC.  It appears to be agreed that they would need to travel to this jurisdiction and spend a significant period of time here whilst the various legal steps and processes were implemented.  In terms of quarantining after their arrival and the required period of residence before a formal assessment can be made, it seems that we are looking at a period of about fifteen weeks.  Given GC&#8217;s needs, there would then be a requirement for therapeutic parenting training, the cost of which would be underwritten by the local authority.  A private therapist would be commissioned for these purposes over a six week period.  Thus, the effective transition period for GC before a formal application for adoption could be made would increase to some 21 weeks (or c. 5 months).  It is reasonably clear from the expert evidence on process and procedure that GC must not be placed in the &#8216;legal custody&#8217; of Mr and Mrs US whilst all this is undertaken. </p>

Whilst I can understand from a human perspective why, as a mother, she wished to do everything she could to ensure that her daughter&#8217;s sense of love and security over the years of her childhood was not punctured or diminished in any way through learning that the man she saw as her father and protector was not in fact her biological father, it does raise some issues in relation to what she really understands about a child&#8217;s need to know his or her true identity.  Were GC to make her long-term home with Mr and Mrs US, there would be many awkward questions and issues over the years.  I suspect that each of them would need professional support to help GC through that ongoing process. </p>

She told me that she did not regard the case as finely balanced notwithstanding its complexities.  Whilst she acknowledged that it was through no fault of Mr and Mrs US that they currently had no relationship with GC, the fact remained that it made any consideration of an attempt to place this child with her extended family even more difficult given the extent to which she looked to Mr and Mrs S as her psychological parents.

I have no doubt at all that her maternal grandmother was genuine and sincere in wishing to put herself forward as a long-term carer for her granddaughter.  In a similar way, extended family members living in the United States, including Mr and Mrs US, have made themselves available as potential carers.  For various reasons, it is the USs who are now agreed to be offering GC the only viable alternative to placement with her current foster carers. </p>

The family members recognise the excellent care which Mr and Mrs S have provided for GC throughout the time she has spent in their home.  Through their counsel, Ms Barraclough, Mr and Mrs US have made it plain to the foster carers that, should the court decide that GC should remain in their care at the conclusion of these proceedings, they would regard themselves as &#8220;at their service&#8221; should they ever need anything for GC.  Not only does that elegant gesture reinforce the clear impression I have formed about the fundamental human decency of the USs; it also says much about the care and concern which all involved in this case have for GC and her future. </p>

Mr Z, her putative father, is no longer a part of these proceedings.  Y, her mother, accepts that adoption is the only realistic option for GC: the issue is whether that adoption should be achieved in the context of an extended family placement with Mr and Mrs US or outside the family with Mr and Mrs S.  In the context of a non-family placement, Y does not give her consent and the court will need to dispense with consent if this option is to be pursued. </p>

She has a wide extended family who love her and want the best for her.  For Mr and Mrs US in particular, it is an appreciation of the importance of those family ties which drives and informs their wish to care for GC.  In this context they underscore the importance to GC and her developing sense of identity of growing up with a family which shares biological and kinship ties.  They are prepared to make a very significant personal investment in ensuring, as GC&#8217;s adoptive parents, that she grows up with a clear sense of who she is and where she came from.  With appropriate help and professional guidance, they wish to be able to share with GC a developing narrative about her life story which only they can tell.  Her mother is, and will remain, a member of their family.  They want to be able to talk to GC about her mother and to share with her the family memories and stories which only they can know first-hand.  They want to be able to answer her questions in due course and provide the reassurance which only close family can provide.  They want to be able to tell GC that, despite the sadness they share with her that she could not live with her mother, she was loved so much by so many within her family that the court was able to achieve the next best thing of ensuring she maintained her family and biological ties throughout the years of her childhood, adolescence and beyond.   </p>

That is the current composition of the family who will be sharing a home together in The USA.  In due course, K and her son may move out to a home of their own but, at least for the foreseeable future, they will form part of the home which GC will share with the USs.  I say that this would be a placement within a fractured family unit because it is quite clear that, in order to keep GC safe from physical and psychological danger, Mr and Mrs US will have to sever ties with the English family members.  Everyone is agreed that the invisibility which this child needs in terms of any exposure to Mr Z and, to  lesser extent her mother if she remains in a relationship with him, is such that an ongoing relationship with the English family would be impossible.  Depending on the extent to which Mr and Mrs US&#8217;s older children and their families remain in touch with the extended family in England, there may need to be restrictions on GC&#8217;s contact with, and exposure to, the US family members with whom she does not share a home.  That in itself may create strains within the existing family dynamic.  But, more importantly, it effectively dilutes many of the benefits which would otherwise flow from a placement within the extended family.  Those family connections would be preserved within the nucleus of GC&#8217;s home with Mr and Mrs US but she would have no real exposure to, or connection with, her half-siblings living in England and/or her English grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins.  She may find it confusing in future if the person she will come to regard as her mother has to visit England to see, or care for, her own mother or other family members when she herself is prevented from having any contact with them for reasons of her own personal safety.  However sensitively this message is delivered in the future, it will be a difficult one for GC to absorb and understand. </p>

It may or may not be possible for Mr and Mrs US effectively to monitor GC&#8217;s use of social media as she gets older.  I have every confidence that they would do their best but the consequences of some innocent interaction which exposes GC to the risk of visibility to Mr Z could have potentially serious consequences for her future safety and wellbeing.   </p>

These are all &#8216;unknowns&#8217; which cannot be measured or assessed by the court at this juncture. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">There are also the practical effects of delay which have to be factored into the balance.  On the present state of the evidence, there is no guarantee that GC would be able to make an immediate transition into the care of Mr and Mrs US were she to leave her current placement prior to a move to the United States.  The expert evidence which I have considered above points to a delay of several weeks, if not months, before the court could be sure that the way ahead was clear to a successful adoption process and a final move to the United States which was compliant with that jurisdiction&#8217;s domestic immigration processes.  Throughout that period of delay, I am satisfied that there will be a material and continuing risk that any placement with the USs (or indeed any other transitional carers) might break down.  I have the clear impression that the trial process itself together with the compelling evidence of Drs Gough and Tostevin have given Mr and Mrs US a much more clearly defined window of insight into the difficulties which are likely to present themselves if GC is removed from the security of her present placement.   Were that placement to break down, there is no guarantee that a restoration of the status quo ante (were that possible) would redress the damage done to GC in terms of her psychological and emotional wellbeing.  There is a risk in that event that this child&#8217;s window of opportunity would have closed leaving her in a state of permanent limbo where survival became her default response to whatever future transitions might lie ahead.  Having had the opportunity to assess Mr and Mrs US, I do not believe that they would wish to pursue any course of action if it was causing GC psychological distress and damage.  I believe that they would wish to terminate any placement with them if, after professional support and input, this child became inconsolable as a result of any transition or change in the arrangements for her care.  That decision would not be any reflection of a lack of commitment or dedication to GC.  I am confident, were it to arise, that it would be driven by their wish to bring to an end a situation which was causing her distress and further harm.  Each of Mr and Mrs US appeared to me to understand that this </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">All the evidence points clearly to the fragile recovery which has been, and continues to be, achieved as GC continues to be the beneficiary of the consistent love and care which Mr and Mrs S provide.  Dr Tostevin&#8217;s evidence was clear:  any fracture in the provision of that care could have potentially devastating consequences for this child.  GC&#8217;s removal from her current placement and the only home she has known from the age of three months has the potential to leave her with lifelong consequences in terms of her ability to make and sustain healthy and long-lasting relationships.  The evidence from Dr Tostevin is that those consequences are likely to impact her development throughout her childhood and adolescence.  They will, in all probability, shape her experience of adult life.   With the potential risk of a placement breakdown with the USs before any formal adoption process can be completed, the overall risk to this child is substantial.  I have to balance the scale of that risk against the potentially positive benefits for GC of growing up within a home surrounded by family members with whom she shares a biological connection and, to a lesser extent, a shared history.  As I have said, those benefits are tempered to an extent by what is likely to be the overlying dynamic of the fractured relationships with the wider English family.  That dynamic, if it materialises, will bring for GC additional complications in terms of her sense of self and her identity within that family group. </p>

I recognise and factor into my assessment of the balance of risk the potential exposure of that course to a different psychological risk in terms of her sense of identity and sense of place/belonging.  That is a risk which has to be balanced against the risks and likely consequences of removing her from her current foster carers which Dr Tostevin described on more than one occasion as &#8220;potentially catastrophic&#8221;. </p>

Whilst I acknowledge that Mrs US is prepared to make the very significant sacrifice of giving up her career and severing ties with her close and extended family members in England, I am concerned about the effect upon her or requiring her to take that step.  She acknowledges that she is close to her sister, GC&#8217;s maternal grandmother, and has in the past had to resist the temptation to speak to her sister during the latter stages of this litigation.  It seems to me to be counter-intuitive to require this of her if the purpose of a placement within the biological family is to promote ongoing family ties into the future.  In my judgment it would only promote conflict and confusion for GC to grow up knowing that she had half-siblings and other family members living in England with whom she was allowed no contact.  That in itself could be profoundly damaging.  There is evidence that the USs&#8217; adult children currently living in the United States, one of whom shares the US family home with their grandson, have an ongoing relationship with the English side of the family, including their English grandmother.  Their relationship with those family members is likely to be affected if GC was at the centre of a complicated family dynamic.  In addition, any exchange of information between family members, advertent or inadvertent, only increases the risks of exposure to Mr Z and to Y if she chooses to maintain her relationship with him. </p>

I view these risks as material, substantial and solid.  They are likely to continue for years to come regardless of whether he remains in a relationship with Y.  Whilst I accept that these risks may diminish in time were they to separate permanently, I have to bear in mind that they now have a young son.  Given the history and dynamic of their relationship to date, their role as parents to BC is likely to perpetuate that ongoing connection and Mr Z&#8217;s ability to manipulate the situation.    Whilst I know that Mr and Mrs US are alive to these risks and would do everything possible to protect GC, she remains much more visible to Mr Z in a placement within the extended family.  GC&#8217;s mother is well aware of her aunt and uncle&#8217;s living arrangements in The USA.  The likelihood is that she knows, or is in a position to secure details of, their address.  She is also supporting an adoptive placement in their home.  I do not consider the geographical distance which separates England from The USA to be a sufficient protection when juxtaposed against the relative ease of digital exposure, a risk which is made greater by the skills and technical proficiency which Mr Z has already demonstrated.

There is already a body of evidence and information about Mr Z in this jurisdiction.  Professionals within the criminal and civil justice systems are aware of his history and background albeit that this court does not have the benefit of a recent assessment.  That background has already informed the expert risk assessments which are currently before the court.  The police and other agencies are already on board in this jurisdiction in terms of the expert professional input and support which is reflected in both the current arrangements to keep GC and her carers safe and in the future arrangements which form an integral part of the local authority&#8217;s care plan for the future.  To an extent, these are unknowns in the context of a move to the United States with Mr and Mrs US.  I am conscious that they have put much thought into a parallel plan to keep GC safe were she to move to share a home with them in the United States.

This was something which was acknowledged and addressed by Dr Gough when she gave her oral evidence.  It is the inevitable consequence of Mr Z&#8217;s failure to engage in these proceedings.  Because of that lack of engagement, the court can only proceed on the basis of the best evidence available.  I have summarised that evidence in paragraphs 5 to 9 of this judgment.   Ms Barraclough invites me to scrutinise with care the reality or substance of the risk which Mr Z actually poses to GC since it is relied on by the local authority, in part, as justification for the need to suspend all contact between GC and her birth family save for letterbox contact.  She submits that there is no logical reason why the same safety measures could not be put in place in the United States either in the US&#8217;s current home or in any new home to which they might move in future if the risks of GC&#8217;s visibility were perceived to be too great at an address which is known to members of the maternal family (which, for these purposes, includes Mr Z). </p>

He has past convictions and was the subject of a prison recall which resulted in a reasonably lengthy period of enforced incarceration.   His risk profile is evidence-based and involves harm of a serious nature to both people and animals.   His thought processes and ideation have extended from the maiming of small animals to cannibalism.  He has posted a photograph of his son with an entirely inappropriate caption which demonstrates a complete lack of insight into any reasonable norms of child care.  Shortly before GC&#8217;s birth when there was already concern about whether or not she could be left safely in her mother&#8217;s care, Mr Z made a clear threat that if he could not have the baby, then nobody else would.  The earlier report of a consultant psychologist who assessed Mr Z in May 2017 referred to him being a low risk in terms of physical violence to a child.  That assessment was prepared before he made the threat to which I have referred a few months later in December of the same year. </p>

I cannot eliminate a potential risk of abduction were Mr Z to discover GC&#8217;s whereabouts.  Such an abduction would, of course, be wholly inimical to her welfare both in terms of her physical safety and her psychological attachments.  Mr Z has already established his ability to disappear under the radar with his younger child, BC.  For a significant period of time during these proceedings, international law enforcement agencies were involved in trying to establish the whereabouts of BC and his two parents.  Dr Gough was of the view that the risk of an intervention on the part of Mr Z was likely to remain a serious risk for some time to come were he to discover GC&#8217;s whereabouts.  In my judgment that risk is likely to be heightened in the immediate aftermath of this court&#8217;s decision should GC remain with her current foster carers against her mother&#8217;s wishes.  Ms Barraclough submits that there is less risk of a physical abduction if GC remains within her extended biological family in accordance with the plan supported by her mother.  Whilst there may be some force in that point, it is but one of the factors which has to be weighed in the balance of the decisions which need to be taken in order to keep GC safe. </p>

I accept that he may also attempt to remove GC from that placement by abduction and thus the risk of physical harm to her and the existing members of the S family will remain a live risk in this jurisdiction were she to remain a part of her present foster carers&#8217; family.   </p>

She points to the USs&#8217; training and the proximity of support from family and the military as protective factors in this event.   Whilst I accept that Mr US&#8217;s employers may well be able to provide some additional support in the event of any approach by Mr Z, there is no clarity of what form that support might take.  Further, whilst they have children living in the United States (one of whom is part of their current household), it is difficult to see what additional protection they can offer over and above emotional and moral support. </p>

The measures put in place pursuant to the individual care plans will obviously be an important factor.   Those arrangements will need to be flexible and will no doubt develop as future risk assessments are undertaken as GC&#8217;s experience of family life changes over the years to come.  Mr Z&#8217;s ongoing connection with the family through GC&#8217;s mother and their son, BC, is another factor which will need to be taken into account.  If they remain in a relationship, Y&#8217;s reaction to a placement of GC outside the extended family may well impact on Mr Z&#8217;s response to the conclusion of these proceedings.  The crucial point is that whether the risk of further intervention in GC&#8217;s life by Mr Z is assessed to be high, low or somewhere in between on the spectrum, the foreseeable consequences of such intervention are potentially catastrophic for this child.  As such, and in my judgment, they need to be taken very seriously.  </p>

I am persuaded by all the evidence I have heard that the overriding need to maintain the momentum of the fragile recovery she has been making over the last few months outweighs the potential benefits of a family placement.  This is a child who has already developed a psychological bond with these carers.  Whilst I do not propose to rehearse the detail of the evidence I heard from Mrs S, I am satisfied that GC&#8217;s current foster carers are highly attuned to her needs and the signals she sends them about her needs.  They are already communicating effectively with GC and have significant insight into how to meet the very complex needs she has as a result of the damage she sustained in the early weeks of her life and probably before her birth.  As the expert evidence in this case demonstrates, Mr and Mrs S have experienced at first hand the manner in which GC reacts to threats and perceived danger from adults she does not know or with whom she has no bond.  They know how to reassure her and provide the sustained care and comfort she needs.  They have cared for this child since she was three months old and GC herself has known no other home or care system for the past two and a half years.  That is effectively the entirety of her young life to date. </p>

It is in line with the specific recommendations which were made by Dr Tostevin.  In addition, there is provision for ongoing co-ordinated support from the Police and Children Services designed to ensure the family&#8217;s and GC&#8217;s safety.  That support and its reach across other agencies will need to evolve and develop over time as their needs change and this must be kept under review at appropriate intervals.  For reasons which will be apparent, I do not propose to set out in this judgment the detail of those arrangements which includes an element of contingency planning. </p>

I have set these out in full in paragraph 35 of my judgment and do not repeat them here.  Standing back and surveying all the evidence which is before the court and the conclusions I have reached in relation to GC&#8217;s ongoing needs both now and for the rest of her life, I am satisfied that an adoption order in favour of Mr and Mrs S is the only option which will meet those welfare needs.  This will be achieved by making full care and placement orders which will enable that adoption to proceed once the matching process has been completed.  I have reached this clear conclusion despite the opposition of GC&#8217;s mother who does not consent to this course.  Whilst her views are important, I propose nevertheless to dispense with her consent to the course I propose to take.  I do so because I do not consider that she has the necessary insight into GC&#8217;s ongoing needs and/or the nature and extent of the risk which Mr Z poses to A were he in a position to identify her whereabouts.  I do not accept that a placement within the extended family which is in accordance with the wishes of GC&#8217;s mother is a sufficiently protective factor to keep her safe and/or to outweigh the significant contraindicators of a removal from her current placement at this stage of her development.

Unlike the position in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C</span>, this is not a case where such a change is being contemplated because the name which has been given to GC by her mother is in itself a name which is likely to cause her emotional harm and/or expose her to a risk of serious bullying in the future.

GC will in due course need to know why it was not possible for her to live with her mother or members of her mother&#8217;s family.  Those reasons have nothing to do with an absence of love or commitment as far as Mr and Mrs US are concerned and GC will need to know that in clear terms.  Having listened carefully to Mrs S as she gave evidence on behalf of herself and her husband, I am entirely satisfied that they recognise the importance of this life story work in the context of GC&#8217;s psychological wellbeing and her emerging sense of identity from within the security of her placement with the S family. </p>

One of those individuals was Ms Danga.  At the same time, I made an injunction prohibiting Y from publishing on any form of social media any material which might identify the child as being the subject of these proceedings or which might lead to her whereabouts being identified.  I directed that she must remove a series of Facebook posts which she had made concerning GC and these proceedings.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The local authority has already met the costs of Dr Gough&#8217;s initial risk assessment completed in September 2019.  When Mr and Mrs US became parties to these proceedings in March this year, they sought the court&#8217;s permission for a further report from Dr Gough in relation to their own application to care for GC in the United States.  It was agreed at the time that the costs of this exercise would be shared.  Through Ms Barraclough, they now seek to be relieved of any financial contribution to the costs of that second report, the report prepared by Dr Tostevin and the attendance of both experts at court.  The local authority objects to any reapportionment of those costs and points out that the only challenge to the evidence of Dr Gough came from Mr and Mrs US and GC&#8217;s mother.  Whilst she has the benefit of a public funding certificate, the USs have been funding this litigation privately.  They accept that they are financially stable and raised no objections before closing written submissions to bearing a fair proportion of these expert costs.  On behalf of her clients, Ms Barraclough submits that liability for Dr Tostevin&#8217;s costs was specifically reserved.  Further, she says that these assessments should properly be considered to be the evidential foundation for the local authority&#8217;s holistic overview of the realistic options it was placing before the court before filing its final evidence.  She maintains that her clients had to seek party status to challenge local authority failings and to avoid further delay for GC.  In these circumstances, she submits that the local authority should absorb their share of these costs. </p>

They sought party status in these proceedings not simply because they wished to challenge what they perceived to be local authority failings.  They had a separate case to advance which was in direct contradistinction to the final care plan relied on by the local authority.  In support of that challenge, they secured the court&#8217;s permission for an extension to the expert evidence which was then available.  In my judgment the costs of this second report from Dr Gough should be shared equally between the local authority, Mr and Mrs US and the public funding certificates held by GC and Y. </p>

For these purposes she did not carry out a specific assessment of Mr and Mrs US.  There was no need for that exercise because her task was different from that undertaken by Dr Gough whose focus was on the physical security of GC&#8217;s future placement.  Dr Tostevin&#8217;s evidence, which I have found, ultimately, to be a determinative factor in maintaining the placement with Mr and Mrs S, was directed towards the psychological risks to GC of fracturing those ties.  That evidence was plainly an important part of the whole picture but it would have been required to support the local authority&#8217;s final care plan whether the alternative option for the court was a placement with Mr and Mrs US or another member, or members, of the extended family. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I am well aware that the local authority has underwritten a very significant bill of costs in this litigation.  To the extent that these costs have increased as a result of both delay and the need to collate further evidence as the evolving care plan for GC has changed, the authority is, to an extent, the author of its own misfortune as a result of the failings I have identified in this judgment.  I would regard it as impermissible for the court to impose a further financial penalty on the local authority simply as the cost of those failings.  Any costs order must be both principled and fair.  That said, I do not regard it as either appropriate or fair to require Mr and Mrs US to contribute towards the costs of Dr Tostevin&#8217;s two reports or her attendance at court for the purposes of speaking to those reports.   Dr Tostevin&#8217;s evidence was an integral component of the local authority&#8217;s case.  It was required for the essential purpose of providing the court with an evidence-based evaluation of its final analysis in terms of a care plan for GC.  As has been made clear in both <span style="font-style:italic">Re B-S (Children) </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (A Child)</span>, both cited above, a local authority pursuing care and placement orders is under an obligation to ensure that sufficient evidence is made available to the court to enable it to carry out a proportionate evaluation and balancing exercise. </p>

Those criticisms emanate both from the extended family and from the Guardian.  The local authority accepts that there were a number of failings prior to the current lead social worker taking over conduct of the case in April 2019.  Much of Ms Danga&#8217;s evidence was absorbed with meeting those criticisms.  The first point which needs to be made is that, whatever those shortcomings may have been in the past, this local authority has now made a clear commitment to fund its current amended care plan so as to put in place what is likely to be needed to keep GC and the S family safe and to ensure she has the benefit of expert therapeutic advice and support. </p>

On behalf of her employer, she accepted that the case has not been managed as it should have been.  She acknowledged that there had been clear errors on the part of the local authority.  Those errors flowed in the main from decisions made by a previous social worker and as a result of a failure properly to communicate with the family members who were putting themselves forward as alternative carers for GC.  Ms Danga told me that the local authority has already instigated an internal review in relation to what has happened in this case with the objective of learning from those mistakes. </p>

I acknowledge and accept that designated leadership roles within the local authority&#8217;s legal and social work departments changed during 2019.  As a result of those changes and the escalation of these proceedings from circuit judge to High Court judge tier for the purposes of all case management hearings and final disposal, I was able to ensure that a greater discipline has been brought to bear on the timetable.  I am satisfied that communication has improved and there has been a much more proactive approach within the authority&#8217;s legal department.  It is only right that I express my thanks to Ms Danga and to Ms Pouya, the lawyer who has been dealing with the case since January 2020.  In recognising the former shortcomings, each has been of considerable assistance to the court in terms of achieving a final hearing in the midst of the global pandemic we have experienced.  In this context, I wish to acknowledge the invaluable assistance I have had from all counsel appearing in the case.  The work and measured judgment which each has applied to the professional task in hand has been exceptional.  The case has presented different challenges for each of the six barristers involved in the case.  They have met those challenges on behalf of their respective clients whilst at the same time ensuring that I had an immaculate set of written submissions and other material to assist me in the preparation of my judgment. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">That said, it is equally important to note that the failings of the local authority have had real and significant consequences for GC, the members of her extended birth family and Mr and Mrs S, her foster carers.   The changes in direction in terms of planning for GC&#8217;s future have resulted in delays and confusion.  The decision to place GC with Mr and Mrs S in anticipation of an adoptive placement outside the family when consideration to an intra-family placement had not been ruled out and at a time when viability assessments were ongoing is difficult to justify.  It was certainly in breach of the existing guidance in force at the time of placement<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="5">
		<p class="footnotedescription" style="margin-left:0.51in"> Whilst I accept that the placement with Mr and Mrs S was sanctioned as a holding position by the judge, he did so on the basis that the original social worker&#8217;s viability assessment of GC&#8217;s grandmother and her partner could not be regarded as &#8220;the final word [on their] abilities&#8221;.  Instead he ordered the preparation of a further report by an independent social worker.  In the circumstances, it is difficult to see what other option was open to him at that time.    </p>
	      </authorialNote>.  Thus, whilst I accept that the placement with Mr and Mrs S carried the imprimatur of the court in terms of its approval of that interim care plan, it has had the consequence of creating the impression of a status quo which will have left Mr and Mrs US feeling that they have not been litigating on a level playing field.  Whilst I am confident that the final hearing itself was entirely compliant with their Art 6 rights to a fair hearing, as counsel have confirmed, they must have asked themselves what the outcome might have been had GC been entrusted to their care following the hearing in November 2018.  In this context, I understand that they feel keenly that it is not they who have lost an opportunity as a result of the local authority&#8217;s failures but GC herself. </p>

The original social worker who recommended the placement of GC with foster to adopt carers has been referred by the local authority to the Health and Care Professions Council.  I am told that the task of the new team in establishing what has gone wrong in its legal department has been hampered by the failure of Ms Pouya&#8217;s predecessor to keep full and complete records in relation to his conduct of this litigation.  This appears to be evidence of lax practice at best if not blatant inefficiency.    In their written concluding submissions, Ms Campbell QC and Ms Isaacs have set out the relevant steps in the litigation chronology which they contend provides some mitigation for the actions taken by the local authority.

That was then followed by the need to take specialist legal advice in the United States in relation to the home study process.

It is the right outcome for GC and I am as sure as I can be, knowing what I know of the USs, that they understand it is the right result given the body of evidence presented to the court.  They have not lost their fight for GC; they stayed the course to the bitter end and left an indelible impression on the minds of all those who heard the evidence they gave.  Their willingness to offer GC a permanent home gave this court its best opportunity to weigh up the competing options from the foot of positions which were motivated and informed in each case by a perception of this child&#8217;s best long term interests. </p>
