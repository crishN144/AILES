	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in;margin-right:0.04in">MR JUSTICE WILLIAMS:  I am dealing with an application made by the father under the 1980 Hague Child Abduction Convention for the return of his daughter, A, who was born on 27 December 2014, so who is now therefore 4 years and 2 months of age.  The father is represented by solicitors and counsel.  He has the benefit of non-means, non-merits legal aid in accordance with the obligations we have undertaken in relation to the 1980 Hague Convention.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in;margin-right:0.04in">The application is for the summary return of A to Latvia.  The mother, the father and A are all of Latvian origin and the application arises out of the fact that A was brought to the United Kingdom in the summer/early autumn of 2018 without the agreement of the father.  The mother has been living here ever since with her mother.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in;margin-right:0.04in">A was habitually resident in Latvia prior to the summer of 2018, and because, according to the documentation from the Latvian Ministry of Justice, parental responsibility for A was shared between the mother and father, the removal of A from Latvia by her mother was wrongful within the meaning of the 1980 Hague Convention as being in breach of the father's rights of custody.  And because A was habitually resident in Latvia immediately prior to her removal, that means the provisions of the 1980 Hague Convention are engaged. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in;margin-right:0.04in">The obligation on this court pursuant to Article 12 of the 1980 Hague Convention is to order the return of A forthwith to Latvia, unless the mother establishes that an exception applies.  In this case, the mother has put before the court evidence which raises a potential defence under Article 13(b) of the Convention. </p>

Proceedings first came before this court on 26 November when Newton J made an order which provided for the tipstaff to locate A's whereabouts and listed a hearing on 14 December. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in;margin-right:0.04in">On 14 December, Cohen J made an order.  On that occasion, the father was represented by Mr Turnell, who appears again today, and the mother appeared in person.  On that occasion, the mother accepted that she had removed A from the jurisdiction of Latvia without the father's consent, but I think it was indicated on that day that not only did she oppose the application, but she alleged she had been subjected to domestic abuse in Latvia.  She was provided with some information about possible lawyers who might help her but, given that she is here alone today, that obviously did not lead anywhere.  The order also urged the parties to use the Reunite mediation scheme.  I have not heard anything further about what happened in that regard, but given we are here today, that also made no progress. </p>

Somewhat unusually, he provided that the father might attend today's hearing via video-link.  Mr Turnell explained that the court was unclear on 14 December of precisely the nature of the mother's defence, so provision was made for the father to be available to give evidence if I decided that was necessary at the final hearing.  The final hearing was listed by Cohen J to take place on 14 February with a time estimate of one day. </p>

I have seen her statement written in English and exhibiting certain I think texts or Instagram or other exchanges with the father.  The general nature of the account in that statement is an account of domestic abuse amounting to or including physical violence, threats and controlling behaviour.   </p>

As an aside, that refers to her as a hardworking, trustworthy and reliable employee.   </p>

I have also been provided by the mother with some documents which show that A has been registered with a doctor, and there are a series of photographs of the child I am concerned with, A, who looks like a very engaging and smiley child and who is most unfortunate to be at the centre of an argument between her parents. </p>

In general terms, he denies the allegations of domestic abuse and he has offered a series of protective measures which he says could be put in place and which would ensure that A was protected from any risk of harm were she and her mother to return to Latvia.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.42in;margin-right:0.11in;text-indent:0in">Mr Turnell on the father's behalf filed a position statement setting out the father's stall.  That asserted that the mother's allegations did not in any event meet the Article 13(b) threshold. This was primarily on the basis that the mother had not intended to flee Latvia by reason of the alleged domestic violence &#8211; Mr Turnell relying on the closing words of the mothers statement  saying &#8216;I want to stay in with my child in the UK [sic] because my family resides here. Also, it is very important to note that I think my child would be much better off living, growing up and studying in this country&#8217;. More significantly, perhaps, it was submitted that even if the allegations did meet this threshold, the protective measures which the father proposed would reduce any risk of harm to A to such an extent that the court could not possibly say that there would be a grave risk of harm to A if she were to return to Latvia. </p>

As is usually the case in relation to such undertakings, he makes that promise without accepting that he has ever behaved that way in the past.   </p>

He has clarified that he will pay the rent on that property so the mother and A will have a secure home available to them until such time as the Latvian court is able to consider the situation with both the mother and father present in court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in;margin-right:0.04in">The mother's general position today is that she confirms she has been subjected to domestic abuse and some of the additional documentation she has put from family corroborates her evidence.  Much of the evidence she has put in suggests that she and A are settled and making a life in England.  She says the father has made promises to her in the past.  I think she said she had listened to his promises for six years but she says he has not kept his promises, so she clearly does not believe that any promise he gives to this court will be stuck to if she returns to Latvia.  So in legal terms, I suppose she would say that these protective measures the father offers would not be adequate to secure her protection in Latvia. </p>

By my decision, I am not deciding whether A should live in England or in Latvia; I am not deciding whether A should live with her mother or her father.  That is the job of the Latvian courts who retain jurisdiction over A by operation of Article 10 of the Council Regulation 2201/2003 (BIIA).  What I am called upon to decide is an application under the Child Abduction Convention as supplemented by Article 11 of BIIA, so Articles 13 and 12 of the Hague Convention are engaged.   </p>

The burden lies on the person opposing return; it is for them to produce evidence to substantiate one of the exceptions.  The standard of proof is the ordinary balance of probabilities, but in evaluating the evidence the court has to be mindful of the limits on its ability to assess evidence within a summary hearing of this sort.  The courts usually will not hear oral evidence from the parties, and usually documentary material before the court will be fairly limited.   </p>

It is not enough just for the risk to be real, it must have reached such a level of seriousness that it can be characterised as grave.  The word "grave" characterises the risk, not the harm, but there is a link between the two.  The words "physical or psychological harm" are not qualified, but they do gain colour from the alternative "or otherwise placed in an intolerable situation".  Intolerable is a strong word, but when applied to a child must mean a situation which this particular child in these particular circumstances should not be expected to tolerate. </p>

The situation which the child will face on return may depend on the protective measures which can be put in place to ensure that the child will not be placed in an intolerable situation or grave risk of harm when she gets home.  Where the risk is serious enough, the court will be concerned not only with the child's immediate future because the need for protection may persist. </p>

The Practice Guide makes clear that this is intended to address the situation where authorities have made or are prepared to make such arrangements.  The Court of Appeal has recently confirmed that protective measures include all steps that can be taken, including housing, financial support, as well as more traditional measures such as non-molestation injunctions (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re C</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2018/2834" uk:canonical="[2018] EWCA Civ 2834" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] EWCA Civ 2834</ref>). </p>

European Regulation 606/2013 on the Mutual Recognition of Protection Measures in Civil Matters sets up a mechanism allowing for direct recognition of protection orders issued as a civil law measure between member states, thus a civil law protection order such as a non-molestation order or undertaking issued in one member state, can be invoked directly in another member state without the need for a declaration of enforceability but simply by producing a copy of the protection measure, an Article 5 certificate and where necessary a transliteration or translation.  </p>

Our domestic law provides this court can accept an undertaking where the court has the power to make a non-molestation order.

The mother's statement contains an account of various forms of abuse which she alleges the father perpetrated on her.  She describes being forced into a cold shower, she describes shouting, abuse, spitting, twisting of her arm, pushing, choking, all clearly forms of physical abuse.  She alleges that he threatened to kill her family, that he threatened to take her daughter away, and that he would commit suicide and harm himself, all of which clearly would fall into the category of emotional abuse, at least. </p>

She refers in particular to one incident where in 2017 she says he hit her head with a door and as a result of which she received four stitches to her head.  I have seen a photograph of her thereafter and I have also seen a medical report which confirms that she presented herself to hospital and a wound was stitched.  The medical report although does say that it happened accidentally and does not refer to it as being deliberate.  The mother says that during this incident, A was present.   </p>

Although she concludes her statement by saying, "I want to stay with my child in the UK because my family resides here, also it is very important to note that, I think my child would be much better off living and growing up and studying in this country", she does not specifically say there that she fears returning to Latvia.  But I think it is implicit in the whole of her statement that she says she is scared of returning to Latvia, and she has confirmed that in court today.   </p>

So I approach her case on the basis that she not only is fearful of returning to Latvia, but that also she considers for other social and economic reasons that life would be better here for her than in Latvia.  It seems fairly clear that she has family in this country, I think her mother and possibly her sister, who are part of her support network here. </p>

He denies behaving aggressively, he denies assaulting her in almost any form, save that he admits on one occasion he did put her in the shower.  He says this was because she had become aggressive and he did it in order to calm her down.  He denies other forms of abuse, whether threats to commit suicide, following her, or surreptitiously recording sexual activity.  He accepts there was an incident when the mother suffered a cut to her forehead when he says he pushed open a door and she was behind it and it caught her on the head. </p>

There seems to be a considerable difference in their perception of how long they lived together for, and indeed even where, because the father says that for a period of time before A's birth, they lived in England.  None of those disputes are ones which I can resolve.  All of those events which are narrated by the mother and by the father took place in Latvia.  There may be one or two events which took place in England or otherwise, but it is plainly the Latvian courts which would be better placed to resolve the question of whether the mother has been subjected to the sort of abuse described or not. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in;margin-right:0.04in">The limited window into the possible truth or otherwise of the allegations which I have been provided with is the social media exchanges between the parties, and perhaps the medical report which I previously referred to.  The social media exchanges are, I suspect, only a very limited selection of probably a far greater range of exchanges between the parties.  They made for unpleasant reading.  The father at times expresses himself in abusive language, the mother might respond in colourful language at times.  But I cannot say from looking at them that there is clear evidence which points to the truth or otherwise of the mother's allegations.  Both the mother and the father might like to remind themselves that they have what appears to be a beautiful little girl, and the idea that at some point in the future she might read what her father said to her mother and what her mother said to her father should embarrass them.  They owe it to their daughter to behave better.  But I cannot say from what I have read that the exchanges go beyond commonly encountered acrimonious, ill-tempered recriminatory language between two parents who are dealing with the fallout of a separation.  </p>

That says -- it must have come from the mother -- that the cut to her head was caused accidentally by a door.  That sort of explanation might be given when somebody hit their head accidentally on a door; experience also tells us that sometimes victims of abuse give false accounts of how they suffered injuries.  But insofar as the objective evidence sheds any light on the allegations of abuse, it happens to fit more easily with the father's explanation than the mother's.  So ultimately, I am not in a position to say whether the mother's allegations are true or not.  That may be something a Latvian court may have to determine. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in;margin-right:0.04in">What I can say though is that if those allegations are true, they would amount to domestic abuse at a relatively high level.  These courts have long accepted that domestic abuse perpetrated by one parent on the other can have a profound and harmful impact on a child, either through the child directly witnessing the abuse or because of the impact that the abuse has on the parent. </p>

Clearly the majority of the allegations of abuse take place within the context of an ongoing relationship and the parties sharing a property together.  Thus, if they are living separately and are longer in a relationship, the opportunity for incidents will be reduced.  In terms of other forms of abuse, whether it is attempting to snatch A from the mother on the street or sending abusive messages or making threats, they would all be addressed by measures which would prevent the father from communicating with the mother, or measures which would prevent him from removing A from her care without an order of the Latvian courts. </p>

The intention of the European instruments is to create a situation where a protective measure made by this court will be as effective in Latvia as it is here.  The same is true of the 1996 Hague Convention; an application made to the Latvian court to register protective measures made by this court should have the effect of making them bite in Latvia. </p>

That means that the risk which arises, taking the allegations at their highest<span style="font-weight:bold"/> is ameliorated to a very significant degree sufficient to reduce it below the Article 13(b) threshold.  In practice, that means the mother cannot establish the defence under Article 13(b).  That means that I am obliged by Article 12 of the Convention to order the return of A to Latvia. </p>

I will order that return on the basis that the undertakings offered by the father are put in writing, that they will become part of the order I am making, and that they will be the subject of an application to the Latvian court to register them so they become enforceable there.  So if anything were to happen in Latvia, the mother would have the protection of the courts there in the same way she would have the protection of the courts here.  So subject to those all being committed to writing in the form I have identified, I will order the return of A to Latvia. </p>

If she does, it will be available for her exclusive occupation with A until such time as the Latvian courts hold an on-notice hearing.  If she prefers to stay with family or friends, that is a matter for her.  I note that the tenancy she has in England is due to expire on 28 March.  Three weeks from today takes us to something like 7 March, so it will be slightly before her tenancy expires.  Arrangements will have to be made to purchase tickets for the mother and A, and arrangements will need to be made very rapidly by the father to seise the Latvian court both of an application in relation to A but also, more importantly, in so far as is necessary, to register the undertakings with that court to give them teeth in Latvia. </p>
