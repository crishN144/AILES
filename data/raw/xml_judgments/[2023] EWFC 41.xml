	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The court is concerned with an application for a parental order in relation to B, now age 19 months. The applicants, X and Y, seek this order to secure their legal parental relationship with B. The respondent to the application is Z, who was the gestational surrogate, and B, through her Children&#8217;s Guardian, Ms Biggs. Z carried B as a result of a surrogacy arrangement entered into between the parties in this jurisdiction on 6 November 2020. Z has been given notice of this hearing, has engaged in email exchanges with Mr Niven-Philips, the child&#8217;s solicitor, and has been spoken to by Ms Biggs. Z did not attend this hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before turning to consider the background and evidence, this case is another timely reminder of the need for parties to surrogacy arrangements to understand the legal consequences and implications of the agreement they are entering into. As has been made clear by this court on many occasions before, a parental order is a transformative order; it changes in a lifelong way the legal status the child has with the parties to the proceedings. If a parental order cannot be made for any reason, the legal parental relationship will remain with the birth mother, with all the lifelong consequences that flow from that, even though everyone may agree the child will remain living with, and be brought up by the commissioning parents.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The applicants have been critical of the delays that have taken place in dealing with this application. They are right that there were initial delays. The application was issued in November 2021. It was listed for a final hearing before the magistrates in August 2022 when the issue of the difficulties with the evidence to establish domicile was raised, and the application was re-allocated to High Court Judge level. Further evidence was directed to be filed by the applicants, with encouragement for them to seek legal advice. Having considered the applicants further evidence I made directions on the papers on 31 October 2022 and listed the matter for hearing on 6 December 2022. After hearing submissions at the hearing on 6 December 2022 I joined the child as a party and listed the matter for this hearing. On the three occasions when directions for further evidence have been made in August, October and December 2022, the focus has been on the applicants providing further evidence about domicile, and demonstrating the evidential basis upon which they say their domicile of choice is in this jurisdiction. If that evidence had been provided earlier by the applicants, the delays would have been much reduced.</p>

He recognised that at some point it does need to change, but intends to delay that for as long as possible. He agreed the tax authorities in the US still considered him to be resident there and he had a mailing address, using a registered agent based in the US for that purpose. He confirmed he had no income in this jurisdiction and no assets in the US. When asked about the recent discussion with Ms Biggs in February 2023, he said the intention of them both is to return to the UK in July.

In that conversation, according to Ms Biggs, the applicants did not give any fixed date when they planned to return to this jurisdiction and implied that, due to his frustration about how long these proceedings had  taken, they had no intention of returning to this country. In her oral evidence Y felt this was said out of frustration and anger. They indicated they had hoped to ask Z to have another child for them but felt what was happening with this application was affecting that process.</p>

It is counter intuitive to do anything other than try and seek that outcome. However, the court has to be careful not to find that the domicile requirement is met unless there is the evidence to support it, however powerful the welfare considerations maybe. The court&#8217;s task has been hampered by the applicant&#8217;s approach to this application and their failure to provide documentary evidence to support their written statements.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue of whether domicile has changed is a question of fact. The court must look at the wide evidential canvas, in the context that it is considering whether the applicants have discharged the evidential burden on them. In looking at intention the focus is on an intention to reside permanently, or for an unlimited time. The court needs to consider with caution a self-proclaimed declaration to live here, unless it is corroborated by actions that are consistent with it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I agree with Mr Niven-Philips, this case is very finely balanced but having considered all the evidence I have reached the conclusion that domicile of choice has been established at the relevant times. That conclusion has not been reached without considerable hesitation and I recognise is largely based on the court accepting the account given by the applicants being credible and truthful. Whilst it only needs to be established by one of the applicants the reality in this case is the evidence they rely upon is interdependent and they have both discharged the burden. I have reached that conclusion for the following reasons:</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.12in">There is a consistency in the written and oral account given by each of the applicants, which supports the credibility of what they say. X&#8217;s account of a growing realisation of his wish to live here permanently is supported by the increasing amounts of time he said he spent here from 1999, his experience of being based here for his Masters in 2011 &#8211; 2012, the fact that he raised this early on in his relationship with Y and the time they spent here prior to 2020.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.12in">That expressed intention is supported by a number of actions that, when taken together, provide some corroboration for that declaration of intent, although there is a paucity of documentary evidence. Those actions include: (i) Wanting to undertake a surrogacy arrangement in this jurisdiction, undertaking the necessary procedures at LWC for the embryos to be created, the embryo transfer taking place here and B&#8217;s birth here. B has a British passport and they have not applied for a US passport even though she is entitled to one, albeit they did consider it at one stage. (ii) They did not take any steps to establish B&#8217;s legal parentage in the US. (iii) X has established two companies here, and, whilst they are not currently generating any income currently, his stated intention is to operate his business through them. (iii) Both applicants are registered with the NHS here, and remain registered with a GP here. (iv) Giving up their rented accommodation in the US in 2020, and not retaining any accommodation there  together with Y&#8217;s evidence that they moved all their belongings here. (v) I accept their evidence that they have maintained their contacts here within the community and with friends, and they have actively continued to look for properties here. When Y finishes her fieldwork in July 2023, they will return to this jurisdiction.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.12in">I have carefully weighed in the balance the factors that point away from establishing the required intention, including: (i) The lack of settled immigration status, although they are permitted to remain here on time limited visas and intend to apply for more settled status when they can. (ii) The lack of settled accommodation here, although I accept their evidence that their reason for going to the US in November 2022 was for Y to complete her Harvard course, and it was uncertain then as to how long that would take. They have continued to look at the options for purchasing a property in this jurisdiction and maintained their contacts and connections here. (iii) The decision to continue to pay tax in the US, although I accept they have taken advice as to when that change should be made. It remains their intention for that change to take place at some point. (iv) The discrepancy between what the applicants have said about moving here in early 2020 and what Ms Biggs concluded in her first report that they relocated here permanently in the summer of 2021. That is likely to have been caused by a combination of the Covid travel restrictions at the time and the applicant&#8217;s evidence that they had a series of short term lets here until December 2021. </p>

In doing so I make it clear that in the event of the applicants having another child through a surrogacy arrangement in the UK and a parental order application is made, the court will need to evaluate the question of domicile then, in the light of the evidence at that time.</p>
