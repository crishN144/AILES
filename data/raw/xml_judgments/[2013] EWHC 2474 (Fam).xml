I do not, in the light of the availability of those documents, repeat the history in detail.  In short form, both parents took Elsa in December 2011 for a holiday to Egypt, the land of the father's birth, so that Elsa could enjoy some time by the sea with some of her paternal relatives.  Whilst there, it would appear the parents had a serious disagreement.  It is the mother's case that the father removed Elsa from her care in the last days of December 2011.  Elsa was placed by the father with his own family and, in particular, his mother.  Perforce, she says, that this mother had to return to England alone.  She has not seen nor been allowed to speak to Elsa since that time.  It is the father's case that the mother in fact at one point consented to Elsa remaining in Egypt.  I am not, I remind myself, trying a child abduction case.  </span></p>

Also he says he is currently not considered by them to have a voice in the affairs of Elsa because he is a serving prisoner.  I shall not report the nature of his allegations against the mother here.  They go, if anything, to welfare considerations irrelevant to this committal application.  He says the family have decided that their view of the welfare of Elsa requires her to be kept in Egypt away from the mother and if that is part of the price of her safety, kept away from her father too.  I emphasise I make no findings at all in respect of these matters, setting them out in summary simply to illustrate his defence.</span></p>

He was, in my judgment, and I am sorry to have to record it, shifty, evasive and plainly dishonest.  He was asked, for example, if he would sign an authorisation to his family to provide the information required of him by paragraphs 3 and 5 of the order of Cobb J.  He seemed to regard the request as potentially fraught with danger for Elsa if the information disclosed fell into the hands of the mother and her legal team of which he has a low opinion or, indeed, Tipstaff and this court.  It was quite clear to me that although his hesitations and body language would not by definition appear on the transcript, that he was weighing up the pros and cons of giving such information all of which he has, I find it, within his power to divulge.  At times I thought that he was almost trying to negotiate with this court as to the terms on which he would divulge that information.  Whilst he ultimately gave a guarded view that he might be able to do so he has not provided any authorisation yet, and has thus been, and continues to be, in breach of those parts of the order of 15</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> January. </span></p>

I wholly disbelieved his account when he asserted that compliance was beyond its control.  As to the provisions of his passports, his account was that they, that is both his United Kingdom and Egyptian passports had been posted to his brother Umma in late December 2011 or early January 2012 to help in the registration of Elsa at a school in Cairo, but then held by Umma to his order.  He, so he said, required Umma to send those passports to his friend in England to hold them to his order.  He did not trust the mother's legal team nor, frankly, Tipstaff and the court to hold them, and was, as I understood it, though he was short on the mechanism for this, only prepared to surrender them to the court through his own legal team which, unhappily, he has not had prior to this hearing, although he is now, if I may respectfully say so, ably represented by Miss Allwood of counsel.  What he did not know prior to this hearing was that the passports had been retrieved from his friend, Mr. SM, as I shall refer to him, and taken into the possession of Tipstaff by court order.  I wholly disbelieve the father's account of the history of these documents.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">In coming to my conclusions on this subject I took account of his friend, Mr. SM's evidence.  That witness has provided a statement to the court and attended and gave evidence contradictory to that of the father, particularly but not exclusively as to the period in which he had held those passports to the father's orders.  Mr. SM told me, and I accept, that he had been asked by the father to take custody of some of his records and possessions and that when the father's friend with whom he had previously shared a house in Southampton delivered the bags to Mr. SM containing documents in about March 2012 Mr. SM found a folder within the contents, amongst other things, containing the father's two passports and bank cards etc.  Mr. SM also told me that he had a telephone conversation with the father, and the father sought his help in enquiring of the Egyptian embassy if the father could renew his now expired Egyptian passport.  There were other conversations he told me about when, because the father knew that telephone calls from prison were recorded, they spoke in code about the father's passports and bank cards, referring to them by colour and in the case of the passports, the Egyptian one being green and in the case of the United Kingdom one red.  They also referred to bank cards with separate banks which were also in colours of red and green, but that when the father was discussing passport issues it was very clear to Mr. SM that he was so doing and that he, Mr. SM, was not confused about this issue.  I accept that evidence as truthful, as mostly did the father.  However, the father baulked with the idea that they discussed passports in code, and asserted that they only ever spoke of his bank cards by colour and that Mr. SM must be innocently mistaken in holding the views he appears to have.  I repeat, I accept Mr. SM's evidence on this subject, especially that concerning the passports and when they came into his possession, namely in March last year.  That being established, how it did he account for a passage in a letter the father wrote to his mother and brother, Umma, dated 17</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> December 2012 exhibited to the statement he made in January this year in which he asked them to send his passports back to England.  He also told me that he had asked his brother again this year to send the passports back, but that it was only last night over the adjournment when he had telephoned his brother in Egypt to ask why that brother had not informed him in March 2012, or subsequently, that he had sent the passports back already that his brother, Ari, said that he had not mentioned so doing because it would make no difference.  I disbelieved that account of the father.  The clear inference is that the father was not going to hand over his passports voluntarily and was doing all he could to secrete them from the court for future use.  I add that knowing that he had legal representation yesterday and today, if he was correct in asserting that he was simply waiting for the appropriate opportunity to hand them into the court, it is puzzling that he did not invite Mr. SM to attend court bearing them on the first day of the hearing.  Even on his own account he would not have handed them to the court save through a legal team.  I find this to be a deliberate breach of the relevant paragraph of Cobb J.'s order.  I have also considered as part of my evaluation of the evidence a statement produced by the father yesterday morning just a few days late after the obligation to file such a document imposed by the order of Cobb J.  In fact the statement does little more than repeat his defence and matters already set out in earlier statements filed by him in these proceedings, but fails to answer any of the relevant questions.  I have no doubt that he could cause the return of Elsa and/or provide the information required and or arrange for the mother and Elsa to talk on Skype should he so wish.  He refuses to do so.  I disbelieve his evidence in relation to the family closing ranks against him.  </span></p>
