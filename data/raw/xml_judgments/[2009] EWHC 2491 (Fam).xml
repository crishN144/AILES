M was granted a visitor&#8217;s visa for 6 months following his successful appeal against the refusal of the Entry Clearance Officer in Pakistan. The purpose of M&#8217;s visit was stated on his visa application form to be a family visit. During M&#8217;s visit to England his mother and brother returned to Pakistan leaving him behind.</p>

On 13 December the SSHD refused the application as in any event his visa was not capable of being extended. No further steps were taken to regularise M&#8217;s immigration status. He has remained in England since 23 June 2007. He has sworn a statement of 2 September 2009 in which he expresses his heartfelt wish to remain living in the UK and to be adopted by the applicants. It is common ground that the effect of an adoption order would be to confer on M British citizenship by virtue of s. 1(5) of the British Nationality Act, 1981.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Both the local authority &#8211; see Annex A at E 10 et seq &#8211; and M&#8217;s guardian support the making of an adoption order in favour of the applicants. By order of 14 July 2009 the SSHD was granted leave to intervene. He opposes the grant of an adoption order. First, it is submitted that the applicants need leave to bring such an application pursuant to s. 42 (1)(b), (5), (6), and (7) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> (&#8220;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref>&#8221;), which should be refused. Second, the application for adoption should not be granted because the applicants were party to deceiving the immigration authorities in or before June 2007 as to the purpose of M coming to the UK, which, it is submitted, was not for a visit but to facilitate M&#8217;s adoption in the UK. Third, whatever welfare advantages there may be to M being adopted they should not override the deceit practised in June 2007.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I turn to the facts. ASB and KBS are aged 63 and 60 years respectively. In 1965 and 1967 they moved to England from Pakistan respectively. In 1966 they were married. They have known for a long time that they cannot conceive a child. KBS has undergone extensive medical treatment and investigation, all sadly to no avail. By 1994/5 they knew for sure that KBS could not conceive.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On a visit to Pakistan in 1995 KBS talked to her mother. The applicants wanted to adopt M. A family discussion took place. MSB and his wife wholeheartedly agreed to M being adopted. The rationale for this is explained in para 6 of ASB&#8217;s statement of 23 January 2009:-&#8220;6. In the traditional society where I come from, it is considered important to have children. They look after their parents in their old age, and are a comfort and support to their parents. The children also know it is a duty that they have, to be responsible for their parents welfare, to look after their parents, even though leading their own independent lives. The children are taught that they will eventually have a responsibility for their parents, and that this is because of the care hat their parents have given them when they are young. This part of the teaching in the Koran, the responsibility for looking after your parents (sic). I know a number of childless parents in Pakistan who have adopted relatives&#8217; children for that purpose, and it is considered quite an acceptable thing to do.&#8221;</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Thereafter the applicants considered that their relationship with M was different. In January 2002 ASB swore an affidavit in Pakistan in the presence of M&#8217;s birth parents &#8211; see C 7 &#8211; that he accepted M as his son and would treat him as such. The affidavit is headed &#8220;Affidavit regarding Adoption Deed&#8221;. It is uncontroversial in the instant case that adoption is not a concept known to Pakistani law. It seems that what happened in 2002 is that the applicants became the beneficiaries of a guardianship order.</p>

From the age of 5 or 6 years they paid for M to be educated privately. They sent presents of clothes and shoes. They regularly sent money, and visited and took M on trips around Pakistan.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mr. Ruck Keene, counsel for the SSHD, put to the applicants in their evidence that they had arranged with M&#8217;s parents, prior to his coming to England in June 2007, for M to be brought to England to be adopted by them, that they well knew that M was coming to England to be adopted by them, and that the &#8220;visitor&#8221; visa was applied for by M&#8217;s mother and/or maternal uncle because the applicants knew that the visa would not be granted if the true position was disclosed.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The applicants&#8217; case is that they had nothing to do with the application made in Pakistan for a visa for M. That was undertaken by M&#8217;s mother and/or maternal uncle. They understood that M had only come for a visit with his mother and brother. When they came in 2007 neither applicant suspected that the reason why M was brought here (if such was the case) was for him to remain in England to be adopted by the applicants.</p>

In September 2007 M started at Copeland school where he has been educated to date.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">At some point after MSB arrived in the United Kingdom there was a family discussion involving the applicants about M staying in England. It was agreed that ultimately it would be left to M to decide. ASB told me that a decision was taken by him and KBS to adopt M after M had indicated that he wanted to stay with them. ASB told me that M asked if he could remain in England, that he asked M if he wanted to live with them, to which M replied that he did. ASB then informed the local authority. KBS&#8217;s evidence was to like effect.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In August 2007 &#8211; see E 22 &#8211; it seems that ASB told the local authority of M&#8217;s &#8220;adoption&#8221; in Pakistan and entry into the UK. He was advised to contact the Home Office. In December 2007 ASB asked the local authority to undertake a home study. He was told to seek guidance from the Home Office as to M&#8217;s status before a home study could begin and that more information would be needed from Pakistan, from the Home Office and from Pakistan.</p>

M is well settled in this country educationally, emotionally, and psychologically. Ms. Hegarty, a senior adoption social worker with the local authority, warmly supports M&#8217;s adoption. She says that it is the only appropriate order (see E 38) as it will give him the security he requires. Ms. Pauline Bennett, M&#8217;s guardian, speaks in her report of 29 May 2009 of the applicants&#8217; high degree of commitment and motivation in caring for M. Their love, affection and care of M are &#8220;completely evident&#8221;. M is thriving with them. They, in her view, have exercised genuine parental authority. Adoption would be of significant benefit to M both now and for the rest of his life. If he is not adopted all the benefits that have accrued, and will accrue, to M will be lost which would have &#8220;an extremely detrimental effect&#8221; on M (see C 331 para 8).</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">As is apparent I saw and heard the applicants give evidence. When cross-examined by Mr. Ruck Keene, ASB was asked about several matters arising out of the documents. First, a passage at para 3 of the guardian&#8217;s position statement of 30 September 2009 (C 29) was put to him, particularly the penultimate sentence, which  could be said to give the impression that the  applicants had told the guardian that M was being brought to England to be adopted by them. ASB told me that that was not correct. Ms. Bennett told me that at all times during her lengthy enquiries the applicants has always told her that they understood that M was coming to England purely for a visit. In my judgment this passage in her position statement refers to what happened after M came to England and is not referable to the applicants&#8217; state of mind, motives, or intentions at the time of M&#8217;s arrival in England.</p>

Furthermore, I note from E7 that Ms. Hegarty strongly suggests that the applicants themselves &#8220;had not approached an Entry Clearance Officer before leaving Pakistan with M to ensure that they knew the purpose of the trip to the UK was to adopt M.&#8221; But I have heard no suggestion that it was the applicants who actually brought M to England. Indeed there was no evidence to the effect that they had. Thus it would seem that Ms. Hegarty has made a mistake in that respect. She says that she obtained such information from the applicants in discussion with them prior to the directions&#8217; hearing of 18 November 2008. ASB told me that there was no such discussion.</p>

They dealt with the points put to them by Mr. Ruck Keene. I accept their evidence that they believed that M had come over to visit England in June 2007 and that any question of M staying on was only raised subsequently. They knew nothing of the application for a visitor&#8217;s visa. Thereafter the applicants told the local authority of their wish to adopt. They did not know that M&#8217;s application to extend his visa had been refused because M&#8217;s passport was not returned promptly at the end of December. Indeed it took some time before the applicants knew of the SSHD&#8217;s refusal decision of December 2007.</p>

If they had declared that the true reason why M was coming to England was adoption by the applicants, the visa would never have been granted. In my judgment it is more probable than not that MSB, his wife and/or M&#8217;s maternal uncle did intend that M should be brought to England to live with the applicants permanently. If such had been declared to the Entry Clearance Officer the visitor&#8217;s visa would not have been granted. So it is likely that the immigration authorities were deceived by one or both of M&#8217;s parents and/or his maternal uncle. But I wish to emphasise that in my judgment such deception was totally unknown to the applicants and that they played no part in it.</p>

When the mother returned to Jamaica the child remained with her grandparents. The mother consented to the child being adopted by them. The SSHD intervened and argued that the adoption was being used as a means of acquiring the right of abode in the UK. The judge held that, in accordance with s. 6 of the Adoption Act, 1976 he had to give &#8220;first consideration&#8221; to the child&#8217;s welfare throughout her childhood including the welfare benefits which flowed from the acquisition of the right of abode in the UK and that those benefits warranted the making of the adoption order. The Court of Appeal allowed the SSHD&#8217;s appeal, holding that it was necessary to distinguish the benefits of adoption from those of acquiring a right of abode and that there was no advantage to the child apart from those which would flow from a right of abode. The House of Lords reversed the Court of Appeal and restored the judge&#8217;s order.</p>

I do not see how, consistently with this language, the court could simply have ignored the considerable benefits which would accrued to T. during the remainder of the childhood. That the order would enable her to enjoy those benefits was a fact which the court had to take into account. No doubt the views of the Home Office on immigration policy were also a circumstance which the court was entitled to take into account, although it is not easy to see what weight they could be given. Parliament has not provided, as I suppose it might have done, that the adoption of a non-British child should require the consent of the Home Secretary. On the contrary, it has provided that the making of an adoption order automatically takes the child out of the reach of the Home Secretary&#8217;s powers of immigration control. The decision whether to make such an order is entirely one for the judge in accordance with the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 6</ref>. In cases in which it appears to the judge that adoption would confer real benefits upon the child during its childhood, it is very unlikely that general considerations of &#8220;maintaining an effective and consistent immigration policy&#8221; could justify the refusal of an order. The two kinds of consideration are hardly commensurable so as to be capable of being weighed in the balance against each other.</p>

			      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><marker name="tab"/>The cases upon which Mr. Underwood relied do not go nearly far enough to support the exclusionary rule which he was advancing. They appear to me to justify two more modest propositions. The first is that the purpose of an adoption is, as <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> says, to give parental responsibility for a child to the adopters. The court will therefore not make an adoption order when the adopters do not intend to exercise any parental authority but merely wish to assist the child to acquire a right of abode. This what Cross J. In Re A. (An infant) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1963] 1 WLR 231" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1963">[1963] 1 W.L.R. 231</ref>, 236 called an &#8220;accommodation&#8221; adoption.  The second proposition is that the court will rarely make an adoption order when it would confer no benefits upon the child during its childhood but give it a right of abode for the rest of its life. In such a case there are no welfare benefits during childhood to constitute the &#8220;first consideration&#8221;. The court is in effect being asked to use adoption to confer citizenship prospectively upon an adult. This is a power which Parliament has entrusted to the Home Secretary and the courts are reluctant to trespass upon the area of his authority.&#8221;</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment it remains the court&#8217;s obligation post <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref> to be on its guard in adoption proceedings against misuse of such proceedings. Misuse of adoption proceedings to gain a right of abode (as opposed to exercising parental authority) is most unlikely to be in the child&#8217;s welfare as well as undermining immigration policies and procedures. Paragraph 4 of Adoptions with a Foreign Element Regulations 2005 (S.I. 2005/393), made pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/83" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 83</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref>, demonstrate that the procedure for the adoption of a foreign child by applicants in the UK may be long, perhaps arduous, and uncertain of success. The temptation in such cases to pull the wool over the eyes of the immigration authorities may be well nigh irresistible. If the regulations are not complied with the offender may be guilty of a criminal offence &#8211; see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/83/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 83 (7)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref>.  The procedural requirements include (i) the prospective adopter receiving notification that the appropriate certificate has been issued by the Secretary of State confirming him as eligible and suitable to be an adoptive parent and that the child will be authorised to enter and reside permanently in the UK, (ii) the prospective adopter visiting the child in the state of origin, (iii) before visiting the child notifying the adoption agency of certain matters, (iv) after the visit confirming to the adoption agency the visit, providing any further information requested, and confirming the child&#8217;s expected date of entry into the UK, and (v) accompanying the child on entering the UK and thereafter giving notice to the adoption agency of the child&#8217;s entry and of the intention to apply for an adoption order.</p>

If applicants for an adoption order use the court&#8217;s procedures not to exercise parental authority in respect of the child but to assist him to acquire British nationality, such action is most unlikely to (indeed I would go so far as to say, cannot) be in the child&#8217;s best interests. For the proposed adopters would have proved to have been irresponsible, indeed thoroughly devious if not dishonest and thus not acting in the child&#8217;s best interests in a fundamental respect. Thus such behaviour ought to preclude the child being committed, indeed committed irrevocably, by adoption to the care of such applicants.

His secondary position is that the applicants, by making the application for adoption substantially after the time when M entered the UK, have colluded in the breach of immigration law by his parents and/or maternal uncle. He submitted that the applicants have no intention of exercising parental authority and are motivated solely by getting M British nationality. I wholly reject these submissions. I am abundantly satisfied from the applicants&#8217; evidence and by their love of, and devotion to, M, shown by their relationship with him since 1995, that they have every intention of exercising parental authority, and I am confident will continue to do so, in respect of M.</p>

He conceded that M&#8217;s rights under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights would be interfered with. Nevertheless the refusal of an adoption order leading to his likely return to Pakistan would be a proportionate interference and thus lawful.</p>

I have said that the applicants will exercise parental authority. M is well and happily settled in England. There is a genuine relationship between M and the applicants of son and parents. M sees them as his father and mother. They see him as their son and the child they have longed for. M fervently wishes to be adopted by them; he is 17 and his wishes and feelings are very important. He is doing well at school and has a network of friends. The applicants can assist him to achieve his educational and career goals and can provide him with continuity of religious and cultural norms. He will be adopted into a family that shares the same background, history, religion and cultural practices as his birth family. He will continue to have meaningful contact with his extended and birth families. I agree with the guardian that there is a real risk of a severe detrimental effect on M if the adoption order is refused thereby leading to his likely return to Pakistan. It would fracture his relationship with the applicants and most likely lead to instability and insecurity in his life now and in the future. In my judgment there is no order other than adoption that I can make that will secure M&#8217;s best interests throughout his life. So, in conclusion, I have no doubts that adoption by the applicants of M will confer real benefits on him throughout his life.</p>

But counsel were in agreement at the hearing before the judges as to the proper approach to any such application; and the judge accepted and endorsed the approach which they commended to him.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">                 &#8220;My view is that the requisite analysis of the prospect of the prospect of success will almost always include the requisite analysis of the welfare of the child. For, were there to be a real prospect that an applicant would persuade the court that a child&#8217;s welfare would best be served by [the substantive order sought], it would almost always serve the child&#8217;s welfare for the applicant to be given leave to seek to do so. Conversely, were there not to be any such real prospect, it is hard to conceive that it would serve the welfare of the child for the application for leave to be granted. But I hesitate to suggest that analysis of welfare will always be satisfactorily subsumed within an analysis of prospect.&#8221;</p>

Whilst M&#8217;s welfare is not the paramount consideration in this connection, the immigration matters, as I have found them to be, are not sufficient to persuade me to refuse leave. Indeed, now that I have conducted a full hearing into the merits and concluded that an adoption order should be made, it would be quite unjust not to grant leave.
