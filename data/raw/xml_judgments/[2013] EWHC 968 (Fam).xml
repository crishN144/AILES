	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">On 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2011, a baby girl was taken to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital by air ambulance having collapsed at home.  She was discharged the following day but brought back to hospital a few days later where further investigations revealed that she had sustained subdural haemorrhages and bone fractures.  Her twin brother was then admitted to hospital where it was discovered that he too had suffered subdural haemorrhages and nine rib fractures. Understandably, the medical staff at the hospital thought they were probably dealing with a case of non-accidental injury and notified the social workers and the police in accordance with usual protocol.  The Local Authority duly started care proceedings.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">It is an important feature of this case that each parent suffers from a range of medical conditions.  The mother has provided a long list of ailments from which she has suffered, including spondylolisthesis, Raynaud&#8217;s syndrome, painful joints, a tendency to easy bruising and excess joint laxity.  In the course of genetic and clinical investigation during these proceedings, she has been diagnosed with a condition known as Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, as discussed below.</p>

His problem with kidney stones is possibly linked to an imbalance in calcium in his body.  His recurrent kidney stones necessitate regular treatment including operations two or three times a year and very frequent visits to his GP.  In evidence, he told me that he occasionally spends the whole day in bed as a result of his health problems.  In the course of these proceedings, genetic and clinical investigation has revealed that he is probably suffering from a form of joint hypermobility.  His poor health has affected his employment record.  At present he is not working, his last post being that of assistant hotel manager.</p>

Following IVF treatment at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital, (hereafter &#8220;RDEH&#8221;), however, the mother became pregnant in mid-2010 and as is not uncommon after IVF, it emerged that she was expecting twins.  Up to that point, the parents had not lived together but in January 2011 the father moved to live with the mother in her bungalow in Devon.   </p>

The twins were born on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> February 2011: a girl, hereafter referred to as E, and a boy, hereafter referred to as J.  The babies were born by planned Caesarean section and were 2 &#189; weeks premature.  Both babies were well after birth, although it was noted that there was some blue colouration in the whites of E&#8217;s eyes.  </p>

Initially both slept in the same cot in the parents&#8217; bedroom but, after a few weeks, they were separated at night.  At first, E and the father moved into the spare room while J and the mother remained in the parents&#8217; joint bedroom. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Following their return home, the twins were regularly seen by the health visitor, Mrs Still.  The health visitor records and the red book for each twin have been produced for this hearing at which Mrs Still gave oral evidence.  She is obviously a very experienced and highly competent health visitor.  Significantly for this case, she examined both E and J very regularly during the first few weeks of their lives,  by my calculation 17 times between 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March and 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July.  On the first visit, and every visit thereafter, the babies were each weighed naked.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">It is accepted that J had no discernible health issues although subsequent investigation has demonstrated that he has congenital kidney malformation with a vesicoureteric reflux and also slightly prominent subarachnoid spaces.  From an early stage, however, concerns were raised about E&#8217;s poor feeding.  In addition, there were concerns about sounds she made when breathing, which suggested that she had a floppy larynx, or laryngolmalacia.  The mother took her to the GP about this on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">When both children were seen again by the health visitor on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March, Mrs Still noted in respect of E: &#8220;Only slight weight gain.  Vomiting feeds and only taking small quantities at all times.  To try larger holed teats.&#8221; The next day, E was seen by another GP who prescribed Gaviscon infant powder.  A further review by the GP took place on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st </span>April.  On 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April, Mrs Still visited again.  On this occasion, she noted about E: &#8220;Now fully formula-fed using Optimal Comfort and no Gaviscon.  Still vomiting after feed but less so and weight gain good over four days.  4 ounces.&#8221; Two days later, E was seen again by the health visitor at home who noted; &#8220;Steady weight gain.  Maintaining growth on 0.4 centile.&#8221; Both children were seen again by the health visitor on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The difference between the children is evident from photographs produced by the parents in the course of this hearing.  Judges are, of course, used to being shown pictures of children who are the subject of proceedings.  It is, in my view, very important to have that opportunity.  In this case, I was shown 2 albums out of a total of 19 volumes of photographs so far compiled by these parents, from which I was able to discern a striking difference in their appearance in the children at this early stage of their lives.  In contrast to their current appearance, where there is a striking resemblance (as is apparent from a DVD which I have just been looking at) one would not have known at that point that they were twins.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_15">
	  <num>15.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Another feature that emerges from the photographs is the manifest devotion displayed by both parents to the children.  I bear in mind, of course, the importance of not reading too much into photographs, but I do consider that the albums produced by the parents, and the enormous art book proudly produced by the mother in the course of the evidence, are significant evidence demonstrating how much these parents love their children.  They were, and are, besotted with them.</p>

According to the father, he heard E cry or scream and went into the bedroom where he picked her up and brought her back into the living room.  In evidence, he stated that he wanted to calm her down before she was fed, so he sat down on the sofa and put her between his legs facing away from his body in the direction of the TV.  He then noticed that she had flopped to one side and, when he looked at her, he saw that she had gone pale and was turning blue.  He then picked her up, placed her on his shoulder and walked out of the living room into the conservatory and called for the mother who was still sanding down the furniture in the garden.  She came in and took, or snatched, E from the father, shook her gently, placed her on the sofa in the conservatory and gently shook her shoulders again.  In passing, I interject that no mention was made of these acts of gentle shaking until the hearing before me.</p>

Later that day a lumbar puncture was performed to extract cerebrospinal fluid to test for evidence of infection.  In the course of that procedure, E was held firmly by the legs.

The father was, therefore, asked to bring J into hospital where he was examined by Dr Hart.  The father again mentioned the clicking sound that he had heard. A nursing sister present during the examination, Nurse Ahmed, felt and heard the clicking sound when she picked J up.  Dr Hart noted that J seemed: &#8220;well, thriving, normal&#8221; and, on seeing J undressed, noted no bruising and no tenderness over the chest.  An MRI scan revealed however that J, like his sister, had intracranial bleeding, and a skeletal survey revealed the presence of a number of rib fractures.  A skeletal survey then carried out on E revealed that she too had a single rib fracture but also a fracture of her right ulna.  </p>

This principle inter alia was drawn from the decision of the Court of Appeal in the criminal case of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">R v Cannings</span> [2004] EWCA 1 Crim.  In that case a mother had been convicted of the murder of two of her children who had simply stopped breathing. The mother&#8217;s two other children had experienced apparent life-threatening events taking a similar form.  The Court of Appeal quashed her convictions.  There was no evidence other than the repeated incidents of breathing having ceased and there was serious disagreement between the experts as to the cause of death.  There was fresh evidence as to hereditary factors pointing to a possible genetic cause.  In those circumstances, the Court of Appeal held that it could not be said that a natural cause could be excluded as a reasonable possible explanation.In the course of his judgment, Lord Justice Judge, as he then was, observed: </p>

In the earlier survey, the reaction was faint but by the later survey it had become much thicker.

She described this in her report as a transverse fracture of the distal right ulna which would have been caused by the application of a force at that point, for example, by a direct blow or angulation. In oral evidence, Dr Halliday explained that this injury was the infantile equivalent of a transverse fracture.  Infants&#8217; bones are very much more bendy and it is unusual to see a clear fracture line from an x-ray, although Dr Halliday suggested that it may be visible at microscopic level.

This statement assumes, of course, that there is no increased bone fragility in either child.  There was no evidence of any such fragility on the x-rays.<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"/>In oral evidence, Dr Halliday stressed that it is not necessarily the case that issues with bone density would be detectable on x-rays.

She added, however, that, where fractures have occurred in young children, loss of bone density is very obvious.  Dr Halliday said, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily be able to see loss of bone density but I wouldn&#8217;t accept that fractures were due to loss of bone density if not visible on the x-rays&#8221;.   In other words, bone density may be reduced without being detected on x-rays but, if it were sufficiently reduced to give rise to fractures with normal handling, then Dr Halliday would expect to see it.  </p>

There was no enlargement of the head.  Furthermore, the account of the apparently encephalopathic episode was more consistent with an acute bleed than with a re-bleed into a chronic subdural.  He said in answer to Miss Ingham that chronic subdurals are known for re-bleeding but such events are normally symptom-free.  It would not be expected that a re-bleed into a chronic subdural would lead to a collapse or that any event that caused a collapse in the presence of a chronic subdural might lead to some re-bleeding in the subdural.  In E&#8217;s case, the evidence was compatible with one event leading to intracranial damage, leading in due course to the child becoming acutely unwell and then recovering.  Mr Richards stressed that the evidence was compatible with this explanation but not diagnostic.

In addition, there was evidence of some growth in J&#8217;s head circumference between birth and the date of his presentation to hospital in July.  Overall, Mr Richards considered there was some &#8220;weak evidence of skull growth greater than normal in J&#8221; which would support the theory that the fluid seen on the scans was a chronic subdural haematoma.  He added that, in the subsequent scan three weeks later, the collection was resolving, although not completely resolved, which would be unusual although not completely unknown for a chronic subdural.

I, therefore, consider it unlikely that these children are the victims of a new previously unreported condition.  Given that these children have presented with similar injuries and that they are twins, the possibility has to be considered that they harbour some similar genetic predisposition towards injury and are, therefore, unduly fragile and capable of being injured by normal handling.

He further concluded that, whilst the father did not suffer from EDS, he had relatively mild inherited connective features which are consistent with a condition known as joint hypermobility syndrome.  Other types of EDS were excluded clinically and/or after electron microscopy, although the possibility that the parental clinical features might have been caused by subtle mutations of certain genes could not at that stage be completely excluded.</p>

In theory, E&#8217;s clinical features could predispose her to easier subdural bleeding, although it was much less likely that J&#8217;s clinical features could explain his subdural collections.  In addition, Professor Pope thought that it was unlikely that the fractures sustained by the children could have been explained by these factors.  However, the electron microscopy conducted on samples provided by the parents revealed a pattern of collagen &#8220;mispacking&#8221; typical of osteogenesis imperfecta.  Professor Pope, therefore, recommended further genetic testing to exclude the possibility of certain mutations linked with osteogenesis imperfecta which can occasionally cause both fractures and subdural bleeding. As a result, a direction was given for a further DNA sequencing of the relevant genes.  The result of those tests formally excluded the possibility that either twin suffered from osteogenesis imperfecta linked to EDS except for the very small technical possibility of 2 per cent of type 1 collagen mutations which were not detectable by those methods.  Such sequencing eliminates 90 per cent of all other osteogenesis imperfecta mutants caused by collagen type 1 errors and the remaining 10 per cent can be eliminated clinically on grounds of lack of clinical severity. Further examination of the two children&#8217;s urinary cross-link profiles excluded the clinical possibility they might suffer from type 4 EDS.  </p>

He pointed out, however, that the medical literature presented a slightly more complicated picture.  Some evidence in the literature suggested that in some cases of type 3 EDS there was evidence of lower bone density, although other research papers reached a different conclusion.  In Professor Pope&#8217;s view, EDS type 3 was a very variable disorder and it is possible that there are some subsets which feature lower bone density.  Type 3 is, said Professor Pope, the most common but least distinctive of the EDS types and was not yet fully understood.</p>

Instead Professor Pope had to resort to mere observation.  His conclusion was, given the adult characteristics shown by the mother, the features demonstrated by E were consistent with her having inherited her mother&#8217;s condition.  In J&#8217;s case, his features were less strong and there was no convincing evidence of an inherited condition.

In this case, the mother certainly has type 3 EDS and in Professor Pope&#8217;s opinion it is probable that she has inherited it from her own mother.  Furthermore, the mother&#8217;s two siblings have symptoms consistent with EDS.  Professor Pope conceded that, if EDS in this case is familial, it is not confined to females because the mother&#8217;s brother is showing symptoms.  As a result, it follows that genetic EDS in this family could pass through both the male and female lines.  </p>

Equally, noting that there had been no further reported injuries following the placing of the children under the overall care of the maternal grandparents, Dr Sunderland observed that there is no disease that disappears on change of carer.  In the absence of any chemical or metabolic disorder, Dr Sunderland considers that it is exceedingly rare for pre-mobile children to sustain fractures accidentally.  He expressed the view in his report and in the experts&#8217; meeting that a possible explanation linking the injuries was squeezing of the chest while the baby was being shaken.  Without a clear explanation of significant accidental trauma, there must be concerns that these were non-accidental injuries.  </p>

In the absence of certain haematological or metabolic disorders, Dr Sunderland advised that the mainstream medical view is that subdural haemorrhage is caused by vigorous shaking/whiplash motion of the head/neck.  He noted, however, that this has been challenged by pathologists and engineers because of analysis of traffic accidents which have identified that the forces required to cause subdural haemorrhage in such circumstances are more substantial than can be generated by humans while shaking.</p>

Another possibility was that the collapse had been caused as a result of some pressure on the brain leading to a transient seizure and a transient stopping of breathing.  He accepted there was a possibility that E had suffered some form of collapse and that her injuries had been sustained in efforts to revive her.  Ultimately he was unable to give a definitive view from a medical perspective as to whether the injuries were accidental or not.  Asked as to whether the injuries in this case followed the category of something unexplained beyond medical knowledge, Dr Sunderland said that on the balance of probability, he did not consider that these injuries fell into this category although he observed that &#8220;you can never say never in medicine&#8221;.</p>

I say straightaway that I found both parents to be honest witnesses.  The mother&#8217;s evidence was clear, concise yet full.  I was satisfied that her answers were as accurate as possible in the circumstances. The father was inclined to answer a question about something he had done by replying about what he would have done.  At times, this tendency made it difficult to be entirely confident about the accuracy of his answers but this did not lead me to doubt his honesty.  I expressly reject, with respect, Mr Whitehall&#8217;s submission that the father&#8217;s evidence was &#8220;deeply unimpressive&#8221;.  Ms Cook submits that the father may be inarticulate and a poor narrator but that does not make him dishonest or a likely perpetrator of physical abuse to a child.

Despite the earlier confusion over vitamin D levels, the court has heard evidence from Dr Salzmann and that would show that the twins&#8217; vitamin D levels were within normal range.Whilst acknowledging that Professor Pope accepted that there were two schools of thought as to whether there can be bone density reduction associated with EDS, and that he had expressed the view that EDS is a variable disorder and that not all categories are as yet fully resolved, Mr Whitehall submitted that overall Professor Pope&#8217;s evidence indicated that it was exceedingly unlikely that the children had inherited any condition that made them more susceptible to fractures, that  neither the mother nor the father had any history of fractures that were linked to their connective tissue disorders or to the joint hypermobility problems, and that there was no evidence that the children were prone to easy bruising.  </p>

He reminds the court of the view of Dr&#160;Sunderland, Dr Anslow and Mr Richards that subdural haemorrhaging in the absence of a particular medical condition does not occur spontaneously but rather following some event.  The events put forward by the parents, do not, he submits, account for the subdural collections in this case.  In the absence of a particular medical condition, therefore, an unexplained event or events have given rise to the subdural bleeding.  Given the age of the children and the fact that they were constantly in the care of either or both parents, an unexplained event raises a high suspicion of non-accidental injury.  </p>

First these are injuries and symptoms seen in twins.  The research as to such similar events in twins is limited.  They are, additionally, children conceived through IVF where research appears to be similarly limited.  Then the parents both have an unusual number of medical features and conditions. The extent to which any combination of these has transferred to the twins cannot be known.  They remind me that they rely on the fact the mother has EDS type 3 with a history of easy bruising and that this is a symptom shared by other members of her family.  They point out that the twins have features and symptoms of EDS which are more pronounced in E than J, although the symptoms in J may develop as he gets older.  E has hemangiomas externally and it is, therefore, possible that she has them internally.  If so, they may have increased her susceptibility to intracranial bleeding.  In addition, E has other medical problems including gastroesophageal reflux, laryngomalacia and possibly apnea.  J has congenital kidney malformation.  All the fractures, furthermore, were asymptomatic despite the children being handled regularly by professionals.  Both children have suffered a number of petechiae over a long period of time in different circumstances.  At least some of the injuries are likely, on the balance of probabilities to have occurred after 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July once the parents were under complete supervision.  </p>

Her revised opinion is that the window in which those fractures occurred is from approximately 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> to 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July with the likeliest date being about a fortnight before the scan on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July, ie, 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July.  Mr Whitehall submits that this is consistent with something having occurred to J whilst he was in the sole care of his father after the mother had taken E back to hospital.  Ms Cook and Ms Phillips respond, on the other hand, that there is thus a significant possibility that the fractures occurred after J was himself admitted to hospital that day.  This leads, they suggest, to a conclusion that those fractures could have occurred as a result of normal handling and in those circumstances there is no reason why the other fractures to the upper ribs might not have been sustained in the same way.  They add that the timing of the second, third and fourth rib fractures, broadly the whole of June, makes it very surprising that, when the health visitor was visiting weekly and observing him dressed and undressed, handling him and seeing him naked, she did not observe or experience any of the features one would normally associate with such fractures.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Secondly, so far as the fractures are concerned, Mr Storey and Mr Butterfield submit that there is a real possibility that the children were suffering from reduced bone density given the familial history of EDS.  In the circumstances, the court is left with an unknown degree of force required to cause bone injuries in the case of both children. They submit that it is not good enough nor accurate for reliance to be placed on the suggestion there had been no fractures since all of this came to light.  The reality is that no one knows whether there has been any bone injury or fractures because the children have not been re-x-rayed.  Given the fact that the previous fractures were all symptom free, it cannot be assumed that there would be any symptoms if the children had sustained further fractures since the start of these proceedings.</p>

Not surprisingly, they considered that these factors pointed strongly towards a diagnosis of non-accidental injury.  As a busy consultant paediatrician in a local hospital, Dr Hart was doing his job properly and conscientiously in investigating and instigating child protection procedures and in explaining to the parents in frank terms his view, based on the available evidence and the established understanding of cases involving such injuries, that this was prima facie a case of child abuse.</p>

A court hearing application for care orders based on cases of suspected physical abuse of children must follow the evidence and pursue the enquiry in whatever detail and for however long is necessary to arrive at the truth.  In this case, it was decided, rightly as it turned out, to seek expert opinion from a range of experts and to explore the family medical history in much greater depth than normally occurs in care proceedings.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The first, and to me particularly striking, is the fact that there were hardly any external signs of any of the injuries sustained by either of the children.  Until the MRI, CT scans and x-rays were carried out, nobody had any idea that these two little children had sustained the large number of injuries that were subsequently discovered.  It is remarkable and in my view highly significant that these children were seen very frequently by a range of health professionals, including being regularly examined naked by a very experienced and highly competent health visitor, and yet not a single bruise or mark or other sign was ever seen on either child that might have suggested that either of them had sustained a fracture.  Furthermore, neither child exhibited any signs of pain and discomfort that might have been attributable to such an injury, save for the incident in hospital to which I shall return.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">This, therefore, gives rise to the very real possibility that these children had sustained their fractures as the result of the application of forces that were insufficient to cause bruises.  Of course, not every fracture will be accompanied by external evidence such as bruising or swelling or pain or discomfort but it is to my mind very surprising that none of the fractures in this case were accompanied by any of these signs.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">With that preliminary observation, I return to the family medical history.  On any view it is complex.  Both the mother and the father have different and difficult medical histories.  Each deals with their various conditions in different ways.  The mother is something of a stoic.  The father, if he will forgive me saying so, is something of a valetudinarian, but neither exaggerates or fabricates their conditions.  It is just part of their lives.  I agree with Ms Cook that the consequence is that the parents separately together have an unusual number of medical features and conditions, the combination of which if they have been transferred to the twins cannot be known.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Furthermore, and central to that unknown combination, are a number of conditions which prima facie may lead to an impact on bone fragility.  The mother now has a clear diagnosis of EDS, inherited from her own mother and now, in Professor Pope&#8217;s view, possibly passed onto her daughter, E.  The father has joint hypermobility and in Professor Pope&#8217;s view, J has symptoms similar to that condition.  Whilst I accept Professor Pope&#8217;s evidence that subdural haematomas are not normally associated with the type of EDS from which the mother suffers, I also accept his evidence that there is a lack of clarity and understanding about some aspects of the syndrome, in particular its association with fragility.  In Mr Richards&#8217; phrase, there are dark corners of this area of medicine which even Professor Pope, the world expert, does not understand.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">In addition, there is an area of the family medical history which, surprisingly, even this exhaustive inquiry has not, to my mind, fully explored.  The father suffers from kidney stones.  They are, in fact, his most troublesome ailment.  Stones are sometimes, although not always I understand, associated with an imbalance of calcium and other minerals in the body.  J also suffers from a congenital kidney malformation, the extent of which is not yet established.  It is to my mind at least possible that there is a link between kidney stones, the possible association with calcium imbalance, and reduced bone density.</p>

On the other hand, there is the opinion of Professor Pope that the incidence of reduction of bone density in children with EDS is relatively unclear because of the absence of any controlled studies.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">At this point I recall my earlier finding regarding T.  That was, of course, an interim finding but it has not been revisited at this hearing. In other words, it is accepted by the Local Authority.  As a result, I proceed on the basis that T sustained skull fractures as a result of a low level fall witnessed by the mother and maternal grandmother.  The consensus among the experts is that such an occurrence is unusual but not impossible.  Mr&#160;Richards alluded in his oral evidence to a growing number of cases in both his clinical and medico-legal practice in which he and his colleague, Mr Jayamohan from the John Radcliffe Hospital, have come across fractures attributable to low level falls.  In passing, I express the hope that research into such cases will be undertaken to increase the level of understanding on this important topic.  The significance of T&#8217;s fractures for this case is that it is another pointer to the possibility that the children in this family may be more susceptible to fractures than other children.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">To these matters I add a number of other factors.  First, these children are twins, conceived by IVF.  I accept Ms Cook&#8217;s submission the research into such circumstances are limited.  Secondly, I note the striking symmetry in J&#8217;s bilateral upper rib fractures.  Thirdly, there is the fact that E had external haemangioma and may, as Dr Sunderland, Dr Anslow and others accept, have internal haemangioma which might, therefore, increase her susceptibility to intracranial bleeding.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Fourth, I accept the evidence that J&#8217;s subdural haemorrhage were chronic with minor incidents of re-bleed.  So far as E is concerned, Dr&#160;Anslow felt that the prominent collections were chronic whereas Mr Richards favours the alternative explanation of acute traumatic effusion. I find that it has not been proved that E had sustained an acute intracranial bleed.  Given that her twin had a chronic subdural haemorrhage, there is to my mind a strong possibility that her subdural collection is also a chronic.  Furthermore, I accept the view of Dr Anslow that it is possible that such chronic subdurals date back to birth.  The publication of research papers on the incidence of birth-related subdural haemorrhage alluded to by Mr Whitehall in his closing submissions have fundamentally altered the understanding as to the incidence of intracranial bleeding in babies.  Subdural haemorrhages are very, very common in babies, and although they are apparently less common after a Caesarean section, they are found after all types of delivery.  Like many judges, I have a strong sense that there is more to be learnt about this issue after further research studies have been concluded.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Finally, there is the question whether some of the injuries were sustained in hospital.  I accept Dr Anslow&#8217;s evidence that at least one injury, J&#8217;s re-bleed detected in the further MRI on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> August, was definitely sustained in hospital.  In a sense, that is not surprising because it is now accepted that a chronic subdural is susceptible to re-bleed with minimal force or even spontaneously.  Counsel for the parents have, however, doggedly pursued the theory that other injuries may have been sustained in hospital.  The first is the fracture of E&#8217;s ulna.  On any view, this was an unusual injury and at first sight very worrying.  At the outset, when counsel for the parents started to explore the question of whether it could have been sustained during the attempted insertion of the canula on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July, I was, frankly, sceptical but, as the case has proceeded, and particularly in the light of Nurse Gray&#8217;s evidence, she having witnessed the difficulties the doctors had and described the way in which E&#8217;s arm was held, and, having regard to the evidence of the mother, which I accept, as to the distress and discomfort this manifestly caused in E, I have come to accept that it is at least a real possibility that the injury to the ulna was sustained in that way.   I stress that I am not criticising the doctors involved and I am not making a finding to that effect.  It is, however, a real possibility that is part of the overall picture.  Then there is the evidence about J&#8217;s posterior rib fractures.  Dr Halliday&#8217;s change of opinion as to timing may be significant because it moves the window forward in time to an extent that it becomes more likely that they were also sustained in hospital, although again I stress that I am not making a finding to that effect.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The Local Authority&#8217;s case regarding those latter fractures is that they provide an important clue as to the cause of the injuries in this case.  Mr Whitehall submits that the likeliest interpretation is that J&#8217;s fractures were inflicted by the father whilst he was caring for him on his own after E had been returned to hospital but, to my mind, the striking feature about this area of the evidence is that the father, as is his want, sought immediate medical advice about this clicking sound.  If he had been responsible for injuring J through an act of a momentary loss of control, as Mr Whitehall suggests, I think it highly unlikely that he would have taken J to the GP.  As it is, he did take J to the GP who heard the clicking but noticed no other sign and did not get any sense that this was a case of child abuse.  I find that the father&#8217;s behaviour about this episode of clicking is wholly inconsistent with what would have been expected of someone who had inflicted a non-accidental injury on the child.  On the contrary, it is entirely consistent with what one would expect with a properly concerned parent.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">This brings me to the wider canvas.  It is an important part of the evidence in this case that, save for the injuries, there is not one scintilla of criticism of the way in which the mother and father have cared for these children.  In the period leading up to the admission of the children in hospital, and in the 19 months since that admission, their care has been observed and scrutinised by a large number of professionals and the picture that emerges, not least from the highly positive assessment carried out on behalf of the Local Authority, is that these are doting parents who are devoted to the children and provide them with a very high level of care.  This was obvious to me throughout the hearing, from the way they spoke about the children, the large numbers of photographs taken and produced in the 19 albums, the huge book of artwork, the DVD of the children and the smiles on their faces on the many occasions when the children are being spoken of, not least as I am giving judgment.  Put simply, this couple are simply dotty about their children.</p>

I accept that there were the stresses identified in closure by Mr Whitehall.  I accept that in some cases, such stresses might lead to a momentary loss of control but I do think it unlikely that this happened on four occasions, or possibly more than four occasions, in this family.  In any event, as I have already indicated, I find these parents to be truthful and honest witnesses and I accept their evidence.</p>

There is a possibility that these injuries were inflicted by one or other of the parents in a momentary loss of control but I find that the Local Authority has not proved that that happened on a balance of probabilities.  That is my finding and that is the basis upon which these children will be cared for hereafter.  Accordingly, the threshold conditions under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31(2)</ref> of the Children Act are not crossed and this application is therefore dismissed.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">I conclude with a few final observations.  This case demonstrates yet again the importance of a full and thorough forensic examination of cases of suspected child abuse.  A full and thorough investigation involves a number of elements.  First, it requires judges of sufficient experience who are able to manage cases through the course of the proceedings.  Judicial continuity is a crucial component of the modern family justice system.  This case was due to be managed and heard by Mr Justice Holman but, for reasons set out above, the interim hearing and in due course the final hearing have been conducted by me.  The fact that I heard the interim hearing concerning T and then the final hearing has been, I think, of very considerable importance.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Secondly, this case required the involvement of a range of experts from different disciplines.  If the case had been decided purely on the basis of the treating doctors, the outcome may have been very different.  The perspective brought, in particular, by Dr&#160;Halliday, Dr Anslow, Mr Richards, Dr Sunderland and Professor Pope has been very important.  Judges will be rigorous in resisting the call for unnecessary use of experts in family proceedings but equally will not hesitate to endorse the instruction of experts where, under the new rules, they are satisfied that they are necessary for the determination of the issues in proceedings.</p>

In this case, the further testing proposed by Professor Pope which led to a series of adjournments was unquestionably necessary.  Judges must be vigilant to identify those rare cases which require longer time.  It is, of course, important that these cases are identified as soon as possible at the outset of proceedings and that any delay is kept to a minimum.</p>

The role played by all of the representatives for all of the parties in this case has been of the utmost importance.  All judges are very concerned at the prospect of an increase in self-represented litigants and the consequences for the family justice system.  Not enough recognition is given to the contribution to the family justice system made by family lawyers.  </p>
