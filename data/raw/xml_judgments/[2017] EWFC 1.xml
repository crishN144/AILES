			<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Judge Brasse found that the Indian pension fund belonged to the husband and dismissed his case that he had transferred all his interest in it to a Mr Deshmukh. He made strong findings of dishonesty against the husband. McFarlane LJ did not in his judgment question those findings, and indeed relied on them. He stated however at paragraph 15 that &#8220;the focus of this appeal is not upon the judge's findings of fact but upon the order that he made in the light of those findings.&#8221; In paragraph 47 he held that paragraphs 1 and 2 of the order should be set aside - and those only concerned the injunction order. However, as I have already stated, the actual order of the Court of Appeal sets aside not merely the illegitimate free-standing injunction orders (i.e. paragraphs 1 and 2), but the order &#8220;in its entirety&#8221; made by Judge Brasse, and this included the key declarations as to the beneficial ownership of the fund. Therefore, it seems to me that, although this was probably unintended by the Court of Appeal, the question of the ownership of the fund is at large and needs to be re-determined, although in such determination the findings of Judge Brasse are naturally admissible and influential, if not decisive.&#8221;</p>

Mr Cayford QC and Miss Toch are in my judgment right to submit that the terms of the judgment and the terms of the order of the Court of Appeal are simply irreconcilable. The judgment expressly relies on the factual findings made by Judge Brasse. Para 47 of the judgment of McFarlane LJ sets aside only paras 1 and 2 of the order but does not set aside the declarations, which immediately precede the orders, and which concern the ownership of the Indian annuity contract. These state:</p>

The words are not mere recitals. In my judgment these are findings of fact formally incorporated in a declaration within the court&#8217;s order. As such they can be set aside on appeal &#8211; see <span style="font-style:italic">Re M (Children)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/1170" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 1170" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 1170</ref> at para 21. But in this case the Court of Appeal could not have set aside those declarations as permission to appeal them had not been granted, nor even sought. Their validity had never been in issue in the Court of Appeal and so it was not possible for them to have been set aside. I therefore conclude that the order of the Court of Appeal which purports to set aside &#8220;in its entirety&#8221; the order of District Judge Brasse is mistaken, and that the declaration of Judge Brasse incorporating his findings concerning the issue of ownership of the annuity remains intact. </p>

Here the parties must be the same (in reality), but the subject matter of the litigation in the prospective second action is not the same as that in the original action. In this scenario a bar may arise &#8220;where a particular issue forming a necessary ingredient in a cause of action has been litigated and decided and in subsequent proceedings between the same parties involving a different cause of action to which the same issue is relevant, one of the parties seeks to re-open that issue&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic">Arnold v National Westminster Bank plc</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1991] 2 AC 93" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1991">[1991] 2 AC 93</ref> at 105E per Lord Keith of Kinkel). In this situation, the bar is not absolute. Here, the public policy on which the doctrine is based and principles of justice have greater force. A discretion arises to do justice. It is in principle possible to challenge the previous decision on the relevant issue not just by taking a new point which could not reasonably have been taken on the earlier occasion, but even to reargue in materially altered circumstances an old point which had previously been rejected.&#8221;</p>

Before Judge Brasse the wife was seeking a pension sharing order; alternatively, by some innovative method, the transfer of that policy to her. Before me the relief that is sought is periodical payments calibrated by reference to the income deriving from the policy. Therefore, the relevant principle in play is not cause of action estoppel but issue estoppel; and the issue in question is the ownership of the policy.  </p>

This does not cause me to think in the slightest that the findings of Judge Brasse were incorrect. Who the husband chooses to give the death benefit of the policy to tells me nothing about its current ownership.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Judge Brasse was of the view that the wife should have the entire benefit of the annuity policy. In para 29 of his judgment of 6 January 2016 he explained that he was applying the underlying rationale of his earlier judgment of 9 October 2015 to that policy. That rationale was that because the husband had lost such vast sums by reckless gambling the wife should recover the few scraps that were left. It was for this reason that Judge Brasse ordered that the husband should pay to the wife the sum that corresponded to the proceeds of sale of certain UBS shares, worth some &#163;19,000, believed to be owned by the husband. In fact, unbeknown to Judge Brasse and the wife, but probably not to the husband, those shares had been distrained by a creditor of the husband (who happened to be one of his relatives). So not even that scrap will be recovered by the wife. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are therefore powerful reasons for making a supplementary periodical payments order in favour of the wife which equates to 100% of the income deriving from the annuity policy. On the other hand, I must be realistic.   If such an order were made I foresee that a thicket of obstacles will be placed in the wife&#8217;s way to her receiving that income. If, instead, some part of the income were to remain the husband&#8217;s it is less likely that he would cut off his nose to spite his face. I also bear in mind that in their agreement which led to the <span style="font-style:italic">Rose</span> order the wife accepted 50% of the predecessor policies. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I therefore vary the existing periodical payments order to provide that it has two limbs. The first limb will be the monthly amount payable by the husband under Judge Brasse&#8217;s order as varied by me (as to which, see below). The second limb will provide that the husband will pay to the wife two-thirds of the quarterly income deriving from the annuity policy as it arises. This will take effect on 9 August 2016 being the date that I deemed the wife to have made her application. It will be paid to the wife&#8217;s Indian bank account with the State Bank of India, [redacted] Branch, New Delhi (bank code [redacted], account number [redacted]). There will be a bolstering injunction made against the husband requiring him to procure that these payments go to the wife. This injunction is made pursuant to the principle expounded in <span style="font-style:italic">Blight v Brewster</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2012] 1 WLR 2841" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] 1 WLR 2841</ref> following the Privy Council in <span style="font-style:italic">Tasarruf Mevduati Sigorta Fonu v Merrill Lynch Bank and Trust Company (Cayman) Limited </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/jcpc/2011/17" uk:canonical="[2011] UKPC 17" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] UKPC 17</ref>. On service of that injunction on HDFC Life the existing freezing order, initially made by the Court of Appeal and repeated by me, will be discharged. I would like to think that HDFC Life will, on service on them of this judgment, my order, and the bolstering injunction, pay the sums directly to the wife&#8217;s account, but that is a matter beyond my power to direct.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In para 105 of his judgment of 9 October 2015 Judge Brasse recorded that the husband had stated that he believed that within four months he could obtain work in a bank earning &#163;60,000 per annum. In para 115 and 116 Judge Brasse recorded his prediction that within the same period the wife would obtain employment earning &#163;18,000 - &#163;19,000 annually, thus enabling her to come off state benefits. Whilst in receipt of benefits spousal maintenance has no economic benefit for the wife as there is a &#163;1 reduction in benefit for every &#163;1 of maintenance received. Therefore, he made a spousal maintenance award of &#163;500 per month but deferred its commencement until 1 March 2016. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In fact, both predictions have proved false. We are now over a year from Judge Brasse&#8217;s judgment but neither party has obtained full time employment. The husband argues with some force that the lurid press reports of Judge Brasse&#8217;s judgment which were published (along with photographs said to have derived from the wife&#8217;s Facebook page) following the open court hearing on 26 May 2016 by Cobb J of his application for permission to appeal, have fatally compromised his prospects of obtaining work in the financial sector. It is an irony that reports strongly sympathetic to the wife and damning of the husband (and of which she may have had a hand in their creation) seem to have prejudiced the very periodical payments order she was awarded. Be that as it may, the husband has not obtained employment as predicted. He is exploring qualifying as a teacher. He is also exploring writing a PhD. At present he is earning relatively modest sums tutoring 11 &#8211; 15 year olds in Maths and Physics. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I agree with Judge Brasse that having regard to the facts of this case the wife is entitled to recover from the husband some money by way of periodical payments. Had it not been for his reckless conduct in gambling away his high earnings there would have been no doubt a substantial sum of accumulated wealth for her to have shared at the end of the marriage. But &#163;500 per month is a long way beyond the husband&#8217;s capacity at present. I therefore vary the maintenance award to &#163;100 per month from 1 February 2017 (payable in advance). This is within the husband&#8217;s present earning capacity; of that I have no doubt. The arrears under the existing order are remitted.  </p>

Under the second limb, and using present exchange rates, she will receive &#163;4,000 per annum. This is a total of &#163;5,200 per annum, or a mere &#163;100 per week. This is a very small sum objectively, but it will be a meaningful sum for her as she attempts to rebuild her life and to support their child. It will end, of course, if she were to remarry, which she hopes to do.  </p>
