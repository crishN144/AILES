The issue before me today is how this litigation is to be funded to its conclusion, which includes a five day hearing listed in July this year. I&#160;am not going to say a great deal about the background or the chronology to these proceedings because, as is common knowledge to everybody in this court, I&#160;have had extensive involvement in this case in terms of a ten day fact-finding exercise.  That resulted in a lengthy judgment which was produced in January of this year, in which I&#160;made a significant number of findings in relation to the litigation and the conduct of each of these parties in the context of disclosure and other aspects which were the subject of lengthy allegations and cross &#8211;allegations.</span></p>

We are all very familiar with the history of this matter and for that reason I&#160;am not going to go into the background in the context of this short judgment which is being delivered late in the day.</span></p>

By and large, with one or two forensic comments, they are as reflected in the schedule which has been produced for me today by Mr.&#160;Ewins.  That schedule, depressingly, shows that once the burden of costs already incurred are factored into this case, the assets available for division are less than &#163;4&#160;million, including about &#163;1.7 million of pension funds.  </span></p>

Unfortunately they came to nought.  It is clear to me that, although at one stage there was a tentative agreement in principle as to bridging the significant shortfall which the wife has in relation to her outstanding legal costs, that agreement was quite clearly abandoned (as I see from the correspondence) against the backdrop of what one might call emergency funding to enable a settlement meeting to take place.  </span></p>

First, there was the significant liability they were carrying in respect of their professional costs; secondly there was the quandary of how they were to meet a further liability in relation to counsel&#8217;s fees of the upcoming hearing.  I&#160;take the view that that was a perfectly proper position for them to take, just as I&#160;accept entirely that those who represent the husband are entitled to look to him for proper funding of his legal costs in this application.  </span></p>

Although I&#160;have no doubt about the ability of Mr.&#160;Sear, his junior counsel, to conduct proceedings on his behalf, I&#160;accept that in that respect he has had to make sacrifices in terms of his own representation.  </span></p>

As I&#160;myself stressed to these parties during open email correspondence between the Bar and the Bench after I&#160;had handed my judgment down in January of this year, what was essential was that some agreement was reached in relation to funding both parties&#8217; costs, so that we did not face the spectre of the July hearing on the basis that either was unrepresented.  It is a highly complex case even if it is run from the foot of the base of my findings.  It would be an almost impossible case for the wife as a litigant in person (because she is somewhat handicapped in terms of her understanding of legal principles and her use of English) and I&#160;have no doubt an equally difficult exercise for the husband.</span></p>

The target of that provision is a significant fund of money which is currently held in a Jersey account.  It is US Dollar account maintained offshore in the Channel Islands.  I&#160;am told the current balance in that account is just over $710,000 which translates into a sterling equivalent of just over &#163;420,000.  That fund represents the proceeds of the husband&#8217;s activities in employment which were not disclosed until a very late stage of the proceedings, a matter of less than a month before the October 2013 fact finding hearing.  That fund is currently frozen as a result of undertakings which he gave in September of last year pending the final outcome of these proceedings.</span></p>

An estimate has been produced on her behalf of a need for &#163;52,000 going forward.  I&#160;am told by Mr.&#160;Ewins that that costs estimate is not in issue.  Mr.&#160;Sear very sensibly did not take any issue with that figure and it is difficult to see how he could, given that on any view it represents a significant discount on what the wife&#8217;s solicitors would otherwise be entitled to charge. They have reached an agreement with her whereby they will represent her on a fixed cost basis.  To that extent it is, as I&#160;accept, an arrangement which indirectly benefits the husband because it means at the end of the day there is going to be more available for distribution between the parties. Thus, I&#160;accept what Mr.&#160;Ewins says to me that there is an inbuilt discount in that figure.</span></p>

His position, as he comes to court today, is that he needs a further sum of just under &#163;105,000 to put him in a position where he can fund his own costs to the conclusion of the July hearing.</span></p>

However there is an important caveat to his offer which is that he should receive a release of &#163;60,000 in order to deal with a significant element of his own costs going forward.  To that extent the parties are some &#163;52,600 apart as matters stand.  </span></p>

Mr.&#160;Ewins on behalf of the wife submits to me that there should be no release at all to the husband in relation to his ongoing costs, and in support of this submission he points to the fact that the husband has access to potentially liquid funds of approximately &#163;275,000, being the sum of about &#163;160,000 cash in a bank account and a portfolio of shares in this jurisdiction worth approximately &#163;115,000.  Thus, Mr.&#160;Ewins says the husband has the means to enable him to meet the &#163;104,000 which he claims he will need to spend between now and the end of the trial.  </span></p>

He also points to the fact that even if he is obliged to look to his own resources to meet that liability, he will still have &#163;174,000 onshore and liquid.  That is the response which Mr.&#160;Ewins advances to the submission made to me by Mr. Sear on behalf of his client that if I&#160;do not permit release to the husband then he will be faced with significant hardship as a result of having to fund his own costs.</span></p>

This is by no means a &#8216;run of the mill&#8217; (if I&#160;may put it in those terms) application for financial provision for legal costs.  This is, in effect, an application made in the context of hard fought, bitterly contested and part heard proceedings where there are allegations on both sides as to the extent to which each of these parties has complied with his and her obligations to make full and frank disclosure.  I&#160;see with some disquiet that those allegations rumble on in the context of the latest round of updating disclosure which has been made by the parties.</span></p>

When I&#160;concluded my fact-finding judgment, I&#160;made it very plain that I&#160;envisaged making a substantial costs order against the husband in respect of some significantly misleading disclosure he had made to the court.  This included fabricating bank statements to show false information designed to hide the true position from the court.  I&#160;will not repeat what I&#160;said in my judgment but he knows, subject to any adjustment I&#160;make in relation to the litigation conduct I&#160;found to have been perpetrated by the wife, that he is in a position of significant financial exposure on that front.  </span></p>

But for the absence of time at the conclusion of the fact-finding hearing in October 2013, it is highly likely that the husband would already have had to meet a significant costs order which would have operated to deplete his existing assets and to reduce the exposure of the wife&#8217;s solicitors.  In my mind, the fact that that exercise has had to be postponed is a very relevant feature of this case.</span></p>

All she has is whatever her potential claims may be worth in these proceedings.  There are two properties in Moscow, and there is the property here which has an equity of about &#163;500,000 in round terms when the various loans are taken into account.  Other than that, according to Mr.&#160;Ewins&#8217;s schedule her liquid assets amount to just over &#163;15,000 and she has a significant raft of liabilities.</span></p>

I&#160;have already addressed the point that he has recourse to assets outside those funds of about &#163;275,000.  Further, I&#160;have already taken on board his concerns that further erosion of those funds may well deprive him of the means to make proper provision for his current wife and his young daughter, never mind for the needs of his other children.  </span></p>
