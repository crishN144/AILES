It was further adjourned at the next hearing when L attended court represented by solicitors and counsel. The Judge ordered a report by CAFCASS on joinder of both children, which was prepared by Miss Alicia Northcutt, then of CAFCASS High Court team. The children were formally joined on 14 October 2015, and Mrs Ramus was appointed as guardian for L and Ms Northcutt as guardian for B. Mrs Ramus told me in evidence that she was appointed guardian for L because that was his preference. </p>

Her case is that L has been far too exposed to these proceedings already and taken far too active part. I understood and understand her concerns. At the same time I was concerned that to exclude L from the proceedings might be to fuel his complaint that he was not being listened to. I was also concerned that he should have an accurate view of what transpired in court, and that he might gain a misunderstanding of the proceedings and process if he was only told what had happened. </p>

I do not understand that the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-weight:bold">Re KP (a child) [2014] EWCA 554,</span> disapproved that process. Notes of the meetings have been circulated.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are obvious problems for solicitors to be the first port of call, even for an older child (although L was only 14 when first seen). As the authors comment, a solicitor can advise on competence, but not on the weight to be accorded to a child&#8217;s wishes. There is a risk that a child or young person&#8217;s account which is accepted at face value and without probing or challenge, and then put forward to the court (where again it is unchallenged) will become reinforced and embedded. </p>

His complaint against his mother was that she had interfered with his contact to his father. At that point he became upset. I broke off the interview and resumed it at his request when he wanted to say to me was that he was concerned that there would be consequences from S if he returned because of what he and B had said. He described S as &#8220;aggressive and in your face when you say things about him&#8221;; &#8220;I&#8217;m sort of afraid of him&#8221;. All the incidents he described were in the context of domestic life. He did not deal with the proposal that S would leave the home. I asked him no questions.</p>

Ms Kirby relied on this to assert that the mother has no reliable family support and to imply that the mother is an unstable individual.

She refers to their statements. She says that they are well and happy in England. She does not describe how they are in Spain.  She says that she does not really know S but has been told by a relative that he had made a threatening comment about another relative. He has a bad reputation. She is very proud of her grandsons for being so open and honest. She feels that they will be unsafe and will be punished. She does not say why she had fallen out with the mother, her daughter.

It is the mother&#8217;s case that although there is some overt untruth in what has been said, there is some factual foundation, in that real incidents, many quite historical, have been built on and exaggerated through discussion, fuelled by adolescent feelings and in an atmosphere of fear and hostility in the father&#8217;s home from him and his family, to effect a change in residence. </p>

L has refused to take part in family life for some time now, chooses to spend most time in his room, and has spoken covertly to his father outside permitted time.  B has not behaved in the same way. The children are not isolated. There has been no name-calling, threats, bullying, or intimidation.

Not all step parents are benign, and children can be scapegoated.  But in this case it would be inappropriate to accept all I have been told without question and without it being tested. There is nothing inherently incredible in what either the mother or S say. The picture they present is consistent with the picture of an elder boy in particular who has been encouraged by the other parent, whether deliberately or not, both on direct visits and through telephone calls and other contacts, to adopt the worst possible view of his life in Spain, and who does not understand that the parents might be playing out their family conflict through him, nor that the perceived restrictions of contact with his father (a major complaint) might stem from influence, or the extent to which emotional pressures may be being placed on him.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I was urged on behalf of L to consider that he had conducted himself with maturity and to recall that he had been upset. L was very polite and I did note his distress when talking about his perception that he had not had enough time with his father.  He addressed me throughout with real feeling in so far as I can tell. I also observed in court the sense of solidarity with which L and his father conducted themselves, and how when they perceived the mother&#8217;s counsel to be discomfited when I intervened in a dispute between him and L&#8217;s counsel, they looked at each other with pleasure.  Their demeanour and body language was both confident and oppositional to the mother.  The mother in contrast was very sad and subdued. L&#8217;s demeanour in the case was very much the active engaged combatant rather than a frightened sad young person, and certainly did not run counter to the mother&#8217;s case that this father and son pair are mutually presenting a case against her, and even supported it.  If I am not entitled to make these observations about L&#8217;s presentation, they are not the foundation of my conclusions, and I would have come to the same conclusion without them.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The court is mandated to look at the source of a child&#8217;s objections, and if a fear without true foundation has been fuelled by a retaining parent, then it cannot be a bar to return, and  it is not in the child&#8217;s interest for return to be frustrated in reliance on it.  There are features of this case which are consistent with this conclusion.</p>

There is also the argument that wishes as to residence should in any event prevail. In L&#8217;s case that is likely to be a stronger argument than in B&#8217;s. Those matters are however for investigation by the court of habitual residence. </p>

I have previously set out the reasons for which a court may conclude allegations are not objectively true, and may stem from adult influence, as I am directed to do when weighing child&#8217;s objections.  But for the purpose of &#8216;grave risk of harm&#8217; and &#8216;intolerable situation&#8217; I look at protective measures on the basis of treating the factual allegations as true, as Miss Kirby asks me. </p>

The Spanish Court will take undertakings with the utmost seriousness and they will be enforceable.  Pursuant to Article 11 BII R also I must assume this. All the complaints about S are made in a domestic context and as a parental figure. The boys&#8217; situation cannot be regarded as intolerable if undertakings are in place.    That is so, even taking the allegations at the highest, nor do I have to allow fear to stand in the way of return if these fears are unreasonable, and have been encouraged or not dispelled, either under a category of grave risk of harm or objections, the undertakings will protect against them.  A specific undertaking can be given in respect of any weapon.</p>

Neither boy makes any real complaint about physical abuse from their mother save for the one incident, and that she prioritises their stepfather. She and S are now prepared to part in order for the boys to return. L&#8217;s complaint that he and his mother have little in common does not come under any definition of risk of harm.</p>

This case bristles with factual issues which need to be determined in the boys&#8217; interests. Factual allegations as to the behaviour of S and the boys&#8217; lives in Spain, and the family relationships, over 7 years can best be determined there.  Evidence from witnesses there, and from the schools, and so on, will be highly relevant. A determination as to the extent, if any, to which the father and his family have undermined the boy&#8217;s family life will partly depend on evidence from the mother and S, and assessment of the father and his role can easily take place in the Spanish courts. The mother will have a small baby and find it less easy to travel then the father.  The children and parents speak Spanish.</p>

It has been urged on me that the boys should not be separated. In a case of suggested alienation, in which the older child has said to have been an active factor in that his views have been transmitted to a younger child, it is a moot point, and really one for the Spanish court, as to whether children should necessarily remain together. In any event the mother says that the closeness and dependence is a new development. It is easy to see how this would come about after retention and a separation from the established main home and carer.</p>

I have not heard his response and this may be hotly denied. However Spain is the country of habitual residence and jurisdiction and absent prorogation must determine substantive issues for the boys. I note that the boys too would prefer this court to determine any substantive case but that is not a matter for them, or for me. </p>

Although I am sure this is not intended, this shows a misunderstanding of the evaluative role of the court, and of the Spanish authorities. Ms Northcutt has taken what she has been told at face value without considering the mother&#8217;s case as a possibility. She has not subjected what she has been told to any form of critical analysis. I note also that she has not made any like statement about the need for social services assessment of the father in spite of what the mother has said about the father&#8217;s history of drink, domestic abuse, volatility and mental heath problems. Ms Northcutt seems a truly kind and conscientious person, and I must assume that she was also swayed by passionate presentation, instead of the cool, analytical approach directed by the Court of Appeal. </p>
