At this hearing I am ostensibly concerned with an application to adjourn these proceedings.  However, given the nature and complexity of the issues that arise for consideration when determining whether to grant the local authority&#8217;s application to adjourn, in order to permit it to issue a petition in the Inner House of the Court of Session in Scotland for reasons that will become apparent, and whether to grant the further interim relief under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court sought by the local authority pending the determination of that petition, I heard full submissions before announcing my decision at the conclusion of the hearing with reasons to follow.  I now set out those reasons. </p>

There is a risk that placements are continuing where no advice has been sought.  It would be helpful if authoritative guidance was given by the Court, particularly in light of the questionable footnote in the Family Court Practice upon which reliance is likely to have been put.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Within this context, on 4 October 2018 His Honour Judge Butler sitting as a judge of the High Court made an order under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court of England and Wales authorising the deprivation of M&#8217;s liberty in her current Scottish placement.  It is this latter order made by the English court to which the jointly instructed expert makes reference in the extract from his report set out above.  At the hearing on 4 October 2018, HHJ Butler also recorded the local authority&#8217;s intention to apply to the Court of Session in Scotland for an order in Scotland under the <span style="font-style:italic">nobile officium</span>.  However, on 8 November 2018 the local authority received legal advice from its Scottish solicitors to the effect that there is no method by which a child&#8217;s liberty can be lawfully deprived in the jurisdiction of Scotland in a placement that is <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> approved by the Scottish Ministers for the provision of secure accommodation for children, including by way of an order of the English High Court authorising a deprivation of liberty. Highly regrettably, that advice was not brought to the attention of the English court until 23 April 2019, some <span style="font-style:italic">five</span> months later.  On that date, in light of that development and with my agreement, HHJ Butler re-allocated the matter to me to determine the question of whether the interim deprivation of liberty authorisation in respect of M&#8217;s placement in Scotland granted on 4 October 2018 should be further continued in light of the advice received from the Scottish solicitors. </p>

In addition to the questions regarding the approach under Scottish law to the placement of English children in Scotland in placements that are <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> approved by the Scottish Ministers for the provision of secure accommodation raised by the expert opinion, that opinion is also relevant to the merits of the application to adjourn these proceedings in that it informs the question of the chances of the local authority securing relief in Scotland under the <span style="font-style:italic">nobile officium</span>.  Were this court to conclude that the legal position in Scotland is so clear on its face that any application by the local authority to the Inner House of the Court of Session would be bound to fail then there would be little merit in an adjournment and exploration of alternative provision for M in England should commence now. If the court concludes however, that an adjournment is merited on this basis, the expert report also informs the merits of granting further interim relief in this jurisdiction in the form of a declaration concerning M&#8217;s deprivation of liberty pending the outcome of proceedings in Scotland.   </p>

At this time the local authority was satisfied that the grounds for making a secure accommodation order were made out but did not wish to pursue such an application, believing the option of a non-secure residential placement would better meet M&#8217;s needs.  The Children&#8217;s Guardian believed that secure accommodation was necessary for M but, having spoken with staff at the proposed non-secure unit, did not oppose the local authority&#8217;s plan.

As at the date of this hearing she has not tried recently to abscond and has been engaging well with her schooling.

Within this context, Ms Sambrooks considers that &#8216;[the placement]&#8217; is the most appropriate long term placement for M.  Within this context, the local authority&#8217;s final care plan for M provides for her placement at &#8216;[the placement]&#8217; under the auspices of a final care order, with contingency planning involving the identification of alternative placements in England should the placement at &#8216;[the placement]&#8217; not be capable of being sustained.

In the circumstances, all parties are anxious that principled differences of approach that mark the border between the sovereign English and Scottish legal systems should not, if possible, prejudice the continuation on the ground of a placement that is demonstrably benefiting a vulnerable child if a way of reconciling those differences can be found.   </p>

The local authority points in this regard to the limitations on M&#8217;s ability to be on her own at school, on other visits and in the community, the level of two to one supervision that is present both inside and outside the placement, the restrictions on her use of the Internet and the use of physical restraint as a means of protection for M and for others in the event that her behaviour escalates.  The local authority further points to the previous view of this court that M is being deprived of her liberty.

It is not just about the restriction on liberty involved in requiring a reluctant child to remain at school for the school day. It arises in the context of the responsibilities of parents which extend well beyond ensuring the child's attendance at school. So it involves education in the broad sense, similar, I would respectfully suggest, to the general development of the child's physical, intellectual, emotional, social and behavioural abilities, all of which have to be encouraged by responsible parents, as part of his upbringing and education, and for this purpose, an appropriate level of supervision of the child to enhance his development, where necessary, by restricting his liberty is permitted. If less were involved than this, there would be no purpose in including "educational supervision" as an express restriction on the right of a minor to liberty: the recognition of </p>

The purpose of this order, and its implementation by the local authority, is to provide the best available environment to enable K's education, both in the narrow and broad senses, under the degree of supervision and control necessary to avoid harm or injury to himself, and to improve his prospects of avoiding both in the long term as well as the immediate future... </p>

Therefore the restriction in article 5(1)(d) is specifically directed to the situation of those minors who are beyond such normal control. Prosecution and punishment do not invariably present the most efficacious solution to the behavioural problems of children and young persons, and their long term development, whether viewed entirely as a matter of their own self-interest or the general benefit of the community as a whole. There is much to be gained if the underlying causes of the misbehaviour of a child or young person can be examined and addressed. Hence the need to allow restrictions on the liberty of minors with such problems, which goes beyond normal parental control and allows for the educational supervision. The Convention is not an appropriate instrument for spelling out precisely what form this may take or its limits. As Mr Garnham's helpful analysis of the differing procedures adopted in many of the countries adherent to the Convention demonstrates, there are different traditions and regimes for dealing with troublesome as well as the criminal young. All these command respect, and the Convention is not an appropriate instrument for spelling out precisely what form this should take, and which particular regime is acceptable.&#8221; </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.4in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;[21] We would make two further observations about the <span style="font-style:italic">nobile officium</span> at a general level.  First, because of the underlying equitable nature of the jurisdiction, we are of opinion that it is no bar to its application that no precedent exists that is applicable to the precise circumstances of the case.  That conclusion is supported by the fact that the primary use of the jurisdiction is to deal with unforeseen circumstances, which obviously may be unprecedented.  Nevertheless, before the jurisdiction is exercised, the court will normally consider whether there has been an analogous application in the past, and if there has that will support the exercise of the jurisdiction.  If there has been no previous analogous decision, however, that is not decisive: in such a case the court must decide whether injustice and oppression will result if it does nothing, and if that is so there is clearly a good case for the invocation of the jurisdiction. On the applicability of precedent to the <span style="font-style:italic">nobile officium</span>, we should record that we have obtained great assistance from the discussion at pages 241-252 of Professor Stephen Thomson&#8217;s work, <span style="font-style:italic">The Nobile Officium</span>, the first monograph to be published on the subject.&#8221;  </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.4in;text-indent:0in">[22] Secondly, in view of the equitable nature of the <span style="font-style:italic">nobile officium</span>, we are of opinion that it should be used in a practical manner, to address the particular situation that is either unprecedented or has not been adequately foreseen.  Cases of the latter sort can result from the failure of those involved in a particular transaction to foresee what might happen, as with the cy-pr&#232;s jurisdiction, or with the general failure of established law or existing statutes to deal with a particular situation.  In either event, the focus should be on providing a practical and workable solution to the problem that has arisen.&#8221; </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.4in;text-indent:0in">The <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> jurisdiction appears to have had a different origin from the <span style="font-style:italic">nobile officium</span>; the former was technically derived from the Court of Exchequer in Scotland, which in turn derived the jurisdiction from the Crown, whereas the latter is part of the inherent powers of the Court of Session as the supreme civil court in Scotland:  Thomson, op.  cit, at 118121; Law Hospital NHS Trust v Lord Advocate, 1996 SC 301, per LP Hope at 314, Lord Clyde at 324 and Lord Cullen at 328.

		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">[26] At a practical level, the need for a legal mechanism to secure the welfare of children is very obvious, and the parens patriae jurisdiction has developed in parallel in both Scotland and England and Wales to achieve this end.  This is well illustrated by the present proceedings.  The jurisdiction may apply to a wide range of cases, in greatly varied circumstances.  The critical objective is to ensure the welfare of the child concerned, in the particular circumstances which have arisen.  This requires a practical approach, so that procedural niceties are not allowed to stand in the way of the fundamental policy that underlies the jurisdiction.&#8221; </p>

Under that jurisdiction the Court of Session has a duty to safeguard the interests and welfare of any child in Scotland.  In the present cases children have been placed in secure accommodation in Scotland by the High Court in England in order to ensure their welfare, for reasons that are explained at length in the decisions of the High Court and accompanying papers.  In order to make those decisions effective, and thus secure the welfare of the children, it appears to us to be imperative that the Court of Session should make use of the <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> jurisdiction to ensure that the children are properly looked after, in secure accommodation, and to provide proper legal authority to achieve that end.&#8221; </p>

Within this context, having regard to Cobb J&#8217;s view that the terms 'complete' or 'constant' define 'supervision' and 'control' as indicating something like 'total', 'unremitting', 'thorough', and/or 'unqualified' (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re RD (Deprivation or Restriction of Liberty)</span> at [31]), I am satisfied that the regime of supervision, which can be characterised as at least &#8216;thorough&#8217;, if not &#8216;unremitting&#8217;, falls within the concept of continuous supervision or control or, to put it in the terms of the <span style="font-style:italic">Storck </span>criteria, amounts to confinement to a certain limited place for a not negligible period of time.  Further, whilst I accept that M is not locked in the placement, it is the case that, if she attempts to leave, persuasion by staff will be used in an attempt to stop her doing so.

The first question is to be determined by the law of country A (England); the second is one to be determined by the law of country B (Scotland). For an English judge, the content of the law of England (including the English law relating to private international law, the conflict of laws) is a matter of law, to be ascertained in the light of legal argument.

Within this context, whilst it is clear from the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Re X </span>that Sir James Munby anticipated this situation would also be the subject of consideration by the Scottish court in the context of the <span style="font-style:italic">nobile officium</span>, it was not.   </p>

As noted by the Court of Session in <span style="font-style:italic">Cumbria Country Council and Ors, Re Children X, J, L and Y</span> at [2], again in context of orders made under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> when unamended by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2017/16" uk:canonical="2017 c. 16" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children and Social Work Act 2017</ref>: </p>

That raises an obvious conflict, between a child&#8217;s welfare and the child&#8217;s right to personal liberty.  That conflict can be shortly stated, but it is of fundamental importance.  The conflict creates a very obvious dilemma for the institutions in which the children are held:  unless legal authority is given in Scotland for the detention of the children those authorities will be acting illegally if they prevent them from absconding.&#8221; </p>

This court is aware anecdotally, for example, of a number of cases on the North Eastern Circuit in which this issue has arisen.  It is likely that there will be other cases on the Northern Circuit and perhaps elsewhere in England and Wales.  Within this context, it is in the interests of these children that the legal issues set out above are the subject of clarification, whether that be on the basis of confirmation that the <span style="font-style:italic">nobile officium </span>can be engaged in these circumstances or confirmation that it cannot.  Even if the latter is the position, further planning with respect to this constituency of children can then take place in the context of legal certainty.   </p>

In these circumstances, as Mr Inglis rightly surmises in his expert report, this court is anxious to explore any approach which will enables the lawful implementation of its assessment as to what is in M&#8217;s bests interests.  This brings into even sharper focus the merits of permitting an adjournment to allow the local authority to petition the Court of Session with a view to regularising M&#8217;s legal position in Scotland in a placement that is plainly meeting her needs. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.4in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;It was to deal with that situation that the suggestion was made in the English proceedings that the appropriate remedy in Scotland might be a petition to the <span style="font-style:italic">nobile officium</span>.  Sir James Munby P expressed the view that this appeared to be the only way in which the present matters could be taken forward.  He noted that, if such a remedy were not available, the English court would have to consider whether it was appropriate to make any order for the placing of children in secure accommodation in Scotland.  Furthermore, because this area of law is governed by Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights, any deprivation of liberty required to be subject to regular judicial monitoring and review.  That raised a potentially difficult question as to whether in such a case that judicial function should be vested in the English court or the Scottish court, or under some joint arrangement.  In favour of the English court was the fact that it was the court responsible for the existing proceedings; in favour of the Scottish court was the fact that it was the court that would have to be responsible for enforcing the secure accommodation orders, if need be by the use of coercion.&#8221; </p>

It is plain from the judgment of Sir James Munby in <span style="font-style:italic">Re X </span>that the <span style="font-style:italic">English</span> High Court has jurisdiction to make orders under the inherent jurisdiction authorising the deprivation of M&#8217;s liberty in her current placement, the outstanding question being whether the <span style="font-style:italic">Scottish</span> court will be willing to find and declare that the measures ordered by the High Court in respect of M should be recognised and enforceable in Scotland as if they had been made by the Court of Session by application of the <span style="font-style:italic">nobile officium</span>.
