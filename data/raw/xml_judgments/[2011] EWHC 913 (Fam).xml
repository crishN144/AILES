	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:13pt">Mr Laurence Bothwell, who presents the wife&#8217;s case, is a deep thinker on legal matters.  At one point during courteous submissions ranging widely over current legislation and historic authorities, he observed that if his main argument did not succeed, the resulting situation would be </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:13pt">"a big mess, a fiasco"</span><span style="font-size:13pt">.  He is right.  The events in this case are a financial disaster for a divorced couple and their child.  On separation in 2006, they might with good sense and co-operation have just about stretched their modest means to meet their overall housing needs.  Instead, by 2011, a combination of dissension, misfortune, improvidence, and over-lengthy litigation in three courts, has wiped them out financially and they will now lose their only significant asset, the home occupied by the wife and child.  After five years, almost nothing remains of assets once valued at &#163;300,000.  A family that had difficulty supporting itself as a single unit cannot afford to dissipate limited assets in litigation, and certainly cannot support the professional expenses of lawyers and accountants over a period of years.</span></p>

Here, the liabilities virtually extinguish the assets and there is no prospect of postponement of the legal aid charge.  The parties made unnecessary applications and failed to make necessary ones.  Procedurally, the overriding objective in the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 and the Family Procedure Rules 2010 has been soundly defeated.  The case has not been dealt with expeditiously, and both the costs incurred and the court time spent have been wholly disproportionate to the issues involved.  With the passage of time, the result has been to eliminate the possibility of any solution that is even minimally satisfactory.</span></p>

But even if those applications succeeded, they would not in themselves be enough.  For the wife&#8217;s housing situation to be salvaged, she would also need the court to deprive the husband's creditors of some or all of the sums due to them, and to disallow the fees and expenses incurred in the past three years by the trustee in bankruptcy.</span></p>

An application to annul or suspend the bankruptcy order might possibly have succeeded if it had been brought promptly and on proper grounds three years ago, but it is now far too late, and even if the bankruptcy were annulled there is no proper basis upon which the trustee&#8217;s fees could now be disallowed.  As to the appeal against the order in the divorce proceedings, there was no error in the district judge&#8217;s approach at the time, and subsequent events provide no grounds for interfering.</span></p>

There is no equivalent provision in the case of a debtor's petition, even though third parties may be affected as profoundly as the debtor himself.  On the other hand, there is nothing to prevent the court taking bespoke measures to meet the needs of individual cases.</span></p>

A positive reply should alert the court to the likelihood that a spouse or partner may have a legitimate interest in the outcome of the petition.  I propose that the bankruptcy court should employ a simple expedient in cases where it is apparent that divorce proceedings are ongoing.  When faced with such a petition, and particularly the petition of a debtor who is not being pressed for payment, the court should consider whether to adjourn for a short time to allow notice to be given to a spouse or partner who may be affected.  They may be in a good position to say whether the debtor is in fact insolvent or, if he is, to make proposals for debts to be cleared without the need for bankruptcy and all it entails.  </span></p>

In 2002 they moved into a house that had been bought by the husband in 1988, long before he met the wife.  It was in his sole name and unencumbered, the mortgage having been paid off in the 1990s with some redundancy money.  During the marriage, the husband worked as a therapist from a room in the home, but his ability to do this was affected following a conviction for common assault on the wife in 2005.  She did not work, and by that time they were both dependent on state benefits.  </span></p>

In October 2006, the wife obtained a freezing order over the husband's assets and in November 2006 she obtained an occupation order, at which point the husband left the home and went to live with his parents.  In December 2006, he proposed that the house be sold and that most of the equity be allocated to the wife for the purchase of a 2-bedroom flat, leaving him with the balance of the proceeds of sale.  This was rejected.  In February 2007 the freezing injunction was varied and continued until the conclusion of the proceedings.  A final hearing of the divorce financial proceedings was duly listed for October 2007, but then adjourned by the court.  </span></p>

He says that he squandered the money, amounting to over one-fifth of the family&#8217;s means.  The wife has suggested that he has other assets, perhaps representing unspent borrowings, but despite the normal process of discovery by questionnaire in the divorce proceedings, no evidence of this has been found.  The creditors, who are some eleven financial institutions, were all unsecured.</span></p>

In his statement of affairs the husband said he was on incapacity benefit and in the middle of divorce proceedings, although he did not mention the freezing order or the occupation order.  He declared assets approaching &#163;300,000, being the family home, by then valued at &#163;279,000, and a share trading account containing &#163;18,000.  He had an occupational pension with a CETV of &#163;57,000.  His debts totalled &#163;66,300.  Accordingly, the available assets in his name amounted to some &#163;230,000.  He was clearly not balance-sheet insolvent and the question was whether he was commercially insolvent.  By its decision, the court accepted that he was. </span></p>

Instead, in September 2008, the wife's solicitor sought an order from the divorce court requiring the trustee to disclose information and documents relating to the estate, which were duly produced.  It was not until September 2009, 18 months after learning of the bankruptcy, that the wife, by then acting in person, issued her application for annulment.  Her explanation for the delay is that she could not afford the costs of making the application to annul, modest though they are.</span></p>

The husband was unrepresented and the wife was represented by counsel.  She explicitly accepted that the home had to be sold, and was at the time co-operating with the marketing of the property, for which an offer of &#163;270,000 had been received.  By then the amount required to discharge the bankruptcy was some &#163;132,000, having grown to twice the amount of the original debts in a year.  The wife also had a debt to the Legal Services Commission for her publicly funded costs, which could have been postponed if the proceeds of the proceedings were used to rehouse herself and the child.  </span></p>

He found that neither party had much of an earning capacity.  He concluded that a clean break order was appropriate.  He ordered that the wife was to receive a lump sum equal to the entire surplus after the bankruptcy debt and costs was cleared.  She was also awarded the husband's remaining capital of &#163;18,000.  The husband had asked to keep this as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:13pt">"a crumb",</span><span style="font-size:13pt"> but the judge considered that he was in effect the author of his own misfortune.</span></p>

He notionally attributed the debts and the costs of the trustee to the husband, and deliberately left him with nothing except his modest pension.</span></p>

The prospective purchasers dropped their offer from &#163;270,000 to &#163;250,000.  At that point the wife, who firmly believed that the property was worth &#163;300,000, withdrew instructions from her solicitor and stopped co-operating with the sale process.  In December 2008, the trustee asked her to sign a notice relinquishing her home rights so that the sale could go through.  He urged her to co-operate and warned of the serious consequences in terms of costs and dissipation of the estate.  When this warning failed, he made an application to the bankruptcy court for an order for possession.  This was adjourned from time to time, and on at least one occasion (March 2009) the registrar urged the wife to get legal advice, saying that the creditors would have to be paid.</span></p>

Her arguments were that the order did not meet her needs and those of the child, whose welfare she believed should be paramount.  The husband had deliberately declared himself bankrupt to defeat the child's right to a home.  The trustee was unjustifiably reducing the price of the property.  Her previous solicitors had not advised her properly.  The bankruptcy order was not legal because of the freezing injunction.  </span></p>

The triple pre-existence of the divorce proceedings, the freezing order and the occupation order (expressed to last until further order) before the making of the bankruptcy order, meant that, in giving priority to the creditors and the trustee&#8217;s fees, the district judge acted without jurisdiction.  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/336" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.336</ref> does not distinguish between proprietary and non-proprietary rights and must be read at face value.

All the costs since March 2008 have been unnecessary and should not be recovered.  Serious questions arise for the trustee, who should have realised the strength of the wife's position, and should accordingly have restrained his activities.  Instead, Mr Bothwell charges the trustee (in persuading the divorce court to make its order instead of applying to the bankruptcy court) with keeping this particular bankruptcy well away from the eyes of the judges in the bankruptcy court and Chancery Division.  In so doing, the trustee has fallen foul of the rule in </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:13pt">ex parte James (Re Condon, ex p.

It has been the contention of [counsel for the husband] that the judge's ultimate annulment order enabled the wife to "steal a march" on the judgment creditors. As it happens, the wife seems to have issued her proceedings against the husband long before they did. Indeed, although I accept that in proceedings for ancillary relief a court will strive to quantify its award to a wife upon a basis which will enable the husband to meet all his liabilities as well, of course, as to maintain himself, it by no means follows, particularly where money is in short supply, that, whether in the context of capital or in that of income provision, the interests of the husband's other creditors always take precedence over those of the wife: see for example the decision of this court in </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:13pt">Mullard v Mullard</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:13pt"> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1982] 3 FLR 330" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1982">[1982] 3 FLR 330</ref>, per Balcombe J (as he then was), at 332H.

In the present case the existence of the creditors, who seem to have been owed sums totalling apparently less than the value of the house near Perpignan ultimately awarded to the husband, was certainly not a trump card precluding annulment; and in my view survey of the wider circumstances plainly generates a conclusion that the judge's ultimate approach to the exercise of his discretion was correct. </span></p>

However, she had not followed normal procedures to regularise the position and then ignored advice to take immediate steps to have the bankruptcy annulled.  Her application was not made until some 18 months later and the district judge, in annulling the bankruptcy, ordered the petitioning creditor, the local authority, to pay the trustee&#8217;s costs and expenses of some &#163;23,000 on the basis that it had been unreasonable to take bankruptcy proceedings in respect of such a small debt.

The intention behind the subsection is to ensure that, where a wife's home rights are concerned, a trustee in bankruptcy is in no better short-term position than a husband had been.  The rights endure until they are brought to an end by an order of the court, whether in the divorce proceedings or by an order in the bankruptcy proceedings under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/335" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.335</ref>A or <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/336/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.336(2)</ref>(b).  The existence of such rights does not make the property onerous.  Nor does the section give a person in the position of the wife the right to remain in the property in perpetuity regardless of anyone else's interests, indeed such an interpretation would bring about absurd results.  </span></p>

I do not accept the claim that the district judge did not give first consideration to the child's position, and it is of course not the case that his welfare is to be regarded as paramount in this context.  The district judge took the husband's behaviour into account by way of an "add-back" of the lost amounts against his entitlement.  The bankruptcy was not illegal, despite the freezing injunction.

It is said that the district judge proceeded on the assumption that no challenge to the bankruptcy was possible.  This statement is in my view unfounded.  To start with, the wife herself was not challenging the bankruptcy order.  On the contrary, she appeared to be accepting it and, like the court, to be working around it.  Moreover, as the district judge had no power to disturb the bankruptcy, any challenge would have to be made in the bankruptcy court, with the result that the financial application in the divorce, now ready for hearing, would have had to be adjourned again.  Given the fact that the assets were already wafer-thin and the debts a reality, the district judge cannot be criticised for failing to adjourn the proceedings on his own initiative to allow the wife to make an application to annul.  Even if the issue had been raised, it would quite probably have been wrong to adjourn a case that had been on foot for two years to allow the application to be made.  The consequences of such an adjournment can be clearly seen in the escalation of costs that has in fact resulted from the further litigation brought by the wife.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:13pt">I now turn to Mr Bothwell's remaining arguments.  He says that, since the effect of the district judge's order was to deprive the wife of occupation of the home, he should have applied the checklist of factors mentioned in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/336/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.336(4)</ref>, which applies when an order for possession is being sought in the bankruptcy court.  I do not accept this argument.  The trustee had no reason to apply for an order at that stage, because at the time of the hearing the wife was agreeing to a sale.  In any event, under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/336/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.336(5)</ref> the interests of creditors will outweigh all other considerations once the trustee has been in post for more than a year, unless the circumstances are exceptional, which they are not.  It is therefore difficult to see what assistance the wife could have gained from <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/336" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.336</ref>.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:13pt">Mr Bothwell then says that the district judge did not take into account all relevant factors under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.25</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>.  Again, I do not agree.  His judgment shows a sensible and pragmatic balancing of the information before him.  He was aware that the residual assets were scarcely sufficient to rehouse the wife and child, and his order has to be seen in the context of the acutely limited solutions that were by then available.  Although the husband had squandered a significant proportion of the capital, he was the source of that capital.  The real problem facing the district judge lay in the escalating bankruptcy fees, which should have been confronted head-on at a much earlier stage.  </span></p>
