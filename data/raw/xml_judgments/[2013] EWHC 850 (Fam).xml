	    <p style="text-align:justify">This judgment is being handed down in private on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2013. It consists of 43 pages and has been signed and dated by the judge.  The judge hereby gives leave for it to be reported.</p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"> The judgment is being distributed on the strict understanding that in any report no person other than the advocates or the solicitors instructing them (and other persons identified by name in the judgment itself) may be identified by name or location and that in particular the anonymity of the children and the adult members of their family must be strictly preserved.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Habitual residence is a question of fact to be determined by the trial judge. He or she should normally stand back from the evidence and take a general view rather than conducting a microscopic search. An appreciable period of time and a settled intention will be necessary to enable a person to become habitually resident in country B as opposed to country A. </p>

Bringing possessions, doing everything to establish residence before coming, having a right of abode, seeking to bring family, durable ties with the country of residence or intended residence and many other factors have to be taken into account. Habitual residence may be acquired despite the fact that the move may only have been temporary or on a trial basis. A month has been held to be &#8216;an appreciable period of time&#8217; though that has been described as &#8216;the high water mark&#8217; in a case where the Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge&#8217;s finding that six weeks was sufficient to result in the acquisition of a new habitual residence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The defence to the application prepared in advance of the hearing on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March is essentially this &#8211; that it had always been the parties&#8217; intention to live in Canada but there was an agreement that &#8220;if one of them was unsettled or did not feel it was working, they would return to the UK with the children.&#8221; It is also suggested that in circumstances where the parties retained a property in England and had separated less than three months after the move to Canada, the children&#8217;s habitual residence remains in England. Thus, it is argued, there has been no abduction.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his written argument, Mr Rosenblatt contends that the family never became settled in Canada because although it had been their intention to settle that was never achieved. He asserts that the mother&#8217;s motivation to settle was not to be with the father but with the new man in her life; and that I would find it very hard to conclude there was an intention from the beginning to settle permanently in Canada and thus to establish habitual residence there.</p>

Mr Rosenblatt argues that the words speak for themselves. He also submits I should exercise great caution in attaching importance to the extant documentary material relied upon by Miss Chaudhry.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In arriving at a decision I consider the totality of the evidence so as to take a general view. Having done so there really can be no other conclusion but that these two children were indeed habitually resident in Canada at the time of their removal to this country on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February. On any objective analysis of what has happened in the life of this family taken together with the supportive documentary evidence provided by the mother any other result would be simply perverse. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The case advanced by and on behalf of Mr T, even at its highest, does not begin to establish that the children&#8217;s habitual residence remained in the UK; and I agree with Miss Chaudhry when she suggests it is &#8216;unarguable&#8217; that the children had indeed acquired habitual residence in Canada by the time of the father&#8217;s unilateral and clandestine decision to remove them in mid February.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If she will permit me to say so, Miss Chaudhry&#8217;s Skeleton Argument is quite excellent. It contains not only a concise and very useful summary of the law and key facts but also an impressive, cross referenced analysis of the evidence. I was wrong yesterday to challenge her use of the word &#8216;unarguable&#8217; for which I apologise. It is, to use another word, indisputable that the children had acquired habitual residence in Canada.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Over a period of several years, the parents had successfully engaged in a process of applying for permanent residency in Canada. Thus, emigration has to be viewed as their combined and agreed long term plan. Extracts from the inter-party text messages reveal that the mother&#8217;s motivation, at least in part, was so that the girls should have dual nationality and be raised and educated in Canada. It must be fair to assume that the father shared those ambitions at the time he relocated from England believing the family and especially the children would have a better quality of life in Canada.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties&#8217; intentions as to settlement in Canada have aroused the greatest controversy because of the father&#8217;s suggestion they had agreed that if either of them felt unsettled or felt it was not working then they could return with the children. The mother rejects that assertion and makes the entirely valid point that in none of the communications passing between them in the period leading up to the children&#8217;s removal or subsequently was there any mention whatever of such an agreement. It is only within these proceedings, says Mrs T that the father has sought to suggest some form of pre-existing agreement of relevance to the habitual residence question.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A number of proper inferences may be drawn from those exchanges it seems to me. First, that by the time the messages were sent, the parents were wrestling with the likely consequences of their relationship breakdown and had very different ambitions as to the country in which they and the children should be living. The father, self evidently, wanted to go &#8216;home&#8217; to England and would seem to have been utilising a variety of strategies to secure his aims. He was literally pleading with and pressing the mother to agree to return to England, appealing to her better nature, making any number of promises to her as to the advantages of so doing as well as threatening legal action if his ambitions were thwarted. How real those promises and / or threats were remains to be seen but they exemplify the strength of the father&#8217;s desire to return to England with the children. He was trying every ruse at his disposal to secure his goal.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Is there any support for the notion of a pre-existing agreement so heavily relied upon by Mr T? The answer to that question is that there is none &#8211; no vestige of any suggestion from the father&#8217;s messages that a return to England should occur because of some earlier agreement. If there had been such a consensus it may have had some, perhaps limited, relevance to the habitual residence question considered alongside everything else drawn from the evidence. In that regard, it is worth reiterating that habitual residence may be acquired despite the fact that a move may only have been temporary or on a trial basis. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My message for him is that in a situation of the kind he faced earlier this year parents always have choices. There is a right way to resolve differences about how, where and with whom children should be raised and there is a wrong way. Mr T chose to take the law into his own hands by unilaterally removing the children from Canada and from their mother. He had no right to take the decision to bring the children here. In so doing he has caused the mother immense distress and enormous anxiety as surely he must have known he would. There will have been a considerable emotional cost as well for the children who have never before been away from their mother for such a protracted period. The sooner he is able to see the harm he has done and to express real remorse for his actions, the better will be the prospects of rebuilding trust between himself and the mother. Unless he embarks upon that exercise very soon, the chances for him of continuing his warm and loving relationship with the children almost certainly will suffer. </p>
