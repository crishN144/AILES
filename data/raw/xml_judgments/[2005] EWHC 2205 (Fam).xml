The American father and the Irish mother married in California in 1994. Their only child, S, was born in the same year and is now 9. Until December 1998 the family home was in California, but in that month the mother kept S in Ireland after the end of an agreed holiday there. The father instituted Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction 1980 (Hague Convention) proceedings in Dublin and in July 1999 a consent order for the child's return to California was made. It was envisaged that mother and child would both arrive there in time for a hearing before the California courts later that month, but the mother did not appear at court and took no further part in the proceedings, with the result that in October 1999 that court made an interim custody order in the father's favour. What had apparently happened was that shortly after her and the child's return to the USA the mother re-abducted the child in the same month of July 1999, but this time made her way to England. There she assumed names for herself and the child in order to escape detection, which indeed she did until they were traced to Liverpool more than 4 years later. Prior to the first hearing before me on 17 October, S had been removed from her mother on 15 October and placed in foster care provided through the LA pursuant to a police protection order. </span></p>

The American father and the Irish mother (to whom I shall refer as F and M) married in California in 1994. Their only child, S, was born in the same year and is 10&#160;today. Until December&#160;1998 the family home was in California, but in that month M kept S in Ireland after the end of an agreed holiday there. F&#160;instituted Hague Convention proceedings in Dublin and in July&#160;1999 a consent order for the child&#8217;s return to California was made.

M and S were seen by a Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS) officer at their home on 19&#160;November&#160;2003 pursuant to a direction I had made for a report to be prepared dealing, in particular, with S&#8217;s maturity and any objections to her return to the USA within the terms and meaning of Art&#160;13 of the Hague Convention, and the officer&#8217;s observations concerning her degree of settlement in relation to Art&#160;12. The CAFCASS officer arranged for contact to take place, observed and supervised by her, on 24&#160;November&#160;2003. That contact seemed to go encouragingly well. Sadly the same cannot be said of the next attempt at direct contact which took place on 20&#160;December, when M was to be present throughout. Whatever the reasons for whatever took place (and both are highly contentious) this was in the result a disaster, although (once it becomes clearer to the parties whether or not S is to return to the USA) a setback which may hopefully be surmountable. There has only been indirect contact since then. No clear picture emerges, on the written evidence before me, to establish the true reasons for or the extent of the child&#8217;s distress arising from that incident</span></p>

The concealment involved assuming new identities for both M and S which included, in the case of the child, elaborate and planned arrangements for her to take over the birth date as well as the name of a child who had died. In terms, therefore, of the degree of parental determination displayed to follow through the abduction and to sever the child&#8217;s relationship with her father, this case is at the extreme end of the range</span></p>

For these purposes she had to tell S that she was now going to be known by a new name and that her birthday would be altered. At the same time M changed her name by Deed Poll so that her surname coincided with that of the dead child. </span></p>

I am unconvinced by this. There was no satisfactory explanation given to me about what she must have said to S to justify the dramatic steps that were taken to alter her identity. It seems to me that S must have been told that it was being done to prevent her father from discovering her whereabouts. I have reached the conclusion that to a greater or lesser extent, either expressly or tacitly, F must have been demonised in the mind of S by M. </span></p>

It is clear that she and S travelled to Ireland initially on return tickets with F&#8217;s consent. Why she did not return is a matter of controversy but the fact is that upon proceedings being commenced under the Hague Convention M consented to return and an order recording such consent was made by McGuinness J on 18 July 1999. M and S did return to California but a few days later M re-absconded. The reason given to me was that M could not afford the lawyer&#8217;s fees quoted to her for the purposes of the custody proceedings that had been initiated by F.  That seems to me to be no justification at all for then disappearing off the face of the earth and depriving F of the society of his daughter; and, equally importantly, depriving S of one of the two most vital relationships in her life. </span></p>

F adamantly maintains that this was an unjust conviction. He was offered a plea bargain whereby he would plead &#8220;no contest&#8221; to the charges in exchange for which he would suffer only a minor penalty. He adamantly refused this and the jury convicted him. His subsequent attempt to annul the conviction on the ground of the withholding by the police of evidence that would have exculpated him failed. It appears from documentary evidence that Judge Doyle, who presided over the trial, was doubtful about the safety of the conviction since he was instrumental in obtaining work for F thereafter in a school (where by all accounts H performed admirably). It is fair to say that neither M nor the Guardian in this case have relied on this conviction at all in justification of a limitation on F&#8217;s contact to S.</span></p>

There is no justification for it whatsoever. That said, it is plain that during the period of concealment M has bought up S to be a dutiful, respectful, indeed model, child. She has performed excellently at school and is a devout member of the local Roman Catholic community. She made her First Holy Communion at the parish church two years ago and has recently moved from the Catholic primary school to the secondary school. F is also Catholic and it is painful for me to observe that he has been deprived of the opportunity of participating in his daughter&#8217;s religious upbringing or in any of the important milestones of that faith. </span></p>

The legal questions were, first, whether the notion of &#8220;settlement&#8221; encompassed in addition to physical settlement an emotional and psychological component; and second, whether, in the event that the court found settlement to be established, whether there was retained by the court within those proceedings a residual discretion to order a return. These issues had given rise to a host of often contradictory jurisprudence from jurisdictions all over the planet. Those questions were answered by Singer J on 28 May 2004, in an immensely learned judgment, respectively no and no. By this stage seven months had passed since the discovery. Singer J wished to give directions for a speedy resolution of issues of residence and contact but they were side-lined by F&#8217;s decision to appeal.

On 3 November 2004 Kirkwood J held that S was &#8220;settled&#8221; here (in both senses of the word) and that he would not exercise his discretion to return. He gave directions for the questions of residence and contact to be tried, thereby returning the case to exactly the position it was in May 2004 when Singer J gave his judgment. Unfortunately the 4 day fixture scheduled for June 2005 was aborted for reasons nothing to do with the parties and so it has taken almost a whole year since the decision of Kirkwood J for the matter to be determined. </span></p>

He may feel wronged but it is hardly likely to help his cause if he turns his grievances into a crusade. I consider his recent appearance on an Irish television chat-show, when he stated that S had told him that she had been told that he was dead to be an example where he has crossed the boundary from legitimate rhetoric into untruthfulness, and this untruthfulness was, I am sorry to say, aggravated by his explanation in the witness box. He made other untrue statements in the interview. His comments about his perception if the failings of the English family justice system and his membership of fathers4justice (in which he was heavily encouraged by the interviewer) were within his perfect right to state (even if I happen not to agree with him), but I wonder if he had S&#8217;s best interests in the forefront of his mind when he uttered them. </span></p>

F accepted in his evidence that were S to write me a further letter she would unquestionably state that she wanted to continue living at her home with M. At 11&#189;  her views are deserving of very great weight. After all in year&#8217;s time (when F wants to remove her to live with him in California) she will be arguably Gillick competent. It is obvious that she has the necessary maturity to have an almost decisive voice as to where she should live both at that point, and, I believe, now.</span></p>

	      <p class="WorkNMnumbers" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:12pt">Unfortunately on the morning of Friday 14 October 2005, when I was expecting to receive Counsel&#8217;s speeches, I was informed that F had changed his position and that he now wished to pursue his application for an immediate residence order and an order that he be given leave to remove S to the USA in precisely two days&#8217; time. He re-entered the witness box to give me reasons for this volte-face. I have to confess that I failed fully to understand them. Essentially he says that he believes that the expression of wishes by S that she wishes to remain living at her home with M are not genuine (while at the same time stating that her wishes to have unsupervised contact with him are genuine). The proposal is obviously untenable and I believe that in his heart he knows that. It is a pity that he should have undermined his reasonable and measured approach of the previous day. I have concluded that this was an incident of emotion overwhelming reason when by and large the latter has been F&#8217;s dominant faculty. It was a piece of soap-box oratory. I very much hope that F will try to exercise more self-control particularly when he enjoying unsupervised contact with S. I think F is bound up in the drama of this case. I sincerely hope that following the delivery of this judgment there will be closure and that both parents can now calmly focus on facilitating the major role that F should play in S&#8217;s life. After all, he has so much to offer her.  </span></p>

I have full jurisdiction to deal with this matter by virtue of S&#8217;s habitual residence here (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s2</ref> and 3 <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref>). That she was unlawfully abducted here does not affect the proposition once the 12 month period has passed and a finding of settlement has been made under Article 12(2).

The habitual residence of the child is the basis for jurisdiction to be found in the Hague Convention for the Protection of Children 1996. I would hope that once the Californian court and criminal prosecutors have read this judgment they would take whatever steps are necessary to discontinue the custody proceedings and to discharge the warrant.</span></p>

Among them is the importance of recognising the vital role of the press in seeking to identify and locate abducted children. For that we must be very grateful. Another is the importance of recognising, when a child has been located after a prolonged disappearance, that it may be futile to seek to wrench her out of her rooted environment. Of course, all cases will turn on their own facts and generalisations are dangerous. But it seems to me that the first step should always to seek to achieve the most expeditious re-establishment of a meaningful relationship between the child and the wronged left-behind parent.</span></p>
