I referred to the significant number of cases in which the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (&#8220;the HFEA&#8221;) had identified &#8220;anomalies&#8221;. I have now given final judgment in twelve cases (Cases A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, M and N). This is Case L. Case K, which was before me in July 2016, has been adjourned part heard for further argument. I have since heard argument and reserved judgment in another case (Case O). Six further cases (Cases P, Q, R, S, T and U) are currently awaiting final hearing. There is at least one other (Case V) pending. There are probably others, for the HFEA has identified no fewer than 90 cases where there are &#8220;anomalies&#8221;.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The applicant, who I will refer to as X, is a woman who was at all material times until the events I describe below in a relationship with the first respondent, a woman who I will refer to as Y. Each wanted to bear a child, using the same sperm donor. Y gave birth to their first child, who I will refer to as C1. C1 had been conceived before <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref> came into force, so X could not, as a matter of law, be C1&#8217;s parent. Accordingly, Y alone was registered as C1&#8217;s parent and Y&#8217;s name alone appears on C1&#8217;s birth certificate. Following IUI treatment provided by St Bartholomew&#8217;s Hospital Centre for Reproductive Medicine, operated by Barts Health NHS Trust, which I shall refer to as Barts, a clinic which is and was regulated by the HFEA, X gave birth to their second child, who I will refer to as C2, a couple of years later. It will be appreciated that C1 and C2 are half-siblings. No issue arises in relation to C1; the issues (see below) arise in relation to C2. X seeks, together with other relief, a declaration pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/55" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 55</ref>A of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref> that Y is <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>the legal parent of C2.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The clinic, the HFEA, the Secretary of State for Health and the Attorney General have all been notified of the proceedings. With the exception of the clinic, which was represented, although not joined, none has sought either to be joined or to attend the hearing. The clinic&#8217;s position is set out in a witness statement by the individual who is the &#8220;person responsible&#8221; within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37/section/17/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 17(1)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1990 Act</ref> and in the position statement prepared by Ms Dorothea Gartland and adopted by Mr Hassan Khan who appeared before me on its behalf. Given the nature of one of the issues (see below) I decided that C2 needed to be joined and a guardian appointed. Where a child&#8217;s parentage is challenged, the child must be joined as a party: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re L (Family Proceedings Court) (Appeal: Jurisdiction) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2003/1682" uk:canonical="[2003] EWHC 1682 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] EWHC 1682 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 FLR 210" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 FLR 210</ref>.

	  <num>13.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The first relates to the fact that, by the time they were contacted by the clinic, X and Y&#8217;s relationship was breaking down. They separated shortly afterwards. Y has subsequently married another woman and given birth to their child. That child has no biological relationship with C2 but is C1&#8217;s half-sibling. Private law proceedings between X and Y were amicably settled, without any order of the court, when, following mediation, they agreed a parenting plan in respect of both C1 and C2. A pattern of shared care was agreed, which the guardian reports is, in general, working well. I do not propose to go into the details, except to note that the arrangements mean that C1 and C2 spend most of their time together being cared for by one or other of the adults. As the guardian puts it, effectively C1 and C2 have two homes. The sibling relationship is strong. The guardian reports C2 as being &#8220;confident and secure about &#8230; family relationships.&#8221; </p>

	  <num>14.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">More importantly for present purposes, a key component of the parenting plan was that there should be equivalence between X and Y and C1 and C2 in relation to the children&#8217;s legal status. Accordingly, X and Y agreed that neither would be the legal parent of, or have parental responsibility for, the other&#8217;s biological child. As X put it in her witness statement, &#8220;It was very important for me that the children should have the same legal status.&#8221; In her witness statement, having referred to the parenting plan, Y said &#8220;I am not seeking legal parenthood for [C2] and do not therefore oppose [X]&#8217;s application for Non Parentage.&#8221; Hence, the fact that, as I have already mentioned, Y does not oppose X&#8217;s application for a declaration that Y is <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>a parent of C2. (It will be appreciated that in the circumstances set out in paragraph 6 above there is no need for Y to seek any corresponding remedy in relation to C1.) </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second point of difference in this case is that, almost serendipitously, as it might be thought, there is in fact no basis upon which X and Y could escape from the clinic&#8217;s blunders as summarised in paragraph 11 above, even if they wanted to. The Barts records as disclosed have been examined very carefully, in particular by the guardian and her counsel, and everyone is agreed that (i) there is no PP, (ii) the IC signed by X contains neither Y&#8217;s name nor her signature, (iii) there is, in contrast to the circumstances in Case A, Case F and Case H, no entry in the <span style="font-style:italic">Treatment Checklist </span>showing signature of a Form PP, and (iv) there is nothing else in the Barts records which even arguably makes good the fundamental deficiency, the absence of a signed Form PP. </p>

I am conscious that this might be thought a self-serving absence of recollection, given the terms of the parenting plan, but such an unworthy thought must, in my judgment, be dismissed. There is, I am satisfied, nothing in their evidence which begins to suggest that X and Y are being anything other than completely frank with the court; no-one has sought to challenge their evidence on this point; and, in particular, it has not been challenged by the guardian, whose careful, detailed and thoughtful report shows how scrupulously she has investigated this most unusual case. Her position, as articulated by Mr Geekie and Ms Segal in their skeleton argument, is that &#8220;despite the intention at the time, the guardian considers that the requirements of legal parentage pursuant to [<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref>] cannot be satisfied, in respect of [Y], in this case.&#8221; I agree.</p>

I fully understand this is not the intention but wondered what [C2] might make of this in later life, for on the surface it appears to be a statement that a fundamental relationship does not exist, or at least not exist in the manner in which [C2] had believed. I also wondered about how it was possible to divest someone of a title they never had as, accidentally, [Y] has never had parenthood for [C2] although the birth certificate indicates otherwise. </p>

The Declaration sought is far more about the parental relationship and is not a comment on the parent-child relationship &#8211; both parents considering that [C2] will not be adversely affected. [C2] is unaware of any court proceedings, either current or in the past, and is described as having a secure relationship with both &#8230; parents and with [C1]. [C2] has been largely sheltered from the parental difficulties. [X] agreed that it could be perceived as quite a stark statement and accepted that a preferable course of action would be to simply amend the birth certificate such to record that she was the only named parent, and the only one with parental responsibility. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Asked the same question, [Y] agreed that taken out of context, it could be perceived as quite an act of distancing herself from [C2]. However, she considers that both children are very secure in their relationships, their identities and their place in the family. They know they are very much loved by both women &#8220;and they know whose tummies they came out of&#8221;. [C2] would never have cause to question the relationship &#8211; her behaviour would never be interpreted as rejecting. She, too, would prefer a simple amendment of the birth certificate for she can see that [C2] may question why there are two parents on [the] birth certificate and only one parent on [C1]&#8217;s. Even if she did have parenthood for [C2], [Y] is clear that she would never seek to exercise PR at the expense of [C2]&#8217;s mother. </p>

If the court could find a means of simply amending the birth certificate, both would find that a more attractive remedy. Both were equally clear that no changes were envisaged to the current arrangements for the care of the children and I have no reason to doubt this.</p>

[Y] and [X] are very focussed on the needs of both their children &#8230; They have found a means to share the care of their children which appears to be an arrangement that has worked well for sixteen months. This is unusual in that neither now seeks parental responsibility for the other&#8217;s child, although I am aware that [X] wanted this and continues to do so. Notwithstanding her preference, she accepts that [Y] will not agree to share parental responsibility for [C1] and this is unlikely to change. The issue of parental responsibility does not appear to affect what happens day to day. I can identify no reason for the court to further scrutinise, or interfere with, an arrangement that works well.&#8221;</p>

So a child needs to know, where parentage is in issue, whether P is <span style="font-style:italic">or is not</span> a parent.

And nothing in the guardian&#8217;s careful and sensitive analysis of C2&#8217;s welfare points in the other direction. In principle, as I have said, X is entitled to the declaration she seeks, namely that Y is not C2&#8217;s parent. As Ms Fottrell and Mr Wilson put it, &#8220;the legal and factual reality should coincide.&#8221; If I make no order, C2 is, they say, left in a legal limbo. Ms Morgan and Ms Sprinz submit that this accords with a child welfare analysis, on the basis that it provides C2 and C1 with equivalent legal status in relation to X and Y. Mr Geekie and Ms Segal submit on behalf of the guardian that there must be certainty about C2&#8217;s parentage. I agree. As the guardian points out in a passage in her report which I have already set out, if in fact, and in law, Y is not C2&#8217;s parent, but her name remains on the birth certificate, this will produce possible ambiguity and confusion.  </p>

That is not desirable from C2&#8217;s point of view, whether now or in future, exposing C2, as it would, to the curiosity and comment of those to whom the birth certificate might in future have to be produced: cf the comments of King LJ in an analogous situation arising under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/1-2/20/section/13/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 13(1)</ref>(b) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/1-2/20" uk:canonical="1953 (1 &amp; 2 Eliz. 2) c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1953 Act</ref> in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C Children) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2016/374" uk:canonical="[2016] EWCA Civ 374" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWCA Civ 374</ref>, para 34 (the case where a mother wished to register her child&#8217;s names as &#8220;Cyanide&#8221; and &#8220;Preacher&#8221;).</p>

It might also, Ms Fottrell and Mr Wilson suggest, confuse a reader rather than clarify C2&#8217;s legal status. Mr Geekie and Ms Segal put the point very pithily, when they refer to the guardian&#8217;s wish to achieve &#8220;clarity &#8230; by the most unobtrusive means.&#8221;</p>
