She attends the MCC, a specialist residential college for young learning-disabled people.  Dr Peter Birtles, a general practitioner, assessed LMS on 11 July 2020 as lacking capacity to make sound financial decisions because she is unable to understand the concept and importance of money.  In a separate letter dated 9 January 2020, Dr Birtles confirms that in his opinion LMS lacks capacity to agree to the deed of variation sought in this application.  On the basis of Dr Birtles&#8217; assessment, I find that the presumption of capacity set out at <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(2)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> is displaced.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-style:italic">That test is not of course a substitute for the language of the regulation itself, which requires that the purpose of securing such entitlement must be affirmatively established in relation to the particular claimant and his or her actions in each case in order for the "notional capital" provisions to apply. It has however evolved by long use and acceptance as perhaps the best way that can be got of expressing the perfectly valid point that a person's actions may well have more than one purpose, and the existence of one does not necessarily negate another. Thus in order for the regulation to apply the securing of benefit does not have to be the claimant's sole, or even his predominant, motive or purpose; and it is not a "wholly and exclusively" test. The point is neatly put in the decision of Mr J G Monroe who was I think the first Commissioner to use the expression, in paragraph 10 of case </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">R(SB) 40/85</span><span style="font-style:italic"> when he said: </span></p>

For instance one can visualise a case of a man possessed of say &#163;1,000 over the statutory limit whose resources fall short of his requirements to an extent that this &#163;1,000 would make up the deficiency for 12 months. He might conclude that if he forthwith spent the &#163;1,000 on carpeting his home from wall to wall he could start drawing supplementary benefit at once and thus be no worse off income-wise and have the benefit of the carpeting. It would be legitimate to conclude that if such was his purpose he had deprived himself of the &#163;1,000 for the purpose of securing supplementary benefit, notwithstanding that another purpose was to have the house carpeted."</span></p>

Such a task is however a perfectly normal one for a tribunal of fact to have to undertake, and this is of course by no means the only instance in the law when the purpose for which a thing is done may not be express, and has to be ascertained "as a matter of substance and of fact": re South African Supply and Cold Storage Company <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1904] 2 Ch 268" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1904">[1904] 2 Ch 268</ref>, per Buckley J at p282.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">Whilst <span style="font-style:italic">Watt v ABC</span> establishes there is no presumption in favour of a deputyship/LPA there are a number of reasons why I consider the proposed deed (absent any financial benefit to LMS) would not be in LMS&#8217;s best interests.  Firstly, and most importantly, LMS made a capacitous decision that her property and affairs should be managed by her attorneys under the LPA.  The proposed deed is contrary to LMS&#8217;s wishes as expressed through her execution of the LPA.  Secondly, the trustees of the proposed trust would not be bound to apply the principles of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> to their decisions.  Thirdly, the regime of supervision by the Public Guardian of LPA attorneys does not apply to trustees (I do not intend to suggest in any way that the proposed trustees are likely to act other than in LMS&#8217;s best interests).  Fourthly, the proposed deed would mean LMS&#8217;s capital being managed under the trust and her income under the LPA which does not seem to be the most efficient method of management of her property and affairs.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">In <span style="font-style:italic">Re Sarah McCullagh</span>, McBride J found it was possible to approve a proposed arrangement in a way that did not disqualify the beneficiary under two will trusts from entitlement to means-tested benefits.  She did so on the basis that the significant operative purpose of the proposed scheme was to better effect the settlor&#8217;s intention to provide for her son&#8217;s comfort and welfare rather than to enable her son to claim means-tested benefits.  The Applicant submits that I can and should reach the same conclusion in this case.   </p>

The Applicant submits that the intention of LMS&#8217;s grandfather was that LMS should benefit financially from his will.  His will was drafted poorly such that his intention will be defeated by the effects of LMS&#8217;s inheritance on her entitlement to meanstested benefits.  His clear intention to benefit LMS will fail unless the proposed deed is authorised.   </p>

She is in more need than other granddaughter&#8217;</span>.  It is evident from the will file that LMS&#8217;s entitlement to means-tested benefits was discussed at that initial meeting.  At a further meeting LMS&#8217;s grandfather said that the Applicant had not provided him details of LMS&#8217;s benefit arrangements so he was &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">leaving his will as it was&#8217;</span>.  The Official Solicitor submits that the only intention that may be discerned from the will file and the will itself is that LMS&#8217;s grandfather intended her to receive her provision outright and that he did so in the knowledge that it may adversely affect her entitlement to benefits. </p>

I discern from the will file that he intended LMS to benefit financially from her inheritance and that he would have altered his will had he received information confirming an adverse effect on LMS&#8217;s benefits as the will was initially drafted. </p>

Although the Court of Protection does not have jurisdiction to determine whether LMS will be entitled to means-tested benefits and funding, it is able to discern and record its own intention in authorising the deed on behalf of LMS.  I am satisfied that the continuing eligibility of LMS to means-tested benefits and funding is not the significant operative purpose of the proposed deed and that is not the court&#8217;s motive in authorising the deed on behalf of LMS. Rather it is intended to better effect the intention of LMS&#8217;s grandfather. </p>

I consider that she was right in this case not to simply agree to the proposed deed and recommend its authorisation to the court.  I consider that the discernment of LMS&#8217;s grandfather&#8217;s intention and the question of whether his intention could provide a reason for authorising the proposed deed were both matters for a judge of the Court of Protection to decide. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">In her position statement, the Official Solicitor submitted that if the proposed deed were to be authorised, it should first be amended to include safeguards to ensure that LMS, either on her own behalf if she has the requisite capacity or by the Court of Protection on her behalf if she lacks such capacity, is able to exercise a degree of control and oversight of the administration of the assets comprised in the trust fund. The Applicant accepted at the hearing that such amendments should be made. As such, I intend to authorise the proposed deed subject to the inclusion of a clause vesting the power of removing and appointing trustees in LMS and further an amendment to the default trusts providing that after the death of LMS any assets remaining in the trust fund should be held for such persons as LMS may by her will appoint and subject thereto for her children and remoter issue absolutely. If no such persons are living then for her grandfather&#8217;s other grandchildren and remoter issue absolutely. </p>

If the Applicant were right that the intention of the court cannot amount to the subjective intention of the protected party when considering deprivation of capital, it must follow that neither could the intention of a deputy.  That would mean that a deputy could deliberately use a protected party&#8217;s capital solely with the intention of gaining an entitlement to means-tested benefits (whether that coincided with the expressed wishes and feelings of the protected party or not) but that the deprivation of capital rules would not apply.
