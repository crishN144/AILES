The mother regularly left Z with family  friends. In September 2015 at the beginning of a new school term (and whilst X and Y  were still away) the mother left Z with a family friend so she could travel abroad to a  different country (other than where X and Y were living). The mother was away for  around five weeks. Shortly after the mother left, the friend relinquished care of Z to  another friend. The Court found that Z will have been frightened and bewildered by  the mother leaving him in this way without any planning and that he will have suffered  significant  emotional  harm.  The  Court  found  that  the  mother  has  had  ongoing  problems with her mental health and issues with her use of alcohol, placing the  children at risk of emotional harm and neglect. The mother has been unable to protect  Z from the escalating unpredictable behaviour of X and Y, with X and Y each having  poor mental health, X having threatened to kill Z on a number of occasions and Y&#8217;s  mental health posing a risk of physical and emotional harm to her siblings. The Court  found that the mother had continued to inflict significant emotional harm on Z by  giving him a photograph on which she had written &#8216;You are from my sacred place, my  womb, therefore no evil, no demon, no enchantment, no witchcraft can take you away  from me. My ancestors who are your ancestors will not allow strangers to raise their  offspring while I&#8217;m still alive. No psychological manipulation will work on you. You are  coming home to me where you belong after court. I love you, your ancestors love you,  you don&#8217;t belong where you are, and whoever tries to keep you away from me it shall  never be well with them&#8217;. The Court also found that the mother had continued to  cause significant emotional harm to X even through indirect contact, by bombarding  X with telephone calls about the pending court final hearing, leading to X making  threats against children&#8217;s services and the judge that if the mother did not get Z back,  X would end her life.  </span></p>

However Recorder Taylor  noted that during the proceedings in 2019 Dr Green, consultant psychiatrist,  assessed  the  mother  and  concluded  that  although  she  had  suffered  from  depression, he did not consider her mental state to impact upon her parenting. I  acknowledge that the threshold findings made in 2019 and in 2021 refer to the  mother having had ongoing problems with her mental health and having had  issues with her alcohol usage placing the children at risk of emotional harm and  neglect, however when one considers the welfare findings of Recorder Taylor and  the content of her judgment it is clear that the issues which led Recorder Taylor to  conclude that the mother was unable to care for B were the mother&#8217;s continued  association with A, despite the risk he poses, her lack of acceptance of the court&#8217;s  previous findings, her lack of insight, her inappropriate messages to Z and her  inability  to  work  with  the  local  authority.  Recorder  Taylor  did  not  base  her  conclusion that the mother was unable to meet B&#8217;s needs upon the mother&#8217;s poor  mental health. The mother&#8217;s current stable mental health therefore does not in  my view constitute a change in circumstances since the placement order was  made in November 2021.  </span></p>

It is clear that  the mother feels very deeply about these issues. I am conscious that B&#8217;s removal from  her care (irrespective of the merits of that decision, which was made at a time when  the mother was legally represented and had the opportunity to argue her case at the  time the order was made) will have been traumatic for her. The prospect of B&#8217;s  adoption I understand must also be extremely difficult for the mother to face and I  have no doubt of her love for her son. But none of these factors assist me in deciding  as I must whether the mother  can satisfy me that there has been a change of  circumstances since the placement order was made. It was clear to me from the  mother&#8217;s submissions that she continues to dispute significant aspects of the findings  of the court and that she has failed to reflect on, acknowledge and address the  deficiencies that the court has found in her parenting of her three older children and  her lack of openness within the proceedings and the risks that would be posed to B,  in light of those deficiencies, were he to be placed in her care.  </span></p>

The benefits of permission to oppose  being granted are that this would allow the mother to advance her case for B to move  to her care. If the mother were successful, this would give B the opportunity to be  brought up by his birth mother, who clearly loves him. He would have the opportunity  to form relationships with his half siblings and his cultural and identity needs would  be met. The disadvantages of permission to oppose being granted are that in the short  term B&#8217;s carer would face a period of uncertainty and the prospect of a contested  adoption application, the stress of which may indirectly be felt by B. B himself, if the  mother is successful, would face the disruption and emotional harm of being moved  from his current carer, with whom he is familiar. Much more significantly, B would be  exposed in the care of his mother to the risks of significant harm identified by Recorder  Oldham and Recorder Taylor, which Recorder Taylor concluded following a contested  hearing could not be adequately managed other than by a placement outside the  mother&#8217;s care.  </span></p>

I am sure  that B, if he could understand the issues, would wish to be brought up within his birth  family if he could safely do so. If B in due course is adopted, the fact of being and the  reasons why he is an adopted person are things that as he grows older he would need  to come to terms with and would remain part of his identity throughout the rest of his  life. Although B&#8217;s mother wishes to be able to care for B, if he were placed in her care  the risks identified by Recorder Taylor remain. B&#8217;s older three half siblings have in the  past suffered significant physical and emotional harm and neglect due to the mother&#8217;s  inability to protect them from harmful behaviour posed by her former partner and  due to her own inability to recognise and meet their emotional needs. The mother has  not been open and honest with the local authority in the past, which means that the  significant  risks  to  B  in  the  mother&#8217;s  care  could  not  be  effectively  managed  by  professional monitoring and support.  </span></p>

The  findings of Recorders Oldham and Taylor show that the mother sadly is unable to meet  this need. B&#8217;s carer has demonstrated a good understanding of B&#8217;s identity needs,  given his ethnicity, and a commitment to promoting an understanding by B of his  heritage. If B is adopted, he will grow up with a knowledge that his older half- siblings  were not adopted, however he will be able to understand in due course that, like him,  they were also unable to remain in their mother&#8217;s care for the same reasons that led  to his adoption.</span></p>
