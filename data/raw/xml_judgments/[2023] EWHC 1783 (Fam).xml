It concerns a child, who I will call Maria, now aged 5 years, who was born in England and who has dual Polish and UK nationality. Maria is currently living in England with her father (&#8220;the father&#8221;) who is the respondent. The applicant mother </span>(&#8220;the mother&#8221; born in 1986) is Polish and she seeks the summary return of Maria to Germany. The application is opposed by Maria&#8217;s father (born in 1989) who is also Polish. The father has settled status in the UK and the mother does not. </p>

The mother also contends that Maria was habitually resident in Germany immediately before the asserted wrongful retention.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The father resists summary return on the grounds that at the date on which he retained Maria in England, she was not habitually resident in Germany, accordingly his retention of her outside that jurisdiction was not wrongful. Further or alternatively, and this is his primary ground of resistance, the mother consented to Maria remaining with him in England. Acquiescence, raised in the father&#8217;s statement, is not pursued. Needless to say, the mother denies that she provided her consent at any time.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">In summary, I find that Maria was habitually resident in Germany on the date of alleged wrongful retention. I also find that on a balance of probabilities, the mother consented to her being retained in England by the father. Finally, I have not exercised my discretion to return Maria to Germany. It follows that she will stay in England, pending the resolution of the currently stayed welfare proceedings in the Luton Family Court.</p>

That was a sensible and helpful agreement. Both parties&#8217; statements were materially incomplete and important documents, which required to be addressed before they could be properly understood, were not touched on at all. Absent oral evidence, I would not be in a position to decide the issue of consent fairly. In the event, the evidence I heard proved pivotal.</p>

Each parent&#8217;s statements exhibited electronic messages exchanged between them, other documents, and photographs of Maria with friends and relatives in both Germany and England.</p>

The father worked on a construction site, and the mother worked in the home and was Maria&#8217;s primary carer. Maria went to nursery and the mother produces a letter from the nursery which speaks highly of her as a reliable, caring and emotionally responsive parent who was greatly involved in her daughter&#8217;s life, and the nursery community.</p>

The mother says that this was when cracks in the relationship became significant. She says that the father was frequently intoxicated, verbally and emotionally abusive, and controlling of her. She was unhappy and sought help, and there is a letter stating that she had five sessions of therapy at a Family Aid Centre. The Father said that it was a happy time for the family but he found it difficult to adjust to living in Poland. He attributes this to the fact that he had spent the preceding nine to ten years in England, and become accustomed to a different lifestyle.</p>

They stayed at Maria&#8217;s maternal grandmother&#8217;s house in an area outside Frankfurt. This is the same house to which they returned around a year later, and which they were living in when Maria left Germany on 20 December 2022. The mother still lives there.</p>

The mother says that all such decisions were made by him, and her views were not taken into account. She says she had little choice but to go along with what the father wanted since he was the sole owner of the flat. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Since they had nowhere to live in England (they had previously rented) the move had to be made in stages. It was agreed that the father would go ahead to find somewhere for the three of them to live, and while he was making those preparations, the mother and Maria would once again stay with the maternal grandmother in Germany. The parents estimated that it would take about three months to make the necessary arrangements.</p>

The mother, Maria, and the family dog remained in Poland. The father returned for a couple of days in mid-June when the sale of his flat went through. He took their remaining possessions, including many of the mother&#8217;s clothes, her winter coats, important documents such as her tax records, and many of Maria&#8217;s toys and clothes, to England and put them in storage. None of these items needed to go to Germany because both parents anticipated that the mother and Maria would have relocated to England by the time the winter came.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">In her written evidence, the mother said that she and Maria travelled to Germany on 16 June, directly after the flat was sold. However, in oral evidence, after her attention was drawn to plane tickets produced by the father, she agreed that in fact they left Poland one calendar month later. On 16 June, the mother and Maria travelled to the grandmother&#8217;s holiday home in Poland where they stayed for a month and on 10 July, the father joined them there for a week. In oral evidence, the mother recalled that he came over to help her sister who was building a house. On around 16 July 2022, Maria, her mother, grandmother and step-grandfather, plus the dog, drove to Germany, to the grandmother&#8217;s house where the mother and Maria had stayed the preceding summer. Also living in the house were the mother&#8217;s other sister and her two daughters.  </p>

Unsurprisingly, the plan for the family to relocate to England also entered a state of flux. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">When he arrived in the UK at the end of May, the father rented a room in the Wembley area. In his statement, he explained that he did not rent a flat immediately in order to save as much money for the family as possible and that evidence was unchallenged. He worked full time in the construction business owned by his sister and her husband. There are messages between the parents indicating that in August, the Father shared with the mother pictures of flats that he was looking at in the Dunstable area where his sister and her family lived. The mother indicated a preference for one of them.  He took some steps in preparation for the mother&#8217;s arrival such as enquiring about what would be necessary to obtain settled status for her, ascertaining that there may be a tax position to be rectified, and the fines that would need to be paid.</p>

The first message in evidence was on 18 October, when the father wrote to the mother saying: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Swap with me, stay on your own and I will take Maria.</span>&#8221; Two days later, he made a surprise visit to Germany, arriving on 20 and leaving on 23 October 2022.

This was her position at the start of the hearing. In oral evidence she was asked whether it was right that she was in Poland on 6 January, and it was at this point that her case changed. In reply, and for the first time, the mother said that between 2 and 4 January the father called her and told her that he had cancelled Maria&#8217;s return flight to Germany and they were not coming back. She said she was very concerned. She had been intending to return to Germany on 5 January but stayed in Poland an extra day, trying to obtain legal advice.</p>

She was asking about whether the grandmother had an internet connection at the flat because she wanted to speak to Maria and it was convenient to use the internet, rather than a mobile network, to make the call. </p>

As to that, there are compelling reasons why the removing parent must be aware of whether or not consent exists. The first is that as a matter of ordinary language the word 'consent' denotes the giving of permission to another person to do something. For the permission to be meaningful, it must be made known. This natural reading is reinforced by the fact that consent appears in the Convention as a verb ("avait consenti/had consented"): what is required is an act or actions and not just an internal state of mind. But it is at the practical level that the need for communication is most obvious. Parties make important decisions based on the understanding that they have a consent to relocate on which they can safely rely. It would make a mockery of the Convention if the permission on which the removing parent had depended could be subsequently invalidated by an undisclosed change of heart on the part of the other parent, particularly as the result for the children would then be a mandatory return. Such an arbitrary consequence would be flatly contrary to the Convention's purpose of protecting children from the harmful effects of wrongful removal, and it would also be manifestly unfair to the removing parent and the children.</span><span style="color:#000000">&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Before turning to the issues, it is convenient to consider the date of wrongful retention. Wrongful retention occurs not when a child is not returned to the care of a custodial parent, but when a child is not returned to their state of habitual residence. In the present case, the mother asserts that the father had agreed to bring Maria back to Germany on 5 January, and return the child to her care on 6 January. As I go on to explain, I find that Maria was habitually resident in Germany. It follows that the date of asserted wrongful retention is 5 January 2023. </p>

In June 2022, she witnessed the flat being packed up and cleared, and must have had a sense that it was no longer her home. Her father took away all the things from the flat in boxes. After a month in the countryside in Poland, she went to the house in Germany she had visited before. On arrival in Germany, Maria continued to live in a Polish community in a Polish speaking household. It is likely that her habitual residence did not shift immediately to Germany and that this was a process that took time.</p>

She was also of pre-school age (had she been in England she would have started school in September 2022; in Germany I was told that school starts at age 6 years) and therefore it is relevant to consider the mother&#8217;s degree of integration, though the focus throughout is on that of the child. The mother quickly found work in Germany, formed new friendships with colleagues, and obtained health insurance. I find that the mother became habitually resident in Germany quickly after arriving there in July.</p>

For example, because the father did not want her to start Kindergarten if she was going to be leaving Germany imminently, she did not attend. Had she done so, Maria would have formed her own friendships and started to learn German which did not happen. However, the law requires &#8220;some degree&#8221;, not full, integration and that is amply demonstrated on the evidence.</p>

Following this argument through, Maria would have had to acquire habitual residence in England between the evening of 24 December 2022 and 5 January. As noted above, she and the father were in Tenerife between 27 December and 1 January and therefore there were only about six days available. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The legal principles tell us that integration can happen quickly but I do not find that Maria had the requisite, if any, degree of integration into a social and family environment in England immediately before she was retained here on 5 January. She had come for a holiday and was expecting to go back to her grandmother&#8217;s house to live with her mother. What exactly she understood about any change of plan for her to stay in England and not go back to England is unclear but it is unlikely, in my judgment, that she understood that she would not be returning to life in Germany. I keep in mind that she was born and spent the first two years of her life here but in December 2022 she was still only 4 years old and will have had little recollection of her time here as a baby and toddler. This must have been an exciting time for Maria but it was also an unstable one, not least because this was the first occasion when she had been separated from her mother for any length of time. There was Christmas, followed by a winter sun break, then back to England, and then the news that her mother would not be joining them. All of the evidence suggests, and I find, that it was not until after 8 January 2023, when the mother communicated her intention to stay in Germany, that Maria started to acquire some degree of integration into life in England.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">I do not accept that this is one of those very rare cases where the child had no country of habitual residence at the relevant time. I accept that when she arrived, her parents intended that her time in Germany would be a short stop gap between leaving Poland and moving on to a new home in England. However, after they arrived, the situation changed and the stay was extended.  Parental intention is only one factor to be considered and in any event, there was a time in October when the parents were actively considering a future in which the mother and Maria lived in Germany indefinitely. For the reasons I have explained, I am satisfied that on 5 January 2023, Maria had a sufficient degree of stability, and integration into the environment in Germany, for that to have become her country of habitual residence.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Before turning to the specifics, I address the mother&#8217;s overarching explanation of her thoughts and actions in the critical period between October 2022 and 10 January 2023. This is that: she was unhappy in the relationship which she experienced as abusive, she had tried to end it but the father had not taken no for an answer, he threatened that if she did leave him he would take Maria and she would not see her daughter again, and therefore she found it easiest to appease him by telling him what he wanted to hear, namely that they would live together again as a family in England, despite her having no intention of moving there.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The mother has provided documentary evidence of her seeking counselling in Poland as a result of unhappiness in her domestic situation. She ended the relationship in October 2022 and there was a separation. I found the father to be a determined, hardworking, efficient and energetic man who does not lack self-confidence. There was a power imbalance and the mother came across as a quieter personality. It is easy to see that she may have found it difficult to persuade him to alter course once his mind was made up. His messages show that he was insecure about the relationship whilst they were living apart, suspicious of other men, and jealous of her new friends. Those he sent her in late January contain vitriolic attacks on her character and are evidence that he is capable of being verbally and emotionally abusive when angry. I also accept that during their two pandemic years in Poland (which country the mother had left seven years earlier) she was in a vulnerable position. She was living in the flat of which he was sole owner, with sole care of a toddler while he was out at work, and financially dependent on him. It may have been a lonely time as well as an unhappy one.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">However, that situation changed when she moved to Germany. She quickly obtained a job and was earning her own money, she had loving and reliable childcare on tap because she was living with her own mother, she had secure, family owned accommodation, with family around her who could provide emotional support, and she had new friends who were nothing to do with the father. As to Maria, she was the custodial parent and she had possession of Maria&#8217;s travel and identity documents. That being the case, her evidence that she feared the father would take Maria away from her was difficult to understand. He had no practical way of doing so and she was in a position to refuse him access to her mother&#8217;s house. That evidence was also inconsistent with her oral evidence that even after the father told her he was not returning Maria, she was certain he would bring her back.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The messages in October and early November show that at that time, the mother had three choices on the table. She could stay in Germany and Maria could live with the father in England. He could stay in England and she and Maria could settle in Germany, with Maria attending Kindergarten. Or the three of them could live together in England. I find that this was a genuine, unconditional opportunity for her to effect a final separation, if that was what she wanted to do. I do not accept that the choice she communicated to him on 7 November was the product of telephoned blackmail, threats or pressure. I find that the father would rather have had no romantic relationship with the mother, than one in which she was a half-hearted, unwilling participant. In more than one message he stated his desire for love, trust and honesty. He wanted the three of them to resume their pre-pandemic life in England but not at the cost of more arguments and a repeat separation: obtaining a reunited family by duress would have been counter-productive. </p>

I also reject her suggestion that the father knew, or suspected, that whatever she said in her messages and on the telephone, she never intended to come to the UK. Her words and actions throughout the following two months were all consistent with her holding to the decision she had made. She ended the argument on 26 December with an emphatic reassurance: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I am coming in January and I hope everything will be back to the way it was!</span>&#8221; There is no evidence at all that the mother equivocated after 7 November.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">What has happened here is so unusual that it is unsatisfactory to offer no formulation as to why the mother did what she did. What follows is not a finding of fact &#8211; I am not required to determine motivation &#8211; rather it is my sense, having seen and listened carefully to both parents, about what may have been going through her mind. When asked why she had agreed to Maria going to England for the Christmas holiday if it was true that she was worried about him removing Maria from her care permanently, the mother said that she wanted Maria to have a relationship with her father. Given the coldness between them when he made the brief, unhappy visit in October, this was a conspicuously child centred decision. After he had left, she had time and space to weigh up her choices. With her head, she made the decision that she thought was best for Maria, and that was for the three of them to live together as a family again. In her heart, she knew her relationship with the father would not work. As hard as she could, she suppressed her feelings, and, perhaps, her wishes to continue her new, independent life in Germany. She stuck with the decision to reunite the family in England until the last moment, and then could not go through with it. I do not consider that she intended to delegate care of Maria to the father, much less to abandon her daughter. It would seem that when 9 January loomed, she was in a horrible muddle and made a panicked phone call without thinking through the consequences.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Her message of 10 January was not, in my view, a fabrication but rather a rewriting of history in the light of the realisation of what the situation had brought about. She did fool the father, and through him Maria, because she fooled herself. He did not know, and had no way of knowing, that she did not want to go back to London. That was because she was telling him &#8211; and trying to persuade herself - that she did, and he believed her. He did consult her about the cancellation of Maria&#8217;s return ticket to Germany and she agreed to it. Looking back, she bitterly regretted not telling him between Christmas and 5 January, that they were not relocating after all, and that he would need to bring Maria back as previously agreed.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Where matters are in dispute, I prefer the evidence of the father. I do so because his account of events is clear, corroborated by documents such as plane tickets, and consistent with the messages between the parties, and his actions at the relevant time. He had a strong command of the details of events being an organised person who is good at planning. On the issue of consent, the mother&#8217;s credibility was fatally damaged by her concession that the father told her, sometime between 2 and 4 January, and certainly before 5 January 2023, that he would be retaining Maria in England. She had no plausible explanation as to why, if she was opposed to and did not consent to that, she did not immediately protest. Her silence between 2 and 10 January, can only be explained by the fact that she agreed to Maria staying where she was, in England.</p>

She has been living in England in 2023 for almost exactly the same amount of time that she spent in Germany in 2022. In addition, she was born in England and spent the first two years of her life here. Importantly, she attends school and a report from her Headteacher states that: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">She has settled into school routines and is learning English.</span>&#8221; (There is no evidence that she had started to learn German.) She celebrated her fifth birthday in England and her father arranged a small party to which Maria invited an English school friend. She has a GP in England, attends swimming classes and has an aunt and cousin living nearby. She lives in a flat which her father chose with her in mind, and the majority of her toys and clothes from Poland are here because he brought them to England in preparation for her planned relocation. Her degree of integration into the social and family environment in England is considerable. Her father has spent most of his adult life in England, has settled status here, strong family and other ties to the UK, is permanently employed here, and no longer owns a property in Poland. There is no doubt that her life here is stable.</p>
