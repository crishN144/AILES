Accordingly, B has been joined to these proceedings as 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> Respondent.

Notwithstanding the conveyancing documents clearly identifying W as both the legal and beneficial owner of the new flat, do I accept the account of W and B that at all times it was their common intention that the new flat was to be beneficially held by W for B and that in due course W would in accordance with B&#8217;s instructions transfer it either to B or to his elder daughter; or do I prefer the argument of H, namely that the monies were a gift to W, payment for work done by her, or transfer of family assets from W&#8217;s family to her, and that the documents accurately set out what was agreed?</p>

They are the two children of their father by his first marriage and he has two children by his second marriage.  Their father founded in 1993 a business which now owns a very large number of stores in Central Russia.  Although there are many companies within the structure, I shall for convenience refer to it as &#8220;the business&#8221;.  As a result, W&#8217;s family has become very wealthy.  The business is run by their father and B.  B, aged 46, has worked in the business from an early stage when he finished his university degree.  Father and son control the strategic direction of the business, as I so find.  The father, mother and each of the two children have a 25% shareholding.  W avers that her use of and benefit from her shareholding, including the receipt and use of dividends, is at the direction and discretion of her father.</p>

Among his investments, in 2015 he purchased a hotel in Spain and one in Austria and completed the purchase of another hotel in Austria in 2017.  It was B&#8217;s unchallenged evidence that W gave him significant help in the acquisition process of these expensive assets.  As a result, he gave her as a reward 300,000,000 roubles, which is the sterling equivalent of about &#163;3m.  He did so through the mechanism of &#8220;a donation agreement&#8221; dated 15 February 2016 which as translated sets out that:</p>

B said that how the money was expended by W was a matter for her, although its timing was proximate to the purchase of what became the family home, and the money was no doubt always seen as being likely to be used for that purpose.</p>

B says that this caused him to pull out of the purchase, but the vendor says that he was in the process of rectifying the problem and was told by H that B was no longer interested in buying a London home as his daughter was leaving London.</p>

This was not a straightforward process because the property was held in the name of an overseas corporation.

The payments were made between October 2016 &#8211; January 2020.

He knew that she would transfer the new flat to him or his daughter whenever and as he wanted; at all times he was the &#8216;real&#8217; or &#8216;ultimate&#8217; owner.  It was simply a matter of convenience that the property was purchased in his sister&#8217;s name because of the infrequency of his visits to London, his lack of English language and to facilitate W&#8217;s management of the property in his absence.</p>

He is right to say that W and H have always lived off her family business at a rate far higher than her relatively modest salary (excluding her receipt of dividend income) would have permitted. He hypothesised that it was all the result of family handouts. </p>

There was next to no exploration as to how the family finances operated save in respect of the &#163;3m payment in 2016.  How W came to have the best part of &#163;13m in her bank account was never explored with her.  W has made it in plain in the financial remedy proceedings that she regards that money as held for H and W&#8217;s daughters.  H disputes this but if W is correct it would on H&#8217;s case have been the obvious source for the purchase of the new flat which he says was to be purchased for their benefit, but this was never canvassed.</p>

The 2016 payment was the subject of the donation agreement to avoid any ambiguity about whether there was a debt.  He gave a convincing reason for why that payment was made.  I can see no reason why he would have made another such payment from his own resources 4 years later, particularly at a time when he knew that the marriage was in a critical state, and when W was in no need of his financial assistance.</p>

I conclude that for three reasons: first, neither H nor W produced it as a document in these proceedings and the only copy came from FF&#8217;s files.  Secondly, W made her own hand-written notes at the meeting which she has produced. Her notes would have been unnecessary if she had the schedule and they support her case of what was at the forefront of her mind.  Thirdly, the absence of any confirmatory record in the accountant&#8217;s files.</p>

This is not easy to follow as I find that the money was paid from B&#8217;s personal account and from taxed income and I do not accept H&#8217;s description.  When it was put to H that B had produced his tax returns to show that the funds came from his taxed income, H would not accept that the tax returns were genuine copies and would only accept it if the originals were properly witnessed, signed, and sealed by someone independent. There is no evidence that B has provided false tax returns to the court.</p>

B and W denied that any such suggestion was made.

Whilst that might well be the case if the purchase monies were to be a gift to W (or H/W jointly), there was no such risk if the new flat was always intended to be truly owned by B.  Indeed, it would be surprising if the transaction was not mentioned if it had been a gift, but it is not H&#8217;s case that it was mentioned.</p>
