	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Claimant Local Authority (LA) in this case has applied for an injunction regulating the way adult members of a family in their area live in their home. The family consist of GRL and ML, husband and wife who are aged 85 and 90 years and their son, DL who is in his fifties. They have shared the same home for about 50 years. Just prior to the commencement of the hearing before me GRL was admitted to hospital and then a care home. A very recent report states that he no longer has capacity to make decisions about his future care and, as a result, it was agreed any proceedings that relate to him will be transferred to the Court of Protection. ML and DL remain in the family home. Both ML and DL have capacity in the sense that it is agreed their position does not fall to be considered within the provisions of the MCA.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">Mr and Mrs L are an elderly married couple. He is 85: she is 90. They live with their son, DL, (who is in his fifties) in a house which is owned by Mr. L. Mrs L is physically disabled. She receives support by way of direct payments and twice daily visits from health and social care professionals commissioned and paid for by the Claimant local authority under its statutory community care duties. At the time that these proceedings were commenced, the local authority accepts, for the purpose of this hearing, that neither Mr nor Mrs L (nor, for that matter, DL) was incapable, by reason of any impairment of or disturbance in the functioning of the mind or brain, of managing their own affairs, and, in particular, both Mr and Mrs L appeared capable of deciding what their relationship with their son should be and, in particular, whether he should continue to live under the same roof as themselves.  Mr L has, however, been recently assessed as lacking capacity to make his own decisions and a decision is soon to be reached whether he has requisite capacity to litigate.  Mr. L is no longer residing at the family home and it is not known if or when he will return to the family home.  Nevertheless the need to resolve the preliminary issue remains and for that purpose it is assumed that both ML and GRL have capacity as to residence and contact with DL for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 2</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">The local authority is concerned about DL&#8217;s alleged conduct towards his parents, which is said to be aggressive, and which, on occasions, has resulted, it is said, in physical violence by DL towards his parents. The local authority has documented incidents going back to 2005 which, it says, chronicle DL&#8217;s behaviour and which include physical assaults, verbal threats, controlling where and when his parents may move in the house, preventing them from leaving the house, and controlling who may visit them, and the terms upon which they may visit them, including health and social care professionals providing care and support for Mrs L.  There have also been consistent reports that DL is seeking to coerce Mr L into transferring the ownership of the house into DL&#8217;s name and that he has also placed considerable pressure on both his parents to have Mrs L moved into a care home against her wishes. </span></p>

Mr. Fowler invited DL to be interviewed during the visit which DL acceded to, however the appointment could not be re-arranged to suit DL&#8217;s availability and the assessment proceeded without DL(para 2.1)).  Mr. Fowler concluded (without the benefit of any assessment of DL&#8217;s account or evidence), so far as is material, that both GRL and ML are unduly influenced by DL to an extent that their capacity (in the SA sense) to make balanced and considered decisions is compromised or prevented (paras 3.19-3.26). However it was recorded that DL&#8217;s influence is not so strong that ML is unable to give instructions which reflect her own wishes although they are subject to DL&#8217;s influence (3.29) and that GRL had resisted pressure from DL (3.30).  It was further recorded that neither DL nor GRL meet the criteria set down in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.4</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> and that they both understand advice which is given to them (3.28).

She came from a Pakistani Muslim family and lived with her parents and two younger brothers. She was profoundly deaf, had no oral communication, had profound bilateral sensory neural loss and significant visual loss, and could communicate only in British Sign Language which is based on English. She cannot lip read the family&#8217;s first language Punjabi and nether of her parents are able to use British Sign Language. Her intellectual level was assessed at that of a 13-14 year old and she has a reading age of about 7 &#8211; 8. Whilst SA was still a minor she was made a ward of court and various injunctions were made preventing SA being removed from the jurisdiction or married. The local authority remained concerned, after SA reached her majority that she may enter into an unsuitable arranged marriage. The evidence established that she had the capacity to marry. However, the concern was that her limited ability to communicate and understand could result in her entering into an unsuitable marriage, which would pose significant risk to her future well-being and mental health. The question arose whether the court could exercise its inherent jurisdiction to protect her from those risks, even though she was an adult with capacity to marry. </p>

She would be able to give consent to a particular marriage only if she was provided with a full understanding of what was proposed. In particular, any arrangements for her to be married must be made through British Sign Language and protective measures needed to be put in place to ensure that she is able to understand and give consent to the terms of the specific marriage that she is entering into. She also needed to be protected against a marriage that would cause her to be isolated and helpless in Pakistan in circumstances where she would not be able to communicate with her husband or others around her. The order (set out in full at para [136]) made detailed injunctions against SA&#8217;s parents until further order. At para [137] there is reference to SA&#8217;s mother asking how long the order should remain in force, Munby J expressed the view that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;it is not possible to define this with any precision, though in reality it will need to remain in force indefinitely, probably, in effect, until SA marries.

First, the strength of the will of the patient. One who is very tired, in pain or depressed will be much less able to resist having his will overborne than one who is rested, free from pain and cheerful. Second, the relationship of the "persuader" to the patient may be of crucial importance. The influence of parents on their children or of one spouse on the other can be, but is by no means necessarily, much stronger than would be the case in other relationships. Persuasion based upon religious belief can also be much more compelling and the fact that arguments based upon religious beliefs are being deployed by someone in a very close relationship with the patient will give them added force and should alert the doctors to the possibility &#8211; no more &#8211; that the patient's capacity or will to decide has been overborne. In other words the patient may not mean what he says."</span></p>

I find it difficult to reconcile the facts found by the judge with his conclusion that the influence of the mother did not sap her will or destroy her volition.

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-style:italic">"This young woman, therefore, if a child, would be protected by the court, which would make orders of the sort I am making but adapted to the fact that a child can be made a ward of court. An adult cannot be made a ward of court, but the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court can, in an appropriate case, be relied upon and utilised to provide a remedy. I believe that the inherent jurisdiction now, like wardship has been, is a sufficiently flexible remedy to evolve in accordance with social needs and social values. If an adult is deprived of the capacity to make relevant decisions, then, if there is disagreement about what should be done in his or her best interests, or if there is a serious issue as to the propriety of what is proposed, recourse can be had to the court for declaratory relief. Clear resemblances are to be discerned, in my judgment, with cases such as that of the Norwegian deprived of the capacity for autonomy by the after-effects of a stroke (see Re S (Hospital Patient: Court's Jurisdiction) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1996] Fam 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">[1996] Fam 1</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 1 FLR 1075" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 1 FLR 1075</ref>)."</span></p>

The inherent jurisdiction can be invoked wherever a vulnerable adult is, or is reasonably believed to be, for some reason deprived of the capacity to make the relevant decision, or disabled from making a free choice, or incapacitated or disabled from giving or expressing a real and genuine consent. The cause may be, but is not for this purpose limited to, mental disorder or mental illness.

The significance in this context of the concept of a vulnerable adult is pragmatic and evidential: it is simply that an adult who is vulnerable is more likely to fall into the category of the incapacitated in relation to whom the inherent jurisdiction is exercisable than an adult who is not vulnerable. So it is likely to be easier to persuade the court that there is a case calling for investigation where the adult is apparently vulnerable than where the adult is not on the face of it vulnerable. That is all.&#8221;</span></p>

There is little, if any, practical difference between the types of orders that can be made in exercise of the two jurisdictions. The main difference is that the court cannot make an adult a ward of court. So the particular status which wardship automatically confers on a child who is a ward of court &#8211; for example, the fact that a ward of court cannot marry or leave the jurisdiction without the consent of the court &#8211; has no parallel in the case of the adult jurisdiction. In the absence of express orders, the attributes or incidents of wardship do not attach to an adult. But this apart, the court's powers to make orders under the inherent jurisdiction in relation to adults would seem to be as wide as its powers when exercising its inherent parens patriae jurisdiction in relation to children. Just as there are, in theory, no limits to the court's powers when exercising the wardship jurisdiction I suspect that there are, in theory, few if any limits to the court's powers when exercising the inherent jurisdiction in relation to adults.&#8221;</span></p>

She had formed a relationship with KM who also had mental health difficulties. MM took up residence in supported accommodation and there was an agreement which included that KM would not attend the unit, she would inform the staff if she intended to go out and that she would return by a fixed time. On a number of occasions, and encouraged by KM, MM left the unit without warning and for extended periods of time, apparently sleeping rough and not receiving her medication. The local authority received information indicating that KM was proposing to take MM to stay with his brother in a different part of the country. The local authority issued a Part 8 claim form and an interim order was made that she lacked capacity to decide where she should reside, who she should associate with and that it was not in her best interests to be removed from the unit or to have contact with KM. Munby J concluded that whilst MM had the capacity to consent to sexual relations she lacked the capacity to litigate, to manage her finances, to decide where and with whom she should live, and to decide with whom she should have contact. She also lacked the capacity to marry. Whilst Munby J considered the authorities that looked at capacity (see paras [62] &#8211; [96]) this case did not directly consider the case of <span style="font-style:italic">SA.</span></p>

The purpose, in respect of a capacitated but vulnerable adult, is to create a situation where he or she can receive outside help free of coercion, to enable him or her to weigh things up and decide freely what he or she wishes to do. In respect of an incapacitated adult, I consider the same should apply, except that the aim of providing him or her with relief from the coercion is first to gain capacity and, if achieved, then to enable him or her to reach a free decision. &#8220;</span></p>

The power is itself however, subject to at least two major constraints: it must be in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law, and any such law must in turn accord the respect due under article 8 to private and family life. The first of these elements does not mean that the common law cannot grow or shape itself to changing social conditions and perceptions: see SW v United Kingdom; CR v United Kingdom <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1995) 21 EHRR 363" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">(1995) 21 EHRR 363</ref>. It means that any such change must be principled and predictable. For the reasons set out in the two preceding judgments I consider that the development of the law which our decision represents passes both limbs of this test.</span></p>

But it should be clearly said now that it is T&#8217;s welfare which will remain throughout the single issue. The family life for which article 8 requires respect is not a propriety right vested in either parent or child: it is as much an interest of society as of individual family members, and its principle purpose, at least where there are children, must be the safety and welfare of the child. It needs to be remembered that the tabulated right is not to family life as such but to respect for it. The purpose, in my view, is to assure within proper limits the entitlement of individuals to the benefit of what is benign and positive in family life. It is not to allow other individuals, however closely related and well-intentioned, to create or perpetuate situations which jeopardise their welfare. As the European Court of Human Rights said in Marckx v Belgium <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1979) 2 EHRR 330" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1979">(1979) 2 EHRR 330</ref>, 342, article 8 (I): </span></p>

The State may be obliged to take positive action to prevent or stop another individual from interfering with private life. As the court put it in Botta v Italy at 257 (para 33):</span></p>

These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves&#8230;.

On the contrary, and as Botta v Italy shows, the State, even in this sphere of relations between purely private individuals, may have positive obligations to adopt measures which will ensure effective respect for the son&#8217;s private life. Thus the State, in the form of the local authority, may have a positive obligation to intervene, even at the risk of detriment to the father&#8217;s family life, if such intervention is necessary to ensure respect for the son&#8217;s Art 8 rights. And the State, in the form of the High Court, has a positive obligation to act in such a way as to ensure respect for those rights.&#8221;</span></p>

The &#8216;best interests&#8217; jurisdiction has been largely replaced by that of the Court of Protection under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>.  However, the jurisdiction survives and in one crucial respect it is wider than that of the Court of Protection, because it allows the court to exercise its protective jurisdiction in relation to adults who are incapacitated for some reason other than an &#8216;impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain&#8217;.

Her fall back position is, if it has, it has only survived to a very limited extent. She submits that the MCA and the supporting Code of Guidance was intended to deal comprehensively with issues around those who lacked capacity to make decisions for themselves. If the only ground for interference is &#8220;vulnerability&#8221; then that is an area covered by the MCA and its very careful approach to capacity. Otherwise the courts could use the concept of &#8220;vulnerability&#8221; as a lesser test to that of capacity and thereby circumvent the careful approach in the MCA. Where a person with requisite capacity has been provided with clear advice as to the options and avenues open to him or her, and that such advice has been provided without the source of suspected undue influence, then the court can order no more action be taken. Whilst it may be that such a decision is not in the objective best interests of the person concerned, they have reached that decision independently and with the benefit of unencumbered advice. An individual with capacity can make a decision which is not in his/her objective best interests, and the court has no power to intervene. To do otherwise offends against the principle of autonomy.

In so doing the House of Lords rediscovered the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction and applied the common law doctrine of necessity to rule on whether (i) a course of action was in the best interests of the incapacitated party and (ii) whether the intended action was thus lawful. In <span style="font-style:italic">A (by his Litigation Friend the Official Solicitor) v A Health Authority and others</span> [2002] EWHC 18 Munby J noted at para [40] that the jurisdiction was not confined to cases involving medical treatment, but incorporated all matters that conduces to the incompetent adult&#8217;s welfare and happiness, including companionship and his or her social environment. The basis of any remedy was with reference to whether the declaratory relief sought was in the incompetent adult&#8217;s best interests. At para [43] he stated that this encompassed a welfare appraisal in the widest sense taking into account a wide range of ethical, social, moral, emotional and welfare considerations.

It was also acknowledged in the report that whomsoever one resided with or whom one spent a considerable degree of time with there would be a degree of influence. Therefore, the Bill was drawn up with express consideration of the issues around the potential influence (and by implication potential duress) that may exist in a person&#8217;s home and from close family members (see para 104). She relied on recommendation 16 from The Joint Committee and the Government&#8217;s response set out at paragraphs 42 and 43<span style="font-weight:bold"/>above.</p>

Whilst the common law retains significant relevance as to the interpretation of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/7-8/72" uk:canonical="1959 (7 &amp; 8 Eliz. 2) c. 72" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, it must be recalled that such common law only emerged as a consequence of a gap identified by the courts. With the MCA and its accompanying Code of Practice, all rights pertaining to capacity have been codified and a new Court has been created to hear the determination of those rights. It has been held that the common law cannot go behind statute where that statute was intended to be exhaustive (see <span style="font-style:italic">Black v Forsey</span> [1988] S.C. (H.L) 28).</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">A Local Authority v Mrs A (by her Litigation Friend the Official Solicitor) and Mr A [2010]</span> EWHC 1549 (Fam) Bodey J heard an application  from a local authority seeking a declaration that (i) Mrs A lacked capacity to decide whether to use contraception and (ii) that it was in her best interests to receive contraception. Bodey J dealt with the question of the retention of the inherent jurisdiction. Miss Lieven Q.C. relies of what he states at para [79] <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;...The purpose in respect of a capacitated but vulnerable adult, is to create a situation where he or she can receive outside help free of coercion, to enable him or her to weigh things up and decide freely what he or she wishes to do.&#8221;</span> Miss Lieven Q.C. submits that notwithstanding her principal argument that the inherent jurisdiction cannot apply in a case like this, if it does survive as a protective measure, the remedy and relief as outlined by Bodey J is of a limited degree and nature and does not go beyond that envisaged within the MCA Code of Practice.

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.38in">Miss Lieven Q.C. submits that having codified the common law Parliament had the opportunity to embrace the wider definition as set out in<span style="font-style:italic"> SA,</span> yet chose not to go down that route. Instead Parliament, via the MCA and the Code of Practice, created a mechanism under which assistance in such cases could be provided to the potentially incapacitated person, so they could make a decision for themselves (see Code of Practice para 2.8). The mechanism in the MCA and the Code restricted the MCA&#8217;s reach to (i) the provision of advice and assistance to ensure that the potentially incapacitated person can reach a decision free from influence; and (ii) the capacity assessment. On the facts of the instant case those mechanisms have been applied over a lengthy period and the conclusion was that there was no incapacity. That conclusion has been reached by trained social workers. It follows that the intention of Parliament was for this group to be catered for under the MCA. It cannot be asserted that its existence was ignored, as the Code specifically covers such people and provides for them receiving assistance. Thus, submits Miss Lieven Q.C., there is no gap within the statute from which the inherent jurisdiction can now operate absent incapacity. In her oral submissions she went further. She submitted that s 48 MCA gave the court power to investigate the issue of capacity and, if necessary, interim protective orders can be made to enable the person who is the subject of the application to make decisions.</p>

Miss Lieven Q.C. also relied on what Lord Bingham said in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Razgar) v SSHD</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] 2 AC 368" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] 2 AC 368</ref> and the decision of the ECtHR in <span style="font-style:italic">Neulinger and Shuruk v Switzerland </span>[2010] EHCR 2053. She submits what these cases show is that Article 8 starts from the position of respecting individuals&#8217; choices about their own private life, and the State should be extremely slow to interfere with those choices, however bizarre at times they might appear to be to other members of society. The very raison d&#8217;etre of Article 8 is the protection of individuals&#8217; family life from the interference of the State. However well intentioned the LA&#8217;s actions may be, that is precisely what they are doing. In terms of judging the proportionality of interference, the position will of course be different where the case involves children or those without capacity. In such situations the State may have a positive obligation to intervene to protect, and such interference may well be proportionate. However, with capacitous adults who have made their own choices about their family life, it will not be proportionate for the State to intervene in those choices.</p>

She submits that the vulnerable adult (in the <span style="font-style:italic">SA </span>sense) was considered during the Parliamentary scrutiny of the Mental Capacity Bill. The situation is, she submits, covered by the ability of the court to make interim investigations as to capacity under s 48 MCA, any interim orders and the provisions in the Code regarding the giving of advice and guidance. Her fall-back position is that if the inherent jurisdiction does survive, it is limited to put in place measures to enable such persons to make decisions free from what-ever undue influence or duress there may be. </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.38in">Each case will, of course, have to be carefully considered on its own facts, but if there is evidence to suggest that an adult who does not suffer from any kind of mental incapacity that comes within the MCA but who is, or reasonably believed to be, incapacitated from making the relevant decision by reason of such things as constraint, coercion, undue influence or other vitiating factors they may be entitled to the protection of the inherent jurisdiction (see: <span style="font-style:italic">SA (supra) para [79])</span>. This may, or may not, include a vulnerable adult. I respectfully agree with Munby J in <span style="font-style:italic">SA at para [83] </span> &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">The inherent jurisdiction is not confined to those who are vulnerable adults, however that expression is understood, nor is a vulnerable adult amenable as such to the jurisdiction. The significance in this context of the concept of a vulnerable adult is pragmatic and evidential: it is simply that an adult who is vulnerable is more likely to fall into the category of the incapacitated in relation to whom the inherent jurisdiction is exercisable than an adult who is not vulnerable. So it is likely to be easier to persuade the court that there is a case calling for investigation where the adult is apparently vulnerable than where the adult is not on the face of it vulnerable.&#8221;</span> In the cases I have been referred to the term &#8216;vulnerable adult&#8217; appears to have been used to include the <span style="font-style:italic">SA </span>definition, whether the adult in question is vulnerable or not. Obviously the facts in <span style="font-style:italic">SA </span>were very different to the case I am concerned with. For example, in this case ML and DL have capacity to litigate but that does not, in my judgment, mean that the inherent jurisdiction should not be available to protect ML, once the court has undertaken the correct balancing exercise.</p>

Whilst it is correct that the cases to date regarding any positive obligation on the State (including the LA) arising under Article 8 have concerned cases involving children or adults who lack mental capacity that does not mean, in principle, such positive duties cannot arise in other circumstances.

Each case will have to be considered on its own facts and a careful balance undertaken by the court of the competing (often powerful) considerations as to whether declarations or other orders should be made. As Miss Lieven Q.C. points out the assumed facts in this case are not accepted by DL and even if they are one of the important considerations for the court to consider are the views of adults concerned; they do not support the orders being sought by the LA. In addition, the terms of the orders being sought in this case are likely to require very careful scrutiny.</p>
