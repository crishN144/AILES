They were taken to Russia by their father, Ilya Neustadt, on Christmas Day 2012 and were only returned to the care of their mother, Rachael Neustadt, on 26 June 2014 after strenuous efforts by the authorities in England and in Russia.  The father now seeks to resume contact with the boys and their younger brother Meir (2).  The purpose of this hearing has been to establish the facts and to assess whether the father&#8217;s expressions of regret are genuine.   </span></p>

It may include the abduction of a child for a few days, or even a week or two, followed by the child's return, effectively undamaged, and, more important, although the parent from whom the separation was effected has suffered distress and anxiety in the meantime, with the loving relationship between parent and child quite unharmed.  At the other extreme there are offences of forced marriage which ultimately culminate in what in reality is rape, or cases like the present, where the child is deliberately taken abroad and separated from one of its parents for many years, and the ordinary loving relationship which each should enjoy with the other is irremediably severed.&#8221;</span></p>

Had the effective operation of an international treaty (the 1996 Hague Convention) by a new signatory (the Russian Federation), not led to the boys being returned to England, the separation would in all probability have continued indefinitely.  </span></p>

It is an outstanding example of the value of international cooperation in protecting individual children and deterring potential abductors.  The legal process has in the end defeated a determined abductor with no respect for court orders in either jurisdiction.  This court expresses its profound appreciation for the steps taken by the Russian courts and civil authorities in eventually securing the safe return of the children to their mother&#8217;s care.</span></p>

The mother's legal teams in London and Moscow have been instrumental in achieving the children's return.  As part of the process, the English lawyers pursued a painstaking process of disclosure, piecing together information known at the time only to the father, but now exposed with clarity.  The documents presented at this hearing lay bare the anatomy of an abduction.  In this judgment I shall describe some of that material; it allows for little if any doubt, but where it is necessary to make contested findings of fact, I do so on the balance of probabilities.</span></p>

Of course they have a Russian parent, albeit he himself has lived most of his adult life elsewhere.  But until December 2012, when they were aged 6&#189; and 4&#189;, the boys had always lived in Switzerland and England.  They had never even visited Russia.  Their Russian heritage is important, but it has been played upon by the father because it is the one thing that he can offer that the mother cannot.  </span></p>

He was only willing to accommodate her in the children's lives if she came to live in Russia, where she would be under his control.  When she would not agree, her access to the children was strictly limited, and then stopped altogether.  In doing this, the father counted on his legal position in Russia being secure.  I find that he intended to keep the children indefinitely, and was only frustrated by the determined actions of the Russian authorities.</span></p>

I do not accept that he ever genuinely considered his position to be legitimate.  He is a man who relies on advice that suits him and ignores advice that does not.  He flouted every order of this court and when faced with orders of the Russian courts, he went underground.  His excuse for this (danger from unidentified persons) is a bogus invention, but the children were not to know that.  They were brainwashed into believing that they were being pursued by dangerous bandits, including their mother.  The seriousness of this is not only measured by the length of the separation created by the father, but also by his willingness to root the mother out of the children's lives.  This was not just child abduction, it was child abuse.</span></p>

The only person he seemed to be really sorry for was his mother.  Throughout his evidence he was pedantic, unreliable and untruthful.  When confronted methodically with the clearest evidence, his reaction was to misrepresent, prevaricate, minimise, extenuate and contest.  There was no sign of any real remorse.  So far, his apologies are no more than a means to an end, motivated by disadvantage and the failure of his grand plan.
