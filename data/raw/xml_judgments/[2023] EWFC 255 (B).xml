The facts relied upon were that (i) the wife had three times asked the husband to live away from the family home for one to three months at time, which had left him feeling unwanted and excluded; (ii) that she had at times withdrawn affection and refused to spend time with him, leaving him feeling isolated and unloved; (iii) that she had shown a lack of interest in his life leaving him feeling abandoned; and (iv) that she continually belittled him, and made it clear that the relationship was over, leading him to the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;unhappy conclusion that the marriage has no future.&#8217;</span></p>

It is not disputed that since at least 1 April 2013 the parties have lived in separate properties.  On any view their relationship has taken some twists and turns.  There have been times when they have been actively estranged, not getting on particularly well, and in relationships with other people.  There have been other times when they have been very much closer, in a sexual relationship, and been on family holidays together with the children.  They have shared Christmases, attended each other&#8217;s fiftieth birthday parties and socialised together, including going to concerts, meals out with friends, and on occasion weekends away together.</span></p>

It would also risk importing personal judicial mores and standards into the decision-making process. As Wood J said, what should be examined is 'whether the original decree nisi was pronounced upon sound evidence and upon sound inferences to be drawn from such evidence'. In my judgement in so far as the judge imported a qualitative assessment of the parties' relationship as a means of determining whether there had or had not been a reconciliation, he was in error.&#8217;</span></p>

While the husband indicated that he was willing to accept matters if shown proof, a number of times in his evidence he was unwilling to concede what was plain and obvious.  For example, he was taken to a number of WhatsApp messages between him and the wife which clearly (and he accepted) were sexually charged, but he repeatedly said that he was not able to say they indicated anything about the nature of their relationship at that time, without being given more information &#8216;around the context&#8217;.

In a message sent in mid-January when he is away skiing, he says to the wife that for the last few hours, days, months, in fact for all the seven years since they separated, he has been thinking to himself why can they not get on? He reassures her of his love for her, that she is smart, attractive, interesting, and none of the women who are with him and his friends compare to her.  </span></p>

Again, the wife is saying that no matter how she feels about the husband, she is not sure that she can be happy with the type of relationship they have, she feels she does not bring out the best in him, and is then blamed for this.  The messages show them to be emotionally entangled and invested in explaining their viewpoint to the other.  The husband reminds her that he pays her monthly money, has left her with two investment properties and two houses, pays her an allowance, and she does not need to work, whereas he cannot think of anything she does for him, she does not help him with anything really and does not remove the stress from his life, and instead just has issues with what he does and tells him she is unhappy.</span></p>

He accepted that her recollection of that discussion was very possibly correct, and they may have discussed difficulties arising from his partner wanting to meet his children.  However, he was not prepared to accept that the conversation then developed into a discussion about the husband and wife&#8217;s relationship, or that he had expressed a view that he was pleased for them their relationship was working and they had avoided such difficulties.

For example, it was put to the wife that as she no longer did the husband&#8217;s laundry, bought his clothes, did housework in his property, or cooked for him regularly, then they could not have been sharing a common life.  A marriage should not be marked by the level of domestic chores that one party may do for another.  In any event, the wife&#8217;s evidence was that even before 2012 they rarely had meals together, as she would more often than not have eaten with the children before he got home, and he would usually come home and go straight upstairs to exercise on gym equipment.   </span></p>

There were times when they had an expectation of being &#8216;exclusive&#8217;, there were arguments and jealousy about other partners, and a significant body of evidence that they were &#8211; for significant periods of time &#8211; careful to check with the other about decisions they were making around holidays, shared activities, and how they spent their daily lives.</span></p>
