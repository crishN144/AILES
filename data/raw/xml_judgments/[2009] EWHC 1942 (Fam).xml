They were married in 1998 and separated in approximately 1999 when DD was a baby. There have been problems in relation to M&#8217;s care of DD and of her other children and the local authority for the area in which she lives, the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames (RBK), were involved with the family on occasions prior to the events that feature in this judgment.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">DD came into the care of RBK on this occasion on 25 June 2007 when M was incapacitated once more by mental illness. He was placed with a RBK foster carer with whom he had stayed in the past. On 27 July 2007, he was taken to stay with his paternal grandmother (PGM) who lives in the area of another local authority, Lancashire County Council (LCC), and he has remained there ever since. On 13 December 2007, a residence order was made in favour of PGM, expressed to be &#8220;in the interim&#8221;. The directions given that day contemplated that the matter would return to court in mid February 2008 with the benefit of a s 37 report on the placement with PGM from LCC. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In due course, steps were taken towards the making of a special guardianship order in PGM&#8217;s favour. I put it this way because no application form was ever issued but everyone proceeded as if it had been and a special guardianship report was directed. All represented parties (M, DD by his guardian, LCC and RBK) are in agreement that a special guardianship order should be granted. By an oversight, no doubt compounded by the failure of PGM&#8217;s representatives to issue special guardianship proceedings in the proper way, F has not been formally notified of the special guardianship application. He was apparently informed in December 2008, by DD&#8217;s guardian in these proceedings, of the intention to secure DD&#8217;s position by seeking a special guardianship order in favour of PGM and he was not in opposition to that. He was then contacted by the guardian again, after I raised the issue of service on the first day of the hearing in front of me. I am told that he still agrees to the special guardianship order being made. In the circumstances, I am asked to dispense with any requirement of formal service upon him. I have lamented before a widespread tendency to fail to observe basic procedural formalities prescribed for family cases. I have no doubt that the pressure under which family practitioners work these days contributes significantly to this problem. However, it is important that the rules <span style="font-style:italic">are</span> observed so as to prevent situations like this occurring. In this particular case, I am satisfied that F is genuinely content for his mother to look after DD under a special guardianship order and that no injustice will be done to him if I do proceed to make an order without involving him further. Accordingly, I will dispense with any requirement to give further notice to F and also dispense with the issue of an application form, proceeding as if the application had been properly launched by PGM, who has been entitled to apply for a special guardianship order since 13 December 2007 by virtue of the residence order in her favour (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 14</ref>A(5) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>).

That matter will have to be addressed by whichever local authority is found to be responsible. Counsel on behalf of PGM asked me to give my views in this judgment as to the way in which financial support should be quantified but it seems to me that it would be misguided of me to do so. Once the local authority with responsibility is identified, they will quantify the support they propose and inform the other parties of the figures and the principles by which they have arrived at them. If there is any debate as to whether the approach taken to quantification is lawful, which I doubt there will be, PGM always has judicial review proceedings open to her and the judge hearing such an application would be in a much better position than I am to rule upon the matter because he would be able to scrutinise the actual proposals with the benefit of full argument about them, rather than attempting to formulate an approach in limbo and at a time when attentions are very much absorbed by the fundamental question of which authority is responsible for payment. </p>

A judge decided, opposed by Oxfordshire, that the child ought to be placed with his grandfather and step-grandmother and the child moved to their care in Norfolk where he lived for 2 years before the issue arose as to which local authority would be designated in the event that a full care order was made. Although it looked as if the child was ordinarily resident in Norfolk, Norfolk argued that the disregard provision applied in relation to the period in Norfolk because the child was &#8216;being provided with accommodation by or on behalf of [Oxfordshire]&#8217; during that time and that accordingly, the local authority to be designated was Oxfordshire. The Court of Appeal did not accept this argument because it concluded that, once the child moved from foster care to the relatives in Norfolk, he was not being provided with accommodation by a local authority but began to live with the grandfather pursuant to arrangements made by the local authority pursuant to its duty under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/23/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 23(6)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.</p>

A few days later, she contacted the local authority to arrange for them to be placed with their grandmother in another area of the country, which they were, a package of support within a Children in Need plan having been agreed between the two local authorities. The grandmother&#8217;s local authority argued that the mother&#8217;s local authority was providing accommodation pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 20</ref> in placing the children with the grandmother and remained the responsible local authority. The President found that the children had been accommodated with the grandmother under a family arrangement approved by the first local authority acting under its duty pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/23/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 23(6)</ref> as opposed to being provided with accommodation by Thurrock under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/23/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 23(2)</ref>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Southwark LBC v D</span>, the context was an issue over whether Southwark was responsible for funding a placement with a friend of the child&#8217;s father. The child had had a short period with Southwark foster parents in the past but was not the subject of a care order and after a period staying with a friend of her father&#8217;s, the child returned home to her father. The following year, that arrangement broke down. Southwark social services became involved again. The child told them she would like to return to live with the father&#8217;s friend. The representative of social services contacted the friend and, the friend having agreed that she would care for the child, took the child to her house. Next day, the representative told the friend that someone from his office would visit her and steps would be taken to offer her assistance. The friend indicated her willingness to co-operate. Nothing specific was said about financial arrangements and the friend assumed the person from the office would make them but no one came. Social services got the agreement of both parents to the child living with the friend but the friend never dealt directly with either parent. When the friend approached Southwark in due course for financial support, Southwark said the arrangement with her had been a private fostering arrangement and that she should look to Lambeth, where she lived, for support. Lambeth considered that Southwark had placed the child with the friend pursuant to their statutory duties so Southwark were responsible. The Court of Appeal held that Southwark had had a duty under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 20(1)</ref> Children Act to provide accommodation for the child. Such a duty might be side-stepped by a local authority helping to make a private fostering arrangement but that had not happened here where the local authority had taken a central role in the arrangements for the friend to look after the child. Once the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 20(1)</ref> duty arose, the local authority could ensure that accommodation is provided by providing it themselves under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/23/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 23(2)</ref> or they could make arrangements for the child to live with a relative, friend etc. pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/23/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 23(6)</ref>. The court observed that usually, and ideally, a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/23/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 23(2)</ref> placement will be temporary and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/23/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 23(6)</ref> arrangements for the child to live with someone will provide a longer term solution to the child&#8217;s needs. Considering whether the circumstances in this case amounted to a placement under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/23/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 23(2)</ref> or <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/23/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 23(6)</ref>, the court was clear that it was under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/23/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 23(2)</ref> because, in short, no reasonable bystander would have thought that the local authority was shedding its legal responsibility to provide accommodation for the child and the friend was taking it on. The reality was that the local authority was asking the friend to accommodate the child on their behalf and at their expense.  </p>

When the residence order gave PGM parental responsibility, her status changed and, because she then fell within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/23/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 23(4)</ref>(b), she ceased to be a local authority foster parent. He would argue that, as a necessary corollary, DD ceased to be provided with accommodation by the local authority and, not being the subject of a care order, ceased to be looked after by them. Putting it in my words, not his, being a local authority foster parent and being a child who is provided with accommodation by the local authority are two sides of a coin and, where the child is being looked after by an individual rather than, for instance, in a children&#8217;s home, you cannot have either one without the other. Mr Singh Hayer acknowledges that the local authority continued to give significant assistance to PGM after the residence order was made but points out that local authorities have got ways to assist children which do not amount to providing accommodation or bring the child within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/22/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 22(1)</ref>, notably under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/17" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 17</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.

That would, of course, mean that the child who had been a looked after child by virtue of being in the local authority&#8217;s care under a care order would cease to be a looked after child. Why should the position be different when a residence order supervenes in relation to a child who is being provided with accommodation by the local authority without a care order? </p>

On the other hand, there is no suggestion of bad faith on the part of RBK, or  that they were in any way deliberately trying to divest themselves of responsibility for DD, and PGM&#8217;s instruction of her own solicitor, with RBK&#8217;s assistance, was, it seems to me, the route by which she could be advised of the consequences, advantageous and disadvantageous, of the making of a residence order.</p>

In my judgment, however, it is important to remember that a necessary step in the process would be the making of a residence order. A family member who felt that the making of such an order would be prejudicial would not have to apply for one. The local authority would have no right to apply themselves for such an order and, if it was suggested that the court should make such an order of its own motion, the family member could resist that course by explaining its adverse consequences. Independent legal advice, as sought by PGM, should fortify a relative sufficiently to deal with these matters.</p>

In the meanwhile, the looked after child would be vulnerable as nobody would effectively be exercising parental responsibility. It is submitted that the undesirable consequence would, in many cases, be the instigation of public law proceedings which might not otherwise have been taken.</p>

It is the consequence of a set of legal rules, albeit a set of legal rules which are complex and of which it is extremely difficult to make complete sense. The disadvantage of the analysis proposed by PGM, LCC etc., is that, under their approach, the answer to whether a child is provided with accommodation by a local authority and is therefore looked after, depends on what could, in some cases, be a very detailed consideration and interpretation of the individual facts. In contrast, RBK&#8217;s proposed approach has the advantage of certainty, depending, as it does, upon a readily identifiable single event. Once someone acquires parental responsibility by the making of a residence order, albeit a temporary one, the provision of accommodation ceases. </p>

I accept that it may be necessary for people in the position of PGM to think carefully before seeking a residence order and that they may be disinclined to do so, in order to preserve their links with (and rights in relation to) the local authority who initially placed the child with them. However, should the decision be not to seek a residence order, and should there be a real threat to the security of the placement because of outside influences such as a parent who wishes to resume care of the child, there is a statutory scheme by which the child (and its carer) can be protected. The impact of an interim care order obtained in these circumstances would not necessarily be that much more burdensome for the child and its carer than would be the impact of the child continuing to be looked after by the local authority in the context of a residence order. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I said that I would allude to the reason why, unconstrained by authority, I might have viewed <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/23" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 23</ref> rather differently. I should say immediately that I do not think this different view would have resulted in a different outcome for PGM and LCC, simply that my analysis and route to that outcome might have been different. As this is so, and because I do not pretend to have arrived at a complete answer with regard to the interpretation of the very challenging provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss 20</ref> &#8211; 23, I will say only sufficient to identify why I wonder, respectfully, whether there might be a problem with the approach taken by the courts so far. That approach depends upon <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/23/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 23(2)</ref> and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/23/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 23(6)</ref> (or <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/23/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 23(5)</ref> as Wall J put it in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re C</span> [1997]) being two separate pathways to providing a child with a home, each with distinct and different consequences. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/23/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">S 23(2)</ref> is the provision which is identified as involving the provision of accommodation by a local authority and reliance is put upon the use within it of the concept of placing the child with someone in contrast to the concept in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/23/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss 23(5)</ref> and (6) of allowing a child to live with someone/making arrangements for the child to live with someone. This perceived separation of concepts is difficult to sustain, I think, when one notes that the placing of the child under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/23/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 23(2)</ref> is made subject to subsection (5) (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/23/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 23(2)</ref> (a)). Looking at this, albeit through a glass darkly, it seems to me that it means that the concepts of placing the child and allowing the child to live with someone are in fact intertwined and not separate at all. I have been left wondering, therefore, whether the structure of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/23" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 23</ref> is a unified one in which placements of a child with a family or individual all take place under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/23/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 23(2)</ref> and the effect of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/23/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 23(6)</ref> is simply to put upon the local authority a duty to place the child with a parent, relative etc rather than in traditional foster care wherever possible. If the child is placed with someone who is not within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/23/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 23(4)</ref>, that person is a local authority foster carer and the corollary of that is that the accommodation is being provided by the local authority and the child continues to be looked after by them. If the person is within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/23/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 23(4)</ref>, they are not a local authority foster carer and the child is not being provided with accommodation by the local authority, and, unless he is the subject of a care order, is no longer a looked after child. I apprehend that there may be as many difficulties with this approach as with the approach followed by the courts thus far but if the issue is worthy of further exploration and argument at all, that must be in another case in front of another court. If the matter <span style="font-style:italic">were</span> ever to be explored further, it would be necessary to review not only the terms of the Children Act itself (and probably more widely than just <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss 20</ref> &#8211; 23, also including, for example, Schedule 2 Part II) but also the various regulations concerned with the powers and duties of local authorities in relation to the placement of children with individuals. The Placement of Children with Parents etc Regulations 1991 featured in Wall J&#8217;s reasoning in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re C</span> [1997] and there are other relevant provisions such as Fostering Services Regulations 2002. I invite this wider focus because I am all too conscious of how easy it is, when interpreting provisions that regulate the responsibility of local authorities to support children and families, to fail to appreciate that a proposed construction of a provision upon which one is concentrating will conflict with the obvious meaning of similar words elsewhere in the body of relevant law or disrupt established good practice in some unforeseen way. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Returning to my decision in the instant case, it follows from my having adopted the reasoning of RBK that DD ceased to be a looked after child upon the making of the residence order in favour of PGM. LCC is therefore the authority to whom PGM will look for support in relation to the proposed special guardianship order. As for the allowance that RBK will by paying for the middle period, between the residence order and the special guardianship order, that will be a residence order allowance although, given the circumstances in which the residence order came into being, as part of RBK&#8217;s long term plan, it may be that it will be indistinguishable from the allowance that would have been paid had DD remained a looked after child.</p>
