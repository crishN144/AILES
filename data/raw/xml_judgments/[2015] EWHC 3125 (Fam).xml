If he states he requires either the toilet or a drink, staff must allow him the opportunity of accessing either.  Staff must remind him of the time, redirecting him back to his room by encouragement in a firm tone of voice.  If AB refuses, staff should ask him again in a firm tone of voice.

It may be that those rights have sometimes to be limited or restricted because of their disabilities, but the starting point should be the same as that for everyone else.  This flows inexorably from the universal character of human rights, founded on the inherent dignity of all human beings, and is confirmed in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Far from disability entitling the state to deny such people human rights: rather it places upon the state (and upon others) the duty to make reasonable accommodation to cater for the special needs of those with disabilities.</span></p>

But, as it seems to me, what it means to be deprived of liberty must be the same for everyone, whether or not they have physical or mental disabilities.  If it would be a deprivation of my liberty to be obliged to live in a particular place, subject to constant monitoring and control, only allowed out with close supervision, and unable to move away without permission even if such an opportunity became available, then it must also be a deprivation of the liberty of a disabled person.  The fact that my living arrangements are comfortable, and indeed make my life as enjoyable as it could possibly be, should make no difference.  A gilded cage is still a cage. </span></p>

A person might be under constant supervision and control but still be free to leave should he express the desire so to do.  Conversely, it is possible to imagine situations in which a person is not free to leave but is not under such continuous supervision and control as to lead to the conclusion that he was deprived of his liberty.</span></p>

The answer, in my judgment, is an emphatic "no".  In taking a child into care and instituting care proceedings, the local authority is acting as an organ of the state.  To permit a local authority in such circumstances to consent to the deprivation of liberty of a child would (1) breach Article 5 of the Convention, which provides "no one should be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law", (2) would not afford the "proper safeguards which will secure the legal justifications for the constraints under which they are made out", and (3) would not meet the need for a periodic independent check on whether the arrangements made for them are in their best interests (per Lady Hale in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Cheshire West</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> at paragraphs 56 and 57).                                     </span></p>
