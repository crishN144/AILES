Firstly, it is the purpose of this Court in analysing disputes of this kind, to establish anything relevant to the key, indeed, the paramount question of the welfare interest of the subject child going forward. The Court should confine its enquiries to matters that touch upon those issues. Insofar as disputed allegations are concerned, the task of the Court is to consider the allegations to the civil standard of proof; that is to say the balance of probabilities.  The task of the alleging party is to satisfy the Court that the allegation is proved to that standard. There is no burden in either direction to disprove an allegation.</span></p>

However, what she told me was that, having viewed those videos and discussed them with the mother, the mother had not shown any concern about the impact of physical chastisement on D and had sought to minimise and deflect questions as to her own behaviour.  </span></p>

As a result, G maintained a clear recommendation to this Court that there was no basis to remove D from the care of her father. She also told me that the current level of weekly supervised contact was meaningful and helped to maintain the bonds of the relationship between mother and daughter.  At the same time, she accepted there may need to be some flexibility and practicality about the contact arrangements, not least, to leave weekend time free for father and daughter. </span></p>

G hoped that a date could be agreed between the parties for the reduction of supervision but acknowledged that that may be something which is impossible so far as agreement is concerned between the parents.  She was also asked to consider within the question of the importance of contact; whether substitute contact should take place when the father is on holiday or in similar circumstances and she was clear that such contact should be made up in some way or conducted remotely.</span></p>

She later told me that it was not part of the culture to behave in that way but felt that no one within the family had been willing to tell her where she was going wrong. She also felt at the time that she was caring for her daughter, she was subject to stress and oppressive conduct within the paternal family home by the father, the paternal grandfather and the paternal grandmother. She exemplified this by telling me that the paternal grandmother had threatened to send her back to India and to give her a beating.</span></p>

The mother was also clear that the father had assaulted her by way of strangulation in an incident on 27 March 2022. With regard to that incident, the father obtained a video which was played to the mother and it was put to her that she had no visible injuries in that incident and nor had she shared anything with the police a few weeks after the alleged incident on 16 April 2022.  The mother denied that she was lying about these things.</span></p>

I do not propose to set them all out for the benefit of this short judgment but to exemplify matters. The incident on 17 March 2022 was put to the mother and she was asked whether she accepted that on that occasion she had forcefully slapped her daughter. She said she had not, that it was a &#8220;soft slap&#8221;. Similar incidents were put on 12&#160;January 2022 and on 5 February 2022 to exemplify these matters and how the mother had treated her daughter.

The mother did not accept this. It was also put to her that she had lied when she had said that the father had been controlling and had subjected her to abuse. It was put to her that regarding the allegation of control, it was significant that the mother had never mentioned this to her general practitioner on occasions when she had visited the medical practice alone or on various hospital visits that she had attended alone. It was also put to her that she had been able to visit her sister in 2021 and 2022. The mother accepted that she had done all of these things but did not accept that her allegations were untrue.  What she did accept at one point in her evidence, was that she had lied to obtain a non-molestation order against the father when she had said in her supporting statement that he had made up the allegation of her beating her daughter.

The mother denied this. It was put to her that she had lied for example, when she had asserted that the father had raped her on numerous occasions, sometimes up to three and more times a day and yet she had then gone on to text him to seek a sexual relationship in February 2020.

It is easy to see, having heard from her, the dilemmas presented by witnessing physical chastisement on the part of the mother and this can be seen clearly in the supporting video evidence which has been submitted to this Court. It was a dilemma for the grandmother and it was difficult, so it seems to me, for her to know what to do or how to properly intervene.</span></p>

He has been clear and consistent in his denial of significant oppressive conduct towards the mother and he has refuted in a consistent way very many of the allegations she has laid against him.  That was not significantly challenged or undermined by the cross-examination of B on the mother&#8217;s behalf or indeed, by looking at the totality of the evidence that I have before me from all sources. However, if I look at the video evidence alone, the picture is a more nuanced one in that there is certainly at least one instance where it appears to me by the father&#8217;s words and deeds, he was in despair at what was going on in the family home.  There is at least one occasion when he was, to put matters at their most reductive, reactive to the mother&#8217;s actions. He argued and he shouted at her. All of these reactions are apparent in the video of 27 March 2022 to which I will return.</span></p>

That is an entirely na&#239;ve view, therefore, when the video evidence is taken into account and significant physical chastisement on the part of the mother is observed.  The only point of her evidence which I regarded as helpful to the wider factual inquiry was the denial of a cultural context to the physical chastisement which, given her underlying loyalty to her sister, seems to me to be an important observation in this case.</span></p>

Firstly, there was a basic inability to accept what must be plain to anyone who has viewed the videos, that she has subjected her daughter to a number of physical assaults arising, as is plain from the videos themselves, from shortness of temper when feeding and caring for her. In her evidence, she sought to explain that away by suggesting that it resulted from cultural conditioning in her own childhood or by suggesting other family members should have shown her a better way.  These suggestions are undermined by the other witnesses in this case including the sister and the paternal grandmother as I have set out. What they amount to in my view, is a profound inability on the part of the mother to accept in a direct and straightforward way, the acts of aggression which are plain to see in the videos.</span></p>

As I have already noted, the depiction of the paternal grandmother is very many miles from the picture of a concerned and loving grandmother which I gained from hearing her.  It is also clear in one of the videos which I have seen, the video covering 23 September 2021, that an attempt by the paternal grandmother to console D was cut off because the mother told the grandmother not to interfere or discouraged her from doing so. That is not consistent with the picture the mother paints of control on the part of the paternal grandmother.</span></p>

What the videos actually show is the father refusing to act when the mother had physically chastised their daughter save for the video on 27 March 2022.  In other words, he was acting with restraint rather than, as the Mother would have me believe, carrying out unprovoked assaults on her.  When I look even at that video, it is clear from the playing of the video that there is no opportunity for the father to have strangled the mother in the way that she alleged.</span></p>

Secondly, allegation 3(b), which deals with threats on the part of the paternal family to take D to India, was not something which was significantly pursued at this hearing but it seems to me inherently unlikely from what I know of the paternal family and is not accepted by me.  The whole position of the family, certainly the paternal grandmother and the father from whom I heard was that D was at the centre of their universe and these threats seem, therefore, to me, to be wholly improbable.</span></p>

They are not consistent with the allegations of coercive and controlling behaviour that the mother has alleged. </span></p>

As I have already commented in the previous allegation, from the totality of the evidence, and particularly that of the paternal grandmother but also that of the father, I have come to the conclusion that in fact, D was very highly thought of in the paternal family and there is therefore, no basis for saying they would have acted like this in making that threat.

I have heard from the grandmother and I have viewed the videos and the impression that I get from the videos and what the grandmother said is that the grandparents were in a profound quandary about what to do to protect their granddaughter and that it was inherently unlikely that they would have acted in the violent way alleged by the mother.  For the avoidance of doubt, this extends, although it is not included in the allegation, to the wider allegations made by the mother in this case against the paternal grandmother. I see no basis for an assertion that this woman would have acted in such a way as to have burnt her granddaughter, poured liquids on her granddaughter, pushed her granddaughter or any of the other matters which the mother has sought to assert.</span></p>

They are plainly pleaded as part of a case to have her daughter in her care by the mother. The only qualification to this it seems to me, is that there are instances, as shown by the video of March 2022, which I regard as unlikely to have been a one-off, where the father did lose his temper and there were arguments between husband and wife.</span></p>

She is safe there. He loves her. He is meeting her needs and she is hitting her milestones.  A move to the care of her mother would in my view, run the risk that some of the abusive behaviours which I have set out in this judgment might be repeated in the care that she offered her daughter.

That is a process which I accept is likely to take time. The father talks I think, in terms of D being at least seven and that certainly accords with my view that it is likely to be something which happens when D is at junior school and able to report to the father and to school about anything which gives her concern. However, I very much hope it is something which the parents will consider in the future.

It seems to me he is right to acknowledge that contact ought to be more frequent than monthly to sustain this important relationship between mother and daughter and to take into account D&#8217;s needs at the age she is for regular and frequent contact with her mother.  I note that Cafcass have recommended weekly contact but it seems to me there are a number of practical obstacles to this in terms of the costs and the logistics of having supervised contact at considerable expense in terms of supervision on a more regular basis. I, therefore, propose to make an order along the lines that the father has suggested but with additional provision, hopefully to be agreed between the advocates for the parties today (and about which I might need to hear further submissions), to deal with special occasions, extra time in the holidays and the like, possibly even the prospect of setting up remote contact and certainly indirect contact which will allow the mother to have maximum knowledge of how her daughter is progressing and to interact with her meaningfully in regular contact and other contact.

However, if one ignores the facts of the matter and focuses on the law, the case, as Mr Duncan says, amounts to a statement both of the &#8220;old guidelines&#8221; and of the &#8220;new guidelines,&#8221; if I might describe them that way, for orders under section 91(14), the old position being a great stress upon the need to use such orders sparingly and particularly to consider a series of caveats where there had not been multiplicity of vexatious and unsustained applications.  Then, what the Court was invited to consider was whether matters went beyond scenarios which were traditionally encountered by the Family Court and whether the situation, without the order, was likely to impose strain on the child or the primary carer. </span></p>
