In general terms, pre-acquired assets do not fall for division between the parties to a marriage unless needs require. H contends that, in addition to ring- fencing the European and non-European properties, I should adopt a broad approach and treat &#163;6m, being half of his bank savings and value of his equity stakes, as being non- matrimonial and to be ring-fenced, and the other half as matrimonial. W argues that save for the pre-existing bank savings and shareholdings, H&#8217;s inheritances and both parties&#8217; pensions, all other assets should be treated as being joint, either as a result of mingling or by way of gift to her, and thus that only some 750k should be ring-fenced.</span></p>

This is easily explained: as the proceedings developed, there was in the normal way a private FDR. It took place on 29 September 2022 and produced an agreement under which W was to receive &#163;9m in liquid assets out of an agreed total of approx. &#163;24.5m. This amounted to about 36.7% of the presumed assets, albeit that H took on the burden of a potential tax liability which had only just emerged in an uncertain, albeit anticipated not very large, amount. However, before the order was drawn up and within some 6 weeks after the agreement, W&#8217;s solicitors picked up on reports that there had been a sale of E Co for a very substantial sum.</span></p>

They did not live in high end properties. Although they owned a home in central London which they had lived in from 2007, they rented it out in 2016 when worried about their financial situation and thereafter lived in rented accommodation. Their holidays were usually spent staying with family members or, more recently, travelling by car or camper van around the UK. They normally used budget airlines. Occasionally they would go to fancy restaurants or to the opera. Their children were educated privately but even now the total annual cost of educating all 3 children is &#163;70k.
