	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This is an application concerning CC, who is a 21-year-old woman, who lives at home with her family. She is the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"> </span>children, all of whom are girls. CC describes her family as being ultra-orthodox Jewish. In <span style="color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">her childhood, moving into adolescence, she found the rules and strictures of her community were not ones that she could adhere to. Her temperament, personality, and as it later transpired, her autism spectrum disorder (ASD), rendered her unable to conform with an ultra-orthodox life. I think it likely, from the evidence that I have listened to an</span>d read, that this was a source of sadness to her parents, and in her own way, to her. However, the family has been able to negotiate this, both understanding and accommodating it. They recognise that CC is simply who she is. The wider community has followed the lead of the family, and they have been an important part of CC&#8217;s support structure.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is clear to me that CC is a young woman who is effervescent with talent, energy, and intellectual ability. It is something of an understatement to say that she does not &#8216;suffer fools gladly&#8217;, to use the phrase that many have used when talking about her. She has great confidence in her own abilities, though, it must be said, she is somewhat dismissive of those not bestowed with her talents.</p>

Though that might sound opinionated, it reflects an inflexibility of thinking style in the sphere of human interaction and is a facet of her ASD. CC herself certainly meets her own criteria. She has both a great brain and a great heart. Her intellect is in abundant display and needs no further comment from me, but her warmth, empathy, and compassion are equally clear. Everybody who has spoken about CC has commented upon her enthusiasm for, and skill in helping and caring for people with disabilities of some kind, particularly youngsters with learning disabilities. She is modest when she talks about those she has cared for, but she is also rightly proud of the support she has been able to give. She has received a number of warm tributes from the families of those she has been able to help.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This case came before me because the Applicant Trust were seeking declarations as to whether CC had capacity to conduct these proceedings, and to make decisions concerning her medication and treatment. On 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2024, I granted leave for the instruction of an independent psychiatrist to assist the Court on these issues. Dr Matthew Cahill was instructed. Dr Cahill is a consultant psychiatrist specialising in Eating Disorders. He is the Clinical Director for the Cheshire and Wirral Partnership Eating Disorder Service, recognised as a Regional Specialist Unit, treating the most severe cases of anorexia nervosa, across the Northwest of England, North Wales, and Isle of Man. Dr Cahill is the clinical lead for the Northwest Adult Eating Disorders lead provider collaborative. He is also a member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists Faculty of Eating Disorders Executive Board. He has been working, for over 9 years, in the medico-legal field and has acted as an expert in a number of complex and high-profile Court of Protection cases relating to disordered eating. He was instructed in the case of <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Re WA </span><span style="font-weight:bold">[2020] EWCOP 37</span>. I mention this case because the family have read it carefully and see in it some parallels with CC&#8217;s situation.</p>

This has the consequence, that although [CC] states that she wishes to recover from her eating disorder, she is not able to contemplate accepting the additional nutrition required in order to move forward with her recovery, due to her fear of weight gain, and her distress at the point of accepting nutrition. </span></p>

However during an inpatient admission the emotional distress that [CC] experiences on an inpatient unit is such that it interferes with [CC]&#8217;s ability to participate in a collaborative treatment plan that supports weight restoration. During inpatient admissions the overwhelming nature of [CC]&#8217;s demand avoidance state interferes with [CC]&#8217;s ability to weigh up information, such that she enters behavioural states that move her away from her stated goal of wishing [in the longer term] to recover from her eating disorder. In such a state [CC] is compelled to following her own set of restrictions [eg by participating in total nutritional restriction] that it becomes difficult for [CC] to see the &#8220;bigger picture&#8221; and meaningfully weigh up the necessary information in order to construct a workable collaborative inpatient treatment plan.&#8221; [95]</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Accordingly, there was significant evidence that pointed to CC lacking capacity. Dr Cahill also agreed. It is important that I emphasise that Dr Cahill was instructed late in the day and was afforded very little time to absorb the background. It was necessary to move at pace because CC&#8217;s physical health is in a parlous state. Dr Cahill&#8217;s mastery of the background history, in such a short time, is impressive. He emphasises that the medical notes of this case require to be read particularly carefully and in full. From February this year to the present, CC has had episodes of complete food restriction, causing sudden deterioration in weight, vital signs, and blood chemistry. She has also, at times, refused her medication; she has been self-harming by head-banging and cutting. There has been stockpiling of medication and intentional overdoses. She is at present severely malnourished with frailty, weakness, low energy levels, difficulties with concentration, and irritability. She struggles to walk even for short distances. She has episodes of acute kidney injury and hypokalaemia. She describes chronic pain.</p>

She feels hopeless that it will ever be possible for her to make progress towards recovery. She expresses a wish to die but also, with some frequency, an equally strong will to live. Her prognosis is poor, in the view of her treating clinician. As well as her low weight, he identifies a life expectancy <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;not beyond 6 months&#8221;</span>.

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Dr Cahill considered that CC lacked capacity to make decisions about her treatment concerning nutrition and her physical health. He emphasised that there are many <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;different facets and overlaps&#8221;</span> to her condition. He observed that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;to discuss capacity in general terms is impossible given the many different aspects of the case, likely comorbid psychiatric comorbidities and different clinical decision to be made&#8221;</span>. A great deal of effort and energy has been expended on identifying labels. I have been told that in clinical practice, it is widely recognised that females with ASD and disordered eating often present in an atypical way. CC, all agree, presents atypically. She does not believe that she truly has anorexia, she believes her central problem to be depression.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The labels are, to some degree, a distraction. Dr Cahill considers that CC has the ability to outline the advantages and disadvantages of particular facets of her treatment, but is, ultimately, unable to use and weigh the information necessary to arrive at a decision. This is considered by Dr Cahill to be a consequence of her anorexic/ disordered eating/ ASD thinking. He considers that she is fixated on the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;numbers&#8221;</span> (relating to body mass index (BMI)) whether that be due to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;a drive to be thin&#8221;</span>, i.e. anorexia, a need for control; a combination of anorexia and ASD; a desire to die; an emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD)/ ASD/ depression. Ultimately, CC is, in Dr Cahill&#8217;s view, unable to make decisions about her nutrition. Dr Cahill was not convinced that CC&#8217;s nutritional restriction is a facet of suicidal behaviour. He thought it more likely to be an expression of <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">&#8220;not wanting to feel as she does any longer&#8221; </span>(my emphasis) and her inability to articulate it. In addition, her poor physical health impedes her real insight into the seriousness of her current situation, and the desperation of her body&#8217;s requirement for nutrition.</p>

The MCA provides a specific statutory definition of mental capacity which is termed to be &#8220;decision specific&#8221;, predicated on a &#8220;functional approach&#8221;, evaluated in the framework of a &#8220;diagnostic threshold&#8221;. Thus, at the core of the Act is a central distinction between the inability to make a decision and the making of a decision which, objectively, would be regarded by others as unwise. Fundamentally, the Act emphasises the right of the individual, in exercising his or her personal autonomy, to make bad decisions even extending to those with potentially catastrophic consequences (see <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Barnsley Hospital NHS Foundation Trust v MSP </span><span style="font-weight:bold">[2020] EWCOP 26</span>).</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The presumption of capacity, section 1(2), is the benchmark for decision makers in this sphere. The Act reinforces this by requiring that a person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision unless <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;all practicable steps to help him to do so have been taken without success&#8221;</span>. As has been said on many occasions, the scope of these unambiguous provisions must be fully recognised and vigilantly guarded. The philosophy informing the legal framework illuminates the point that this case highlights, namely <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;a person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision merely because he makes an unwise decision&#8221;.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is important that I emphasise that CC told me that she believes that she has capacity to understand her medical treatment. When by way of example she was confronted with her vacillation on the question of her attitude to dying, she told me she contradicted herself, but asserted, rightly, that did not mean she was incapacitous. <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;We all contradict ourselves&#8221;</span>, she said. She was also able to summarise the full range and detail of her various conditions, in an impressive and eloquent manner. Despite what ultimately emerged as a consensus, amongst the psychiatrists, that CC lacked capacity, I have nonetheless given it a great deal of careful thought and consideration. Evaluating capacity in the context of eating disorders is a challenging process, which demands, to my mind, particular subtlety of thought. It is too easy to infer incapacity by focusing on the consequences for the patient of non-compliance with treatment. In this sphere, there is always, in my judgement, a pull towards paternalism. This requires to be resisted. The force is distinctly strong and stark when, as here, considering the risk to the life of such an obviously talented young person. The MCA does not require me to determine capacity on the balance of probabilities, rather, it requires me to apply that test in evaluating whether the presumption of capacity has been displaced. This is the statutory bulwark protecting personal autonomy.</p>

The former engenders the decision, the latter is ultimately formulation of the question. The impact on CC of her ASD has, despite her efforts, eluded her understanding, in the way that Dr Cahill describes (see emphasis in paragraph 10 above). It is an important and integral element of her eating disorder. It is this inability to weigh and balance the impact of her ASD into the decision surrounding her treatment, that has, ultimately, robbed her of capacity on the issue. It is intensely frustrating to her, and profoundly distressing, not least because in this context, this, otherwise, impressively articulate young woman cannot identify the correct words to articulate her feelings.</p>

He told me that he should have liked to have spent longer with her, but time did not permit. CC told him that there were, as she termed it, a number of issues, which looking back at them, she can now see she was struggling with. She identified primary school as the start of her difficulties. She is in no doubt as to her own intellectual abilities. She has, she told Dr Cahill, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;a clever brain&#8221;</span>, but she added, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I liked to do things my own way, I didn&#8217;t like the rules in primary school.

When CC says, as she does so frequently, that she <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;can&#8217;t see the number go up&#8221;</span>, Dr Cahill perceives that as linked inextricably to her ASD. CC prefers to interpret this as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;her depression&#8221;</span>. When Dr Cahill emphasises her inability to articulate <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;how she feels&#8221;</span> in the context of her ASD, it is notable that CC&#8217;s language breaks down and becomes contradictory and ambiguous<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;&#8230; even if I change my mind, I can&#8217;t change my mind&#8221;</span>.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">CC&#8217;s treating psychiatrist (Dr W) considers that CC has key symptoms of an eating disorder. He predicates this on the fact that CC restricts her intake, fixates on weight, and engages in compulsive binge/ purging <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;to a life threatening level on a daily basis&#8221;</span>. He also notes that CC is fixated on eating <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;and cannot stop once started&#8221;</span>. This latter point was very much confirmed by CC&#8217;s father in his evidence. When CC leaves the ward to go home, it is there that she binges (and purges). I asked F what CC would eat. My thoughts on this question were directed to try and gain some idea of her calorific intake, which Dr W had told me was higher than the 200 calories she received at hospital via the PEG, but otherwise it was difficult to be clear about. Her calorie intake is relevant to assess her resilience to treatment. I had not been expecting the answer. CC binges food on an almost industrial scale. Looking at her in the courtroom, so plainly malnourished, I found it difficult to imagine how she could eat such vast quantities of food on a daily basis and remain as she is. It is also difficult for the lay person to understand why it is CC requires to be fed artificially and at length in hospital, when she can eat and drink at home. All this serves to illustrate the labyrinthine complexity of her condition.</p>

Dr W agrees that her eating disorder is atypical but considers her behaviours cannot be explained by her ASD or depression alone. The difference between Dr W&#8217;s diagnosis and that of Dr Cahill is the latter&#8217;s emphasis on the centrality of the ASD, and the priority that must be given to treating it. Dr W concludes that CC is at a life threateningly low BMI; she actively avoids restoring any weight; interferes with interventions aimed at achieving weight gain and underestimates the degree of her malnutrition and associated risks. He concludes:</p>

This is a psychedelic drug and would require panel approvement at the hospital. Dr W told me, in evidence, that he did not think there would be a problem in getting the approval of the panel. I was rather surprised at Dr W&#8217;s confidence. Esketamine, as a treatment for resistant anorexia nervosa, has very little evidence base. There have been no trials in this country and, inevitably, no peer review. Dr W has had only one patient who he has treated in this way. The treatment, he tells me, was successful. He has discussed Esketamine treatment with CC. She is immensely enthusiastic about it. Indeed, it has become the repository of all her hopes. She is so intensely invested in it, that a decision not to go forward is one she finds extremely difficult to contemplate. Dr W is acutely aware of all of this.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I note that in his report, Dr W&#8217;s language was rather more measured than in the witness box. He emphasised that CC would have to be physically well enough to tolerate Esketamine. The importance of this is obvious given Dr W&#8217;s own description of CC&#8217;s behaviour as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;life threatening on a daily basis&#8221;</span>. He signalled that CC&#8217;s blood pressure and ECG would need to be at, or close to her baseline, with stable electrolytes. That is difficult to achieve when she purges. Accordingly, it would be necessary for CC to be treated on the ward. She has been resistant to this historically, and being on the ward causes her significant distress. Esketamine has a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;profound psychotropic effect in the short term&#8221;</span>, as Dr W termed it in his report. It also requires vital signs monitoring when being administered. <span style="color:#1F1F1F;background-color:#FFFFFF">Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) require co-prescription with </span><span style="color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">Esketamine, used as an antidepressant. CC has agreed to this but, I note she has a long-standing history </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">&#8220;with lack of response to multiple antidepressants of different classes at adequate dose for an adequate period of time&#8221;</span><span style="color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">. Dr Cahill recorded the history of antidepressant prescription in his report, which included the following: </span><span style="color:#000000">Fluoxetine, Sertraline, Mirtazapine, Venlafaxine, Duloxetine, Vortioxetine, Pregabalin, Quetiapine, Aripiprazole, Olanzapine, Naltrexone, Clonazepam and Promethazine.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In his report, Dr W described Esketamine as having <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;few absolute contraindications&#8221;</span>. He considered that it <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">could</span><span style="font-style:italic"> be an option for treatment resistant depression&#8221; </span>(my emphasis).

However, her history of poor medication compliance, frequent vomiting and fluid restriction, with associated kidney injury as well a low BMI, make this option unsafe. If prescribed it would likely cause life limiting renal failure and / or acute toxicity which could lead to brain damage as well as cardiac arrhythmia, with high risk of a fatal outcome in the short and long term.&#8221;</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In his oral evidence, Dr W said that he considered that he had a good working relationship with CC, and that she got on well with the eating disorder nursing team. He told me that Esketamine is a licensed drug which can be used in a psychiatric emergency. Its primary use is in anaesthetics, in which context, it has been used regularly for over 20 years. Dr W described it as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;a safe drug&#8221;</span>. In the context of anaesthesia, I do not doubt that is an accurate description, but I consider it to be a bold claim, on the available evidence, for its limited use in treatment of resistant anorexia. Dr W said that he thought that its impact on CC might be to make her <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;giggly&#8221;</span> and lightly <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;intoxicated&#8221;</span>. This, I took to be based on the response of his previous patient. Dr W amplified the range of likely responses. Esketamine, he told me, has a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;dissociative effect&#8221;</span> on patients, i.e. it alters consciousness. It can create a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;lightness of the body&#8221;</span>, a sense of <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;floating&#8221;</span>. He also described what he termed <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;an enhanced feeling of being in the room&#8221;</span>. The drug <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;heightens the senses&#8221;</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;material may be felt more keenly against the skin&#8221;</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;smells will be experienced more strongly&#8221;</span>. Esketamine is a psychedelic drug and, as such, causes <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;visual distortions, hallucinations, and fragmented consciousness&#8221;</span>. Side effects may include psychological issues, a risk of future substance misuse (described by Dr W as theoretical), raised blood pressure, arrhythmia (thought to be a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;remote&#8221;</span> risk).</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Whilst the hallucinations might be benign or even pleasant, it is also possible that they might be distressing and cause agitation. Both would require careful management and supervision. As Dr W reminded me, CC already has 1:1 supervision. Nonetheless, a pleasant hallucination might, he suggested, cause CC to want to go outside and she would have to be restrained to prevent her from doing so. An unpleasant experience would require her to be talked down by soothing words or, if necessary, by medication (benzodiazepine).</p>

Neither would it be right to clothe this balance in ambiguous language. It requires to be confronted, as CC and her family have done.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In his review of CC&#8217;s antidepressant medications, Dr Cahill considered that none of them had worked because there had not been sufficient focus on the impact of ASD (for all the reasons discussed above). In his evidence, he told me that nothing was likely to work unless the ASD was brought into sharper focus and with the assistance of an Occupational Therapist. He noted that there was no Occupational Therapist in place, and identified that as a key role, including in coordinating support. The Trust has immediately recognised this and has ensured that an Occupational Therapist will soon be appointed and able to identify reasonable adjustments for CC to maximise therapeutic potential. I regard this as a key piece of evidence. Although we are dealing with a very different type of drug in Esketamine, if Dr Cahill is correct, it still runs a risk of failing, if the impact of ASD is not addressed in advance. That outcome has the potential to be catastrophic for CC. To invest so much hope in Esketamine, only for it to fail, would leave CC with no hope and no alternative plan that she could begin to contemplate. If Esketamine is to be tried, it must have the best possible opportunity to be successful. That is not the situation here. At the moment, there is a real risk that to move forward to such a treatment regime might be setting her up to fail.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Ms Paterson KC, acting on behalf of the Official Solicitor, has been able to identify a properly convened medical trial of the use of Esketamine in resistant anorexia that is due to commence in London quite soon. I understand that approaches will be made to see if CC may be included within the trial. Dr Cahill considered that the Esketamine treatment was not, at this point, in CC&#8217;s best interests. I agree. I also regard that conclusion as inevitable in the light of his reasoning.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is important however, that I signal to CC, in very clear terms, that she must not perceive my decision as ideologically resistant to what may yet prove to be, and I hope will be, a progression in the treatment of this awful and insidious condition. Esketamine may well be an option for CC, perhaps even in the near future, but if it becomes an option, it must have the best possible chance to succeed, following the plan which Dr Cahill has suggested, and which I am persuaded is in CC&#8217;s best interests. That plan is to be refined and considered further at a directions hearing in a few weeks.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I delivered an ex-tempore judgment at the conclusion of these proceedings. A note was taken and I have perfected and amended it. I know that CC will read this very carefully. As I perfected the judgment, I was conscious of the likely scrutiny that she will give it and have tried to express myself in terms which are both honest and sympathetic to her circumstances. My respect for her and her family is, I hope, obvious. It is also important that I emphasise that she is surrounded by committed doctors and nurses. Nurse A gave evidence before me by video link at short notice and on CC&#8217;s request. He had been on the screen for barely a matter of minutes before it became entirely obvious to me why CC had such confidence in, and affection for, him. He is plainly a crucial part of CC&#8217;s support. His understanding of CC and his commitment to her care was extremely impressive. CC personally, and the system more generally, is lucky to have him. I indicated, at the conclusion of the evidence, that I wanted him to see the judgment in order that he could fully understand my decision and discuss it with CC if she wishes to do so. Mr Fullwood, on behalf of the Trust, has assured me that will be done. Whilst it is not the judgment CC would have wished for, she will, I am confident, understand it, even though she will not agree with it. I hope she will be able to take some heart from it.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Finally, the consensus has been that CC lacks the capacity to litigate. The challenges she faces in weighing and balancing the complex facets of her competing medical needs also, inevitably, reverberate on her ability to conduct proceedings in which those needs are central. Here, though it is not always the case, the two are inextricably linked. CC has been proactively involved in the conduct of these proceedings. She has also had the benefit of Leading Counsel and the Official Solicitor acting on her behalf. I have watched her give regular instructions to her team. At her request, she has spoken to me in the presence of the Official Solicitor&#8217;s representative on two occasions. Her voice has been heard loudly and clearly.</p>
