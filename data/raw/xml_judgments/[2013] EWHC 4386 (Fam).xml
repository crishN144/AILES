Ms Logan took on the responsibility of preparing the court bundle for each hearing, which has been invaluable to the parties and the court.  The mother has represented herself throughout these proceedings and has done so with enormous care. Her written statements have been admirably focussed and dealt only with what was necessary.  The father&#8217;s representative, Miss Simpson, only appeared in the case today.  She readily and quickly grasped the critical matters. I thought her cross examination of the mother was particularly effective as she sought to explore the relevant issues.  </span></p>

He was seeking the return of A to this jurisdiction; either to be placed in his care or in the care of the mother and he would have more extended contact.  The mother seeks an order that the status quo is continued, although what she does agree to now is that when A comes back to this jurisdiction on at least two occasions a year - firstly for an extended period in April and May when there is the long school holiday in the Indian academic year and also for a shorter period of about two and a half weeks in October - he will see his father and be able to have contact at least once a week for a period of five hours.  </span></p>

There is no real dispute about the legal framework within which I have to make the decisions in this case.  Firstly, A&#8217;s welfare is the court&#8217;s paramount consideration. In determining what his welfare requires the court is required to consider the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and make an evaluation of the matters in the welfare checklist.

In an order dated 21</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">st</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> December 2012 Baker J directed the mother to file a statement setting out her whereabouts, A&#8217;s whereabouts, details of where she and A have resided since the order dated 12</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> December 2011 and her proposals for future contact.  The statement that the mother filed in compliance with that order is dated 18</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> January 2013.  Curiously, the mother gives as her address at the beginning of that statement an address in Hyderabad, India.  She sought, when I asked her about this in her oral evidence, to suggest that she must have forgotten about the position or that when she received the order she may have been in India and so did not remember to set out her English address.  I have to say I find that very hard to believe.  I also note that, despite the statement running for about four or five pages and despite being asked specifically in the order to give details of her whereabouts and A&#8217;s whereabouts since 12</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> December 2011, the account that the court now has does not appear in that statement.  Reading that statement one certainly does not get the picture that she returned back here very shortly after A went to India and that effectively she has been based here since.  </span></p>

Although in fact none of the statements filed by him have needed to be interpreted to him, they have all been filed in English and signed off by him in English.  It was not a requirement when he had attended any of the previous hearings, but, the court was particularly anxious in the event that he was unable to secure legal representation that, if there were any words that he would not be able to understand. It was done really as a precaution to ensure that today&#8217;s hearing was effective. In fact, despite that direction being in the court order, an interpreter was not booked and did not attend at the beginning of this hearing. Following the matter being raised with Miss Simpson, she was entirely satisfied that the father was able to communicate effectively with her. Therefore, on his specific instructions, the hearing did proceed.  The father gave evidence first.  He was clearly very able to read English.  He gave the oath without pause and in fact better than some people who have English as their first language.  So he was clearly very able to understand, not only what was in the court bundle when he was asked questions about it, but was also very able to express himself clearly in relation to the answers that he gave.  There were one or two occasions when he had questions that he did not understand, but, once they were put in a different way, it was clear that he was able to comprehend them.  An interpreter did turn up after the father had in fact completed his evidence, but everybody agreed - including the father - that there was absolutely no need for the interpreter to remain in court. </span></p>

He said they first met face to face in April, since then she had come down and spent long weekends staying with him on a fortnightly basis.  He said they agreed to get married in about August or September of this year. The plan is they are going to get married in February of next year and he is going to move to her accommodation in Mansfield.  He gave some information in relation to her circumstances.  She has five children ranging from, he thinks, age fourteen to twenty-one (the youngest being aged fourteen who is a girl and the older four children are all boys).  None of her children live with her, even the children who are sixteen years and under.  So that is at least two of them, although he was somewhat vague about their ages.  The impression I had was that the younger four children were living with an aunt in Sunderland.  When asked why that was so, he said he had not asked Ms W about that.  He regarded that as personal information and one was left with the impression that he did not see it as much of his business.  As I have said, he has not actually visited Mansfield yet.

As I understand it, his current immigration position is that he has been given permission to remain in this country until the conclusion of these proceedings, there will then be a review of his immigration status.  He showed the court, during the course of his evidence, a permit that he had received in early September of this year which appeared to have the following information (in addition to his name and photograph).  In terms of the type of permit, it says he was entitled leave to remain.  In terms of the validity, it said the place of issue was on 5</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> September 2013 and under the section &#8220;Valid until&#8221; it said 30</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> June 2013, which seems curious, as it is valid until a period prior to the date of its issue.  He said that that is an issue that is going to have to be looked at again within the context of the immigration tribunal.  The section on the card entitled &#8220;Remarks&#8221;, it says: &#8220;No work, no engaging in business&#8221;.  I have to say the answers he gave in relation to that in the context of him working at the moment were very difficult to understand. It does look very clearly as if a restriction on his leave to remain in this jurisdiction is that he does not work and does not engage in business and yet, on his own evidence, he has been working (certainly for the last three months and in fact prior to that according to his written evidence) and intends to work on his move to Mansfield.  The significance of that will, no doubt, need to be looked at the in context of any immigration hearing.  </span></p>

I have already set out the relevant dates.  She also accepts that there was no contact between the father and A when A returned back to this jurisdiction on at least two occasions in 2012.  She seemed unable to give any coherent account as to why that did not take place.  She suggested it was because there was some restriction that was valid until August 2013, but she then said that she did not have a telephone number or any contact details. Again, I was left with the very clear impression that she had made absolutely no attempt to inform the father, or seek to try and inform him, that A was in fact back in the jurisdiction. The father&#8217;s ignorance in relation to that is demonstrated by the early statements he made in these proceedings in November and December 2012 when he clearly had no idea whether the mother or A were back in this jurisdiction, or had come back into this jurisdiction.  </span></p>

She was very clear that from A&#8217;s point of view, if he was ordered to return back to this jurisdiction and to live with the father, he would be extremely distressed; he would resent it and wonder why anyone had made the decision without any consultation with him.  So she was quite clear in relation to her recommendation that she did not support the proposals made by the father.  </span></p>

She said that this did not accord with his wishes and that, if he was returned back to this jurisdiction, he would resent it.  It would increase the pressure and the instability in relation to the mother&#8217;s position and A was likely to suffer as a result of that change, so it was not a course that she would recommend as being in A&#8217;s best interests.  However, she was very firm in her advice about the position of the father&#8217;s role in A&#8217;s life. She was very clear that the importance of the father in A&#8217;s life needs to be consolidated regardless of the history that there have been of the difficulties between the parents.  She does have very real concerns as to the mother&#8217;s ability to be able to be positive about the role that the father should play in A&#8217;s life in the future.  As she said &#8220;This child craves having the father in his life and this is what the child wants&#8221;. </span></p>

He took an extremely simplistic approach in relation to his proposals; essentially that A had had changes before when he went to India in December 2011, so therefore he can cope with changes now in the way that he has outlined in December 2013.  He displayed no understanding of the qualitative and material differences between those two situations.  A has not lived with the father before, he does not know the father&#8217;s partner, he does not know Mansfield and neither does the father know Mansfield.  He does not know or have any idea as to what the impact of that arrangement is going to be on Ms W&#8217;s other children and he showed no real understanding in relation to the impact all those changes would have on A, including being further away from his mother if he lived in Mansfield.  It was an entirely different situation when A went to India.  He was going to stay with family who were known to him, he had been to visit them before and the mother was there to be able to settle him in.  So, I am entirely satisfied that his plans in relation to residence are not only inchoate, they are unrealistic and not in A&#8217;s best interests.  </span></p>

Whilst I have no doubt that the mother considered that she was acting in A&#8217;s best interests when she took the decisions she did in December 2011 in relation to securing an order for A&#8217;s move to India, I am very concerned about the circumstances of that.  It is quite clear to me on the evidence I have heard that, unless anything untoward happens, this mother had every intention of coming back to this jurisdiction. To be fair to her that is what she said to the Family Court Adviser who prepared the report for the hearing in December 2011, but her evidence was quite clear that she had been working on a self-employed basis through a service company since 2010 and there was no suggestion of that being changed at the end of 2011/beginning of 2012.  That view is reinforced by her statement filed in these proceedings on 18</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> December 2012.  The direction made by Baker J on 21</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">st</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> December 2012 could not have been clearer.  The statement was to address where she and A had been since December 2011. I am afraid the statement filed, in my judgement, gives a misleading impression.  Not only does it give an address in India, but in no part of that statement does it set out what we now know to be the reality that she returned a very short period afterwards and remains based in this jurisdiction.  </span></p>

Whilst I fully accept that she must find it very difficult bearing in mind the history of difficulties between the parties, the fact is - having seen the report in relation to the very positive contact that took place in May 2013 - it was incumbent upon the mother then to try and secure improvements in terms of the contact between the father and A, as it was clear that A would benefit from such contact.  I am not satisfied that she has really been able to see or understand that, or the emotional effects on A of her not being able to exercise that part of her parental responsibility to be able to do that.  </span></p>

I am also satisfied that he wants to be able to remain where he is for the foreseeable future - that is the stability he has had. But, as I have said, it has to be in the context that he should be able to consolidate and move on regarding his relationship with his father.  In terms of any change in circumstances, it is quite clear that A has been based in India since December 2011.  He is doing well there and enjoying it.  In terms of his educational and physical needs, there are no concerns in relation to that.  If he returned to this jurisdiction it would be an enormous upheaval for him.  As I have indicated, if he returned back to this jurisdiction and was cared for by the father in the way that he proposes there are enormous uncertainties, not only in relation to the practical arrangements but also the uncertainties regarding the father&#8217;s new relationship which has not really started.  </span></p>

The mother accepts that she could financially afford (bearing in mind the details as to her financial circumstances she gave the court) to be able to provide for childcare.  But it is quite clear that A coming back to live here with her in the short term would cause her enormous anxiety and I accept the evidence of Miss Odze that that would not be in A&#8217;s interests at this stage.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">In terms of harm that he has suffered and is at risk of suffering, there is clear evidence of historical harm in relation to A. The findings of the court in Brentford in August 2011, the other litigation history between the parties and the difficulties between them in their relationship.  Up until the start of these proceedings A was also suffering by not having seen his father.  As I have said, his mother did not encourage contact in large part due to her concerns about the father caused by his previous behaviour to her and A.  I agree with the assessment of Mrs Odze that this mother remains affected by the difficulties in her relationship with the father, the difficult history and that she accepts, and I agree, that they are likely to be transmitted to A.  This is most graphically demonstrated by the different accounts given of the contact between A and his father when the mother was not there in May 2013 (e.g. as described in Mrs Odze&#8217;s report) and the subsequent contact when the mother was there.  It was quite clear that A was picking up her unwillingness for him to go with his father and her anxieties.  A is at risk of harm in the future if there are continued obstacles put in the way of him being able to re-establish his relationship with his father.  As Mrs Odze said in her evidence, &#8220;This child craves having the father in his life&#8221;.  However, I also agree that the continued litigation is affecting this mother.  It is causing her enormous anxiety which directly arises from the repeated hearings that have been involved in this litigation and, subject to A&#8217;s welfare, there is a strong argument that these proceedings should be bought to an end.  </span></p>

The school in India is clearly benefiting A and he is getting a good education.  He is physically well cared for by the wider family.  However, she has not necessarily been able to demonstrate that she is able to meet the emotional needs of A because she has not been able to put her own feelings to one side and promote the contact that is clearly in A&#8217;s best interests with his father.  In my judgement, she has sought to be economical with the information that she has given the court, not only in December 2011 regarding what her true intentions were, but also January 2013 in the statement that she filed in these proceedings.  She is an intelligent woman. She has maintained her earning capacity, been able to file documents within these proceedings and very eloquently been able to set out to the court what her position has been, but, I think, in some instances, she has become blinded by the fact that she was not able to stand back and meet A&#8217;s emotional needs.  </span></p>

This includes the fact that he has been engaged, on his account, for at least two or three months.  He has failed to give any information about that to anybody so there could be an assessment.

I accept much of the criticisms that have been made of the mother about her not being fully frank about the underlying reasons for her proposals, that she has not encouraged contact with the father; but I accept her decision at the time that was the best way that she could meet A&#8217;s physical and educational needs.  In relation to his emotional needs, I have already set out my concerns but I have to deal with the situation that A is in now.  His situation now is that he is settled in India, he wants to be able to remain there.  If he was required to come back to this jurisdiction, he would resent it and that would have a detrimental impact on not only his relationship with his father but also with his mother.  I am entirely satisfied in relation to the father&#8217;s proposals to care for A they are ill-thought out, lack any insight and are clearly not in A&#8217;s best interests to be able to accede to them.  </span></p>

The evidential foundation for that is very secure.  The descriptions of the contact between A and his father in May, despite the fact that there had been a significant period of time when they had not seen each other, clearly demonstrates A&#8217;s need to be able to renew his relationship with his father.  Mrs Odze observed that there was spontaneous affection and an ability by the father to be able to meet A&#8217;s needs in a way that was clearly to his benefit.  I accept that what is required is for the mother (and this needs to be provided for in the order) to bring A back to this jurisdiction for at least two fixed periods of time between 1</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">st</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> April and 1</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">st</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> June and in October to cover the October holidays.  There also needs to be a clear structure for the wider paternal family in India (to make sure that they have the opportunity to be able to see A in India) and in relation to email contact.  I am entirely clear that there needs to be a holistic approach going forward regarding contact so that when A is in this jurisdiction he will be able to see his father on at least a weekly basis for a period of five hours, and such other times as may be agreed between the parties. When he is not in this jurisdiction for the current arrangements for contact to continue.  But that structure of contact, together with the email and the wider paternal family contact needs to be supported in a way that avoids further court proceedings.  The best way to be able to do that is by way of a SPIP (Separated Parental Information Programme) that both parents can attend. This will assist them and support them to make decisions that are in A&#8217;s best interests.  Further, there should also be an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref>H of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> to monitor contact for a period of a year to be able to support the position in relation to the contact order made by the court today.  Mrs Odze has agreed to be the named Cafcass Officer.</span></p>

It may also be suitable in circumstances where the welfare of the child requires it although there is no past history of making unreasonable applications.  It is a case where the court can - when looking at in particular paragraphs 6, 7 and 10 of the guidelines in Re P - make such an order where it considers that the child&#8217;s welfare requires it.  I accept the recommendations made by Mrs Odze in relation to this.  The application that was made by the father at the end of 2012 was justified in the circumstances of this case, but I am entirely satisfied that the effect of continuing applications will be detrimental to A&#8217;s welfare.  In particular, this is because of the impact it has on the mother and her ability to be able to care for A, even though that is done remotely for the majority of the time.  What is important, the court now having set out the structure for orders, is that that structure is supported (as I have set out) by way of the SPIP and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref>H order to monitor contact.  </span></p>
