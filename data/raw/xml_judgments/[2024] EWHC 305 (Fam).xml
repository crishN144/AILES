	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">When the First and Third Respondents to this application, JK and PQ, were in a relationship, they were upset to find that JK struggled to conceive. They investigated the possibility of IVF treatment through the NHS but that was not available to them, and of private IVH treatment but that was unaffordable.  Doubtless in desperation, they agreed upon and carried out a procedure whereby PQ&#8217;s father, RS, provided a sample of his sperm, PQ mixed it with his own sperm, and the mixture was injected into JK&#8217;s vagina. All the adults involved consented to this procedure on the basis that if JK became pregnant and gave birth, PQ would be treated as the baby&#8217;s father, and RS as its grandfather. JK did become pregnant and D was born. PQ was named on his birth certificate as his father. He is now five years old. He has two half-siblings, children of JK, who are E and F. F is an adult but E is a child and, with D, is the subject of public law proceedings brought by the Applicant Local Authority. JK and PQ separated and initially JK cared for D and E, but the Local Authority brought these proceedings because of concerns about serious harm to D and E attributable to her actions and neglect. Now, D and E live with PQ under an interim child arrangements order with an interim supervision order in favour of the Applicant Local Authority. F lives with them. JK lives separately but has contact with her children.</p>

They maintain that they thought it best not to know who was the child&#8217;s biological father, hence the mixing of sperm, but given that JK has had other children, and that she and PQ had tried for several months to produce a pregnancy, it is not against the odds that the biological father of D is RS, in which case PQ, whom he treats as his father, is his biological half-brother, and RS, whom he treats as his grandfather, is his father. They created a welfare minefield through which it will be very difficult to navigate. So far as I am aware, only JK, PQ, and RS knew about the circumstances of D&#8217;s conception until, during these proceedings, JK revealed them to the Local Authority. </p>

It should be noted that, here, the context in which best interests is considered is the direction for testing, not the imparting to D of the results of those tests. However, as was not disputed by Counsel, it is difficult to divorce the testing from the communication of the results or of their implications, in an appropriate manner to D as well as to the other parties.</p>

I described those circumstances at the outset of this judgment. They are very clear in their evidence that it was agreed that RS would be treated as D&#8217;s grandfather. He does not have much contact with D but their relationship is established as one of grandfather and grandchild. Likewise, since D&#8217;s birth, PQ has been treated as his father. Since August 2023, D, E, and F have lived with PQ. E&#8217;s father, LM, has no relationship with E. F, also JK&#8217;s child, is aged 19. Local Authority assessments of PQ as a carer for D and E have been positive.</p>

It was always intended that the arrangement that led to his conception would be kept secret. It is naturally a matter of regret to PQ and RS, and no doubt to JK herself, that JK has revealed the secret to the Local Authority. If D were told of the uncertainty of his paternity, or of any DNA test results that established that PQ was not his biological father, they fear that it would be damaging to his relationships with JK, PQ, and RS. Their own emotional stability, and therefore their ability to provide care to D and E, would be jeopardised. Extremely difficult questions would arise about what exactly to tell D. As a young child he would have great difficulty understanding the mechanics of, the reasons for, and the emotional implications of the circumstances of his conception. Difficult decisions would have to be taken about what to tell him, by whom, and when. There is evidence from the Local Authority that D is a &#8221;resilient boy&#8221; but JK and PQ advise the court that they would be very concerned about the impact on him were either of the applications to be allowed.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Willemsen was jointly instructed to address various matters arising. He has carried out a psychological assessment of D, of his relationships with PQ, JK, and RS, and the likely impact on D of a direction for DNA testing. He has advised on whether, and if so how, information arising from the testing should be imparted to D and the impact on D and his relationships within the family of imparting the information to him (which depends on what any testing reveals). I indicated to the parties that I did not need to hear oral evidence from Dr Willemsen, and none of the parties wished to question him. For the purposes of the applications before me now, I accept his written evidence. He advises the court that PQ&#8217;s fear is that his relationship with D will be weakened by D knowing that he is not his father, but that, in Dr Willemsen&#8217;s view, D has a strong bond with PQ which may in fact be strengthened by sharing the truth with D. Therapeutic work after DNA testing &#8220;will help D integrate a sense of reality reflective of his biological roots, while maintaining the relationship with his primary carer, his father.&#8221; In Dr Willemsen&#8217;s view, the most significant threat to the stability of the current placement lies with JK who &#8220;might attack D&#8217;s relationship with the father, should he not be D&#8217;s biological father.&#8221;</p>

As for the significance of the word &#8220;personal&#8221;, Mr Spencer submitted that it added nothing but was merely a reference to the &#8220;person&#8221; - whether a natural person or legal person - making the application.</p>

In fact FLA s59 provides for the intervention of the Attorney-General in applications for a declaration of parentage, thereby affording an opportunity for the public interest to be protected. The public interest is also engaged in relation to child support payments in which context the Secretary of State (for the Department of Work and Pensions) is given exemption from <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/55" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s55</ref>A(3). There would be no need for the exemption if the Secretary of State, seeking to uphold the public interest in relation to child support payment arrangements, would be considered to have a &#8220;sufficient personal interest&#8221;. The Local Authority, like the Secretary of State has no personal interest in the determination of the application for a declaration of parentage. There is generally no role for a public body to make such applications and certainly not for a public body that does not parental responsibility or any other connection which might be thought to give it a personal interest in the outcome of the application.</p>

Future planning can be undertaken just as well not knowing for sure who is D&#8217;s biological father. There is uncertainty, however it is not the function of the public law proceedings to resolve that uncertainty but rather to determine (i) if the threshold under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s31</ref> is met and if so (ii) what orders, if any, should be made. DNA testing is not required to determine any of those matters in this case. It may be considered desirable by the Local Authority to do DNA testing in order to determine biological paternity but it is not considered desirable by the family members and, most importantly for the issue under consideration, it is not necessary. Hence the question of D&#8217;s paternity is not a matter that falls to be considered in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> public law proceedings.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;[33] There are at least three ways in which a person may be or become a natural parent of a child, each of which may be a very significant factor in the child's welfare, depending upon the circumstances of the particular case. The first is genetic parenthood: the provision of the gametes which produce the child. This can be of deep significance on many levels. For the parent, perhaps particularly for a father, the knowledge that this is "his" child can bring a very special sense of love for and commitment to that child which will be of great benefit to the child (see, for example, the psychiatric evidence in Re C (MA) (An Infant) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1966] 1 WLR 646" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1966">[1966] 1 WLR 646</ref>). For the child, he reaps the benefit not only of that love and commitment, but also of knowing his own origins and lineage, which is an important component in finding an individual sense of self as one grows up. The knowledge of that genetic link may also be an important (although certainly not an essential) component in the love and commitment felt by the wider family, perhaps especially grandparents, from which the child has so much to gain.</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"> [34] The second is gestational parenthood: the conceiving and bearing of the child. The mother who bears the child is legally the child's mother, whereas the mother who provided the egg is not: 1990 Act, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48/section/27" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 27</ref>. While this may be partly for reasons of certainty and convenience, it also recognises a deeper truth: that the process of carrying a child and giving him birth (which may well be followed by breast-feeding for some months) brings with it, in the vast majority of cases, a very special relationship between mother and child, a relationship which is different from any other.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"> [35] The third is social and psychological parenthood: the relationship which develops through the child demanding and the parent providing for the child's needs, initially at the most basic level of feeding, nurturing, comforting and loving, and later at the more sophisticated level of guiding, socialising, educating and protecting.</p>

Her contribution to the welfare of the child is unique. The natural father combines genetic and psychological parenthood. His contribution is also unique. In these days when more parents share the tasks of child rearing and breadwinning, his contribution is often much closer to that of the mother than it used to be; but there are still families which divide their tasks on more traditional lines, in which case his contribution will be different and its importance will often increase with the age of the child.</p>

Furthermore, there is a child arrangements order for D to reside with PQ, that is very likely to be continued as a final order in the public law proceedings, he has parental responsibility for D, he has been treated by D as his father all D&#8217;s life, and he is D&#8217;s day to day carer. The relationship between D and PQ is established. I cannot discern any need to determine D&#8217;s biological parentage in order to address all or any of the elements of the welfare checklist. That does not mean that there will be no risks of harm to D arising out of the uncertainty of his biological parentage, the fact that he is unaware of that, and the effects of the circumstances of his conception on the family dynamics. But those risks are now known to the court and will be taken into account in any welfare analysis. The court will be capable of having regard to each of the elements of the welfare checklist without DNA testing having been carried out. DNA testing might change the factual context in which welfare would be considered &#8211; and it is arguable whether such a change would improve or diminish D&#8217;s welfare &#8211; but it is not necessary to change the factual context in order to carry out the welfare analysis.</p>

Without testing, his biological paternity remains uncertain but there is a strong chance, to say the least, that the person he thinks is his grandfather is his biological father, and that the person he thinks is his father is his biological half-brother. At present the circumstances of D&#8217;s conception are being kept as a family secret and, so far as five year olds understand biological parentage, a fiction that PQ is his biological father is being maintained. But were D to discover the possibility that RS is his biological father, and the reasons why that is possible, his welfare would be jeopardised. That is so even if he were deliberately told in a planned manner with ample support. If he were to learn of these matters in an unmanaged way, the harm to him could be greater. Furthermore, his future awareness that those he loves and relies on most had kept this secret from him could also cause him emotional harm. Anyone concerned with D's welfare must now seek to manage the latent risks to his welfare that arise from the hidden circumstances of his conception. At present that responsibility lies with PQ and JK. It does not lie with the Local Authority. No party has suggested that there are likely to be any changes of parental responsibility even if biological parentage was established by testing.</p>

A supervision order does not give the Local Authority parental responsibility and does not give a Local Authority licence to intervene in parental welfare decision-making about the child. What the Local Authority is seeking to do here is to intervene as if it did have parental responsibility. It wishes to take the decision about how to manage the difficult welfare issue concerning D&#8217;s conception away from the parents and to force the issue by requiring DNA testing or by seeking a declaration of parentage.</p>

It would, I hope, be obvious that the Local Authority and any other public body that became aware of a doubt as to the public record of D&#8217;s parentage would not consider applying for a declaration of parentage or intervening in the private law proceedings in order to seek DNA testing. D&#8217;s welfare would be the court&#8217;s paramount consideration and the welfare checklist would be applicable, as it is in public law proceedings. But the court would not need to carry out testing to determine if PQ was D&#8217;s biological father in order to make decisions about child arrangements. The court would have to consider the ability of PQ and/or JK to deal with the issue of D&#8217;s uncertain genetic parentage and to meet his needs in that and other respects. An important element of the promotion of D&#8217;s welfare would involve the management of the very difficult and delicate situation created by the circumstances of D&#8217;s conception but the court would not consider it necessary to dictate the management of D&#8217;s welfare in that regard by compelling DNA testing, either of its own motion or on application from a non-party in the private law proceedings, such as the Local Authority.</p>

I have not been referred to any authority to guide me. Clearly, &#8220;interest&#8221; is used, not in the sense of having a desire to know, but in the sense of having a stake in the determination. The adjective &#8220;personal&#8221; qualifies &#8220;interest&#8221;. In my judgement the interest of a public body wishing to ensure the maintenance of correct public records, is not &#8220;personal&#8221;, but rather that public body is seeking to uphold a &#8220;public interest&#8221;. If the Secretary of State for the DWP applies for a declaration of parentage he does not have a personal interest in the determination of that application, but to allow such applications to be made, he is exempted from the requirement to demonstrate a personal interest by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48" uk:canonical="1991 c. 48" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Support Act 1991</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48" uk:canonical="1991 c. 48" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CSA 1991</ref>) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48/section/27" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s27</ref>. Other public bodies have to establish a personal interest. The provision should not be interpreted as requiring only that a &#8220;person&#8221; should have an interest.  I accept that as a &#8220;legal person&#8221; a Local Authority may bring an application for a declaration of parentage. So can any other person, but <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/55/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s55(3)</ref> does not prevent the making of the application but the hearing of it. The requirement for the applicant&#8217;s interest in the determination to be &#8220;personal&#8221; would be meaningless if all it required was that the applicant was a legal person. Rather, the provision for the interest to be &#8220;personal&#8221; requires that the applicant should, personally, have a stake or interest in the determination of their application. The court must refuse to hear applications by the officious bystander or the nosey neighbour and, in my judgement, by a person whose only interest is to uphold the public interest (unless the exemption under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48" uk:canonical="1991 c. 48" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CSA 1991</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48/section/27" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s27</ref> applies). The word &#8220;sufficient&#8221; requires the court to consider whether, even if there is some level of personal interest, it is of so little substance that the hearing of the application should be refused.</p>

They would exclude the officious bystander who wishes to know the parentage of someone but has no personal stake in that determination. This interpretation appears to me to be rational and consistent with other provisions within the relevant parts of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FLA 1986</ref>.

It may wish to know who is D&#8217;s biological father, but it has no stake in the outcome of its application. A wish to uphold the public interest in maintaining accurate records of births does not confer a personal interest in the determination of such an application. It would create a significant interference with individuals&#8217; Article 8 rights to allow persons, whether individuals or public bodies, to apply for and continue applications for declarations for parentage when their only motive was to uphold a public interest. Hence, I have to consider whether, in the present case, the Local Authority has some other stake in, or connection with, the determination of the application to give it a personal interest. </p>

However, in my judgement, none of those duties, powers, or obligations depend on the biological relationship between D and PQ. And the interim Supervision Order does not affect RS at all. Importantly the interim Supervision Order does not confer corporate parental responsibility on the Local Authority in the way that an interim Care Order would have done. Without parental responsibility, the Local Authority is not engaged with the welfare of the child in the same way as those with parental responsibility. </p>

If I am wrong about that, then I would add that any personal interest is not &#8220;sufficient&#8221; because there is no link between the interest of the Local Authority and the determination of the application that could reasonably be regarded as of any substance. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FLA 1986</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/55" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s55</ref>A(1) allows for applications for declarations as to whether or not a person named in the application is or was the parent of another person so named.

It would be a misuse of the right to apply, for a person to apply out of prurient interest or to seek to uphold some perceived public interest. The officious bystander does not have a &#8220;sufficient personal interest&#8221; in the determination of the application and so is refused a hearing. Nor would a person who, without any personal interest in the determination, wishes to correct the public record. Here, D&#8217;s birth certificate may be inaccurate and I understand that the Local Authority may not want to stand by and allow that record to stand. However, although the Applicant Local Authority in the present case is, I accept, acting from the best of motives, I do not regard it as having a sufficient personal interest. It does not have parental responsibility, it does not require a determination of its <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/55" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s55</ref>A application in order to know whether, or how, to exercise its obligations and powers in relation to D, and it does not need to know who is D&#8217;s biological father in order to ensure fairness in the public law proceedings.</p>

The direction may only be made if the parentage of a person falls to be determined. The Respondents at the hearing submit that parentage only falls to be determined if it is <span style="font-style:italic">necessary</span> to be determined in the civil proceedings. That interpretation reflects the Art 8 rights of the family members and child in respect of which only necessary and proportionate interference can be justifiable. The Local Authority has challenged that interpretation but nevertheless submits that determination of the parentage of D is necessary within the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> public law proceedings. In my judgement, the issue of parentage &#8220;falls to be decided&#8221; in the civil proceedings if either (i) the court hearing the civil proceedings has decided that the issue of parentage should be determined, or (ii) if the court conducting the civil proceedings is the same court as is hearing the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/46/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s20</ref> application, it decides that the parentage of the person should be determined. Unless or until a decision is made that the determination of parentage is required in the relevant civil proceedings, the issue does not &#8220;fall to be determined&#8221;. In the present proceedings the court has not decided that D&#8217;s parentage should be determined, therefore I must now decide whether D&#8217;s parentage requires to be determined within the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> Part IV public law proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">When considering the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> Part IV public law proceedings, I have to identify what issues remain to be resolved and ask whether the determination of D&#8217;s parentage is needed in order to resolve those issues. I should not consider at this stage whether or not it would be in D&#8217;s best interests for his parentage to be determined. That is a question that arises only if the issue of parentage falls to be determined. Furthermore, the court does not choose which issues fall to be determined by reference to whether it would be in a child&#8217;s best interests for them to be determined. Instead, the court identifies what needs to be resolved in order to make the decisions that have to be made under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> Part IV. As conceded, parentage is not relevant to the question of threshold in this case. The question therefore is whether the remaining issues for the court to decide require determination of D&#8217;s parentage: is that determination necessary within the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> Part IV proceedings in this case?</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">I find that the question for the court is whether determination of parentage is <span style="font-style:italic">necessary</span> to resolve the outstanding issues, because determination of parentage is an interference with the Article 8 rights of D and members of his family, and Article 8 requires any such interference to be necessary (Art 8(2)) and proportionate. Also, as a matter of case management, the court should not allow resources and time to be spent on resolving issues that do not need to be resolved in order to conclude the proceedings. The fact that within proceedings, issues arise that require consideration of a child&#8217;s welfare, does not mean that every aspect of the child&#8217;s welfare must be considered within those proceedings.</p>

Balcombe LJ was merely saying that there have to be civil proceedings in which the issue of parentage arises. He referred to it as an &#8220;ancillary matter&#8221; meaning that the central matter would be something else, such as contact: the issue of paternity could not be sole matter within the civil proceedings. The application for testing has to arise in relation to proceedings in which parentage is an ancillary matter. Balcombe LJ was addressing the meaning of &#8220;in any civil proceedings&#8221; not &#8220;falls to be decided.&#8221; Here, the public law proceedings are ongoing and the question is whether D&#8217;s parentage arises as a matter ancillary to the determination of those proceedings, but as a matter which falls to be determined within those proceedings. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">As the President of the Family Division emphasised in his View in January 2023 when re-launching the Public Law Outline, once the threshold has been met, the remaining issues for the court to consider are: (i) the permanency provisions (within the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s31</ref>A care plan), (ii) contact arrangements, and (iii) what final orders should be made. No care order has been sought or is likely to be sought in this case and so consideration of the permanence provisions of a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s31</ref>A care plan is not required (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s31</ref>(3A)). A decision about making a final supervision order and/or child arrangements order is a determination of a question with respect to the upbringing of the child and so the child&#8217;s welfare shall be the court&#8217;s paramount consideration. Further, by operation of CA 199 <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s1(3)</ref> and (4) the court shall have regard in particular to the welfare checklist. However, the paramountcy principle and the checklist are engaged when the court is determining questions with respect to a child&#8217;s upbringing. The prior question is what are the questions with respect to the child&#8217;s upbringing that need to be determined.  Focusing on what issues require determination, and the questions of contact and what final orders should be made, I cannot see that the determination of D&#8217;s biological parentage is needed in order to resolve those questions. They can and will be resolved without knowing D&#8217;s biological paternity. I accept the Respondents&#8217; submissions that it is not necessary to determine D&#8217;s parentage in the public law proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is relevant to considerations of D&#8217;s welfare within the public law proceedings that there is uncertainty about his biological parentage, that the circumstances of his conception were out of the ordinary and involved RS, and that the family intended to hide, and have hidden those circumstances from him. In considering D&#8217;s welfare, the court will not shut its eyes to those matters. But it is quite another thing to seek to force a resolution to the uncertainty as to his parentage. However strongly the Local Authority consider resolution of D&#8217;s parentage to be in his best interests, it is not something that the court needs to resolve in order to conclude the public law proceedings. All outstanding issues in the proceedings can be resolved without determining D&#8217;s parentage. Particular regard can be had to the welfare checklist without having certainty as to D&#8217;s biological paternity. His needs, his background, and any harm he is at risk of suffering can all be considered on what is presently known. It is one thing to assess welfare on the basis of uncertainties and risks, which is the normal process of assessment, and quite another deliberately to change the circumstances by compelling testing and determination of the issue of biological paternity. I do not consider it necessary to determine D&#8217;s parentage for the purpose of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> Part IV proceedings and I will not direct that it is an issue that should be decided. Hence, D&#8217;s parentage does not &#8220;fall to be determined&#8221; within those proceedings, and a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/46/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s20</ref> order for testing cannot be made.</p>

Nevertheless, other factors may cause the court to conclude that it is in the best interests of the child not to know the truth about their parentage. The circumstances of this case are exceptional. Firstly, none of the adults in the family wish to challenge the status quo. They all believe it would be contrary to D&#8217;s best interests for testing to be done. Secondly, this is not a case where D would potentially discover only that the man he thinks of as his father is not his biological father. He would potentially discover much more than that, namely that the man he considers to be his grandfather is his father, and the man he considers to be his father is his half-brother. There is considerable potential for testing to lead to disclosure to D that will be harmful to him. D is only five years old and the provision to him of information of that kind would have to be carefully managed in order to mitigate the harm to him and his relationships within the family, as well as the relationships between the adults. Dr Willemsen has advised that it could be done, that it might actually strengthen the bond between D and PQ, and that it is probably better to grasp the nettle now, than leave it until later in D&#8217;s development. Thirdly, the secret or fiction about D&#8217;s parentage is being maintained by everyone in the family. JK, PQ, and RS appear to believe that this &#8220;secret&#8221; can be kept forever and that it should be left as a secret. The difficulty with that is that JK has already told other people, i.e. employees of the Local Authority, which is what has led to this hearing before me. It is quite possible that D might learn something of the circumstances of his conception, or that PQ might not be his father, in uncontrolled circumstances. If he is likely to find out, then the longer it is left before he is told, the more he will feel that he has been lied to or at least misled by the adults he most trusts.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am conscious that I have conflated the decision to direct testing with the imparting to D of the results of testing but it is difficult to divorce them. There would be little point in obtaining test results and then not communicating them to anyone. The adults must have a very good idea of what the test results would reveal. If the point of the testing is to provide certainty as to who is D&#8217;s genetic father, and such testing was not against his best interests, then it would seem irrational to find out the results and not inform him in some way and at some time about the results or the implications of the results. Nevertheless, the questions of what information should be given to D following testing, and where, when, by whom, and in what circumstances any information should be given to him, will remain in issue even if testing is ordered.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The exercise of the discretion in this case is finely balanced. The intellectual exercise I have to undertake is to ignore the ruling I have made that the issue of D&#8217;s parentage does not fall to be determined in the public law proceedings. Consideration of the discretion only arises if his parentage does fall to be determined. However, in that event, the fact that parentage was an issue that fell to be determined in the case would itself be a matter to add to the consideration of whether testing would be contrary to D&#8217;s best interests. If his biological parentage <span style="font-style:italic">needed </span>to be determined in order for decisions about a final <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> Part IV order to be resolved, then that would be a factor in favour of proceeding with testing. In the authorities to which I have been referred on the issue of the discretion, there was no question but that parentage was an issue that fell to be decided. It has been repeatedly emphasised in previous cases that the truth is of crucial importance in relation to children&#8217;s best interests in these sorts of circumstances. When considering whether testing were contrary to D&#8217;s best interests, I would give weight to the fact that (i) testing is directed to an issue of parentage that falls to be decided in public law proceedings affecting that child, (ii) the truth of their parentage would otherwise be hidden from the child; and (iii) concealing the truth from the child could jeopardise their relationships with their main carer(s). I do not accept Mr Taylor&#8217;s submissions that I should not follow the decisions of <span style="font-style:italic">S v S; W v</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">Official Solicitor </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Re L</span> (above). I consider myself bound by them. Having weighed all the evidence, including Dr Willemsen&#8217;s report, I conclude that in the event that D&#8217;s parentage fell to be determined, it would not be contrary to his best interests to direct DNA testing. However, were I to have made a direction for testing, I would have directed that a plan should be prepared for the communication of the results of testing, or the implications of those results, to D, and that evidence be filed and served in relation to that plan. The plan and evidence would have needed to address what D should be told, by whom, when and in what circumstances. I would have listed the case for a further hearing at which the court would have considered the communication plan and have given directions accordingly.</p>

The court must be astute to identify the issues that require determination, and to limit evidence to that which is needed to resolve those issues. Absent that discipline, not only would the Family Court&#8217;s caseload become unmanageable, but there would be significant danger of overreach by the state. In relation to the issues which have arisen in this case, there are many families in which a child&#8217;s paternity is uncertain. Welfare decisions are made about the child without knowing who is the biological father. By statute, the circumstances in which anyone, including a public body, may make or continue an application directed at finding out the biological parentage of a child, are carefully circumscribed. Without such statutory gatekeeping, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/46" uk:canonical="1969 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FLRA 1969</ref> and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FLA 1986</ref> would allow unnecessary and disproportionate interference with rights to respect for people&#8217;s family and private life. It was rather robustly put to me in submissions that D&#8217;s parentage was none of the Local Authority&#8217;s business. I would not express it quite like that, but the submission does speak to a truth that when a Local Authority is an applicant under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/46" uk:canonical="1969 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FLRA 1969</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/46/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s20</ref> or <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FLA 1986</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/55" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s55</ref>A, the court has to be satisfied, respectively, that a child&#8217;s biological parentage <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> their business: it falls to be determined in the relevant civil proceedings or the Local Authority has a sufficient personal interest in the determination and declaration of parentage. For the reasons given, the gates to the Local Authority&#8217;s applications in this case are closed and I dismiss their applications both under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/46" uk:canonical="1969 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FLRA 1969</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/46/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s20</ref> and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FLA 1986</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/55" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s55</ref>A.</p>
