The mother, who is Welsh, and the father, who is Spanish, married in 1995 and have five children; running from the eldest to the youngest, Sara, Jessica, Tomas, Eva and David.  The marriage unhappily ran into difficulties and the parents separated in 2008.  Since then there has been an enormous amount of litigation both here and in Spain.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The father has twice made successful applications in this country for orders for return of the children pursuant to the Hague Convention.  The second set of Hague proceedings culminated in an order made by Hedley J on 9 October 2012.  That, which one would normally have expected to be the end of the litigation in this country, was simply the prelude to a blizzard of litigation pursued in this country almost without cease since then.  A number of judges have been involved and have given many judgments.  For present purposes I need refer only to three:  first, the judgment which, as I say, Hedley J gave on 9 October 2012 (<ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2012/2955" uk:canonical="[2012] EWHC 2955 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWHC 2955 (Fam)</ref>); secondly, a judgment which Theis J gave on 25 January 2013 (<ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/88" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 88 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 88 (Fam)</ref>); and thirdly, the judgment which I handed down this morning (<ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/2579" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 2579 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 2579 (Fam)</ref>).  </span></p>

That objection was ventilated before Hedley J.  He dealt with it in this way:</span></p>

That is the court with jurisdiction, the court that ought to make the order and, for all those reasons I propose to direct the summary return.&#8221;</span></p>

They were not taken to Cardiff Railway Station.  The mother, together with her partner, then went on the run with the four younger children who were the subject of Hedley J&#8217;s order.  In consequence of various orders made by the court there was considerable publicity about the abduction, which no doubt played a contributory part in the mother and her partner and the children being discovered some days later.  As a result of further orders of the court the two youngest children were returned to Spain with the father.  All the subsequent litigation in this country has focused upon the two older of the four children who were subject to Hedley J&#8217;s order.</span></p>

That matter eventually came before Theis J.  She has the inestimable advantage of hearing evidence from Mr. John Mellor, whose expertise and experience in matters of this sort is second to none.  There is a transcript of the evidence that Mr. Mellor gave to Theis J on 30 November 2012.  His evidence focused upon the wishes and feelings of Jessica and Tomas as expressed to him in interviews.  The whole of that transcript requires careful reading.  I illustrate the high points by reference to a small number of particularly striking passages.  Quoting what he had been told by Tomas, Mr Mellor said:</span></p>

She set out the parents&#8217; position as being very simply this: The father was seeking an order that the mother return the children to Spain.  The mother did not support the making of any order against her and sought an indefinite stay on the order for return which had been made by Hedley J.  Theis J, and if I may respectfully say so, with every justification for expressing these views, said that in her judgment: </span></p>

Her conclusion was that, albeit &#8220;finely balanced&#8221;, she had come to &#8220;the very clear conclusion&#8221; that in what she called the particular and unusual circumstances of the case she should not make the order sought by the father. </span></p>

That committal application finally came on for hearing before me on 23 July 2013.  As I announced the following day, 24 July 2013, and for the reasons which I set out in the judgment I handed down earlier today, I found that the Solicitor General had not proved his case of contempt against the mother, she being at the crucial time on 12 October 2012 disabled from complying with the order and the Solicitor General, importantly, not being able to prove that it was within her power to comply with the order.</span></p>

All those applications have failed, indeed, such an application was dismissed by Theis J for reasons given in the judgment to which I have already made reference.  The mother&#8217;s wish today remains, I think, that Hedley J&#8217;s order should in any event be stayed or discharged, but Mr. Hames, on her behalf, recognises the legal obstacles standing in the way of that submission. As Mr. Devereux on behalf of the father points out, it is clear from the judgment of Butler-Sloss LJ (as she then was) in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Re M (A Minor) (Child Abduction) </span><span style="font-size:14pt"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1994] 1 FLR 390" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1994">[1994] 1 FLR 390</ref> at 397 that a final order for the return of children to a foreign jurisdiction under the Hague Convention, that being an order of the type Hedley J made, cannot be set aside by further application to the High Court.  It is a matter, if it is to be set aside or discharged, for the Court of Appeal and no one else. The reality is that Hedley J&#8217;s order that the children be returned to Spain remains in full force and effect despite every attempt by the mother to escape from its coils.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.58in"><span style="font-size:14pt">What then, is the mother's answer to what, on the face of it, is the self-evidently justified application made by the father?  It is that if the order which he seeks is made, it will be impossible for her to comply with it because of the likely obdurate refusal of Jessica and Tomas to co-operate.  In other words, the sole argument as to why the court should not make the injunctive order which, on the face of it, the father is entitled to is the mother&#8217;s assertion that it will be impossible for her to comply with the order.  That submission, needless to say, sounds deeply unattractive coming from the mouth of someone whose behaviour has been characterised, as this mother&#8217;s behaviour was, by both Hedley J and Theis J.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.58in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The normal approach of the court when asked to grant an injunction is not to bandy words with the respondent if the respondent says it cannot be performed or will not be performed.  The normal response of the court is to say: &#8220;The order which should be made will be made, and we will test on some future occasion, if the order which has been made is not complied with, whether it really is the case that it was impossible for the respondent to comply with it.&#8221;  There is a sound practical reason why the court should adopt that approach, for otherwise one is simply giving the potentially obdurate the opportunity to escape the penalties for contempt by persuading the court not to make the order in the first place.  That said, I have to recognise that the court &#8211; and this is a very old and very well established principle &#8211; is not in the business of making futile orders.  How does one balance those two somewhat contrasting propositions?  </span></p>

With some justification he complains that if the children are, in truth, obdurate, that is merely the consequence of the mother&#8217;s success in working upon them, and her success in setting out on a campaign to frustrate the orders of the court.  He may or may not be right in that, but it does not seem to me ultimately to address the key issue.  The issue, unhappily, is not how it is we have arrived at the position we are in today.  The key question is: what is the position we are in today?  Mr. Hames says there is no point in making the order because there is no prospect of its being complied with.  Mr. Devereux submits that although we may all be sceptical as to the likelihood of it being complied with, it is not so certain that it will not be complied with and that I should not on that ground be persuaded not to make the order.   </span></p>

First, that this being a case involving the Hague Convention, this country as one of the partners in the Hague scheme owes obligations to the relevant foreign country, in this case Spain, to ensure that the Convention is enforced and, in particular, to ensure that orders which this court makes are enforced in accordance with the Convention.  That is a powerful argument, and as I observed, albeit in a slightly different context in the judgment I gave this morning, there is what I described as: </span></p>

That is a long and well-established principle, it is part of the settled jurisprudence of the Strasbourg Court, to be found most recently conveniently set out in the case of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Shaw v Hungary</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2012] 2 FLR 1314" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] 2 FLR 1314</ref>.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">From the father&#8217;s perspective the litigation in this country over much of the last year has been an exercise in futility.  Twice he has had to come to this country to obtain relief under the Hague Convention.  The relief he obtained under the Convention on the second occasion from Hedley J has turned out to be completely ineffective in relation to Jessica and Tomas, and we are in a situation today where the siblings live separated from each other in a fractured family.  Three of them, the eldest and the two youngest children, are living in Spain with the father, the second and third of the five children are living in Wales with the mother.  Their direct contact has been non-existent for quite some time, and indirect contact has been limited.  It is a very disturbing situation indeed.  </span></p>

It may be that it will be as ineffective as the previous orders which have been made, but I am not persuaded that the likelihood of futility is such as to justify my declining to make the order the father seeks.  I think there is a prospect, even at this late stage, that an order directed to the mother will have the desired effect, if not in relation to each of the two children perhaps in relation to one, the younger.  In my judgment if the court is faced with a parent as obdurate and as in default of her parental obligation as this mother the court should not be deterred from making the appropriate order unless satisfied, and I am not satisfied, that the order will be a futility.  Accordingly, I propose in principle to make the order which the father seeks.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The order will be that the mother return or cause to be returned the two children, Jessica and Tomas, to the Kingdom of Spain by a date which will be specified in the order following further submissions, but which I would anticipate as being between seven and 14 days from today.  Bearing in mind what happened in the immediate aftermath of the specific order of Hedley J of 9 October 2012, I propose to supplement that order with further injunctive provisions.  One of the gaps in the protective framework imposed by the court on the previous occasion was that the mother, when she went on the run, was not in breach of any order of the court.  I propose, therefore, to make, in addition to the order I have already indicated, an injunctive order that the mother, pending the return to Spain, is not to remove the children from where they are currently living in Wales, so that if she were again to go on the run that would be a contempt.  Furthermore, if Mr. Devereux would like me to do so, I am inclined to include in the order default provisions to the effect that if, for any reason, it proves impossible for the mother to comply with the order by the first stipulated date, then she is to comply with the order by a second stipulated date and, if need be, a third stipulated date, so that there is not the gap left which was identified in the judgment I gave this morning.  That is not, of course, an encouragement for the mother not to comply with the order; it is simply a mechanism to minimise the chance of her being able to escape the consequences by the gap which existed in the previous framework of orders.  </span></p>
