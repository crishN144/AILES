		<p style="margin-left:1.26in;margin-right:0in">There is currently an order of the Court of First Instance of the Sultanate of Oman made on 23 October 2018 (now at exhibits bundle, tab 14, p.162) which provides at bundle p.164 that, until the children return to the Sultanate (which the Omani court order requires them to do), the husband must pay a monthly allowance to the children of 2,000 Omani Rials which equates to about &#163;4,000 per month.  However, that is dwarfed by the English court order of which the husband remains in breach, and I am not aware that he is identifiably making those payments, although he may be able to assert that he is doing so indirectly by paying the mortgage instalments, the wages of the nannies, and other expenditure which he does continue to meet.   </p>

There is no financial benefit which the wife or children have received or are likely to receive in consequence of the divorce by virtue of any agreement or the operation of the law of Oman or any other country outside England and Wales; and, as Mr Edge explains, any right which the wife has, or may have had, to apply for financial relief in Oman is of negligible reach or value in the context of this case.  It is probably for that reason that the wife has not even tried to do so.  </p>

The house at Clancarty Road is in the name of the wife already, so the small equity in it is already hers.  The wife has said that she believes that the husband owns, beneficially if not legally, a valuable house in Halkin Street, London SW1 but there is currently no proof of that or of its actual location in the street.  This is not, however, a case in which I am asked to make or contemplate making an order &#8220;in respect of&#8221; any specified or particular property whether here or abroad; but, rather, an order for the payment of a lump sum or payment of capital in lieu of maintenance.  </p>

The non-engagement and breaches by the husband of existing orders do not bode well.  However, the husband himself has invoked the jurisdiction of the English court in relation to his children who continue to live here and I am not willing to dismiss the present application, pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/16/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(1)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, simply on the basis that enforcement may be difficult.  To do so would be to give in to a form of blackmail and would serve as an invitation to many overseas respondents simply not to participate in proceedings under Part III, but to raise the spectre of the difficulty of enforcement.  I do not regard these proceedings, or the making of an order within them, as pointless on the basis that any order would inevitably be ignored or disobeyed, unenforceable and ineffective. </p>

The English connections with the case are certainly now very strong.  The whole family moved here consensually in 2015.  They all lived here together until 2017.  The wife and children are likely to remain living here until, at least, the adulthood of the children.  But the connections with Oman are also very strong.  The husband is a citizen of Oman.  Apart from the sojourn in England between 2015 and 2017, he has always lived there and lives there now.  The parties married there and for the first ten years of the marriage made their home there, and the wife voluntarily subjected herself to the law of Oman.  The husband obtained a divorce in Oman by a lawful process, and that divorce has been recognised as valid here.   </p>

But in my view I should in this case, whose connection with Oman is at least as strong as it is with England, pay some regard to that state of Omani law, and should not treat these proceedings as if they were &#8220;purely English proceedings&#8221;.  The fact is that the husband, who was entitled to do so, lawfully divorced the wife in Oman, and it would be wrong of me to approach the case simply as if that had not happened and the wife had obtained a divorce here.   </p>

I do not know to what extent it is so-called passive growth.  I do not know what endeavour the husband personally contributed to it during the subsistence of the marriage.

This, in turn, is based upon the detailed budget dated 4 April 2018 attached to the wife&#8217;s Form E, which has a bottom line total of projected estimated expenditure of &#163;120,925 per month after deduction of expenses specific to the children.  That budget includes mortgage repayments of just over &#163;18,000 per month of which the wife will be relieved if the husband obeys the order and provides the required amount to purchase a new home mortgage-free, thereby reducing the total monthly figure to about &#163;103,000 or &#163;1,236,000 per annum.   </p>

It is not reasonable to suggest that a wife still aged thirty-six should, after a marriage of twelve years&#8217; duration, be supported, whether by maintenance or capital, at the same rate and standard of living for the further fifty-three years of her life expectancy.   </p>

It would allow her to maintain and properly staff a very comfortable home in London for herself and the children.  It would enable her to take very good holidays several times a year with the children, and to fly at least business class and on occasions first class.  It would probably not extend to chartering large and expensive yachts.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0.01in">But, as Baroness Hale of Richmond said, there must be a gentle transition to a lower standard of living, and it simply is not reasonable or fair to expect the husband to continue to maintain the wife at that standard, whether by payments of maintenance or capital, for the next fifty-three years after a marriage of only twelve years.  I have, however, accepted that by the time she is fifty, the wife will not have any, or any significant, earning capacity of her own.  At that point, her needs and notional maintenance should, in my view, decrease by one third to &#163;400,000 per annum which the husband must fund.  A Capitalise calculation to produce &#163;600,000 per annum for the wife until her fiftieth birthday, and thereafter &#163;400,000 per annum for the rest of her life expectancy, all index-linked, is about &#163;14.6million.   </p>

I could, without error, have selected higher or lower figures, and two or more judges would almost certainly have selected different figures; but they are not arbitrary.  At paragraphs 68 and 69 of my own judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Robertson v. Robertson</span> [2016] EWHC 613, I tried to describe the difference between a decision which is arbitrary and one which is the product of judicial discretion.  The figures which I have selected in this case are the product of the judicial discretion (which, as Lord Collins said, is a broad one) which Parliament has conferred upon judges and which it is my duty to exercise.   </p>

The parties offered to purchase in Kensington at &#163;5million.  The wife has produced a range of house particulars which satisfy me that a suitable five bedroomed house in the Chelsea or Kensington area can be purchased for, but will require, about &#163;5million and the SDLT (Stamp Duty Land Tax) upon a house at that price is about a further &#163;500,000.

Schedule 10 of the wife&#8217;s budget attached to her Form E lists claimed future outgoings in relation to the three children (apart from school fees) at the rate of &#163;26,544 per month or &#163;318,528 per annum inclusive of the wages of a nanny.   </p>

There is a claim of &#163;24,000 per annum for dentist/orthodontist, which seems very high year on year even for three children.  In my view, a more realistic figure for the three children, excluding school fees, is &#163;15,000 per month or &#163;180,000 per annum, which is &#163;60,000 per child per annum until they respectively attain the age of twenty-two.   </p>
