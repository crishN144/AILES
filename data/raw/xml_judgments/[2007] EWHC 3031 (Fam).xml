	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are two applications before me for a final care order.  They are brought by Birmingham City Council, the local authority.  The first of 20 September 2005 concerns four children, K who is 7 (dob 21.1.00), Z who is 5 (24.3.02), A who is 3 (15.3.04), and Z who is 2 (26.12.04).  The second application dated 29 May 2006 concerns I who was born 3 days before (26.5. 06).  The parents of all 5 children are Mr U R who is 35 years old and Mrs H P who is 23.  She was 13 years old when she married the father in Pakistan and only 15 years old when K was born.  The families are closely intermarried.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is the fourth judgment that I have given since the case started, the first resulting from a 4 day fact finding hearing in November 2006 in Birmingham.   This hearing lasted from 12 to16 November again in Birmingham when I reserved judgment.  It involves the question of the children&#8217;s future placement.  Though it was not accepted that it would be outside the family, this was not challenged.  The main issues were the extent to which they should have contact with their family and each other.  It will assist with an understanding of the relevant events if I set out a short history.</p>

He and Z went to live with her in September 2005, the younger two remaining in foster care. They were joined by I in May 2006.</p>

Whether because of undue loyalty to his wife and his family, whether it was to save any loss of face occurring to the family, he has sought from time to time, since he was first interviewed by the police in August 2005, up to and including his evidence to me, to present innocent explanations for all that has happened to the children wherever he can.  I do not consider that he believes them.  He has been inconsistent, accusatorial, and at times plainly incredible&#8230;</p>

It has resulted in a covering up of a series of abusive actions by the mother to the children within the household, starting possibly as early as 2002 and continuing until 2005&#8230;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">This has great importance&#8230;there is a message which must be received and understood by the family.  The best persons to bring up children are their parents.  If for good reason, they cannot do so, then it is better that they be brought up by a member or members of the wider family, where possible.  This becomes more difficult if the extent of what went on, which was seriously wrong, has not been revealed over a period of time, false explanations have been given and pressure put on family members to silence them.  This is what I find has happened here.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">I mention this for one particular reason.  There is time between now and the final hearing &#8230; for the family to stand back and consider the court's findings, however unpalatable they may be for them.  Despite the seriousness of the injuries, and my findings&#8230; there may be time for an acknowledgement and a wholehearted determination to cooperate fully with the local authority.  The results of not doing so could be serious for the future of the children.&#8221;</p>

The result is that I find none of the children can be brought up by the parents or their families.  The main argument has been about the care plan and the extent to which it is both practical and in the children&#8217;s best interest.  I turn to the history since then and my decisions on the various issues that have arisen.</p>

In this case, and in the light of my previous assessment (30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2007) I remain of the view that neither Mr. U R nor Mrs. H P can safely parent any of their children.  They are likely to suffer significant harm if placed in the care of either or both parents.</p>

There would be no way of knowing where the children would finally be living or who their main carer was.  My greatest fear is that the carers would simply be &#8220;minding&#8221; the children for the parents and would &#8220;hand over&#8221; when professional monitoring or scrutiny was less intense or had diminished.</p>

I have included my notes of a telephone conversation on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2007 in the Appendix (&#8220;He knew all about me.  He would see to anyone who took his children away&#8221;).  I really do believe that Mr. U R is the driving force behind the various family members desire to look after one, some or all the children.  Mr. R has been known to apply pressure on his sisters previously and indeed such was a finding by Mr. Justice Sumner.  It is entirely possible that he has put pressure on his half siblings and extended family to look after the children in order to maintain his parental responsibility and have a greater say in future decisions.  It is my opinion that he sees himself having involvement and access to the children through his own extended family.</p>

A placement order authorises a local authority to place a child for adoption.  The child must be subject to a care order.

The alternative is that he will say whatever he thinks will help whether truthful or not to ensure that the children are restored to their family, and that adoption is avoided.  Given all my earlier findings, the threat I am satisfied he made to Miss Hossain and his evidence, I find that it is the latter.</p>

He does not accept that his wife could be responsible for the injuries and absolves himself from any responsibility for his failure to protect them.  He continues to make serious allegations about his mother and his sisters and considers them responsible for his current predicament.  I do not believe that Mr R would be able to robustly protect his children from any risk and certainly not from his wife or his wider family.&#8221;</p>

Neither their parents nor the wider family can provide this.  The alternatives are adoption or long-term fostering.

I consider that the prospects of their settling down, were they to see their parents every month, would be considerably reduced.  It might be otherwise if the parents were able to accept their placement.  The parents cannot do so, and a greater degree of contact runs the risk of undermining the foster placement.  Their present disruptive behaviour might well in those circumstances continue.</p>

At the risk of over-simplification, I note that the rules emphasise that the adoptive family is not taking the place of the biological family, they are trustees and caretakers of someone else's child.  When the child is grown-up members of the adoptive family are not regarded as blood relatives.  Adoption rarely occurs because of the importance attached to the family network, which is both extensive and very strong.</p>

Furthermore, though each of the two groups of children know each other well, as between the groups there is far less knowledge and understanding as Miss Hossain pointed out.

Nevertheless the dynamics of their changing relationship and the possible restriction on placement with a family otherwise suited to adopt them rule against the making of such an order.  I am satisfied that there will be cases where no family is suitable for adoption or long term fostering unless they agree to sibling contact.  Given the troubled behaviour of the two older boys, the strong need for an adoptive placement, and the lack of significant relationship between the 2 groups of children, I have decided in the children&#8217;s best interests that I should not make an order.</p>

Firstly any placement requires a further legal hurdle in respect of which, though the prospects may be reasonable, no guarantees can be given.  Secondly, and no less importantly, there will be yet further delay in respect of children who are in need of the earliest placement in a permanent setting.  That is a significant factor.</p>
