		    <p class="BodyText2" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.25in">&#8220;The Public Guardian&#8217;s position remains the same in that it would be in the best interests of SB for an independent deputy to be appointed as deputy to manage her property and financial affairs given the conflict between WY and BB. It is felt that WY can continue to provide care for SB as he has previously been doing but the appointment of an independent deputy will mean that SB&#8217;s finances are managed by an impartial person, and therefore limiting any conflict between those connected personally with SB. The court is requested to revoke and cancel SB&#8217;s LPA and consider inviting a panel deputy to be appointed as deputy for SB&#8217;s property and financial affairs as being in her best interests. A panel deputy is seen to be more suitable for the role given the size of SB&#8217;s estate.&#8221; </p>

I have always found WY to be a very kind and supportive man who has provided practical assistance from the start. When the home care agency workers were unable to ensure SB was clean and well-dressed it was WY who prompted, cajoled and assisted her to shower. He was the person who would shop for her buying essential clothes and the food she liked. It was WY who supported her through her traumatic admission to hospital and then to residential care. He would visit daily and buy her favourite foods and ready meals and take into her.</p>

However, I disagree with Mr Bunn that, if I were to appoint WY as the sole deputy, it is unlikely that there would be any need for contact between him and SB&#8217;s former attorneys. </p>

As Stephen Bunn said, I think it is in SB&#8217;s best interests to have someone who can quickly and efficiently access her funds to meet her needs.</p>

The first was that, when she made her LPAs, SB had not appointed him either as an attorney or as a replacement attorney, or even someone who was entitled to be notified of an application to register the LPAs. However, I am satisfied with the explanation WY gave at the hearing. He would not have expected to be an attorney or a &#8216;named person&#8217; because BB had arranged for the LPAs to be drawn up, and the last thing that BB would have wanted was to give WY an opportunity to object to the registration of the LPAs.</p>

However, Mrs Aston has discussed the matter with her partners, who have agreed to her accepting an appointment on a joint and several basis in this matter, and she has filed a deputy&#8217;s declaration in which she has consented to act as deputy pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/19/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 19(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>.</p>
